North America, its largest region, continued to falter.Cost take-outs allowed EBITDA to grow and EBITDA margin to improve. I expect HAL to continue to retrench until the pandemic subsides.HAL has ample liquidity, yet its credit metrics continue to deteriorate. At just under 7x EBITDA I rate the stock a hold.","Source: FortuneHalliburton (HAL) reported Q3 revenue of $2.98 billion, non-GAAP EPS of $$0.11 and GAAP EPS of -$0.02. The company missed on revenue and GAAP EPS. The stock is up in the high-single-digit percentage range post earnings. I had the following takeaways on the quarter.The pandemic has caused demand destruction for oil and stymied business activity. Q2 fell sharply, which did not bode well for cyclical businesses like oil services. Halliburton's sizeable presence in North America, previously a boon to the company, was not able to insulate Halliburton from more pain. Its Q3 revenue of $3.0 billion fell 7% sequentially and 46% Y/Y.Revenue from North America fell 6% sequentially to $984 million, implying the stagnation in the region continues. Well construction in U.S. land drilling declined as well as activity across multiple product lines in the Gulf of Mexico. About 33% of Halliburton's total revenue came form North America and it remained the company's largest region. The rig count fell 29% during the quarter - it will likely remain flat to declining with oil prices sub-$45.International revenue was $2.0 billion, down 7% sequentially. Reduced well construction negatively impacted Middle East/Asia, while lower completion activity caused reduced sales in Europe/Africa/CIS. Overall, I believe low oil prices and a dismal economy will create further headwinds for international operations. Until the economy reopens, international revenue will likely continue to decline. Of note is that Halliburton has less exposure to subsea operations than Schlumberger (SLB) or Baker Hughes (BKR). This could be a competitive advantage going forward as subsea projects may not be economical at oil sub-$70.Halliburton, Schlumberger and Baker Hughes have been cutting costs to help offset headwinds to their top lines. Halliburton incurred restructuring costs in Q1 and Q2 of $1.1 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively. This quarter management implied it still wants to get leaner, particularly in North America:The cost cuts worked this quarter. Operating costs of $2.5 billion fell about 9% Q/Q. This outpaced Halliburton's revenue decline. As a result, EBITDA of $505 million rose 4% Q/Q. EBITDA margin was 17%, up from 15% in Q2. Halliburton has returned to the double-digit percentage margins it enjoyed prior to the pandemic. This was commendable, given the consistent decline in revenue. I expect more cost take-outs until the economy fully reopens.Oil services firms must maintain liquidity to survive the downturn in the oil patch. Even if the economy reopens there's no guarantee oil markets will be able to generate sustainable growth. Halliburton finished the quarter with $2.1 billion in cash and $5.1 billion in working capital, down from $6.3 billion at year-end 2019. Free cash flow (""FCF) through the first nine months of the year was $733 million, up from $88 million in the year earlier period. Halliburton cut capital expenditures to the bone - capex during the first nine months of 2020 was $510 million, down from $1.2 billion in the year earlier period. I expect the company to continue to reduce capex until client activity warrants an increase. It's important for Halliburton to preserve as much capital as possible.The company has an enterprise value of $19 billion and trades at 6.9x EBITDA. In my opinion, the valuation is appropriate given the demand destruction in oil markets and dismal prospects for the global economy. Prior to the pandemic, economy expansion was getting long in the tooth. The company's $9.8 billion debt load is now at about 3.6x EBITDA, which could become cause for concern. The longer the pandemic lasts the higher the likelihood Halliburton's credit metrics will deteriorate.HAL is down over 35% Y/Y. Low oil prices and waning demand for oil will not help the company's cause. I rate the stock hold."
4380906,104714,2020-10-23T06:15:54-04:00,"Halliburton's revenue is likely to increase in the near-term on the back of higher international activities.The company has a strong international presence and should benefit if the decline in U.S. oil production enables the international short-cycle producers to regain market share.While the North American offshore market woes are far from over, some positive signs related to fracking activities have emerged in the recent weeks.The company's free cash flow increased remarkably in 9M 2020;with a high debt-to-equity ratio, increased FCF can improve investors'sentiment in the current environment.","For the past several quarters, Halliburton (HAL) has reduced dependence on North America and increasingly diversified into international businesses. Some of the key drivers in international operations include the emergence of digital technology in drilling, production and recovery, directional drilling, and open hole wireline technologies. I also see green shoots in the U.S. as the frac spread count has increased in the past month, suggesting a possible recovery up ahead. As a result, HAL has outperformed the VanEck Vectors Oil Services ETF (OIH) in the past year.However, HAL's management is cognizant that the actual recovery, reflecting in higher sales and margin expansion, is not warranted before late-2021. Although Q4 promises to shape better because of its focus on enhancing the digitalization service and lower capital intensity, the operating margin in the medium-term may squeeze. Its leveraged balance sheet should benefit from the robust free cash flow generation. After taking into consideration the relative valuation, I do not see bullish signals to buy the stock at this level. Investors with a long-term view, however, may consider buying it when the price dips.To understand Halliburton's strategies, we might need to see its energy industry perspective. The management thinks that the drilled-but-uncompleted (or DUC) wells, which have been resilient so far in 2020 despite the fall in drilling and completions activity, will contribute to North America's energy production in 2021. Additionally, it expects drilling activity to see some recovery. However, the steep fall (75% down) in the drilling rig count unconventional shales will not allow production to rise proportionately in the past year. So, lower production can effectively lead to a crude oil pricing recovery. In the international market, the management is confident about seeing a rally in 2021, particularly during 2H 2021. In effect, HAL's management commentary jibes well with its peer Schlumberger (SLB), which I discussed in my article here.Halliburton has traditionally been focused on balancing domestic versus international business. It realized the potential of generating higher growth and returns from the international market early. Its revenue share from the international business increased from 47% to 67% in the past year until Q3 2020. It has made significant investments in directional drilling and open hole wireline technologies in various international markets over the past few years. Plus, it has expanded the production business reach. The management believes that the decline in U.S. oil production will allow the international short cycle producers to regain market share. In October this year, the company received a seven-year contract for electric submersible pumps in the Middle East. So, HAL is poised to benefit from an accelerated growth cycle here.In North America, the company has been seeking to maximize profit and sacrificed the goal of maximizing market share. It will continue to lower the fixed and services costs and drive a higher contribution margin. It has recently completed $1 billion cost reduction measures, including lower maintenance cost per horsepower-hour and the North American management restructuring. Read more about this in my previous article.The strategies, as discussed above, brings us to the company's outlook in Q4 2020. Because the international activity seems to have gone through the demand bottom and supply, especially the energy service companies, have been cut down to the bone by minimizing capex, the demand-supply balance is getting tighter, which means pricing can recover in the coming quarters.In North America, the company expects onshore completions activities to increase by a double-digit percentage in Q4. Rig count may follow the completions well count uptick, albeit with a lag. Already, ~30% of the fracking equipment has been retired. Fracturing activity in the U.S. is also improving, as disclosed by increasing frac count in the past month. Combined, it implies the horsepower supply and demand will see a higher equilibrium in the coming months.The digital transformation, which is a crucial part of HAL's strategy, focuses on the well planning cycle and digital 3D inversion. It has also been striking alliances with its peers to innovate in areas that are seeing rising demand. In one of its recent technological developments, Halliburton 4.0, the company's new digital framework, will accelerate digital deployment and integration across the value chain. As part of the program, it has formed an alliance with Honeywell (NYSE:HON), which changes how surface and subsurface are simultaneously managed. As the company created new revenue opportunities, the capital intensity can fall, resulting in capex being limited to 5%-6% of its revenues. In 9M 2020, capex was 4.6% of its revenues.Despite the steep revenue fall, HAL's operating margin expanded again (171 basis points up) in Q3 2020 following a contraction in Q2. So, the operating cost-cutting exercises did contribute to the Q3 result positively. In Q3 2020, HAL recognized $133 million of impairment charges related to severance and other asset impairments. In comparison, it incurred a huge $2.1 billion (pre-tax) impairment charges in Q2. As the impairment charges fell dramatically, its net loss lessened to $0.02 in Q3 compared to $1.91 loss per share in Q2.Sequentially, North America put up a better fight in Q3 (only 6% revenue decline) compared to a much sharper decrease a quarter earlier (57% down). No doubt, the onshore well construction activity and multiple product service lines in the Gulf of Mexico remained weak. However, a re-emergence of stimulation activity and artificial lift sales, particularly in U.S. land came as a welcome change for the company.While most of the geographic regions failed to register any top-line growth, Latin America was an exception. The region saw nearly 10% revenue growth, quarter-over-quarter, in Q3 due to higher product sales in Argentina, Colombia, and Mexico led the charge. In comparison, the Middle East/Asia region was the worst affected (13.3% down sequentially) in the downturn. Reduced well construction activity and lower project management and wireline activity caused the top-line damage in this part of the world.Halliburton expects drilling activity to start moving up by the end of the year. So, revenues can increase by mid-single digits, while the operating margin may improve marginally (25 to 30 basis points) in Q4. From Q2 2020 to Q3 2020, its Drilling and Evaluation (or D&E) segment revenues decreased by 8%, while the segment operating margin deflated by 80 basis points. Reducing drilling-related services and lower wireline activity in North America and the Middle East led to the fall.In Q4, the company expects increased completions activity in North America, although completion tool sales may fall. The company expects the C&P division revenues to increase by 10% in Q4, while the operating margin may remain unchanged. The Completion and Production (C&P) division saw a more resilient sales fall (~6% down) in Q3 compared to the previous quarter. On the other hand, the segment operating margin improved by 400 basis points in Q3 as the North American stimulation activity and artificial lift sales picked up. On top of that, cost reductions related to stimulation activity and much better sales in Argentina led to margin expansion.SourceAccording to the EIA's Short-Term Energy Outlook, the Brent crude oil price for Q4 2020 can rise by $1 per barrel compared to the September average, while it can increase by $6 further in 2021. According to the EIA, the U.S. shale oil production is due for a further slowdown (4.2% decline, on average) by November 2020. Lower production can lead to higher prices.Halliburton pays an annual dividend of $0.18 per share, which amounts to a 1.47% forward dividend yield. In comparison, Schlumberger (SLB) pays a yearly dividend of $0.50, which amounts to a forward dividend yield of 3.34%.HAL's free cash flow (or FCF) increased phenomenally in 9M 2020 compared to a year ago. The FCF boost was purely a function of the lower capex. Although cash flow from operations (or CFO) decreased marginally in the past year, improved working capital led to the CFO rise. In FY2020, HAL has lowered capex guidance to below $800 million, which will at least be 47% lower than FY2019. Although the top-line growth will be muted in 2021, its cost reduction measures will improve operating margin, which can tailwind cash flows in 2021. So, I think lower capital intensity will drive FCF in 2021.HAL’s debt-to-equity is 1.9x, which is higher than Schlumberger's (1.4x), TecnipFMC’s (FTI) (0.11x), and Baker Hughes’s (BKR) (0.44x). So, Halliburton's high leverage may come in the way of its future dividend payment. However, with increased cash flows, I expect high leverage to not affect the balance sheet strength much in 2021.I have observed a regression equation based on the historical relationship among the crude oil price, global rig count, and HAL's reported revenues for the past five years and the previous eight-quarter trend. Based on the model, I expect revenues to decrease in the next two years. I expect it to rebound in 2023.Based on a simple regression model using the average forecast revenues, I expect the company's EBITDA to decline in the next three years. However, in 2024, the EBITDA can rebound.I have calculated the EV using HAL's forward EV/EBITDA multiple and its past average multiple. Returns potential using the forward multiple (8.7x) is lower (35% downside) compared to returns potential using the past average multiple (7% upside). The Wall Street analysts have much higher returns expectations (29% upside) from the stock.Halliburton's forward EV-to-EBITDA multiple contraction versus the adjusted trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA is in contrast to a rise in the EV/EBITDA multiple for peers because sell-side analysts expect HAL's EBITDA to increase versus a fall in EBITDA for peers. This typically results in a higher EV/EBITDA multiple compared to peers. The stock's EV/EBITDA multiple is higher than its peers' (SLB, BKR, and FTI) average of 6.2x. I think the sell-side analysts are over-estimating the returns potential.At the outset, Halliburton presented the Q3 earnings call at a better spirit than Schlumberger's management did. However, I do not think these companies deviate much over the core issues and the possible recovery period. What makes HAL stand apart from SLB and many others is its pre-emptive move to reduce dependence on North America and resuscitate the international business much before others did. Now, it brings home the benefits of an early mover, as some regions move from strength to strength. The frac spread count has also increased substantially in the past month in the U.S.HAL's management focuses on enhancing the digitalization service can also help reduce its capital footprint. Margin, however, may not have the cushion after the completion of the recently-concluded cost-reduction efforts. I think the company should continue cleaning up its overly-leveraged balance sheet. No doubt, a robust free cash flow generation will go a long way in helping it manage the situation. I think returns from the stock can be muted in the near term. I do expect the stock to produce much better returns in a few quarters. But, just not yet."
4381391,40351,2020-10-26T13:59:20-04:00,"Halliburton reported an adjusted profit of $0.11 per share and free cash flows of $265 million for Q3-2020.The business environment remains tough but we are starting to see some signs of stability in North America.Halliburton's transformation can help lift profit margins and with the improvement in financial health, the company might consider making accretive acquisitions.","This has been a difficult year for Halliburton (HAL) but the company has managed to generate profits and free cash flows, as evident from the latest quarterly results, and its future is looking exciting. Halliburton might continue to struggle with shrinking revenues until the business environment in North America and international markets improve. But its margins might still get better and it could continue reporting free cash flows.Image courtesy of PixabayHalliburton, the world’s largest provider of fracking services, has recently reported blowout quarterly results in which it earned better-than-expected profits and robust free cash flows. The company has exhibited its ability to stand firm even as drilling activity collapsed in North America, its primary market.Halliburton has been operating under tough market conditions as weak crude oil prices and a global pandemic has damaged energy demand. The oil and gas producers, who are Halliburton’s customers, have slashed spending and reduced drilling activity. Upstream investments in the US, which has long been Halliburton’s primary source of revenues and earnings, fell by almost 50% to $100 billion this year, as per one estimate. The shale oil producers have removed hundreds of rigs and demand for fracking services has plunged. The US rig count for offshore and onshore units clocked in at 282 rigs at the end of last week, down from almost 800 rigs at the start of the year, data from Baker Hughes (BKR) shows.That being said, we are now seeing some light at the end of the tunnel, which bodes well for Halliburton. The global oil demand has recovered after bottoming in the second quarter. The decrease in production from OPEC+ and other countries, continued production cuts from OPEC+, and expectations related to finding an effective health solution to the pandemic have lent support to oil prices. The Brent crude oil price has been hovering in the $40 to $45 a barrel since mid-June. The drilling activity has somewhat resumed in North America, which is evident from the improving rig count numbers. The US oil and gas rig count bottomed at 244 rigs in mid-August and has since gradually improved to 284 rigs, as shown in the image below. Both Halliburton and its rival Schlumberger are now seeing signs of stability in the North American market.Image: Author. Data: Baker Hughes Rig CountThat being said, the business environment is still tough, with drilling activity being near the lowest levels in years, and any improvement we are seeing is coming from a very low base. In this backdrop, Halliburton might continue to struggle with shrinking revenues. But the activity in North America isn’t declining anymore, which is certainly a good sign which indicates that the market may have bottomed out and things will gradually get better in the future if oil prices stabilize, E&P companies establish a base-line activity required to hold production flat, some oil producers work through their inventory of drilled but uncompleted wells, and some start deploying new rigs. A turnaround in North America could be followed by an uptick in the international markets where drilling activity is currently still declining.It could take more than a year for the turnaround to materialize and until then, Halliburton might continue to struggle with shrinking revenues. But I think the company’s earnings will benefit from the ongoing cost-cutting and margin expansion efforts. The company has made $1 billion in structural cost cuts, mainly by reducing its headcount and real estate footprint by 50% in North America from last year. Moreover, it is adopting an asset-light business model, disposing less profitable businesses, and increasing focus on providing high-margin digital technology solutions to help oil producers reduce costs and improve efficiency, particularly for the North American market.Halliburton’s shift is a part of its ongoing transformation efforts which can drive margin expansion and I think this makes the company’s future exciting. The company wants to run a leaner but more profitable North American business while concentrating on growing its international operations. That’s a big shift for a company that has historically generated most of its revenues from North America. At the same time, the company will double down on digital technologies both at home and abroad. This approach will likely have a negative impact on revenues in the near term but should make the company more profitable and better prepared to deal with the downturns.Halliburton has also done a commendable job of improving its financial health and I expect the company to continue generating free cash flows in 2021. The company has brought its long-term debt down from $10.3 billion last year to $9.63 billion currently while growing its cash reserves, as mentioned earlier. Its cash flows, on the other hand, may not get the same level of working capital benefit in 2021 as compared to this year. But I think that with improving margins, a lower cost structure, a decline in restructuring and severance costs, and a reduction in capital intensity to 5% to 6% of revenues under the new business model should enable Halliburton to continue generating free cash flows in 2021.This means Halliburton’s cash reserves might grow further in the future. I think the company will use its financial muscle to acquire other businesses, albeit its focus won’t be on growing its market share. Instead, I expect the management to only make those acquisitions that help Halliburton in expanding its margins and free cash flows.Halliburton is charting a new course by concentrating on profit margins and free cash flows, instead of market share, and I believe its future is looking exciting. The shares aren’t looking attractive from a valuation standpoint, with Halliburton stock currently trading 20x next year’s consensus earnings estimate and 8.4x in terms of EV/EBITDA (forward) multiple, as per data from Seeking Alpha Essential, but I think long-term-oriented investors should continue to hold this stock."
4379903,33291,2020-10-20T05:49:42-04:00,"We know it is hard to be bullish on names here, but it becomes easier when you think long term.Q3 earnings suggest the bottom is likely in for oil markets, and despite top line declines, earnings were strong.Cost controls continue to ensure profitability.As we look ahead, we expect pricing to work its way through a couple of predictable steps.","Prepared by Stephanie, analyst at the team of BAD BEAT InvestingHalliburton's (HAL) is a stock we have been encouraging dip-buying in. It offers an interesting risk-reward profile under $12. We stand by it. When economies around the world even return to 50% of what they were doing before the COVID-19 crisis, pent-up demand for oil will be unleashed. We are in no way suggesting we expect oil prices to increase dramatically, or ever see highs they once saw over a decade ago. But we do expect them to increase enough to drive profitability in oil service companies.Thus, buying now is still a rather contrarian play at this time, but we are always on the lookout for names that are simply beaten down too far and look to scale in and profit from the reversal. We will say it again. Unless you see bankruptcy as likely, despite another few months of pain in oil ahead, you can buy. When demand returns, it will mop up a lot of that oversupply which has simply decimated pricing. While we find names left for dead and profit from the reversal, we are in a position of playing after a double. We think that it will take time, but a double is not out of the question. In this column, we check back in on performance.The company just reported its Q3 earnings, which saw a slight top-line miss and a bottom-line beat versus consensus estimates. In fairness, this was another really tough quarter, and we thought sales revenues could be down 50% here. This was because of the devastation in oil pricing continued in the summer, though improved from Q2 mostly. The exception was September, which saw real pain once again, which weighed on the entire oil sector. Demand has rebounded somewhat from Q2, but supply is more than ample. Please understand that oil prices are so strongly linked to the performance of the company and the stock.As such, with wild moves in oil prices in recent weeks, the stock has moved with volatility. The uncertainty makes decisions like capex and labor planning all that much harder going forward. That said, Q3 saw pricing all over the place. Revenues, actually, were as expected down heavily from a year ago, declining 46% and registering at $2.98 billion in the quarter.We saw a decline which we anticipated but was slightly better than we expected. However, at $2.98 billion, the company was slightly below consensus projections. We were more bearish, expecting $2.95 billion, so this result is welcomed in our opinion, but it is still disgusting. But where were the revenues generated from? We need to know the trends driving these issues. Overall, we saw similar trends as we saw in Q2, though declining sequential performance of 7% on the sales front.There was a divergence in operating segment performance relative to the sequential quarter, which saw the beginning of COVID-19. We saw lower revenues sequentially from Q2 2020 in the Completion and Production segment. Revenue here was $1.6 billion, a decrease of $0.1 billion or 6%. This was somewhat unnerving as many expected Q2 was likely the bottom. But the second half of the quarter was painful.These declines stemmed from reduced completion tool sales across Europe/Africa/CIS, the Gulf of Mexico, and Latin America, coupled with lower cementing activity in Middle East/Asia and North America land. It was partially offset by higher stimulation activity and artificial lift sales in North America land, higher activity across multiple product service lines in Argentina, as well as increased pipeline services in Europe/Africa/CIS. It spilled over into Drilling and Evaluation as well.Over in the Drilling and Evaluation segment, we saw a lower decline from the sequential quarter. Revenue came in at $1.4 billion which was down 8% versus Q2 2020, better than we expected, but still down $0.12 billion or 8%. It is worth pointing out that cost controls led to operating income decreasing $22 million, or a 17% drop from the sequential quarter. Driving this was the simple fact that there was a global reduction in drilling-related services and lower project management activity.As we look to the rest of 2020, we are mostly interested in regional activity, and given the global nature of COVID-19, it stands to reason that we will see a divergence in regional activity in the next few quarters. International expansion ceased, which had been offsetting the declines in North America. North America revenue was $0.98 billion, a 6% decrease from the sequential quarter actually. The action is still promising internationally, and we think it will rebound later this year. The company is successfully executing its strategy of controlling what expenses it can control and managing the business to perform well in any market conditions. International revenue was $2.0 billion, a 7% decrease from Q2. All regions in the international space saw revenue declines.Expenses have been well-managed, and the company is committed to further cuts. While the company cannot control pricing, it can control expenses to a large degree. On a GAAP basis, the company saw losses. The company saw a net loss of $17 million, or $0.02 per diluted share. This compares to a net loss for the second quarter of 2020 of $1.7 billion, or $1.91 per diluted share. Adjusted net income for the third quarter of 2020, excluding severance and other charges, was $100 million, or $0.11 per diluted share. This compares to adjusted net income for the second quarter of 2020, excluding impairments and other charges, of $46 million, or $0.05 per diluted share. This was a big positive in the quarter, with the profit surprising to the upside despite the pain in revenues.We know it is hard to be bullish on names here, but it becomes easier when you think long term. COVID-19 has been a global headwind, but it is temporary. Oil demand will return. Economic activity will resume. Driving will resume. Travel will return. Factories and construction will resume. It is not going to be years of this but maybe a few quarters. Halliburton continues to control costs. The pace of activity declines in the international markets is slowing, while the North America industry structure continues to improve, and activity is stabilizing.As we look ahead, we expect pricing to work its way through a couple of predictable steps. The first step, which we're starting to see now, is a recovering demand for active capacity. The second step will happen when activity recovers enough to call on cold-stacked equipment to return to the market. We expect that higher pricing will be necessary for Halliburton to push the button here. Finally, we expect that real and meaningful advancements of COVID-19 vaccines will help drive reopening, and subsequent demand. We think you scale in on weakness and hold for the next few quarters. You will be rewarded.If you like the material here, click ""Follow,"" and if you are seeking professional trading guidance in this market, check out our service below."
4379806,92586,2020-10-19T14:30:39-04:00,"Halliburton shares have spiked on upbeat comments from the company's management team, despite ugly third quarter results.Demand remains in the gutter, although the energy services company continues to do a good job at controlling costs and preserving cash.I am not willing to endure high volatility and the prospect of further losses in the hope that Halliburton's optimism may be justified.","Halliburton (HAL) shares are off to the races, up nearly 4% as I write this sentence, on the day that the energy services company reported third quarter results. Analysts had been expecting to see revenues reach $3.1 billion, but the 46% YoY top line decline was worse than anticipated. Adjusted EPS of $0.11, on the other hand, topped consensus estimate by two cents.Bullishness seems to have come primarily from CEO Jeff Miller's upbeat remarks about the struggling North America market, as he believes that ""we are getting closer to an activity bottom."" It probably also helped that the OPEC+ group committed to a balance in the oil and gas market, which pushed crude prices higher on Monday.Credit: HalliburtonExpectations about the future aside, Halliburton's third quarter results did not deviate much from the numbers posted by peer Schlumberger (SLB) on Friday. With the exception of Latin America, a small market that accounted for barely 10% of revenues in 3Q19, all of Halliburton's operating and geographic segments saw revenues decline both sequentially and YoY. See table below.Pockets of strength could be observed in higher stimulation activity in US land, which did little to prevent North America revenues from falling by two-thirds YoY. Internationally, Argentina, Colombia and Mexico saw increased activity across the board. However, the larger Middle East and Asia geographic group failed to gain traction due to reduced well construction and project management activity.Source: table provided by HalliburtonAlso in line with the performance of its main competitor, Halliburton did a good job at containing expenses and preserving cash in the face of severely adverse market conditions. Across completion and production, drilling and evaluation, the company managed to operate profitably. Cash flow from operations for the year has remained very much in line with the comparable 2019 metric, which has helped Halliburton to improve its net debt position compared to the start of 2020 - $7.7 billion now vs. $8.1 billion then.A painful third quarter of performance may have been largely predicted by analysts and baked into the share price ahead of earnings. Now, investors are faced with a decision: to turn bullish on the management team's more optimistic (and contrarian) view of the energy service space, or stay cautious on the heels of financial results that remain highly discouraging and a macroeconomic landscape that appears far from stable.I could justify a buy of HAL at current levels on a few key arguments. First, energy services tend to be a longer cycle business, and Halliburton should be able to see demand levels beyond the immediate term. Also, the company has been doing a competent job at playing defense, after five years of a painful and ongoing downcycle have prepared Halliburton well for a challenging 2020. Lastly, share price is way off the all-time peak reached in 2014 (see chart below), and bargain hunters may be tempted to place a speculative bet here.Data by YChartsOn the other hand, the oil and gas space has been ""in a funk"" for years, and a few head fakes in the past half decade have caused occasional investor optimism to be crushed. More specifically to Halliburton, the company is traditionally more heavily exposed to the North America market than its peer Schlumberger, which I believe is an increased risk factor. Lastly, even compared to the highly volatile energy sector as a whole (XLE), HAL share price has been more jittery since the start of the industry's secular decline, reaching lower lows during times of distress.Due to the sizable risks, I prefer not to trust ""the bottom theory."" Sure, the worst of the 2020 crisis may have been left behind. But I am not willing to endure high volatility and the prospect of further losses in the hope that Halliburton may be right about market stabilization and a pick-up in drilling and production activity. Instead, I prefer to place more calculated bets outside the oil and gas sector at this moment."

We are seeing massive costs for the company in the short term. Despite trying to slash expenses, it is tough to keep going after a quarter (the March to June quarter) that saw unprecedented oil price action. We believe oil demand will pick up this winter into 2021, and that should help pricing. When economies around the world even return to 50% of what they were doing before the COVID-19 crisis, pent-up demand for oil will be unleashed, in our opinion. We think you can start buying now as a contrarian play, ahead of what we see as a rebound that is coming this winter. Unless you see bankruptcy as likely, despite another few weeks to months of pain in oil, you can buy. In this column, we check back in on performance as we prepare for Q3 results. We think you should be watching these metrics when Q3 is reported.When the company reported its Q2 earnings, it saw a slight top line miss and a bottom line beat versus consensus estimates. We think Q3 will be pressured, but it will be a sequential improvement from Q2. To be clear, Q2 was a really tough quarter, and we thought sales revenues could have been down 50% here. We see Q3 sales being down 20-30%. You need to understand that oil prices are so strongly linked to the performance of the company and the stock. As such, with wild moves in oil prices in recent weeks, the stock has moved with volatility. The uncertainty makes decisions like capex and labor planning all that much harder going forward. That said, Q2 saw pricing all over the place, and here in Q3, it has been better, but we have seen declines in pricing in recent weeks. Revenues, actually, were down heavily from a year ago as expected, declining 46% and registering at $3.2 billion in the quarter.We want to remind you that there was a divergence in operating segment performance relative to the sequential quarter, which saw the beginning of COVID-19.We saw lower revenues sequentially from Q1 2020 in the Completion and Production segment. Revenue here was $1.7 billion, a decrease of $1.3 billion, or 44%.These declines were driven by a decrease in pressure pumping activity globally, primarily in U.S. land and Latin America, coupled with lower artificial lift activity in U.S. land. This was partially offset by improved completion tool sales internationally. As you can see, the crimped demand from COVID-19 was evident. It spilled over into Drilling and Evaluation as well.In the Drilling and Evaluation segment, we saw a lower decline from the sequential quarter. Revenue came in at $1.5 billion, which was down 27% versus Q1 2020, better than we expected at $1.3 billion here. It is worth pointing out that cost controls led to operating income decreasing $90 million, a 41% drop from the sequential quarter. Driving this was the simple fact that there was a global reduction in drilling-related services and lower software sales internationally.We are going to watch this closely when Q3 is reported. We suspect we see an ongoing divergence in the segments.Expenses have been well-managed, but again, management has stated previously that it is committed to further cuts.While the company cannot control pricing, it can control expenses to a large degree. On a GAAP basis, things were nasty. Halliburton recognized $2.1 billion of pre-tax impairments and other charges to further adjust its cost structure to current market conditions. These charges consisted primarily of non-cash asset impairments, mainly associated with pressure pumping equipment and real estate, as well as inventory write-offs, severance, and other costs.This expense control ability on an adjusted basis was more telling. Adjusted operating income was $236 million. Despite the market headwinds, the margin performance was decent, especially in the Completion and Production, but also in the Drilling and Evaluation division. There was $456 million of positive free cash flow generated this quarter, reflecting aggressive cost reduction actions. Despite missing the top line, the earnings per share were ahead of projections, though down from last year.We think that when Q3 is reported, you are going to see continued draconian cuts. This is being done to preserve earnings and protect the balance sheet. In Q2, we saw that adjusted net income was $46 million, or $0.05 per diluted share. This compares to adjusted net income for Q1 2020, excluding impairments and other charges and a loss on the early extinguishment of debt, of $270 million, or $0.31 per diluted share. We think Q3 sees a nice boost from the Q2 numbers, but will still be pressured badly and the year-over-year numbers will be poor.Looks like it is hard to be bullish on energy names here, but it becomes easier when you think long term. Short term, we recognize that this is a very contrarian play. The thing is that COVID-19 has been a global headwind, but it is temporary. Oil demand will return. Economic activity will resume. Yes, supply is a major problem. There have been some cutbacks, but not nearly enough yet. But we also know that driving will resume. Travel will return. Factories and construction will resume. It is not going to be years of this, but maybe a few quarters.When Q3 is reported, we will look to see how Halliburton continues to control costs. We think foreseeing earnings is difficult here. The company is reducing overhead and other costs by approximately $1 billion, and is lowering capital expenditures. We liked seeing positive free cash flow in an incredibly difficult quarter. Q3 will not be not as ugly as where we were in Q2, but we still expect pain. We think that as things improve, the stock will slowly head back to the high teens. Keep a close watch on expenses and international performance in the interim.

4379414,38631,2020-10-16T10:57:02-04:00,"Halliburton is facing an unprecedented downturn in its business due to the pandemic.The company is doing its best in the factors it can control.However, the stock is not attractive. Only the investors who are highly confident in a swift recovery of the energy market may consider buying the stock.Even these investors should realize that Halliburton is not a buy-and-hold forever stock. Its deeply negative 5-year and 10-year returns confirm this.","Halliburton (HAL) has provided remarkably poor returns to its shareholders for several years. The stock has plunged 30% and 67% over the last 12 months and 5 years, respectively. The reasons behind the great divergence from the broad market, which is hovering around its all-time highs, are the coronavirus crisis and some challenges the company was facing even before the pandemic. As this is a highly cyclical stock, it is only natural that investors now wonder whether the stock has finally become a bargain.Halliburton is facing a severe downturn due to the coronavirus crisis, which has caused an unprecedented collapse in the demand for oil products and thus it has resulted in a slump in the global oil production this year.In the second quarter, the average U.S. rig count of Halliburton declined 50% sequentially while its international rig count fell 22%. As a result, the global rig count of the company sank to a multi-year low level. These trends took their toll on the revenue of Halliburton, which plunged 57% in the domestic market and 17% in international markets.Even worse, in its last conference call, the management of Halliburton stated that the rig count had not bottomed yet. It stated that it expected a bottom in the third quarter but it did not expect a meaningful recovery anytime soon. This outlook is in line with the outlook provided by the CEO of Precision Drilling (PDS), a major onshore oilfield services provider, who stated that most shale oil producers will not resume their production until the second half of 2021 even if the economy continues to recover.On the bright side, while the underlying business conditions are exceptionally adverse right now, Halliburton is doing its best in the factors it can control. The company reduced its costs by $300 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 and the first quarter of 2020 and implemented another $750 million of cost reductions in the second quarter. Halliburton has also stated that it would implement another $250 million of cost cuts in the third quarter. These cost reductions are related to its international business and the rationalization of its real estate.Thanks to its aggressive cost-cutting measures, Halliburton exceeded analysts’ expectations by a wide margin in the second quarter. It posted an adjusted profit per share of $0.05 (vs. expected losses of -$0.17 per share) and reported free cash flow of $456 million, which was more than double the analysts’ consensus.It is thus evident that Halliburton is doing its best in the factors it can control in the unprecedented downturn it is facing right now. Unfortunately, the efforts of management are not sufficient to offset the headwinds facing the company. It is also important to note that Halliburton was facing great challenges even before the pandemic.Since the previous downturn of the energy sector, which was caused by the collapse of the price of oil from $100 in mid-2014 to $26 in 2016, oil producers have become markedly conservative in their budgets and try to operate within the limits posed by their cash flows. Moreover, thanks to great technological advances in oil production, oil producers are now able to extract more oil from a given number of wells. As a result, Halliburton now generates lower revenues at a given rate of production than it did in the past. This helps explain the poor results of the company in recent years.The U.S. oil production kept posting new all-time highs every single year between 2014 and 2019 but Halliburton switched from an all-time high profit of $4.11 per share in 2014 to a loss of -$1.29 per share in 2019. These secular headwinds, namely the tight budgets of oil producers and the increased efficiency in oil production, are game-changers in the onshore oil production and thus they will continue to weigh on the results of Halliburton for years.Analysts expect Halliburton to post earnings per share of $0.53 in 2021 and $0.90 in 2022. The stock is thus trading at 24.5 times next year’s earnings and 14.6 times its expected earnings in 2022. The stock has traded at an average price-to-earnings ratio of 16.2 over the last decade. Therefore, the stock seems reasonably valued right now, provided that it meets the analysts’ consensus in 2022.However, Halliburton is highly vulnerable to the ongoing downturn. If the pandemic does not subside next year, the stock will come under great pressure. Fortunately, in the most likely scenario, a vaccine is likely to be developed early next year and distributed in about a year and thus Halliburton will probably begin to recover in 2022. Nevertheless, investors should keep the high vulnerability of Halliburton to prolonged downturns in mind.Overall, if the pandemic subsides next year, Halliburton is likely to offer decent returns off its current stock price. In addition, if there is a temporary improvement in the global demand for oil products, such as an increase in global air traffic, the stock of Halliburton will certainly rally. On the other hand, due to the high vulnerability of the company to downturns and the aforementioned secular headwinds, investors should realize that this is not a buy-and-hold forever stock. As soon as it offers significant capital gains, investors should take their profits and look elsewhere for attractive returns. The -64% return of the stock over the last decade proves that the stock is suitable for trading, not for a long-term investing horizon.Halliburton is suitable for those who have great confidence in a swift recovery of the energy market from the pandemic. However, the investors who want to benefit from a long-term recovery (instead of a prompt recovery) of the energy market should probably select more resilient stocks, such as Total (TOT), Magellan Midstream Partners (MMP) and Phillips 66 (PSX). In the event of a swift recovery from the pandemic, these stocks are likely to rally less than Halliburton but these stocks will prove more resilient in the adverse scenario of a prolonged pandemic while they also offer much higher dividend yields than the 1.4% dividend yield of Halliburton."

However, HAL is an excellent tool for short-term trading at least until H2 2021.","Source: UpstreamonlineThe Houston-based Halliburton (HAL) released its third-quarter results on October 19, 2020. The company achieved a better-than-expected third-quarter 2020 after Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) released its third quarter on October 16, 2020.However, compared to the same quarter ago, Halliburton's revenues tumbled 46.3% with a loss of $0.02 per share compared to an income of $0.34 per share a year ago. Lower revenues from North America activities were mainly to blame, with a large drop of about 67%. The quarterly results did not surprise the market, which expected even worse performance.CEO Jeff Miller said in the conference call:The investment thesis remains the same. Because HAL is an ""oilfields service,"" I do not recommend starting a long-term position before 2021. Investors should focus more on a regular oil investment such as Chevron Corp. (NYSE:CVX), Exxon Mobil (XOM), or Shell (RDS.A, RDS.B), which are more likely to react faster to bullish oil prices next year.However, for those who own the stock already, I recommend trading short term about half of your HAL holding to take advantage of the oil volatility dominating the sector.Data by YChartsLooking at the chart above, we can see that HAL and Baker Hughes (NYSE:BKR) have outperformed SLB since January 2020. It is quite a surprise that Halliburton has more exposure in the North American segment, which is the segment suffering the most lately.Source: HAL filingsNote: more historical data are available for subscribers only.1 - Revenues of $2.975 billion in 3Q '20.Halliburton reported a loss per share of $0.02 for 3Q '20 on $2.975 billion in revenues compared to $5.550 billion in the same quarter last year. Revenues for 3Q '20 were down 6.9% sequentially.The adjusted operating income was $275 million, an improvement of 17% compared to the second quarter of 2020.North American revenues plunged 66.7% year over year to $984 million. Though, revenues from Halliburton's international operations dropped 7.8% from the year-ago period to $1,991 million principally due to the lower value of its fracking tools and real estate.Jeff Miller, Chairman, President, and CEO, said in the press release:Net income reported for the third quarter of 2020 came in at a loss of $17 million, well below the gain of $295 million for the same period last year.Halliburton delivered better-than-expected third-quarter earnings and the market liked it.However, despite better-than-expected results, we cannot overlook the drop in business.The decline in this industry has been significant and was primarily due to:Below is revenue repartition per region.If we compare the third quarter to the second quarter of 2020, we can see that most of the revenues lost have been minimal, with a tiny increase in Latin America.Halliburton's business model relies on two distinct segments:North American revenues plunged 66.7% year over year to $984 million. Though, revenues from Halliburton's international operations dropped 7.8% from the year-ago period to $1,991 million principally due to the lower value of its fracking tools and real estate.Completion and Production: The results were hit by weakness in completion tool sales (internationally) and lower cementing activity in the Middle East/Asia and North America. On the positive side, the North American segment enjoyed improved stimulation activity and artificial lift sales.Drilling and Evaluation:The segment was disappointing, dragged down by the reduced activities in drilling-related and wireline operations in North America.Let's compare revenues per region between Halliburton and Schlumberger. We can see that SLB is a larger company in terms of revenues with a significant part of the business in the Middle East and Asia.2 - Generic Free Cash Flow jumped to $265 million in 3Q '20Free cash flow yearly is $1,560 million (""TTM""), with free cash flow at $265 million in 3Q '20.The company pays a quarterly dividend of $0.045 per share or a $159 million cash cost. Hence, the current free cash flow level is adequate.The dividend yield is now down to 1.35%.3 - Net debt is now $7.71 billion in 3Q '20, slightly down sequentiallyNet debt is $7.71 billion, and net interest expense for the third quarter of 2020 was $122 million.As of September 30, 2020, Halliburton had $2.11 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $9.83 billion in long-term debt, representing a total debt-to-total capitalization of 65%.Halliburton's third-quarter results came at the right moment. Oil prices posted a limited gain as crude and fuel supplies were down, backed by storm-related production disruptions in the Gulf of Mexico. This mitigated the threat to the oil and gas demand from a second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide. However, even if Halliburton performs better in North America, I do not see the sector performing extraordinarily well mid-term.Thus, it is always important to use these temporary strength periods to profit and wait for the next wave of pessimism that will come later invariably.This wide fluctuation will stay with us probably until H2 2021.Technical Analysis (short term)HAL trades within a descending channel pattern with resistance between $13.50 and $13.75 and support between $10 and $10.50. A descending channel is often considered a bearish formation, which means it is time to profit from the table at resistance and wait for a retracement below $11.However, HAL is moving in correlation with oil prices.If oil prices turn bullish, HAL could breakout and retest the upper resistance at $15-$16. In my opinion, this scenario is not the most likely, and we may well keep the same status quo until H2 2021.Conversely, if oil prices turn bearish due to uninspiring demand and increase supply, HAL will quickly retest the range of $10-$9, where it will be wise to accumulate again.Author's note: If you find value in this article and would like to encourage such continued efforts, please click the ""Like"" button below as a vote of support.

4368558,105526,2020-08-13T18:44:33-04:00,"Halliburton's Q2 numbers benefit from a commendable cost-cutting effort, but the top-line remains pressured.International has been relatively more resilient, but signs of deterioration are emerging, particularly in LatAm.Considering cost cuts were front-loaded in Q2, the cost savings tailwind will likely fade once the full benefits are realized in Q3.The premium multiple appears to have already factored in the positives.","As one of the largest and most liquid beneficiaries of the post-2016 shale-led recovery, Halliburton (HAL) stands to be one of the biggest losers from a ""lower for longer"" oil scenario in the upcoming years. Thus far, COVID-19-led supply and demand shocks have severely hit oil prices, and by extension, North American shale and exploration and production (E&P) prospects appear bleak. Considering the elevated risk to HAL's top-line and future core earnings stream, I would be hesitant to buy into the stock at this juncture, especially at an elevated c. 10x 2021E EV/EBITDA multiple.For oilfield services players, especially those heavily exposed to the US, the key question remains whether margins can remain intact under a post-COVID-19 normal. If Q2 was anything to go by, HAL is moving in the right direction, with EBITDA well above expectations at c. $487 million (implying a c.1.2 percentage point margin contraction to 15.2%). According to management on the Q2 '20 call, Q3 EBITDA is also set to be ""relatively flat"" despite a weaker top-line, which is certainly encouraging.Source: Company DataDespite posting a GAAP loss of $1.91/share, HAL's operating EPS was c. $0.05 once we exclude c. $1.96 of impairments (largely non-cash and associated with pressure pumping equipment and real estate), along with inventory write-offs and severance costs. Relative to historical results, however, this was still one of the lowest operating EPS numbers HAL has posted in years.Source: HAL Earnings AnnouncementNonetheless, HAL continues to generate plenty of cash flow to fund its ongoing commitments, with FCF reaching $456 million on aggressive cost-out actions. Excluding the c. $198 million in dividends, FCF (ex-dividends) comes out to a lower but still positive $258 million. With more working capital unwind and cost-cutting measures to be implemented through year-end, HAL looks on track for c. $1 billion of FCF generation in 2020 on the back of a c. $800 million capital budget.Source: Company DataPerhaps the most worrying callout from Q2 was HAL's expectation for North American spend to decline significantly in 2020, with gassier basins outperforming oily basins. This means less production growth, but, on the other hand, management thinks we'll also see an environment with more discipline and stronger participants (this remains to be seen, however). Nonetheless, the anticipated c. 50% Y/Y declines in HAL's core market is cause for concern.HAL also anticipates the completion of DUCs (drilled but uncompleted wells) to drive completion activity in the second half of 2020, but greater gains seem unlikely until oil prices recover to c. $50/bbl (or higher). Considering the relatively brighter international outlook, the North American market looks set for structural declines in the coming years, likely entailing a declining share of global oil production.Internationally, HAL is calling for a reasonably resilient 2020 activity in the Middle East region and the North Sea, while LatAm and Africa face meaningful headwinds. This compares to the outlook for North American onshore activity, where HAL sees drilling activity only finding a bottom some time in Q3 '20. A meaningful upward inflection in drilling activity remains unlikely, however, in the near term.As a result, HAL expects shorter-cycle international barrels to fill a larger portion of incremental oil demand going forward and is aggressively pushing the adoption of its latest technologies internationally. It is worth noting that international spending is now guided to be down ""mid-teens"" in 2020 on a ""deeper and longer pullback in Latin America,"" which signals incremental deterioration relative to the Q1 '20 call (10% Y/Y decline).Source: Company Data, Conference CallsThe key driver behind the Q2 results was the above-consensus cost savings run rate, with realized cost-out reaching c. $200 million for the quarter. While impressive, it remains unclear how much of HAL's targeted $1B cost-out program is structural, considering its cash costs are running well below its peers. For instance, HAL's upsized $240 million (including c. $60 million in Q3 '20) for a $1 billion program, compares to Schlumberger (SLB) at $1.2-1.4 billion for a $1.5 billion program and Baker Hughes (BKR) at $500 million for a $700 million program.Importantly, the savings were front-end loaded in Q2 (c. $180 million in Q2 '20 and c. $60 million in Q3 '20), which likely means HAL captured most of the cost benefits during the quarter. Going forward, the remaining c. 25% of cost savings will be implemented in more International and real estate-focused businesses. This likely means the cost benefits will take longer to be reflected in the results, considering these are longer cycle businesses (vs. US headcount reductions). For the remainder of 2020, HAL has guided toward a c. $50 million quarterly run-rate for corporate expenses (in-line with Q2 '20 and significantly below the c. $65 million quarterly run-rate in 2019).Source: HAL 10-Q FilingCapital expenditures were also guided to be structurally lower, likely in the c. 5-6% of revenues range. This would entail capex levels at half the historical 10-11% of revenues run-rate, reflecting both efficiencies and lower activity. I would not rule out further capex cuts down the line, particularly considering most of the cost benefits look to be behind us, and the full extent of the benefits from cost savings is set to be realized by Q3 '20.Amid declines in the core business, HAL appears to be focused on its digital approach (""Halliburton 4.0""), citing its contribution to a ""large part"" of the cost reductions in North America. Considering the savings came by way of remote operations and lower field personnel, maintenance capex should also be meaningfully lowered. Thinking longer-term, HAL's improving digital capabilities is positive because it facilitates HAL's transition toward a more asset-light model. Therefore, while Digital is unlikely to become a standalone reportable segment in the near term, it certainly bears watching.Source: Q2 Presentation SlidesI think management is taking the right approach by opting to team up with entrepreneurial start-ups (instead of spending millions on developing the same solution in-house). The five-year strategic agreement with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Accenture (NYSE:ACN), for instance, demonstrates a willingness to recognize and work with external experts, while also keeping capex trim.HAL carries some gearing at c. 2.5x trailing net debt/EBITDA, but the near-term liquidity outlook looks fine, especially after the c. 75% dividend cut. Taking a medium-term view, however, HAL still needs to address the $600 million and $1 billion notes due in 2023 and 2025, respectively. HAL has plenty of cash on hand, so the looming repayments should not be an issue, although a refinancing would certainly help. There is also a $3.5 billion revolver available should the need arise, and therefore, I am fairly sanguine on the liquidity position.Source: Q2 Presentation SlidesAlong with the rest of the market, HAL shares have been a strong outperformer coming out of the March trough. Going forward, however, it is hard to see much room for an upside surprise, with cost benefits already factored into the current market valuation. HAL is trading on c. 10x 2021E EV/EBITDA, a premium to its normalized average multiple of c. 6-7x, which I think reflects the market's optimism on a recovery. Balancing this with the relatively high debt levels, the potential for pricing pressure amid a challenging industry environment, and commodity price risks, I am opting to stay on hold.Data by YCharts"
4368149,103610,2020-08-12T18:23:00-04:00,"Halliburton is adjusting its business model to that of a high technology service provider.The future the company sees is smaller, but more efficient and profitable.We think the company makes a compelling argument and expect further growth in a rising oil price environment.","In my last article on Halliburton (HAL), where I implored the readers to scoop up Hally with both hands if they had any interest in the oilfield space at all as an investment vehicle, I identified some key elements in a potential recovery, and made my pitch.""Halliburton: All-time Lows Flash A Strong Buy Signal""The share price was ~$5 a share when this article came out (source).Well, the company delivered on the cost-cutting front and managed to generate a surprising amount of free cash in the second quarter. As a reward Bank of America analyst Chase Mulvehill upped his price target to $18. We think this is baked in and further gains could be seen as we close out the year. In this article we will review the shale recovery thesis for generating continued gains in this stock.Note - this article appeared in the Daily Drilling Report on July 23 when the stock was at $14.80. At today's price, members have had the opportunity to earn 12% on an investment in three weeks.I think we can agree - shale has shrunk. In order to maintain its formerly prodigious output at ~9 mm BOEPD, it required the better part of a 1000 rigs turning to the right. We are far, far from the figure today, and after 18 consecutive weeks, we still haven't hit bottom on the rig count. Today a paltry 253 rigs are searching for oil and gas in domestic North American shale plays.Baker HughesHere's the thing. It's going to start getting better and that spells good news for Hally. Now let's be clear neither I, nor Halliburton, is calling for a ""mini-boom;"" the takeaway here is the bottom is near in terms of drilling activity. Hally's CEO Jeff Miller comments in the call:SourceMeaningful inflection is the operative term here. I would define that as the point where the market goes ""Wowza, oil supplies are dropping!"" Yesterday's EIA WPSR did not advance that position very far. Restored U.S. production likely contributed largely to this event. We see this as transitory as lack of new drilling will create a gap with a legacy shale decline. Interestingly enough, the market must be thinking along these lines as it basically laughed off the storage build. In the coming weeks, we expect storage levels to drop as new drilling is not replacing legacy shale barrels at a rate that will sustain production. 9.3 mm BOEPD is far, far in the rear view.SourceHalliburton is trading at an adjusted (note - the company took a $2.1 bn impairment charge in Q-2) EV/EBITDA multiple of ~6X. With even a modest increase in drilling, say 20% from these historically low levels through the end of the year, a commensurate rise in revenue would add about $600 mm in gross revenue, about 20% higher than Q2. This would take the stock close to BoA's projection of $18 share. I think this is realistic by year's end, and we could possibly see it quicker than that, as well as extend it. We are nearly there at today's price. Now this scenario just takes in a modest uptick in operations domestically from prices for WTI recovering to the mid-$40s, which they have essentially done.Suppose they continue higher. This is a bit of a contrarian viewpoint, but let's consider: Oil is priced at low end of the marginal utility curve. Meaning the market is so used to having a limitless supply of the stuff that the idea we could be looking at S-H-O-R-T-A-G-E-S is completely outside the pale of feasibility. The point here is that we are just one cataclysmic event away from supply interruptions. I'm not predicting anything in this regard, but it's hard to imagine the status quo in many of the world's hotspots -Venezuela, Iran, or Libya - as examples of the stuff we are used to thinking about. A 60-year old conflict between China and India is bubbling on their Himalayan border. As many as 20 Indian soldiers were killed in a June skirmish. What will India's response be to this event?WSJThe point here is it only takes one.The result of a massive cost-cutting promise made in the first quarter and executed over the second delivered a stunning $456 mm in free cash flow. Taking a $2.1 bn impairment charge for the quarter meant that the company posted a loss for the quarter, but this is non-cash. Adjusted net income was $236 mm. The company used the money it saved on dividends to pay down $270 mm worth of debt early, saving future interest expense in the process. Revenues were off as one would expect a 37% QoQ to $3.2 bn, but beating the decline in rig activity fairly by a nice margin. In short, it outperformed the market.Hally divides the company's business into these main lines: Completion and Production (C&P), and Drilling and Evaluation, (D&E).C&P revenue was $1.7 billion, a decrease of 44%, while operating income was $159 million, a decrease of 54% QoQ. Declines in pressure pumping in North America and artificial lift accounted for most of this drop. On a global basis, this was offset somewhat by improved completion tool sales internationally.D&E revenue was $1.5 billion, a decrease of 27%, while operating income was $127 million, a decrease of 41%. These declines were primarily due to a global reduction in drilling-related services and lower software sales internationally.Hally's CEO Jeff Miller's comments on North American shale:SourceMy comments here. This is consistent with the view I have for shale activity being concentrated in fewer companies that find a way to deliver profits at the current price environment. Cutting costs by about $1.3 billion over a 90-day period is nothing short of phenomenal performance by a management team.Cost-cutting across all lines has been the key.Miller's key comment regarding this cost-cutting:SourceThe last line here resonates with me. ""Mature market,"" being the operative term. Economies of scale, technology and specialization will drive the future of a smaller, but more profitable North American market, which Halliburton recognizes as being the most important in the world.Technology seems to gravitate to the oilfield. Doing more with less always has been in the background as the industry responded to ever increasing markets with large explosions of capex. Those days are gone and increasingly what would have been big capex solutions are moving to smarter, more flexible components that deliver value while packing in profits to the supplier. You also will see more joint ventures with participants each bringing key attributes to an increasingly digital solutions.Note - I discussed one aspect of this shift to a smaller, but more technological footprint in an earlier article this month. In it I focused on the software shift to the cloud will bring economies of scale and reduced footprint to oil operators.Microsoft: Frac To The FutureHere are some examples-Intervention-less is the key term I've bolded in the above statement. Interventions are expensive shutdowns of producing wells that often require a rig - a big expensive piece of machinery. They can be done rigless, but that's an outlier. In this case, the company is describing smart equipment that will remotely engineer solutions and that can fix itself.Building in Mister Softee's, Microsoft, (MSFT) and Accenture (NYSE:ACN) architecture is a winning solution for both companies. Accenture is the dominant cloud solutions platform that has largely driven the value of the company over the last few years, from $50 a share to over $200 a share. A good partner is what Hally needs here.Depth correlation is one of the most problematic scenarios in the oilfield. I can remember being shut down for hours as wireline was rigged up to confirm firing depth for guns (hey, in the shallow GoM where the sand interval between shale strata can be five feet total), prior to perforating. Or is my packer-a zonal isolation device, where it needs to be to land out my completion string? Questions like this have to be answered, and Hally is doing this without the mechanical risk -you don't always make it out the hole with everything that goes in. In the oilfield the term ""fishing trip"" doesn't have pleasant connotations.Mechanically, set packers run on pipe or wireline have been the standard for the industry for decades as changing the circulation path also was a mechanical process. Pushing a button to set, reset this tool has been a dream of the industry. Not having to move the tool is a critical step change improvement.SourceHalliburton has set itself up to service the oilfield of the present day, which as we have discussed doesn't support the big capital budgets and staffing levels of the past. The oilfield going forward will be a smaller, but more profitable place.Some comments from Lance Loeffler, Hally's CFO, underscore the expectation for the rest of the year.SourceWe are holding our position on Hally at present. Dips may occur, but we think they will be short-lived as the company finishes its consolidation in Q-3. If Hally meets your investment profile, I would not hesitate to add below $13.00 a share. I will stay long to ~$25 or so, then sell half my position, pocketing 5-bagger gains from March. I don't want to be greedy and stay too long at the party with my entire position. Conversely, I don't want to be shut out of future gains if my scenario for oil in 2021 holds true."
4359684,104714,2020-07-21T14:54:05-04:00,"Halliburton's revenue will continue to show weakness in the near term, while the cost savings will mitigate the pressure on the operating margin.While some of the onshore international markets will remain buoyant, the offshore market will reel under the crude oil price dampness and can lead to underperformance in the near term.It recorded significant impairment charges in the past couple of quarters related to pressure pumping services.The company's free cash flow generation was a positive development in Q2; expect FCF to strengthen more in the coming quarters, which can become a significant advantage in the current environment.","SourceHalliburton's (HAL) international diversification intensified significantly in Q1 as it is currently drawing two-third of its revenues from outside of North America. I think revenues and margin from North America may decline in the near term, while the onshore completions activity in the Middle East and some parts of the North Sea will stabilize and strengthen. The company's international diversification strategy and enhancing the digitalization service have lessened some of the operational risks and should put a premium on its stock market price. Currently, the success of its strategy will depend on its ability to restructure to lower the cost structure - an effort necessary to deleverage its balance sheet.However, the offshore-based projects in Latin America and Africa will procrastinate. I think Halliburton has at least one-quarter of pain left before the top-line and margin improve sharply. At the current level, the stock is undervalued compared to the past average. For now, investors might want to stay invested and take the back seat.Halliburton has acknowledged the fact that the North American energy industry is going through a structural transformation, and as such, growth will only decelerate more in the near term. The fundamental strategy, given the environment, is to reduce costs as much as possible, be it through facility rationalization or capex readjustment. Thankfully, HAL had already identified these strategies a couple of quarters back, as I discussed in my previous article. It will continue to lower the fixed and services costs and will strive to drive a higher contribution margin. Following up with the $300 million cost reduction achieved in the previous two quarters, the company will look to further add another $1 billion to its margin. Some of the prominent steps have been the significant reduction in maintenance cost per horsepower-hour compared to 2019 and the restructuring of the North American management. It has already achieved 75% of the cost-cutting target and expects the remaining 25% to accrue in Q3. However, some of these initiatives may result in additional one-time costs.Since the start of Q3, the crude oil price has remained stable, which should reinforce its stance that the price will not fall below the cash breakeven level at the wellhead. The management, however, is uncertain over the recovery of the commodity price, which can adversely impact margin in all the U.S. Basins.Seeing the steep fall in demand, the company retired 22% of the available fracturing horsepower by the end of 2019 to maintain the balance between equipment supply and the anticipated demand in 2020. In the second half of 2020, HAL's management expects to see a moderate completion activity recovery as the crude oil price has been consolidating at the $40-level in the past month or so. I think the relative strength in the DUC wells in the past few months also contributes to the renewed optimism. Although drilling activity and the U.S. rig count has nearly bottomed, I do not see any green shoot in that front in the near term. Therefore, the downside to growth continues to hover around the medium-term horizon. However, the margin-level savings can help the company outperform the oilfield services market in this period.In the digital transformation, which is a crucial part of HAL's strategy, it has been focusing on the well planning cycle and digital 3D inversion. It has also been a striking alliance with its peers to innovate in areas that are seeing rising demand. For example, it collaborates with TechnipFMC (FTI) to create distributed acoustic sensing solutions for subsea wells. It has also signed a five-year agreement with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Accenture (NYSE:ACN) to enhance the digital capabilities in Microsoft Azure. The company is removing equipment from location and replacing them with software solutions. The move is also helping it to reduce the capital investment requirement.Given the persistent slowdown in North America, the shorter cycle business in HAL's international portfolio will account for a larger share. In anticipation of a recovery in these regions, the key players can indulge in increasing their productive spare capacity. On the other hand, the longer cycle barrels and new exploration activity in the international offshore business will not turn around quickly as the current pricing stays below the breakeven level in those businesses. Geographically, the OPEC countries in the Middle East will be least affected because of their low breakeven production cost. Offshore Africa and Latin America, however, may see double-digit declines.Going forward, HAL anticipates an apparent disconnect between drilling and completions activity in the international markets. While the former is expected to be scaled back, the latter will be more resilient. In 2H 2020, OPEC countries in the Middle East and some parts of the North Sea will move ahead, while Latin America and Africa will lag because of the offshore project deferrals by some of the upstream companies. As the Latin American energy market continues to see further activity cut, it will pull down the entire activity level and capex in the international market by mid-teens.Despite the steep revenue fall, HAL's operating margin decline was less sharp (221 basis point drop) in Q2 2020 compared to Q1. So, the operating cost-cutting exercises did affect the Q2 result somewhat positively. In Q2 2020, HAL recognized $2.1 billion (pre-tax) impairments charges, primarily related to pressure pumping equipment, real estate, and inventory write-offs, severance, and other costs. As a result of these charges, it recorded a $1.91 loss per share in Q1 2020. In comparison, it marked a $1.16 loss per share in Q1 2020. Investors may note that the company recognized $1.1 billion impairment charges, primarily related to pressure pumping equipment and severance and other costs in Q1.SourceThe economy, according to some estimates, can turn around, even if moderately, from Q3 2020 until 2021. The improved outlook has subscribed to the revision up of the average crude oil price forecast. According to the EIA's Short Term Energy Outlook, the Brent crude oil price for 2H 2020 is now expected to exceed the previous month's forecast by $4 per barrel, while it is expected to beat the previous estimate for 2021 by $2 per barrel. The higher crude oil price reflects EIA's expectation of declines in global oil inventories during this period.The specter of the North American slowdown, which somewhat escaped during the last quarter, hit it hard this time around. The region saw revenues crashing by 57% sequentially (quarter-over-quarter) in Q2. While the onshore pressure pumping business was the primary victim, as anticipated, other key services like well construction, artificial lift, and wireline activity suffered as well. As a result, multiple products and service lines were adversely affected in the Gulf of Mexico.While none of the geographic regions registered any top-line growth, the Middle East/Asia region was the least affected (10% down sequentially) in the downturn. Improved drilling activity and completion tool sales in China and Kuwait restrained the fall. However, Latin America and Europe/Africa/CIS regions were deeply affected due to decreased activity levels in various product service lines, primarily related to well construction and pressure pumping.From Q1 2020 to Q2 2020, Halliburton's Drilling and Evaluation (or D&E) segment revenues decreased by 27%, while the segment operating margin deflated by 210 basis points. A reduction in drilling-related services, as well as reduced software sales in the international market, led to the fall.The Completion and Production (C&P) division saw an even sharper revenue fall (43.6% down) in Q2 compared to the previous quarter. The segment operating margin, too, deteriorated by 210 basis points in Q2 as the U.S. onshore pressure pumping and artificial lift activity slide down. However, completed tools sales in the international market partially retrieved the fall.I have observed a regression equation based on the historical relationship between the crude oil price, the U.S. rig count, and Halliburton's reported revenues for the past 16 quarters. I have also observed its previous five-quarter revenue trend. Based on the regression analysis as it progressed with time, I see that the short-term trend suggests a sharp decline, while the medium-term multi-variable study suggests a moderately growing revenue. Now, I think that the short trend factor will initially have a significant role but will gradually decline as the energy activities recover and start affecting HAL's results more actively. With that assumption, I expect its revenues to continue to decline in the next four quarters and also expect the rate of deceleration to taper off by Q2 2021.I have also developed a Monte Carlo simulation for the revenue based on the equation from the multi-regression formula. The output of the simulation was developed after 10,000 iterations. I set minimum the rig count and the crude oil price at zero and observed the effect. I find that the maximum frequency ranges between $4.7 billion and $6.1 billion, which is significantly higher than its current revenue. However, investors should note that this is an academic exercise and is not part of any investment advice.Halliburton pays an annual dividend of $0.18 quarterly per share, which amounts to a 1.34% forward dividend yield. In comparison, Schlumberger (SLB) pays an annual dividend of $0.50, which amounts to a forward dividend yield of 2.7%.HAL's free cash flow (or FCF) turned positive in 1H 2020 compared to a negative CFO a year ago. In the past year, cash flow from operations (or CFO) has doubled, despite the year-over-year revenue fall in 1H 2020. Improvement in working capital led to the CFO rise. A higher CFO and lower capex resulted in the remarkable turnaround in FCF in 1H 2020. In FY2020, HAL expects to reduce capex by 47% from FY2019 to ~$800 million. I think lower capex will mitigate much of the pressure on CFO, leading to a steady FCF in FY2020.HAL's debt-to-equity is 1.9x, which is higher than Schlumberger (1.0x), TechnipFMC (0.57x), and Baker Hughes (BKR) (0.36x). So, Halliburton's high leverage may come in the way of its future dividend payment. However, the company is confident of its free cash flow strength, which has reflected in the upward share price movement following the Q2 result. The management believes that advances in sensing technologies and design improvements, such as component modularity, are lowering the cost of tools. On top of that, digitalization reduces its capital footprint, as I discussed earlier in the article. With a lower activity level in North America, I expect cash flow to improve further in 2020.Halliburton is currently trading at an EV-to-adjusted EBITDA multiple of 6.8x. Between FY2015 and now, the stock's average EV/EBITDA multiple was 10.6x. So, it is currently trading at a discount to its past average.Halliburton's forward EV-to-EBITDA multiple expansion versus the adjusted trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA is in line with the peers, which typically results in a similar EV/EBITDA multiple compared to peers. The stock's EV/EBITDA multiple is higher than its peers' (SLB, BHGE, and FTI) average of 5.1x. I have used estimates provided by Seeking Alpha in this analysis.SourceAccording to data provided by Seeking Alpha, 11 sell-side analysts rated HAL a ""buy"" in July 2020 (includes ""Very bullish""), while 18 recommended a ""hold."" Only two recommended a ""sell (includes ""very bearish.""). The consensus target price is $13.61, which at the current price, yields ~1% returns.According to Seeking Alpha's Quant Rating, HAL, currently, receives a ""Neutral"" rating. While the ratings are high on revisions and momentum criteria, they are moderate-to-low on profitability, growth, and value.HAL's international diversification intensified significantly in Q1 as it is currently drawing two-third of its revenues from outside of North America. It has also minimized its pressure pumping capacity in North America after several impairment charges and business closures. Currently, the success of its strategy will depend on its ability to restructure its management, to prune capex, and to lower the cost structure. Lower capex should also help generate positive FCF, which would become necessary to deleverage the balance sheet. Its focus on enhancing the digitalization service can also help reduce its capital footprint. Given a leveraged balance sheet, Halliburton should continue cleaning up balance sheets and cash flows to survive the catastrophic situation.However, the investors should keep in mind that when the energy activity stabilizes, North America may trudge along, while the Middle East and some parts of the North Sea will move ahead. Offshore-based projects in Latin America and Africa will lag. While investors may view the cash flow improvement in a positive light, I do not think the real turnaround in the top-line and margin will occur before the end of 2020."

The spotlight will be on cash flow next quarter.At less than 7x EBITDA, Halliburton is a Hold.","Source: ForbesThe coronavirus caused business activity to come to a standstill and caused oil prices to plummet. It also led to a lack of demand for oil, making it difficult for shale oil plays to make money. Supply cuts by OPEC and Russia have driven oil into the $40 range, but that may not spur E&P. Drilling activity could remain depressed for the rest of the year. This sounds foreboding for Halliburton (HAL), which reported Q2 revenue of $3.2 billion, down 37% sequentially and 46% Y/Y.Halliburton (HAL), Schlumberger (SLB) and Baker Hughes (BKR) dominate the North America land drilling market.Revenue from North America fell 57% sequentially and fell over 65% Y/Y. E&P in the region went through fits and starts for much of 2019. Pricing power for oil services companies also waned. The North America rig count fell 61% compared to the second quarter of 2019. It was no surprise that revenue in the region fell hard. The pandemic caused a disruption in the North American oil market. Drilling activity may not rebound anytime soon.International revenue was $2.1 billion, down 17% sequentially. The international rig count fell in the double-digit percentage range during the quarter. A falling rig count connotes lower E&P and lower completion activity. Drilling and completion activity could remain stagnant until global economies fully reopen. Customers have been delaying projects, particularly in the offshore sector. Halliburton may not have the offshore/subsea exposure of Schlumberger or Baker Hughes. That could be a blessing for now, as offshore projects may not be economical at current oil prices.Halliburton and Schlumberger have been cutting costs early and often to help offset their stagnant top line growth. No one could have envisioned a pandemic that would nearly shut down the economy. Halliburton incurred restructuring costs in Q1 and Q2 of $1.1 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively. About $1.5 million of restructuring costs in Q2 were related to severance pay and asset impairment charges:Operating costs of $2.7 billion fell 35% Q/Q, which was less than the 37% decline in revenue. As a result, EBITDA of $487 million fell 43% Q/Q. EBITDA margin was 15%, down 200 basis points versus Q1. Cost cuts could pay dividends down the road. For now, Halliburton appears to be treading water.It could worsen until the economy reopens and demand for oil drives prices higher. I envision the company will employ cost take-outs through the first quarter of 2021 to help preserve margins. As the economy slowly reopens, oil markets and Halliburton's operations should begin to stabilize.Oil services firms must maintain ample liquidity in case oil markets continue to falter. Halliburton has cash of $1.8 billion, down from $2.3 billion at year-end. Working capital at Q2 was $5.8 billion, down from $6.3 billion at year-end. About $3.3 billion of working capital was tied up in inventory. As the business continues to slow, the company must liquidate inventory and monetize working capital in order to drive cash flow.Free cash flow (""FCF"") through the first six months of the year was $468 million, up from -$438 million in the year-earlier period. Halliburton cut capital expenditures to the bone; capital expenditures during the first six months of the year were $355 million, down from $855 million in the year-earlier period. This should give an indication where management thinks the business is going. Instead of investing for the future, Halliburton is battening down the hatches and trying to preserve as much capital as possible.The company has an enterprise value of $21 billion and trades at 6.5x EBITDA. I believe the valuation is appropriate given the headwinds faced by the oil industry and the likelihood that EBITDA could fall further. Its $9.8 billion debt load exceeds 3x, and could become cause for concern if the EBITDA and credit metrics continue to slide.HAL has spiked off its March lows. The stock could remain in a trading range until the economy reopens. I rate HAL a Hold."
4360880,40351,2020-07-26T17:30:54-04:00,"Halliburton reported a better-than-expected adjusted profit of $0.05 per share and free cash flows of $456 million, even as the rig count plunged in the US and international markets.The company will continue facing tough market conditions, but will get support from cost-cutting measures, CapEx reduction, and positive changes in working capital.Halliburton has made a strategic shift and will now concentrate on growing in the international markets.","Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) has reported a large drop in earnings, but the company managed to post an adjusted net profit as well as free cash flows despite facing a tough business environment. I think the persistent weakness in E&P activity might keep the Houston, Texas-based oilfield services provider's earnings subdued in the coming quarters. But the company could remain profitable and continue generating free cash flows. Furthermore, Halliburton's long-term outlook is looking exciting as the company shifts its focus from its North American heartland to the international markets, a strategic change that might open up high-margin growth opportunities.Image courtesy of PixabayHalliburton has recently released its financial results for the second quarter in which the company's revenues dropped by 37% on a year-over-year basis and 46% on a sequential basis to $3.196 billion. The drop was led by the 69% decline in revenues from North America on a year-over-year basis and a 57% drop on a sequential basis to $1.05 billion. The company's revenues from the international markets fell by 18% from last year and 17% from the first quarter to $2.15 billion in Q2-2020.Halliburton also booked $2.1 billion of pre-tax mostly non-cash impairment charges, primarily related to the reduction of the value of its pressure pumping equipment and real estate. The impairment charges pushed the company's net losses to $1.67 billion from a loss of $1.02 billion in Q1-2020. Excluding the one-time items, Halliburton reported a net profit of $46 million, or $0.05 per share, down from $0.31 per share in Q1-2020. The profit was still substantially better than the analysts' consensus estimate of a loss of $0.11 per share.Overall, I think Halliburton delivered a blowout performance in the second quarter, considering this was arguably one of the most difficult periods the oilfield services industry has ever faced. The industry experienced a steep decline in the number of rigs during the quarter. In my previous article on Halliburton's rival Schlumberger (SLB), I wrote that the US oil and gas rig count likely plunged by 60% and by more than 20% in the international markets in the second quarter. Halliburton revealed that the average US rig count fell by 50% in the US and by 22% in the international markets in Q2-2020 from Q1-2020 as oil producers reduced spending and curtailed drilling activity in response to the weakness in commodity prices. But with capital discipline and cost reductions, Halliburton has shown that it can remain profitable even during these tough market conditions.Additionally, Halliburton also generated strong levels of cash flows of $598 million, which were enough to fund the capital expenditures of $142 million, enabling the company to end the period with robust free cash flows of $456 million. In my previous articles (here and here), I wrote that Halliburton will realize a large working capital benefit this year which will give a boost to its cash flow profile, just like the company did in the prior downturns. The company booked a major working capital benefit in the first quarter which enabled Halliburton to end the period with excess cash.Halliburton continues to face a challenging outlook. The oil prices have risen in the last couple of months. The US oil prices have been hovering close to $40 a barrel since early-June, up from an average of $28 in Q2-2020. This increase has prompted US shale oil producers, including companies such as EOG Resources (EOG), Parsley Energy (PE), and ConocoPhillips (COP), to start restoring curtailed production.The oil companies, however, are currently focusing on bringing the shut-in wells back online and working through their inventory of drilled but uncompleted wells. With oil trading in the low-$40s a barrel range, substantially below last year's average of $57 per barrel, I expect oil producers to continue focusing on protecting the balance sheet, preserving cash flows, and conserving their assets for a better oil price environment. The shale drillers likely won't meaningfully increase capital expenditures. I think although the oilfield services market could be bottoming out and a recovery is possible in the coming months, we are rising from a very low base, and it could take a while for the business environment to increase back to pre-crisis levels. Therefore, Halliburton will likely continue facing tough market conditions and might struggle with weak earnings.Halliburton has also painted a grim outlook. The company is expecting continued weakness in North America. The drilling activity isn't in a free fall anymore and the company expects the rig count to find a bottom in Q3-2020, but a turnaround seems further out. The company expects oil and gas producers to reduce spending by 50% this year as compared to 2019. The international markets will fare better, with some markets, such as the Middle East, showing more resilience than others. The international drilling activity and expenditures will drop by mid-teens in 2020.However, I think the strong performance in the second quarter should give confidence to investors about Halliburton's ability to continue doing well in the future. The company's earnings will benefit from a big reduction in operating costs and other expenses. Halliburton announced its plan to achieve $1.3 billion of cost savings on an annualized basis, has already achieved 75% of the cost cuts, and expects to realize the remaining cost reductions by the end of the third quarter. It has reduced its annual CapEx budget to just $800 million which is having a positive impact on the company's earnings and has bolstered its ability to deliver free cash flows. I expect the company to continue realizing working capital benefits which will provide further support to the company's cash flows in the coming quarters, just as we saw in Q2-2020.Halliburton is also making a strategic shift by increasing its focus on the international markets, as opposed to North America which has traditionally been the company's biggest source of revenues. Moving forward, Halliburton will concentrate on its operations outside of North America to drive sales growth. The drilling activity and production profile of the North American shale drillers might remain low in the foreseeable future as shale oil producers sharpen their focus on generating profits and free cash flows instead of aggressively growing volumes. The international markets, on the other hand, might use this scenario as an opportunity to recapture market share from shale oil producers by growing production. Halliburton's new strategy will put the company in a good position to take advantage of these changing market dynamics.In my view, this is a smart move from Halliburton. Although on paper, it may seem like a fundamental shift for the company, and it some ways it is, Halliburton will still be playing to its strengths. Halliburton already maintains a vast geographic footprint that is second only to Schlumberger, the dominant player in the international markets. More importantly, Halliburton has been posting robust growth outside of North America for the last couple of years. In fact, the company has outperformed Schlumberger by reporting superior revenue growth from the international markets in nearly every quarter of the last three years. This trend might continue in the future as Halliburton zeroes in on international expansion.What's even better is that the international expansion has been driven partly by the adoption of Halliburton's latest technologies, such as the EarthStar ultra-deep resistivity service, which is a logging-while-drilling (LWD) technology, and Cerebro in-bit sensor package, which is a data capture system. The growth of these digital technologies can not only drive Halliburton's growth, but also transform the company's international business into a high-margin operation.For these reasons, I believe that Halliburton is facing a challenging outlook for now, but its long-term future is looking exciting. Halliburton stock has gained 77% in the last three months, largely due to the improvement in commodity prices, and has easily outperformed its peers (OIH) whose shares rose by 45% in the same period. The stock is looking expensive, currently trading 9.4x on an EV/EBITDA (forward) basis, above sector median of 7.7x. At this price, I would rate Halliburton as a hold, but the stock is certainly worth closely following."
4359496,33291,2020-07-20T22:15:52-04:00,"HAL stock had been absolutely decimated during the COVID-19 market selloff but we encouraged a buy near the lows.Q2 performance was mostly better than expected.Looks like it is hard to be bullish on names here, but becomes easier when you think long term.","Prepared by Stephanie, analyst at the team of BAD BEAT InvestingHalliburton's (HAL) stock had been absolutely decimated during the COVID-19 market selloff. Oil prices hit lows not seen in many decades, including unprecedented negative pricing on the front-month contract during the most recent quarter. We made a bold buy call and said that you should take a position in this stock when it was under $7. You now have a double. Our members have largely made the wise decision to back out their initial investment, plus a little profit, and are now playing with house money. We think you can do the same if you have not done so. If you are on the sidelines, we have good news. We think there is more upside in the medium term, and especially the long term, but in the short run, expect more volatility. We are seeing massive costs for the company in the short term. Despite trying to slash expenses, it is tough to keep going after a quarter that saw unprecedented oil price action. H2 2020 looks better, but we especially think 2021 will be good for the company and the stock.When economies around the world even return to 50% of what they were doing before the COVID-19 crisis, pent-up demand for oil will be unleashed. Thus, buying now is still a rather contrarian play at the time, but we are always on the lookout for names that are simply beaten down too far and look to scale in and profit from the reversal. Unless you see bankruptcy as likely, despite another few weeks to months of pain in oil, you can buy. While we find names left for dead and profit from the reversal, we are in a position of playing after a double. We think that it will take time, but another double is not out of the question, but wait for the next pullback. In this column, we check back in on performance.The company just reported its Q2 earnings, which saw a slight top-line miss and a bottom-line beat versus consensus estimates. In fairness, this was a really tough quarter, and we thought sales revenues could be down 50% here. This was because of the devastation in oil pricing continued through April and May, as demand had been eroded, and supply was still coming. This was truly a huge headwind. Only in recent weeks have things begun to improve, but there is still so much work to be done. The fact of the matter is that you need to understand that oil prices are so strongly linked to the performance of the company and the stock. As such, with wild moves in oil prices in recent weeks, the stock has moved with volatility. The uncertainty makes decisions like capex and labor planning all that much harder going forward. That said, Q2 saw pricing all over the place. Revenues, actually, were as expected down heavily from a year ago, declining 46% and registering at $3.2 billion in the quarter.As you can see, we saw a decline which we anticipated but was slightly better than we expected. At $3.2 billion, the company was slightly below consensus projections. We were more bearish, expecting $3 billion, so this result is welcomed in our opinion, but it is still disgusting. But where were the revenues generated from? We need to know the trends driving these issues. Overall, it was a huge decline from Q1.There was a divergence in operating segment performance relative to the sequential quarter, which saw the beginning of COVID-19. We saw lower revenues sequentially from Q1 2020 in the Completion and Production segment. Revenue here was $1.7 billion, a decrease of $1.3 billion or 44%. Yikes. These declines were driven by a decrease in pressure pumping activity globally, primarily in U.S. land and Latin America, coupled with lower artificial lift activity in U.S. land. This was partially offset by improved completion tool sales internationally. As you can see, the crimped demand from COVID-19 was evident. It spilled over into Drilling and Evaluation as well.Over in the Drilling and Evaluation segment, we saw a lower decline from the sequential quarter. Revenue came in at $1.5 billion which was down 27% versus Q1 2020, better than we expected at $1.3 billion here. It is worth pointing out that cost controls led to operating income decreasing $90 million, a 41% drop from the sequential quarter. Driving this was the simple fact that there was a global reduction in drilling-related services and lower software sales internationally.As we look to the rest of 2020, we are mostly interested in regional activity, and given the global nature of COVID-19, it stands to reason that we will see a divergence in regional activity in the next few quarters. International expansion ceased, which up until this Q2 was helping to offset the declines in North America. North America revenue was $1,0 billion, a 57% decrease from the sequential quarter actually. The action is still promising internationally, and we think it will rebound later this year. The company is successfully executing its strategy of controlling what expenses it can control and managing the business to perform well in any market conditions. International revenue was $2.1 billion, a 17% decrease from Q1. All regions in the international space saw revenue declines.Expenses have been well managed, but again, management has stated previously that it is committed to further cuts. While the company cannot control pricing, it can control expenses to a large degree. On a GAAP basis, things were nasty. Halliburton recognized $2.1 billion of pre-tax impairments and other charges to further adjust its cost structure to current market conditions. These charges consisted primarily of non-cash asset impairments, mainly associated with pressure pumping equipment and real estate, as well as inventory write-offs, severance, and other costs.This expense control ability on an adjusted basis was more telling. Adjusted operating income was $236 million. Despite the market headwinds, the margin performance was decent, especially in the Completion and Production, but also in the Drilling and Evaluation division. There was $456 million of positive free cash flow generated this quarter reflecting aggressive cost reduction actions. Despite missing the top line, the earnings per share were ahead of projections, though down from last year.Adjusted net income was $46 million, or $0.05 per diluted share. This compares to adjusted net income for Q1 2020, excluding impairments and other charges and a loss on the early extinguishment of debt, of $270 million, or $0.31 per diluted share.Looks like it is hard to be bullish on names here, but becomes easier when you think long term. COVID-19 has been a global headwind, but it is temporary. Oil demand will return. Economic activity will resume. Driving will resume. Travel will return. Factories and construction will resume. It is not going to be years of this but maybe a few quarters. Halliburton continues to control costs. We think foreseeing earnings is difficult here. Halliburton is reducing overhead and other costs by approximately $1 billion, and is lowering capital expenditures. We liked seeing positive free cash flow in an incredibly difficult quarter. Q3 is off to a much better start with oil prices having improved. While we need more improvement, it is not as ugly as where we were in Q2. We think that as things improve, the stock will slowly head back to the high-teens and eventually retake $20.

4359450,61381,2020-07-20T15:41:13-04:00,Halliburton reported a loss per share of $1.91 for 2Q '20 on $3.196 billion in revenues compared to $5.930 billion in the same quarter last year.The annual dividend payment is down to $0.18 or 1.38% per share.I recommend HAL as a hold.,"Source: UpstreamonlineThe Houston-based Halliburton (HAL) released its second-quarter results on July 20, 2020. It was a positive surprise for the market.Halliburton, which makes most of its revenue in North America, was the first oilfield service business to release second-quarter results. Baker Hughes (NYSE:BKR) will release on July 22, and Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB), probably, on Friday this week.The investment thesis has not changed from the prior quarter. HAL is an ""oil service"" and should be considered at a secondary level in this global oil paradigm even if the valuation could be regarded as attractive for a long-term investment perspective. Investors should focus more on a regular oil investment such as Exxon Mobil (XOM) or Shell (RDS.A, RDS.B).Therefore, I recommend to reduce your HAL long position slightly and, above all, trade short term about half or more of your HAL holding to take advantage of the oil volatility that will dominate the sector.Data by YCharts(Source: HAL filings and Morningstar)1 - Revenues of $3.196 billion in 2Q'20.Halliburton reported a loss per share of $1.91 for 2Q '20 on $3.196 billion in revenues compared to $5.930 billion in the same quarter last year. Revenues for 2Q '20 were down 36.5% sequentially.The adjusted net income was $46 million or $0.05 per diluted share, excluding impairments and other charges. Jeff Miller, Chairman, President, and CEO said in the press release:Below is the revenue repartition per region.If we compare to the first quarter of 2020, we can see that most of the revenues lost come from the North America segment.Halliburton's business model relies on two distinct segments:North American revenues plunged 68.4% year over year to $1.049 billion. Though, revenues from Halliburton's international operations dropped 17.5% from the year-ago period to $2.147 billion primarily due to the lower value of its fracking tools and real estate.Net income reported for the second quarter of 2020 came in at a loss of $1,676 million, well below the gain of $75 million for the same period last year.The company indicated $2.147 billion in non-cash impairment charges mostly associated with lower demand from North American customers suffering from lower oil prices.In short, HAL delivered better-than-expected second-quarter earnings and the market like it.However, despite better-than-expected results, the drop in business cannot be ignored.The decline has been brutal and was primarily due:One analyst at Raymond James wrote:2 - Generic Free Cash Flow jumped to $456 million in 2Q'20Free cash flow yearly is $1,821 million (""ttm""), with free cash flow at $456 million in 2Q '20.The annual dividend payment is down to $0.18 per share or a payout of $158 million annually. On May 26, 2020, the company announced:The dividend yield is now down to 1.38%.3 - Net Debt is now $8.02 billion in 2Q'20, staying constant.Net debt is $8.02 billion, and net interest expense for the second quarter of 2020 was $124 million. I still consider the debt load too high, and the company is not reducing it as promised.Halliburton surprised the market with its second-quarter results, which were better-than-expected. However, the oilfield services provider recorded a $2.147 billion non-cash impairment charge due to sinking demand from North American customers suffering from lower oil prices.However, we can't be satisfied with such a dire situation. Halliburton surprised investors by slashing costs more than anticipated. Still, the fact is that the company's primary business is going through an unprecedented crisis that will have long-lasting effects on oilfields services.Thus, I am not convinced the worst is behind, and we should be cautious not to get over-excited and use these up days to take some profit off the table. The path of recovery has not even begun.Technical Analysis (short term)HAL was forming a descending triangle pattern until last week, with line resistance at $13 and line support at $11.80. HAL results were better-than-expected and could trigger a resistance breakout today (need confirmation).In this case, HAL could eventually reach the range of $15-16, where it would be reasonable to sell about 25% of your position and wait for a retracement at $13, which is now the new support.However, the oilfield services business is fragile and mostly dependent on the price of oil. Any weakness below $40 will trigger some selling pressure again.Author's note: If you find value in this article and would like to encourage such continued efforts, please click the ""Like"" button below as a vote of support.

4357101,38631,2020-07-06T10:40:40-04:00,"Halliburton has enjoyed an impressive rally off its bottom in March.While the price of oil has rallied to a 4-month high, the recovery of shale oil production is not expected until the second half of next year.Halliburton has limited upside and significant downside risk in the short run.","About three months ago, I wrote an article in which I stated that Halliburton (HAL) had plunged to the extreme and thus it would greatly reward investors if the pandemic did not last longer than expected. Since my article, the stock has rallied 55% and hence the big question is what investors should do at the current stock price.The steep rally of Halliburton has been fueled by the rally of the price of oil, which has climbed to a 4-month high. The coronavirus crisis has caused a slump in the demand for jet fuel and gasoline and thus the global demand for oil products is on track for a record slump this year. However, the pandemic is expected to subside the latest from next year. As a result, the demand for oil products is likely to recover strongly from next year.The International Energy Agency (""IEA"") agrees on this view, as it recently issued a markedly positive outlook for the energy market. According to the report, the global demand for oil products is expected to surge at the fastest pace in history next year, by 5.7 million barrels per day. If this forecast materializes, the demand for oil products next year will be only 2.4 million barrels per day lower (2.4%) than it was last year, before the onset of the pandemic.However, the recovery of U.S. shale oil production is expected to be slow. The active U.S. rig count has decreased for 13 consecutive weeks at a fast pace and thus it has slumped 71% over last year, to an 11-year low level. Even worse, according to the CEO of Precision Drilling (PDS), a major onshore oilfield services provider, shale oil producers will not return to production mode until the second half of next year even if the economy continues to recover. This slow recovery will provide a strong headwind to the business of Halliburton for at least the next two years.Analysts seem to agree on this outlook. They expect Halliburton to incur losses this and next year and earn only $0.19 per share in 2022 and $0.28 per share in 2023. Even in 2024, Halliburton is expected to post earnings per share of only $0.78, much lower than the earnings per share of $1.24 reported last year. This means that Halliburton is currently trading at 16.0 times its expected earnings in 2024. Moreover, the stock has traded at an average price-to-earnings ratio of 16.2 over the last decade. It is thus safe to conclude that the fair earnings multiple of the stock is around this value. Therefore, it is evident that the market has already priced most of the growth expected from Halliburton over the next four years in its current stock price.It is also important to note that Halliburton was struggling even before the pandemic. Since the previous downturn of the energy sector, which was caused by the collapse of the oil price from $100 in mid-2014 to $26 in 2016, oil producers have become remarkably conservative in their budgets and thus they have exerted a strong headwind to the oilfield service providers. In addition, thanks to technological advances in the production of oil, oil producers are now able to extract more oil from a given number of wells and thus Halliburton generates lower revenues at a given rate of production.This helps explain its lackluster performance in recent years. To provide a perspective, the U.S. oil production and the global oil production kept posting new all-time highs every year between 2014 and 2019 but the adjusted earnings per share of Halliburton slumped 69% during that period, from $4.03 to $1.24.Halliburton is highly vulnerable to downturns, such as the ongoing coronavirus crisis. This is not surprising, as the energy sector is infamous for its high cyclicality, but investors should note that Halliburton is more sensitive to downturns than the average energy company.Due to its high vulnerability, Halliburton is not a buy-and-hold stock. To be sure, the stock has shed 50% over the last decade and 70% over the last five years. In other words, not only did its shareholders miss the entire 11-year bull market between 2009 and 2020, the longest bull market in history, but they also incurred devastating losses.On the bright side, Halliburton is an ideal stock for those who want to benefit from the exaggerations of the oil price during downturns. Those who believed that the collapse of the oil price to its 18-year lows in March was an exaggeration and bought Halliburton near its bottom have enjoyed an approximate 200% rally in less than four months.On the other hand, due to its impressive rally, the stock of Halliburton has already priced the recovery of the company in the next 3-4 years. As a result, the stock has limited upside potential, at least in the short run. Moreover, if the pandemic deteriorates, the stock of Halliburton will probably slump once again, to much more attractive levels. To cut a long story short, Halliburton seems to have limited upside and significant downside risk right now, particularly given that the pandemic has become more aggressive lately. Therefore, those who want to profit from the dramatic swings of the stock should probably take their profits and remain on the sidelines until another slump of the stock sends it to bargain territory.Halliburton plunged to bargain territory at the peak of the coronavirus crisis, in March, but the impressive rally of the stock has rendered it fairly valued, as the stock is currently trading at 16.0 times its expected earnings in 2024. Halliburton is not a buy-and-hold stock and hence investors should take their profits and wait for a significant correction, which may be caused by another wave of the pandemic."

The dip in oil prices has fueled an unprecedented decline in drilling activity, with the US oil producers significantly slashing capital expenditures and the rig count falling to historical lows. Halliburton posted decent results for Q1-2020 but its earnings will likely come under a lot of pressure from Q2-2020. In my view, the Houston, Texas-based oilfield services provider has the financial muscle to stand firm in this difficult period. The good thing, however, is that we're now starting to see some early signs of a recovery that have improved Halliburton's long-term outlook.Image courtesy of PixabayThe novel coronavirus continues to spread in several countries around the world. At the time of this writing, there were 10.2 million COVID-19 cases in the world, with over 500,000 deaths. The rapid spread of the pandemic has gravely affected the global GDP growth. The International Monetary Fund now expects the global economy to contract by 4.9% this year. This downturn will undoubtedly hurt business performance in all the major sectors, triggering job losses, hurting demand, and pushing the consumption of goods and services lower.The tough business environment has already caught up with the oilfield services industry which is seeing a sharp drop in demand for fracking services. The demand shock has been so severe that it has forced the industry titans Halliburton and Schlumberger (SLB) to make tough decisions ranging from eliminating thousands of jobs to slashing dividends to making wholesale cuts to capital expenditures. These drastic actions indicate that the oilfield service providers are not expecting a rejuvenation of demand in the present scenario.As a reminder, Halliburton posted robust results for Q1-2020, but it was also seeing signs of weakness. The company reported a 35% increase in adjusted profits to $0.31 per share and generated free cash flows of $12 million, up from a cash flow deficit of $481 million in Q1-2019. But it also posted a 25% drop in revenues from the crucial North American market to $2.46 billion. The company typically gets most of its revenues and earnings from North America, where it is the leading provider of fracking services. But it reported a reduction in drilling activity and pricing levels in the North American land market, which pushed its revenues lower. The business environment worsened in the second quarter, setting the stage for a decline in overall revenues and earnings.The price of the US benchmark WTI crude tumbled to historical lows in the second quarter. The spot price of WTI averaged around $27 per barrel in Q2-2020, significantly below the Q1-2020 average of $46 per barrel. The tough business environment forced shale oil and gas producers to significantly cut capital expenditure to align their cash flows with the prevailing market conditions. The US oil producers have announced budget cuts of more than $42 billion, with each company reducing its capital program by an average of 37%.Image: CXO Investor Presentation, June 2020.The capital cuts have been accompanied by an unprecedented decline in drilling activity. The US land rig count tumbled to 254 in the week to June 26 from this year's peak of 771 rigs in early-March, according to data from Baker Hughes (BKR). The total oil and gas rig count has fallen to an all-time low of 265 rigs. Virtually all oil producers have removed rigs, while some companies like Occidental Petroleum (OXY), Apache Corp. (APA) and Marathon Oil (MRO) have cut their US onshore rig count to zero units. Some of the biggest players of the industry, including Exxon Mobil (XOM), Chevron (CVX), EOG Resources (EOG), Continental Resources (CLR), and Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD), have removed dozens of rigs from all major US shale oil plays, particularly the Permian Basin, Eagle Ford, and Bakken regions which together accounted for a majority of US oil production.The cut in capital expenditure and the subsequent decline in drilling activity will push Halliburton's revenues and earnings lower in Q2-2020 from Q1-2020. The company might also burn cash flows. But in my view, Halliburton can stand firm in this challenging period. The company doesn't have the strongest balance sheet, with a total debt of $9.83 billion which translates into a lofty debt-to-equity ratio of 144% - the highest among its peers Schlumberger, Baker Hughes, National Oilwell Varco (NOV), and TechnipFMC (FTI). But an above-average debt load isn't a major red flag since the company has a manageable debt maturity profile, with just around $1.3 billion of debt coming due through 2024. Besides, Halliburton also has robust liquidity of $5 billion, which includes $1.4 billion of cash reserves and funds available under the revolving credit facility. That should help meet any short-term funding needs.Furthermore, Halliburton has taken several steps which should help the company greatly in conserving cash flows. It slashed this year's capital budget by 48% to $800 million from $1.53 billion in 2019. It reduced dividends by 75% which can result in cash savings of $474 million on an annualized basis, as per my estimate. It is targeting $1 billion in cost savings by clamping down on overheads, payroll, operational, and other costs. Although Halliburton might face a cash flow deficit this year (ahead of the working cap. changes), due to the cost-cutting measures, it might not face a large deficit. I also expect Halliburton to realize a large working capital benefit in 2020, given this is currently one of management's top priorities, which might help plug a cash-flow deficit.The great thing, however, is that now we are beginning to see light at the end of this tunnel. The US oil price has climbed from around $20 a barrel in early-May to $40 at the time of this writing. The gains appear to be on solid footing since they've come on the back of the improvement in the market's supply and demand situation. The commodity has received support from a decrease in supplies from OPEC, its allies including Russia, and other non-OPEC oil-producing countries such as the US and Canada. The US oil production has fallen from 13 million bpd in early-2020 to 11 million bpd by mid-June, as per the US Energy Information Administration's estimates. The global oil demand, on the other hand, has started to recover as major economies, including China and India, lift lockdowns and ease travel restrictions. In the US, gasoline demand has been steadily rising after touching April lows, albeit at a slower-than-expected pace. The markets remain jittery and the refiners are exercising caution as the coronavirus ravages on but oil demand is still heading in the right direction.This improvement in oil prices has given confidence to some of the low-cost oil producers who had curtailed output and removed rigs in April and May, and have started resuming drilling activity and putting some of those rigs back to work. EOG Resources and Parsley Energy (PE), for instance, who substantially cut production in Q2-2020 intend to ramp up output from the second half of the year. Continental Resources, which reduced output by 70% in May, is also easing the rate of curtailment and restoring production.I think these are all early signs of a turnaround and only the lowest cost producers whose wells can generate decent returns and free cash flows at $40 oil have started resuming production. We may not witness a major industry-wide revival in the short term. But in the upcoming quarters, as global oil prices climb, supply remains low, and demand continues to rise, more oil and gas producers will be inclined to increase drilling activity. At some point, perhaps in 2021-22, the E&P companies will start increasing capital expenditures and we'll start seeing a new reinvestment cycle. That's going to drive Halliburton's turnaround.Halliburton stock has surged by more than 90% in the last three months, largely due to the improvement in commodity prices, easily outperforming its peers (OIH) whose shares rose by 45% in the same period. The stock is now looking expensive, currently trading 11.04x on an EV/EBITDA (forward) basis, above sector median of 7.8x, as per data from Seeking Alpha Essential. Its peer Schlumberger is cheaper, currently trading 10.5x EV/EBITDA (forward) multiple. At this price, I'd rate Halliburton as a hold."
4342464,31441,2020-05-03T09:54:22-04:00,"Falling E&P have hurt HAL's revenue and EBITDA.Cost cuts have helped keep EBITDA from free falling. HAL's solid balance sheet and cost containment efforts could be a competitive advantage.Once the economy reopens, oil markets should bound. HAL is poised for a rebound. Buy the stock.","Source: MarketwatchI have been known as a Halliburton (HAL) bear over the years. My thesis was that the economy would eventually falter, taking down cyclical names like Halliburton. The coronavirus has caused a shutdown of the economy, and may have exposed a weakness that had always been there. Oil prices have fallen below $30 and HAL is off over 60% Y/Y. The company reported Q1 revenue of $5.04 billion, down 3% sequentially. I just went long. I explain below.OPEC supply cuts have buoyed oil prices for years. I have long-suspected the lack of demand for oil could hurt oil markets and E&P. Budget exhaustion caused several of Halliburton's clients to reduce E&P in the second half of 2019. The knock-on effects of the coronavirus have led to a lack of demand for oil, making it difficult for shale oil plays to make money. On the earnings call, Halliburton management described the free fall in North America activity:Revenue from North America actually rose in the low-single-digit percentage range Q/Q. Each of the other segments experienced a decline in revenue.North America revenue rose 5% Q/Q, but fell 25% Y/Y. The region has been characterized by a decline in pricing power, primarily associated with pressure pumping services, well construction and the sale of completion tools. Halliburton incurred $1.1 billion in restructuring charges during the quarter; about $780 million was attributed to Completion and Production and another $277 million was attributable to Drilling and Evaluation. The knock-on effects of the pandemic may not have been fully realized. There could be more declines in North America E&P at least for the first half of Q2.Revenue from international markets was $2.6 billion, down 10% Q/Q. E&P declined across various markets. Management expects operators to look for ways to cut costs. The company expects international activity to continue to slow down through the end of 2020. Supply cuts from Russia, Saudi Arabia and certain U.S. producers should help buoy oil prices. Ultimately, global demand for oil needs to kick in. E&P will likely be determined by demand for oil and whether oil producers believe such demand is sustainable.The big three oil services firms have proven the ability to rapidly cut costs to adjust to declining E&P. Halliburton is evaluating ways to lower its cost of delivery in the U.S. The downturn has accelerated the company's adoption of digital technologies. Management will also cut its workforce by 1,500 in Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana and Colorado.In Q1, the company reported $850 million in EBITDA, down 7% sequentially. Operating costs of $4.2 billion fell 2% sequentially; they did not fall as much as revenue, which caused EBITDA to decline. EBITDA margin was 17%, down about 100 basis points versus Q4. Of the big three oil services firms, Halliburton ranks behind Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB), which delivered a Q1 EBITDA margin of about 18%. I expect E&P to remain in the doldrums for the next few months, which could prompt more cost cuts in Q2.A downturn in oil markets makes having a strong balance sheet a competitive advantage. Halliburton has cash and equivalents of $1.4 billion. Its working capital was nearly $6.0 billion. Free cash flow (""FCF"") during the quarter was $60 million versus an outflow of $455 million in the year earlier period. One of the biggest variances was a decline in capital expenditures from $437 million in Q1 2019 to $213 million in the most-recent quarter. I expect management to make even deeper cuts to capital expenditures going forward.Its $9.8 billion debt load was 2.7x last 12 months' (""LTM"") EBITDA. Halliburton may need to squirrel away capital to help pare debt to ensure its credit metrics do not deteriorate. We do not know if the current decline in the economy is a one-off event or a secular trend. Paring debt could become a priority for Halliburton.HAL has an enterprise value of $17.0 billion or 5.6 LTM EBITDA. This is extremely low by historical standards and reflects the free fall in oil markets. Once global economies reopen, demand for oil will increase. Supply cuts combined with rising demand will likely drive oil prices and E&P higher. It could be wise to buy into the stock before animal spirits take hold and drive HAL much higher.Buy HAL on a rebound in oil markets."
4340283,40351,2020-04-27T15:25:39-04:00,"Halliburton has reported a surge in profits and free cash flows for 1Q20 but has warned it is entering the most severe downturn ""in a generation.""Halliburton's 50% reduction in CapEx, $1Bn of cost cuts, and a potential benefit from effectively managing working capital will support cash flows.Halliburton has brought its total debt down to $9.8Bn from well over $10Bn in previous years, improved debt maturity profile, and has $5Bn of liquidity.","Last year was a tough one for Halliburton (HAL), the leading fracking services provider in the US, and things will get a whole lot worse in 2020. The plunge in oil prices and the resulting drop in drilling activity will push the company's earnings lower. Although Halliburton is facing a grim outlook, there are a few bright spots as well.Halliburton's financial health is in decent shape and the company can withstand this turmoil. Moreover, I believe the company can also harvest significant cash by effectively managing working capital. The excess cash can help support dividends. Its balance sheet is looking much better now as compared to the last few years, thanks to the successful debt reduction efforts.Image courtesy of PixabayLast year, Halliburton reported a 35% drop in profits (adjusted) to $1.24 per share as oil and gas producers in North America, from where the company gets a majority of its revenues and earnings, reduced spending. The company initially expected continued weakness in North America in 2020 as shale drillers kept a tight lid on capital expenditures. The impact of weakness at home was going to get partially offset by the international markets where oil producers were ramping up exploration and production work. But now, following the historic drop in oil prices, Halliburton CEO Jeff Miller said that the company is entering what could be the most severe downturn ""in a generation.""Halliburton has recently reported solid first-quarter results which also showed a glimpse of what's about to come. The company has reported a net loss of $1 billion, or $1.16 per share, as opposed to a net profit of $152 million, or $0.17 per share, in the first quarter of 2019. The loss came after the company reduced the value of its assets, particularly the pressure pumping equipment, by $1.1 billion in light of the current market conditions. Excluding one-off items, the company's adjusted profits increased by almost 35% to $0.31 per share. The company also generated free cash flows of $12 million, as opposed to a cash flow deficit of $481 million seen in the corresponding period last year.But Halliburton's total revenues declined by 12.2% to $5.04 billion, with the drop being led by North America where revenues fell by 25% to $2.46 billion. This decrease was attributed to the reduction in activity and pricing levels in the North American land market. Halliburton has warned that the business environment is going to get worse in the future, which will likely push the company's earnings lower.I think the current downturn, as Miller predicted, could turn out to be one of the worst we've ever witnessed. The oil prices have been highly volatile and weak, with WTI crude falling into the negative territory for the first time from more than $60 a barrel at the start of the year and then recovering to $17 at the time of this writing, this has forced all shale oil producers to aggressively cut spending and reduce drilling activity. Even the biggest and the most well-established energy companies in the US - Exxon Mobil (XOM), Chevron (CVX), and ConocoPhillips (COP) - have made wholesale budget cuts of 20% to 35%.The drilling activity in North America is in free fall, as evident from the sharp decrease seen in the US rig count. 378 rigs were operating in the US at the end of last week, Halliburton's rival Baker Hughes (BKR) revealed in its closely followed report, which depicts a drop of almost 50% since January. We haven't seen a decrease in activity of this magnitude, in a span of just a couple of months, in recent past, even though the rig count figure was already low at the start of the year and the oilfield service providers were facing pricing pressure from their clients. What also sets the current downturn apart is that there has been an across the board decline in rig count in all major basins, including the prolific Permian Basin which is the lowest cost US shale play. In the last week, oil and gas producers removed a total of 37 rigs from the Permian Basin, according to Baker Hughes. In other basins where production costs are relatively higher, such as the Bakken formation, the oil producers could be forced to shut-in production (a large chunk of Bakken oil production has reportedly gone offline as operators shut nearly 30% of North Dakota's wells).Drilling activity in the international markets will also decline as the national oil companies shift their focus from growing volumes to preserving financial health. Halliburton's bigger rival Schlumberger (SLB), which holds a dominating position in the international markets, also recently talked about weakness in some key regions, such as China, Malaysia, Iraq, Nigeria, and Mozambique. Several national oil companies will also slow down drilling to comply with the OPEC+ agreement.Halliburton is also focusing on drastically reducing costs and conserving cash flows, which will enable the company to navigate through this crisis. The company is reducing CapEx by 48% to $800 million in 2020 from $1.53 billion in 2019. The company will also reduce its overhead and other costs by $1 billion by closing and consolidating facilities, reducing and streamlining workers, eliminating all salary increases and reducing compensation paid to executives, slashing technology budget by 25%, removing a layer of management in North America, and taking other measures.The reduction in drilling activity and increase in pricing pressure from the exploration and production companies will likely push Halliburton's cash flow from operations substantially lower from $2.6 billion in 2019 (ahead of changes in working capital) but its cost-cutting measures will protect the operating cash flows. Moreover, by cutting CapEx, the company will lower its cash outflows which will protect its free cash flows (cash flow from operations minus CapEx).I also expect Halliburton to realize a large working capital benefit this year which will give a boost to the company's cash flow profile. The company has set improving working capital, including all of its three primary components (accounts receivable, accounts payable, and inventory), as one of its top priorities for the current year. We have previously seen how Halliburton harvests significant cash by managing working capital during downturns. In 2016, for instance, when Halliburton made a similar promise, it reported a $1.2 billion net improvement in working capital by the year-end. I think the company will deliver a similar performance in 2020 as well. This cash can help pay the dividends of around $630 million (annualized) and any excess funds can be used to shore up the financial health.I believe Halliburton is entering 2020 with a better financial footing, marked by lower levels of debt as compared to the previous years. The company has managed to bring its debt down to $9.83 billion at the end of Q1-2020 from a peak of more than $15.3 billion at the end of 2015 and $10.3 billion at the end of last year. The company's debt-to-equity ratio still stands at a lofty 123% but has gradually moved lower from more than 140% at YE-2019. In Q1-2020, the company executed a debt issuance and a tender offer which enabled it to reduce near-term (2023, 2025) maturities by $1.5 billion. Now, Halliburton has just $1.3 billion coming due through 2024 and ample time to devise a repayment or refinancing strategy. Although the company still has to find ways to bring its leverage lower, in my view, the company's reduced debt levels and a favorable debt maturity profile have put it in a better position to withstand the turmoil.Halliburton has also amassed robust liquidity of $5 billion, which includes $1.4 billion of cash reserves and funds available under the revolving credit facility. If the company were to face a cash flow shortfall, then it can use this liquidity to meet its funding requirements. But I expect Halliburton to either preserve or further grow its liquidity as it gets a cash infusion by effectively managing the working capital.Shares of Halliburton have fallen by 63.8% this year, in-line with the broader oilfield services industry (OIH) which tumbled by 63.6% in the same period. I think Halliburton appears well-positioned to weather the storm, particularly after the latest update. But the worst is yet to come for Halliburton as well as the oilfield services industry whose earnings and cash flows will come under pressure in the coming quarters as we head deeper into the downturn. Therefore, Halliburton stock will likely remain subdued. I suggest investors should stay cautious and avoid Halliburton stock for now."
4339448,104714,2020-04-23T11:58:19-04:00,"Halliburton's management the energy market in North America to deteriorate sharply in Q2 2020.A relatively steady performance in international markets will keep the company buoyant in 2H 2020.Although a reduction in capex and operating costs can improve free cash flow, a high debt-to-equity ratio can become a concern.Its quarterly dividend payment may come into question if thebalance sheet comes under further stress.","As the crude oil price crashes and upstream companies' capex budget freezes, the short-term prospect for Halliburton (HAL) looks underwhelming. Despite the surmounting challenges, the company produced a resilient performance in North America in Q1, which outperformed its larger peer Schlumberger (SLB). Its focus is on cutting costs significantly and freeing up the balance sheet from near-term debt repayment obligations. It also plans to compensate some of its losses in North America with a steady show in some of its international operations.So, Halliburton, by lowering capex, should generate positive FCF, which would become necessary to deleverage the balance sheet. Its balance sheet is more leveraged than SLB, which can spell concerns in the current scenario. I think it is quite likely that the company's Q2 performance will deteriorate as the severity of the North American downturn reflects on its results. Based on its earnings capacity and quality, Halliburton will survive the downturn. Once the trough is over, its top line and margin should improve sharply from their current level. But in the short-term, investors should refrain from making new investments.Since the pandemic arrived, the energy market has seen a disjoint as demand took a free fall, while supply far exceeded total demand. According to some estimates, crude oil demand can fall by 30% in 2020. Of late, OPEC, Russia, and other key energy producers have made a renewed effort to balance the gap by committing to reduce supply. However, it is less than sufficient. The crude oil price has continued to plummet. Such is the gravity of the situation that it has declined by more than 70% year-to-date. The reality even took Halliburton's management by surprise, as they had to revise down their earlier outlook. Even in an optimistic case, the management now expects the COV-19 effect to follow through 2020.The effect has had a more dramatic impact in North America than in international markets. According to HAL's estimates, their North American upstream customers have slashed the 2020 E&P budget by 50%. The precipitation rate has accelerated in the past month, as evidenced by a 24% fall in the rig count in the region. However, it does not concede the price has fallen below the cash breakeven level at the wellhead, although expects pricing to remain depressed throughout the year, which can adversely impact margin in all the U.S. Basins. Consequently, the company retired 22% of the available fracturing horsepower by the end of 2019, which will allow it to maintain the balance between equipment supply and the anticipated demand in 2020. I think the service industry can augment the working fleets, when necessary, by cannibalizing idle equipment for parts and new sideline pumps. You can read more about its strategies in my previous article here.The international markets were relatively insulated from the COVID-19 effect in Q1, although this can change in Q2. As more and more countries quarantine their population, operational disruptions and supply chain issues will evidently arise. On top of that, some of HAL's international customers started reducing capex and deferring exploration and appraisal activity. They are also looking to reduce costs in some of the significant projects. The company expects international capex to fall by 10% in 2020 compared to the previous year. Geographically, the OPEC countries in the Middle East will be least affected because of their low breakeven production cost. Offshore Africa and Latin America, however, may see double-digit declines.As upstream capex moves south, Halliburton is keen to see pricing improve. It makes pricing decisions based on its returns expectations. The company sees its oilfield equipment pricing at historic lows given the oversupply in the industry. In response to the downturn, it restructured its North America organization, rationalized facilities, completed the previous cost reductions, and started leveraging fixed costs through the service delivery improvement. At the international level, pricing was beginning to improve before the current crisis hit the market. To reduce capital outlay and improve margin, it will focus on technology-centric solutions like integrated completions offering and the iCruise rotary steerable system.Let us discuss the company's cost out measure in detail. In Q4, it started a $300 million annualized cost savings and service delivery improvement strategy through personnel reductions and real estate rationalization. It aims to reduce annualized overhead costs by another $1 billion. In that regard, it looks to reduce capex by $800 million. On top of the restructuring efforts, it will redesign the fracturing services process to lower unit costs and improve margins. It will also cut its technology budget by 20% in 2020. The company has suspended salary hikes for the employees for the year. It will look for additional headcount reductions in the rest of the year. However, some of these initiatives may result in additional one-time costs of up to $200 million.In Q1 2020, HAL recognized $1.1 billion (pre-tax) impairments charges, primarily related to pressure pumping equipment and severance and other costs. Also, following the deteriorated business outlook, it recorded a $310 million expense related to deferred tax assets. As a result of these charges, it recorded a $1.07 loss per share in Q1 2020. In comparison, it recorded $1.88 loss per share in Q4 2019. Investors may note that the company recognized $2.2 billion of impairments charges (pre-tax) associated with pressure pumping and legacy drilling equipment in Q4.SourceThe key U.S. unconventional Basins, on average, the U.S. saw a 4.5% rise in tight oil production despite a 41% fall in the rig count. According to the EIA's Drilling Productivity Report, however, the U.S. shale oil production is due for a slowdown (4.6% decline, on average) by May 2020.The sharp fall in U.S. liquid fuel demand is primarily owing to a reduction in personal travel in the summer driving season. However, it is unlikely that the medium-to-long-term energy growth in energy will melt away by the current crisis. In its Annual Energy Outlook, the EIA expects the fossil fuel energy production will rise by 2050, as exhibited in the graph above. Natural gas is expected to account for the majority of the growth. Leading oilfield services companies like Halliburton will benefit from higher production, even if the mix changes in the coming years.The Q1 performance threw some surprising figures for Halliburton. Most notable was its performance in North America. Amidst the slowdown scare all around, the region saw revenues increasing by 5.4% sequentially. While the onshore business led to increased artificial lift activity and specialty chemical sales, the offshore side saw higher stimulation activity in the Gulf of Mexico, which resulted in the revenue jump. It could not escape the industry-level decline in the onshore activity, which reflected in lower sales of pressure pumping, well construction, and completion tool sales.Latin America was weakest (13.7% sequential decline) among the geographies due to a decline in stimulation and fluids activity. In the Middle East/Asia, although the quarter-over-quarter performance was poor, the region witnessed year-over-year revenue rise as various product line sales increased in the United Arab Emirates, Indonesia, and Malaysia.From Q4 2019 to Q1 2020, Halliburton's Drilling and Evaluation (or D&E) segment revenues decreased by 2.7%, while the segment operating margin remained unchanged. Although pricing was weak in North America during the quarter, higher demand for drilling-related services in the North Sea and Asia offset the fall.The Completion and Production (C&P) division, on the other hand, saw revenue fall (3.1% down) in Q1 compared to the previous quarter. The segment operating margin, too, deteriorated by 110 basis points in Q1 as pressure pumping activity and reduced completion tool sales kept the margin depressed.Halliburton pays a quarterly dividend of $0.18 quarterly per share, which amounts to a 9.4% dividend yield. In comparison, Schlumberger (SLB) has recently lowered its dividend by 75%, following which the forward dividend yield now stands at 3.4%.HAL's free cash flow (or FCF) turned positive in Q1 2020 compared to a negative CFO a year ago. In the past year, cash flow from operations (or CFO) turned positive, despite the revenue fall in Q1 2020. Improvement in working capital led to the CFO rise. A higher CFO and lower capex resulted in the remarkable turnaround in FCF in Q1 2020. In FY2020, HAL expects to reduce capex by 47% from FY2019 to ~$800 million. I think lower capex will mitigate much of the pressure on CFO, leading to a steady FCF in FY2020.HAL’s debt-to-equity is 1.4x, which is higher than Schlumberger's (SLB) (1.0x), TecnipFMC’s (FTI) (0.57x ), and Baker Hughes’s (BKR) (0.19x). However, it repaid $500 million in debt during Q1 and extended $1.0 billion of its debt maturity up to 2030.So, Halliburton's high leverage may come in the way of its future dividend payment. The company does not intend to increase leverage to maintain the dividend. As we have seen Schlumberger reducing its dividend recently, HAL, too, may consider a similar approach to reduce the strain on its cash flow and balance sheet.Halliburton is currently trading at an EV-to-adjusted EBITDA multiple of 5.1x. Based on sell-side analysts' EBITDA estimates, the forward EV/EBITDA multiple is 7.6x. Between FY2015 and now, the stock's average EV/EBITDA multiple was 10.1x. So, it is currently trading at a discount to its past average.Halliburton's forward EV-to-EBITDA multiple expansion versus the adjusted trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA is steeper than peers, which typically results in a lower EV/EBITDA multiple compared to peers. The stock's EV/EBITDA multiple is lower than its peers' (SLB, BHGE, and FTI) average of 5.4x. I have used estimates provided by Seeking Alpha in this analysis.SourceAccording to data provided by Seeking Alpha, 12 sell-side analysts rated HAL a ""buy"" in April 2020 (includes ""Very bullish""), while 17 recommended a ""hold."" Only one recommended a ""sell (includes ""very bearish."") The consensus target price is $10.35, which at the current price, yields ~36% returns.After the crude oil futures price stooped into the negative territory on fear of a production glut and storage concerns on April 21, the energy market is at one of its historic lows. In anticipation of the downturn, HAL had reduced its pressure pumping capacity in North America. Also, the company's diversification away from North America has lessened risks and should put a premium on its stock market price.I think it is quite likely that the company's Q2 performance will deteriorate as the severity of the North American downturn reflects on its results. So, Halliburton aims to reduce costs by $1 billion by the end of 2020 by restructuring management structure and pruning capex. Lower capex should also help generate positive FCF, which would become necessary to deleverage the balance sheet. Although it has reduced the debt size, further deleveraging will be necessary when the economic recession sets in and hit the capital market. Not surprisingly, oilfield services leaders like Halliburton and Schlumberger are cleaning up balance sheets and cash flows to survive the catastrophic situation.However, the investors should keep in mind that when the crisis is over, the energy market will get to its new normal, and the demand for oilfield services will rise. I think Halliburton and the companies that will survive will see top-line and margin improve sharply from their current level. But for now, investors might want to let the storm pass."
4338708,61381,2020-04-21T05:45:09-04:00,"Halliburton reported a loss per share of $1.16 for 1Q '20 on $5.037 billion in revenues. Revenues for 1Q '20 were down 3% sequentially.North American revenues plunged 24.9% year over year to $2.460 billion. Though, revenues from Halliburton's international operations rose 4.7% from the year-ago period to $2.577 billion.I recommend reducing your Halliburton long position slightly and, above all, trading short term about half or more of your holding in the stock to take advantage of the sector volatility.","Source: OilnowThe Houston-based Halliburton (HAL) is the world's second-largest oilfield services company after Schlumberger (SLB) that I covered recently on Seeking Alpha.The two companies present many similarities in their business model, and I will compare them in detail in this article.I have said in my preceding article that Halliburton has a strong presence in well completions and fracking in the US shale, which is a region suffering a severe business contraction and pricing reductions that may get even worse. Halliburton is the most affected by this ongoing struggle, with the North America region accounting for 44.9% of its total revenues.Those revenues have been drastically reduced, and the company was forced to impair its assets this quarter by over $1 billion and posted a double-digit decline in revenue compared to the same quarter last year.The investment thesis is, therefore, elementary here. As I said, Halliburton is an oilfield service company, and the global environment is challenging, with the North America region in total mayhem, thanks to a double-headed black swan event called the coronavirus pandemic outbreak and Saudi Arabia's price war.While North America's slowdown has a significant negative impact on revenues, the International segment has been supportive this quarter as well.Because HAL is a ""service,"" it is placed at a secondary level in this global oil paradigm, and the stock does not enjoy the same growth quality that we should expect from a regular oil investment such as Exxon Mobil (XOM) or Shell (RDS.A, RDS.B). I still think Halliburton as a decent long-term investment, but the situation is now so harsh that I do not believe it is safe to keep a long-term investment at the moment.Therefore, I recommend to reduce your HAL long position slightly and, above all, trade short term about half or more of your HAL holding to take advantage of the oil volatility that will dominate the sector. I recommend turning long again only if HAL drops below $4, which is very likely, in my opinion, in the second quarter of 2020.As I said above, Halliburton and Schlumberger have a very similar business model. Both companies have a significant presence in the US shale, and therefore, are quite sensitive to any economic changes in this region.Halliburton's business model relies on two distinct segments:Schlumberger's business model is very similar and quite more substantial in size, as we can see below:The North America region represents 44.9% of Halliburton's total revenues in 1Q'20. The company is present in every unconventional basin in the US shale (e.g., DJ Basin, Eagle Ford, Bakken, etc.)Comparatively, the North America region represents 30.7% of the total revenues of Schlumberger (including Cameron US). Below, I have indicated Schlumberger's revenue detailed per area for the last two quarters. As we can see, there has been a sharp fall in revenues from North America.One characteristic that separates Schlumberger and Halliburton is that the latter has a more substantial presence in the USA, and that is now a definite disadvantage. Thus, any slowdown in this region will affect Halliburton's balance sheet more than its competitor Schlumberger. The graph below demonstrates this fact.Schlumberger's North America represents 30.5% of the total revenues of the company. In contrast, Halliburton's North America represents 48.8%, as we can see Schlumberger's revenues from the Middle East and Asia are double what Halliburton is posting there. It is even more pronounced in Latin America and Europe/CIS Africa.As I said earlier, the North American business outlook continues to be an issue for both Halliburton and Schlumberger. As a result of the slowdown in North America, the company took steps to scale down the North American business again this quarter and brought massive non-cash impairment charges. But the situation is turning from bad to catastrophic, with WTI barely holding above $20 per barrel, and it may soon trade below $10.Furthermore, due to a lack of demand, the US is experiencing an acute problem in terms of oil storage.Both companies have suffered a significant retracement of about 67% and 75%, respectively, on a year-to-date level. Unfortunately, the decline could potentially be more severe as we walk through 2020.Data by YChartsHalliburton's yield is 9.44%, compared to Schlumberger's lower yield of 3.30% after cutting its dividend by 75% this quarter. However, Halliburton will not be able to sustain such an insane dividend much longer, and not cutting like Schlumberger seems quite foolish when you know that soon every dollar is vital.(Source: HAL filings and Morningstar)1 - Revenues of $5.037 billion in 1Q'20.Halliburton reported a loss per share of $1.16 for 1Q '20 on $5.037 billion in revenues compared to $5.737 billion in the same quarter last year. Revenues for 1Q '20 were down 3% sequentially.North American revenues plunged 24.9% year over year to $2.460 billion. Though, revenues from Halliburton's international operations rose 4.7% from the year-ago period to $2.577 billion. However, the segment is down 9.8% sequentially.Net Income reported for the first quarter of 2020 came in at a loss of $1,015 million, well below the gain of $152 million for the same period last year. These charges consisted primarily of non-cash asset impairments, mostly associated with pressure pumping equipment, as well as severance and other costs, said the company.In short, HAL delivered better-than-expected first-quarter earnings as robust international activity partly offset headwinds in North America.International revenue in the first quarter of 2020 was $2.6 billion, a 5% increase when compared to the first quarter of 2019. It was primarily driven by increased well construction activity in the North Sea and Russia, coupled with higher activity across multiple product lines in the United Arab Emirates, Mexico, Indonesia, and Malaysia, said the company.Jeff Miller, Chairman, President, and CEO, commented in the press release:However, management warned that activity would continue to plunge in the second quarter.2 - Generic Free Cash Flow jumped to an estimated $827 million in Q4Free cash flow yearly is $1,408 million (""ttm""), with free cash flow estimated at $12 million in 1Q '20, probably the last positive quarterly free cash flow for a long while looking at the oil prices crash.The dividend payment of $0.72 per share, or a payout of $631 million annually, is still supported by the level of free cash flow generated by the company now. However, unlike Schlumberger, which cut its dividend by 75%, Halliburton kept the quarterly dividend at $0.18 per share, or a yield of 9.44%. I believe it is a mistake, and the situation is so fierce that the company should have reduced the dividend to $0.045 to match Schlumberger. I find this decision entirely nonsensical owing to the rapid deterioration of the oil business.3 - Net Debt is now $8.44 billion in 1Q'20, up from $8.05 billion in 4Q'19Net debt is $8.44 billion, with a net debt-to-EBITDA of ~2.4X, which is excellent and similar to that of Schlumberger (SLB's net debt is ~$13.3 billion).Net interest expense for the first quarter of 2020 was $134 million.Halliburton has been the number one oilfield service company in the USA, and it was a definitive advantage until a big storm decided to darken the sky totally out of the blue. Now, Halliburton is turning into the weakest link, and the next few quarters will be brutal.The North America segment has been a headache for the company for a few quarters now, and Halliburton closed 2019 with massive non-cash impairment charges of $2.2 billion, which shows the severity of the operating environment in North America. But what is about to come seems alarming with cuts in CapEx. Already, Halliburton announced that it has laid off 384 workers at the South San Antonio facility that oversees its Eagle Ford Shale operations.It is not what I am calling a ""perfect blue sky,"" and the risk of getting a terrible result next quarter is high.Technical Analysis (short term)HAL closed today at $7.63, perhaps because the dividend has not been cut. I see a trading channel now with line support at $4.80 and line resistance at $9.90.I recommend using the resistance to sell a good part of your position and using the cash to trade short term the volatility that I see increasing.The long-term support indicated above could eventually be breached depending on the severity of the oil crash, and we could subsequently trade in the $3's area then. Any bullish uptrend should be used to make a profit, and I recommend taking profit started at or above $9.50.However, for the contrarian investor, it would be good to wait patiently for one strong adverse reaction of the market that may come the next few weeks when investors will realize how catastrophic the situation has become.Long term, I would argue that a decent recovery will follow this oil crash, and I believe Halliburton and Schlumberger will rise again from the ashes. Therefore, watch the next stampede, and when it shows up, use your cash reserve and go long.Author's note: If you find value in this article and would like to encourage such continued efforts, please click the ""Like"" button below as a vote of support.

4339673,104744,2020-04-23T22:36:04-04:00,"In Q1, Halliburton booked an over $1 billion impairment, which dragged its accounting net income down.While GAAP profit was deeply negative, the company delivered quarterly free cash flow to equity of $81 million.Investors should brace themselves for a more than 30% revenue drop in 2020.However, capex reduction and opex savings will likely help HAL to deliver the 2020 free cash flow of $650 million.I maintain my neutral rating.","Halliburton Company (HAL), the OFSE industry heavyweight, has recently presented its Q1 2020 results and negatively impressed the market with a humongous quarterly loss of above $1 billion caused by massive impairment. Another matter that added to its difficulties was the shocking situation in the oil market, as the front-month (May) contract for WTI crude oil plummeted to sub-zero figures for the first time in history because the U.S. tank storage capacity has been approaching limits. As you can see, the OPEC+ deal that was supposed to bolster the price for crude is still of secondary importance for traders, at least for now. Demand destruction amid the COVID-19 pandemic is still the powerful downside catalyst. However, on April 22, oil market bulls returned as the U.S. President had ordered the military ""to destroy Iranian vessels if provoked."" Though it fueled a one-day rally, I believe this catalyst will be only temporary.So, while the company topped analysts' Q1 EPS consensus estimates, Halliburton's better-than-expected earnings tell nothing about the 2020 prospects of the company, which look murky even in the best-case scenario.Halliburton has to exert muscles and brace itself for the gloomy downturn with no prospects of a quick return to revenue growth in 2020-2021. Even if WTI rallies to $40 a barrel, I am highly skeptical the U.S. shale players who bring the bulk of its revenue will rush to urgently revise capex budgets up and pour cash into pressure pumping if the benchmark oil price climbs to this level. Some of them will have to maintain conservative spending to preserve cash, reduce leverage, and heal the wounds of the oil price collapse; so, drilling activity is not about to skyrocket next year.Also, I anticipate some consolidation trends in the sector, as smaller players with imperfect balance sheets, shrunk equity values, and promising assets have all chances to be acquired by supermajors who have better liquidity together with relatively easy access to capital markets. However, that is not a massive threat to HAL, as majors who acquired weaker players will still need services and equipment.Now let’s discuss the presented Q1 figures and 2020 prospects in greater detail.Halliburton that had already been experiencing sales contraction in 2019 because of the trade war ramifications like unfavorable oil price and capex trends in the E&P industry ended the Q1 of gloomy 2020 with the lowest revenue since the first quarter of 2018. Its Completion and Production segment sales dropped 19% vs. 1Q19, while Drilling and Evaluation revenue did not change at all. Halliburton explained lower C&P Q1 revenue was a consequence of reduced demand for pressure pumping activity and weaker completion tool sales in North America. An interesting remark worth making is that the NA segment (see Segment and geographic results), the region HAL heavily depends on, even delivered some growth compared to Q4 2019 ($2.46 billion vs. $2.3 billion in Q4), while others inclusive of Latin America, Europe/Africa/CIS, and the Middle East/Asia all delivered lower sales. Surely, that is not an indicator of positive developments in its key region to come. For a broader context, compared to 1Q19, North America revenue decreased by 25%. Also, most likely, the Q2 revenue generated in the U.S. will tumble amid the decreased fracking activity. For instance, Schlumberger's (NYSE:SLB) CEO anticipates oilfield activity to drop by 40% to 60%.While a sharp drop in quarterly revenue was not coincidental, I was also not amused with a deeply negative net income, which was dragged down by the pressure pumping equipment impairment, which amounted to $1.07 billion. The OFSE industry is ailing, as oil players are rushing to cut costs and curtail expenditures to avoid insolvency. The principal source of revenue of oilfield services companies is shrinking. However, HAL is doing precisely what it must do to avoid conundrum. It radically cuts costs, puts much effort into working capital improvement, and reduces capex. For instance, zealous cost-cutting will save it around $1 billion this year. That instills confidence the company will weather the downturn and recuperate in late 2021. But there is no doubt the path will be challenging and painful.Though GAAP loss looks horrible, the silver lining is that HAL continues to generate excess cash, which remains of essential importance considering its huge debt on the balance sheet. With capex taken into account, Q1 FCF amounted to $12 million. Adjusted for asset sales, FCF was $81 million. The cash flow surplus was partly the consequence of the lowest capital expenditures since the beginning of 2018; capital intensity was just 4.2%. For a broader context, Schlumberger, another OFSE heavyweight, had Q1 Capex/Sales of 5.5%.First and foremost, I believe the risk of negative operating cash flow in 2020 is minuscule, as now HAL is much better positioned to weather the downturn than in 2016 when its cash from operations plummeted to -$1.7 billion.Data by YChartsThough according to analysts’ assumptions, the 2020 revenue will most likely drop by more than 30%, HAL has cost flexibility to secure healthy cash generation. At the same time, I would not say profits are protected. I fully agree with analysts who think EPS will languish below zero in 2020 and 2021 because of the steep decline in sales this year and soft growth in 2021.Next, as Halliburton is undertaking emergency measures to protect the balance sheet and mitigate pressure on margins, it is highly likely the company will remain free-cash-flow positive. I believe it can deliver over $650 million in annual pro forma FCF to equity, assuming net operating cash flow of $1.45 billion and capital expenditures of approximately $800 million. Around $630 million of this inflow will likely be used to cover the dividend (assuming no reductions). Though the dividend coverage looks safe, I believe there is a moderate risk of DPS reduction. I have been confident that Equinor's (EQNR) dividend is safe given FCF prospects and robust balance sheet; however, even this highly-efficient supermajor had to cut quarterly DPS citing ""the current unprecedented market conditions and uncertainties.""Perhaps the most gnawing concern of investors who are considering buying the battered stock for holding for at least two years and benefit from the long-term oil market recovery is if HAL can survive this downswing and maintain a robust financial position. In my opinion, Halliburton is not an impecunious company that is on the cusp of insolvency. However, its financial position is not flawless. Let me explain.While the top line is under pressure, Halliburton is not on the ropes. The company is efficiently navigating the downturn and is doing precisely what it must. Costs and capital expenditures reductions are all reasonable and consistent steps. The company is valued at just 5.4x EV/EBITDA and 8.97x EV/Forward EBITDA, which signifies investors are pricing in a massive 2020 revenue contraction. However, given the oil price dynamics and demand outlook, I maintain a neutral rating."
4348622,33291,2020-05-19T03:28:25-04:00,"The oil price decline in tandem with the stock market selloff pummeled Halliburton, but we made a contrarian call.There was a bit of a divergence with oil prices in late April because the market started looking ahead to the end of 2020.A more than 50% rally from our buy call still has room to run.Q1 performance gives clues for what metrics to watch in what will be an ugly Q2 and possibly Q3.Still a good buy, but scale in if you can.","Is oil really back over $30? Why yes it is, and our call to buy Halliburton (HAL) has netted 50% gains in less than a month. That is exactly how we like to trade/invest. We find beaten-down names that have the potential for a rapid snapback, investigate, and if it meets our criteria, we recommend it. Halliburton fit the bill quite nicely because we saw it rebounding in the near term and being solid for the longer term. The bottom line is that whatever was happening to energy demand was (or we should say is) short term.Why do we assert this? When economies around the world even return to 50% of what they were doing before the COVID-19 crisis, pent-up demand for oil will be unleashed. Sure, supply is massively overdone right now, but demand is already starting to rise. Thus, buying now is still a good play. You do not have to buy all at once - the market is very likely to give you a pullback a bit again before running higher. Unless you see oil running to negative on the front-month contract, or think bankruptcy as likely, this name has upside, even after our members saw huge returns.We think you can do the same. It is part of our investing philosophy, finding names left for dead and profiting from the reversal. The stock is at $11 now, not exactly, priced for disaster like it was, but still 10 points below where it was before the real selloff in energy began. In this column, we reiterate a Buy call and remind you of the performance metrics to watch for going forward.Halliburton reported its Q1 earnings about a month ago, and at that time, we saw an in-line top line and a bottom line beat versus consensus estimates. We fully expect Q2 is going to be pretty bad. The devastation in oil pricing that began in mid-winter continued through April, as demand has been eroded, and for a day, the front-month contract for May went negative.Returning to Q1, the month of March was particularly painful for the quarter, as prices eroded with the COVID-19 selloff. Keep in mind, Q2 is off to a horrendous start. The first half of the quarter was mostly business as usual, although we recognize that oil was selling off, though not like we saw in March. Given the selloff in the commodity, we thought we would see bigger declines.Why? Well, you need to understand that oil prices are so strongly linked to performance of the company and the stock. It is an oil service stock after all. Makes sense, right? Thus, with wild moves in oil prices, the stock has taken it on the chin, but also swung higher recently. The uncertainty makes decisions like capex and labor planning all that much harder for the company, but our view is cut, cut, cut. If prices rebound, you can always step the spending back up. While we hate to see jobs at stake, from an EPS view only, when revenues are decimated, you have to control expenses.That said, Q1 saw weak somewhat decent prices to start, and then pricing plummeted. Revenues actually were, as expected, down heavily from a year ago, declining 12% and coming in at $5.0 billion in the quarter. The Q1 trend pretty strongly follows the path of oil in the last five years:Source: SEC filings, graphics by BAD BEAT InvestingThe decline was lower than what we expected. However, at $5.0 billion, HAL was in line with consensus projections.We were more bearish, expecting $4.7-$4.8 billion, so this result was positive, in our opinion. In Q2, the revenue number could be just $4 billion. But where were the revenues generated from? Understanding trends driving these issues is important. Drilling down, we can see where the strength and weakness resides. Operating segment performance relative to the sequential quarter saw a big dichotomy.Essentially, we saw lower revenues sequentially from Q4 2019 in the Completion and Production segment. Revenue here was $3.0 billion, a decrease of $700 million, or 19%. The decline stemmed primarily due to lower pressure pumping activity and pricing and reduced completion tool sales in North America. It is important to note that this was partially offset by increased cementing activity and completion tool sales in the Eastern Hemisphere.Over in the Drilling and Evaluation segment, we saw improvement from the sequential quarter. Revenue came in at $2.1 billion, which was flat versus Q4 2019, far better than expected. It is worth pointing out that cost controls led to operating income increasing $94 million, a 76% increase from the sequential quarter.Driving this was higher activity for drilling-related services in the North Sea and Asia. There was reduced activity and pricing for multiple product service lines in North America land and lower fluids activity in Latin America. International expansion was shown once again, which is helping to offset the declines in North America. North America revenue was $2.5 billion, a 25% decrease from a year ago, but was up from the sequential quarter actually.The action is still promising internationally. HAL is successfully executing its strategy of controlling what expenses it can control and managing the business to perform well in any market conditions. International revenue was $2.6 billion, a 5% increase from a year ago.As we said above, to protect earnings, you have to cut expenses. Overall, expenses have been well managed, but again, management has stated previously that it is committed to further cuts.While the company cannot control pricing, it can control expenses to a large degree. This expense control ability was reflected in Q1, as adjusted operating income was $502 million, which was up 18% from a year ago but down from the sequential quarter.Factoring in both the revenue being slightly better than expected and all sources of expenses being less than expected, earnings per share were ahead of projections, an up from last year:Source: SEC filings (linked above), graphics by BAD BEAT InvestingIn Q1, adjusted net income came in at $270 million, or $0.31 per diluted share. This compares to $0.23 taken in back in Q1 2019. Looking to Q2, it will be ugly. The market is pricing for terrible performance in Q2-Q3, despite Q1 showing strength.Here's the deal. Oil prices are driving most of the action here. There was a bit of a divergence with oil prices in late April because the market started looking ahead to the end of 2020 and priced in the fact that production globally would have to be cut. Now, oil is rallying, and Halliburton has followed suit. While a major run has been made and our members have profited massively, we think upside remains. No need to buy all at once, scale in if you can. But overall, a buy here is going to pay off in the medium term.If you like this column click ""Follow"" and if you are seeking strong returns and guidance from a professional team, check out BAD BEAT Investing"
4338667,92586,2020-04-20T20:37:58-04:00,"A look forward into the remainder of 2020 suggests that Halliburton is ready to hunker down and take a defensive stance.2Q20 is likely to be substantially weaker than the first quarter across the board, with all North American basins effectively going dormant.I prefer to place more calculated bets outside the oil and gas sector at this moment.","On the historic day that crude oil prices for May 2020 delivery dipped well below zero, Halliburton (HAL) posted an adjusted earnings beat for the first period of the year. Revenues declined 12% YOY, the second worst drop of the past three years (last quarter's had been the worst), but were in line with expectations.However, what mattered most on earnings day were not the 1Q20 headline numbers. Instead, a look forward into the remainder of the year suggests that Halliburton is ready to hunker down, taking a defensive stance in the face of deteriorating crude oil prices and tight E&P (exploration and production) capex budgets.Image creditEven in January, well before the current COVID-19 pandemic became an overwhelming global concern, I had pointed out that ""the energy services sector would play hardcore defense in 2020, in an attempt to boost earnings amid a highly unfavorable oil and gas drilling and production environment in North America"". Halliburton had already been stacking equipment, reducing fixed costs, and improving efficiency whenever possible. Not a shocker, things did not get any better by the end of the quarter.Once again, pressure pumping and well construction dragged revenues the most, while drilling, especially in the North Sea and in Asia, fared much better. But the second quarter is likely to be substantially weaker across the board, with all North American basins effectively going dormant through the end of the year at least. It remains to be seen if pockets of strength overseas will emerge, but I find it speculative to think so at this moment.Source: company's earnings releaseIn the absence of revenue growth expected for the foreseeable future, cost containment becomes the most important topic of discussion. Last year, Halliburton operated on very slim margins of about 9%, excluding impairments, but they were enough to allow the company to produce more than $900 million in free cash flow in 2019. This time, Halliburton will need to tighten its belt much more to preserve its $1.4 billion in cash reserves.To accomplish the goal, Halliburton is slashing overhead by a sizable $1 billion, most of which in the next two quarters. Capex is now projected at only $800 million, just over one-third of 2018 levels. All options seem to be on the table, including cuts in technology investments, reduction in management staff, salary freezes and renegotiation with suppliers.Judging by the narrative above, it is hard to find good reasons to be optimistic about the energy services space. North America (45% of Halliburton's 2019 revenues and 56% in the previous year) had already been facing challenges driven by decelerated demand growth, aggressive production targets overseas and rising inventory levels. Now, the continent will likely go into hibernation mode, while drilling and production activity internationally will remain, at best, a question mark.Data by YChartsSure, HAL is a cheap stock today, at $7.63 per share. Trailing P/E has dipped from about 18x at the end of 2019 (see blue line above) to only 6x now. EV to EBITDA of 3.9x is on par with the lowest levels that the multiple has ever reached, around 2000 and 2008. Speculators may be tempted to buy shares at depressed levels, hang on to them for the next several months or even years, and hope for an eventual rebound.I, on the other hand, prefer not to take my chances with this stock. I believe the upside opportunity here is, at best, consistent with the downside risk. Amid a period of uncertainty not seen in over a decade, I prefer to place more calculated bets outside the oil and gas sector at this moment."

As we write, oil prices are at lows not seen in over 20 years. It is not sustainable for any company in the space long term, though, we will say it is compelling for those looking to speculate on a long-term rebound in shares. To be transparent, we have begun buying up competitor Schlumberger (SLB), not because it will rebound tomorrow, but because we see it rebounding longer term. When economies around the world even return to 50% of what they were doing before the COVID-19 crisis, pent up demand for oil will be unleashed. Thus, buying now is a rather contrarian play at the time, but we are always on the lookout for names that are simply beaten down too far and look to scale in and profit from the reversal. Unless you see bankruptcy as likely, despite another few weeks to months of pain in oil, we have started buying small amounts. We think you can do the same. It is part of our investing philosophy, finding names left for dead and profiting from the reversal. Stock is at $7, priced for Armageddon. The market is not wrong, it is pricing the stock based on expectations for earnings to be nearly non-existent in this environment. In this column, we check in on the stock following reader inquiry. While we prefer competitor SLB, those who seek long-term speculative gains can consider scaling into HAL at these levels. We think it survives, and the stock offers upside.The company just reported its Q1 earnings, we saw an in line top-line and a bottom-line beat versus consensus estimates.

Here is the recent Q1 trend:Source: SEC filings, graphics by BAD BEAT InvestingAs you can see, we saw a decline which we anticipated but was a lower decline than what was expected. At $5.0 billion, the company was in line with consensus projections. We were more bearish, expecting $4.7-4.8 billion, so this result is welcomed. But where were the revenues generated from? Understanding trends driving these issues is important.

International expansion was shown once again, which is helping to offset the declines in North America. North America revenue was $2.5 billion, a 25% decrease from a year ago but was up from the sequential quarter actually. The action is still promising internationally.

But, speculation, when everyone is panicking, can lead to solid gains.

Oil demand will return. Economic activity will resume. Driving will resume. Travel will return. Factories and construction will resume. It is not going to be years of this but months. Halliburton continues to control costs. We think foreseeing earnings is difficult here. We believe the activity changes will not be uniform across all markets and will vary by region. OPEC+ production decisions and the duration of pandemic-related demand and activity disruptions will, ultimately, determine the extent of international spending declines this year, but we expect huge cuts. Halliburton will reduce overhead and other costs by approximately $1 billion, lower capital expenditures to around $800 million and try to improve working capital.If you like the material here, click ""follow,"" and if you are seeking professional trading guidance in this market, check out our service below."
4336904,38631,2020-04-09T14:33:55-04:00,"Halliburton has plunged 68% this year due to the fierce sell-off of the entire energy sector.As a result, the stock is now trading at single digits for the first time in 17 years.As the global economy is likely to recover from coronavirus the latest next year, Halliburton is likely to highly reward investors from its current depressed stock price.On the other hand, due to its high debt load and some secular business headwinds, the stock will come under great pressure if the downturn lasts longer than expected.","Halliburton (HAL) has plunged 68% this year due to the fierce sell-off of the entire energy sector, which has been caused by the outbreak of coronavirus and the oil price war. As a result, the stock is now trading at single digits for the first time in 17 years. The energy market is likely to begin recovering from next year and hence Halliburton is likely to highly reward investors from its current depressed price. On the other hand, the stock carries a high amount of risk due to its debt load and some secular headwinds.In the last few years, there has been great technological progress in the production of oil. As a result, oil producers are now able to produce much more oil from a fixed number of wells. This development has taken its toll on the earnings of Halliburton, as the company now generates lower revenues at a given level of production. The CEO of Halliburton has characterized the company as a victim of its own success for this reason.Moreover, shale oil producers used to operate with a significant amount of leverage in the past but they have remarkably tightened their budgets in the last three years, as they saw many of their peers going out of business in the previous downturn of the energy sector, between 2014 and 2016. As oil producers now operate within the limits posed by their cash flows, they have negatively affected the results of Halliburton.As if the above headwinds were not enough, Halliburton is now facing a fierce downturn, which has been caused by the outbreak of coronavirus. Due to the measures taken to limit the expansion of the virus, the demand for jet fuel and gasoline has collapsed. Goldman Sachs estimated that the global demand for oil slumped 25% in the last week of March over last year. Such a collapse is unprecedented during a period of peace, with no rebound on the horizon in the near future.Even worse, Russia refused to reduce its production and Saudi Arabia boosted its output from approximately 9.0 to 13.0 million barrels per day in order to punish Russia for its stance. In other words, global oil production rose during a period of depressed demand. Consequently, the price of oil has now collapsed to a 17-year low level. At the current level, the vast majority of oil producers is burning cash. As some shale oil producers will go out of business and others will be forced to cut their output, they will impart a severe hit on the business of Halliburton. Due to all these headwinds, the stock of Halliburton has plunged to single digits for the first time in 17 years.Due to the aforementioned headwinds, Halliburton is likely to incur losses this year. Analysts currently expect the company to earn $0.52 per share but it is likely that they have not adjusted their forecast for the latest developments of the coronavirus crisis due to the uncertainty over the severity and the duration of this downturn.However, while the global economy will inevitably incur a recession this year, it is unrealistic to expect coronavirus to condemn the whole world to a permanent recession. Many pharmaceutical companies are doing their best to develop an effective treatment and a vaccine and they will almost certainly achieve their goal sooner or later. Gilead Sciences (GILD) has exhibited the most promising results in the development of a drug so far while Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) may be able to produce a vaccine in early 2021. To cut a long story short, the global energy market is likely to begin recovering the latest from next year. As a result, it is reasonable to expect the earnings of Halliburton to recover from next year.The company earned $1.90 per share in 2018 and $1.24 per share in 2019. If Halliburton recovers along with the energy sector from next year, it is likely to earn at least $1.00 per share the latest by 2022. Moreover, the stock has traded at an average price-to-earnings ratio of 16.2 over the last decade. Therefore, the stock can be reasonably expected to trade around $16 the latest in two years from now. In other words, if the global economy and the energy market begin to recover from next year, Halliburton is likely to double over the next two years.Unfortunately for Halliburton, the ongoing crisis has caught the company off-guard, with a weak balance sheet. In the last two quarters, interest expense consumed 50% of operating income. In addition, the net debt of Halliburton (as per Buffett, net debt = total liabilities - cash - receivables) currently stands at $10.5 billion, which is 50% higher than the current market cap of the stock.During severe downturns, like the ongoing coronavirus crisis, investors should pay extra attention to the balance sheet of companies. If the crisis does not extend beyond this year, Halliburton is likely to endure the crisis and recover from next year. On the other hand, if the crisis lasts longer than currently anticipated, Halliburton will come under pressure due to its high debt load. This does not mean that the company will certainly face solvency problems in the adverse scenario. However, it does mean that Halliburton will be hard pressed in the adverse scenario of a prolonged crisis.Due to the collapse of its stock price, Halliburton is now offering a nearly all-time high dividend yield of 9.0%.Data by YChartsThe company held its dividend constant in mid-February and hence some investors may conclude that the dividend is safe for the foreseeable future.However, it is important to note that Halliburton has frozen its dividend for five years in a row. This is a clear indication that the company is struggling to maintain its dividend. Moreover, as the company is likely to incur losses this year, its dividend should not be considered safe, particularly given the appreciable debt load of the company. Furthermore, when a company is leveraged and its business model is under attack, investors should not base their investing decisions on the dividend yield of the stock.Halliburton has been beaten to the extreme by the market due to the coronavirus crisis and the collapse of the oil price to 17-year lows. As the global economy is likely to begin recovering from next year, the stock is likely to highly reward investors from its current depressed price. On the other hand, Halliburton is facing other business headwinds as well while it also carries a significant debt load. As a result, the stock will come under great pressure if the coronavirus crisis lasts longer than expected. Overall, Halliburton is a high-risk, high-return investment right now.It is my principle to avoid leveraged companies and hence I advise investors to look at other beaten down energy stocks, with stronger balance sheets. These stocks, such as Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Total (TOT), have lower return potential than Halliburton but they are much less riskier."

It may need to cut costs to keep EBITDA from sliding.If EBITDA slides further then its ability to service $10 billion in debt could come into question.Oil supply cuts could drive oil prices and HAL higher. Buy HAL.,"Source: ForbesGoldman Sachs is predicting a sharp decline in Q2 GDP due to the coronavirus. Falling oil prices have also weighed on oil-related names like Halliburton (HAL). The stock is down over 70% Y/Y. It likely reflects a dismal economy as well as recent supply increases by Russia and Saudi Arabia. It could be time to buy the stock.E&P in the North America land drilling market has been facing headwinds for a while. Price power for oil services companies has also waned. It has impacted larger players like Halliburton, and the company is battening down the hatches:The coronavirus has led to social distancing, which has caused travel and demand for oil to crater. There is no guarantee demand will return to previous levels after the pandemic is over. Halliburton reported total Q4 revenue of $5.2 billion, down 6% sequentially.Revenue from North America fell over 20% due to an oversupply of the gas market and a double-digit decline in rig count in U.S. land. About 45% of total revenue was derived from North America, down from 53% in Q3. Once an advantage, Halliburton's sizeable presence in the region now appears to be a risk. If Halliburton cuts supply to North America then it could portend even more revenue declines in the future.Revenue outside North America was $2.6 billion, up about 10% Q/Q. The global economy is in serious decline due to knock-on effects of the coronavirus. It is also uncertain how much oil demand there will be outside the U.S. over the next few quarters. Halliburton may not be able to rely on international E&P to offset declines in North America. Revenue from all regions could face headwinds in the first half of the year.Management has proven the ability to contain costs in case E&P falters. It may have to, given the current demand destruction for oil. Halliburton cut costs for most of 2019 amid budget exhaustion for several of its clients. The company achieved run-rate cost savings of about $200 million in Q4. Halliburton reported $918 million in EBITDA, down 4% sequentially. Its operating costs of $4.3 billion were down 7% Q/Q, which allowed Halliburton to increase its EBITDA margin by 100 basis points to 18%. Rising margins amid a mid-single-digit decline were still not cause for celebration.Of the big three oil services firms - Halliburton, Baker Hughes (BKR) and Schlumberger (SLB) - Halliburton trails Schlumberger which has an EBITDA margin north of 20%. Revenue could fall sharply in the first half of the year. Demand destruction amid social distancing will likely cause Halliburton's EBITDA to also fall off, despite cost containment efforts.At this point, the company may have to cut costs simply to keep EBITDA from sliding too much. This is important. Halliburton's $10.3 billion debt load is at 2.8x last 12 months (LTM) EBITDA. If EBITDA falls too much, then the company's deteriorating credit metrics could become cause for concern.The pandemic will eventually end. Millions will return to work, transportation and demand for oil will pick up. President Trump has met with oil executives to come up with a solution to the oil glut. Lots of American jobs are at stake in addition to the trillions in debt oil-related companies are on the hook for. Chatter suggests Russia appears ready to cut production, sending crude oil prices higher:It could be a matter of time before OPEC cuts supply as well. Such an event would likely send oil prices and Halliburton's business prospects much higher. HAL could rise ahead of any subsequent improvement in E&P in the oil patch.With an enterprise value of about $16 billion, HAL trades at less than 4.3x LTM EBITDA. Oil supply cuts could drive the stock higher. Buy HAL."
4335843,104097,2020-04-03T11:23:39-04:00,"It seems that a dividend reduction is virtually assured for Haliburton, as their earnings are under immense pressure.During the normal operating conditions of 2017-2019, they were able to easily cover their dividend payments and thus this indicates that they have the potential to be eventually reinstated.When entering this downturn they had strong liquidity, which should ensure that they remain a going concern through this turmoil.Unfortunately they also had high leverage and thus this further increases the pressure to reduce their dividend to preserve their liquidity and financial position.Even when condition improve, it will likely take quite a few years to lower their leverage sufficiently and thus shareholders should not expect their dividend to increase quickly.","It seems very likely that Halliburton (HAL) will soon be forced to reduce their dividend for the first time in over three decades, due to this once in a generation oil price crash. It was only a few days ago that Helmerich & Payne (HP) took the inevitable but still painful decision to reduce their dividend by approximately 65%. Even though it seems virtually assured that their shareholders will also soon receive notice of lower dividends, this article still provides insight into their potential to reinstate their dividend once conditions recover and whether they can remain a going concern amidst this turmoil.When assessing dividend coverage, I prefer to forgo using earnings per share and use free cash flow instead, since dividends are paid from cash and not from “earnings”. The graph included below summarizes their cash flows from the last three years:Image Source: Author.Since they are a mature company that is operating in a very mature industry, I believe that the best way to assess their future dividend potential is by analyzing what was fundamentally affordable during the normal operating conditions of 2017-2019. Throughout this period of time their dividend coverage averaged a strong 166.56%, with the lowest point only being a still respectable 145.24% in 2019. This indicates that during calm operating conditions they are able to consistently fund their dividend payments without the use of debt and thus they appear fundamentally affordable.When looking towards the future in 2020, predicting their actual cash flow is now a mere guessing game. Nonetheless it will certainly be ugly, given that oilfield spending will tumble below the depths of the previous oil price crash in 2015-2016, with their key North American market expected to see the biggest impacts. Whilst they are reducing their capital expenditure, they have not provided any exact guidance and given the severity of this downturn, it seems unlikely to be sufficient to still cover their dividend payments.Since their dividend payments can be covered during normal operating conditions, their financial position will be the primary factor determining whether they are capable of sustaining them during this downturn and most importantly, whether they can remain a going concern. The two graphs included below summarize their financial position from the last three years:Image Source: Author.Overall their financial position is rather mixed, they entered this downturn with strong liquidity, which is evidenced by their current ratio of 2.30 and a cash balance of $2.268b that almost equals their operating cash flow from 2019. Whereas on the other hand they also have high leverage, as evidenced by their gearing ratio of 50.07% and all of the other metrics included in the above graph.Barring a black swan event, they appear strong enough to remain a going concern throughout this downturn, primarily thanks to their strong liquidity. Although this further highlights the importance for them to reduce their dividend as soon as possible, as continuing to pay these will unnecessarily erode this liquidity and increase leverage at a time when capital markets are at their least supportive.Since this downturn is almost guaranteed to inflict additional damage on their financial position, after conditions improve they will likely wish to lower their leverage before increasing their dividend materially. Unfortunately this will likely take quite a while and thus shareholders should not expect a quick rebound in their dividend. To provide an example, even if they somehow exit this downturn with the exact same net debt as when they entered and their free cash flow instantly recovered to $1b, which is approximately the average of 2017-2019, it would still take four years of no dividend payments to halve their net debt and thus bring their leverage down to a strong level.Whilst it appears that during normal operating conditions they can afford their soon to be reduced dividend payments, given their leverage and the likely damage this downturn will inflict on their financial position, it will likely be a slow road to recovery. Given this I believe that a neutral rating is appropriate for the time being, with the potential for a change once more time as elapsed and thus more information has come to light regarding their financial performance.Notes: Unless specified otherwise, all figures in this article were taken from Halliburton’s 2019 10-K and 2017 10-K SEC filings, all calculated figures were performed by the author."
4319114,40351,2020-01-26T13:47:51-05:00,"Halliburton reported an expected drop in earnings as North America revenues plunged, but still improved adjusted operating margins and generated free cash flows.The business environment will remain weak in North America in 2020, but the drilling activity continues to climb in the international markets, which will benefit Halliburton's earnings.Halliburton could sustain its margins, even as drilling activity slows in the US, and will likely report strong levels of free cash flows in 2020.","Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) has reported an improvement in profit margins and strong levels of free cash flows in its latest quarterly results, and I think the company will perform well in the future as well, even as it faces a tough environment in the US where its customers are cutting spending and shale activity is slowing down.Image courtesy of PixabayHalliburton has reported robust results for the fourth quarter of 2019 as the cost-cutting efforts and a strong performance in the international markets helped offset weakness at home. The company's total revenues dropped by 12.6% from Q4-2018 to $5.19 billion in Q4-2019. The drop was led by the North American business where revenues plunged by 30%. Halliburton's international revenues, however, rose by 10% to $2.86 billion.The company's adjusted operating income dropped by 10.2% from a year earlier to $546 million. Halliburton reported an adjusted profit of $285 million, or $0.32 per share, down from $358 million, or $0.41 per share a year earlier, but managed to beat analysts' consensus earnings estimate by $0.03 per share. The drop in earnings can be attributed to the worsening conditions in the US where shale activity and service prices have declined.Halliburton also faced pricing pressure, but the company did an impressive job of improving its margins. The adjusted operating margin increased from 10.24% to 10.52%. Halliburton also ended 2019 with $827 million of free cash flows for the quarter and $915 million for the full year, exhibiting its ability to generate strong levels of cash flows in a tough environment.Several oil producers have already reduced drilling activity by removing rigs in the US. Although Baker Hughes (NYSE:BKR) recently reported a big jump in its latest rig count of 15 units to 796 rigs for the week ended January 17, the US rig count has largely been going downhill. In the last one year, drillers have removed a total of 254 rigs in the country. The persistent weakness in oil, NGL, and natural gas prices have forced some companies such as Apache Corp. (NASDAQ:APA) to drop drilling rigs while other oil producers such as EOG Resources (NYSE:EOG) are running fewer rigs than originally forecast as operational efficiencies allow them to produce similar or higher oil and gas volumes with fewer rigs.The rig count will likely decline further in 2020 since the business environment remains challenging in North America as oil producers - Halliburton's customers - cut capital expenditures, reduce drilling activity, and increase focus on generating free cash flows and returning the excess cash to shareholders. The US oil production growth is also widely expected to slow down this year. Halliburton and its bigger rival Schlumberger (SLB) have both forecast decline in spending from their E&P customers. The demand for fracking work will drop, putting additional pressure on service pricing and making things difficult for oilfield service providers.The impact of shale slowdown, however, will get partly offset by the rebound in the international markets where drilling activity has been steadily climbing after four years of declines. Halliburton has capitalized on this positive trend by growing its international business for two years in a row. I think the company may have also gained market share outside of North America, considering its annual growth has outpaced the international rig count growth. Halliburton has posted a 10% increase in international revenues on a sequential basis and 10% on a full-year basis, posting across-the-board increase in all major regions and both completion & production and drilling & evaluation divisions.The Baker Hughes rig count data shows that the international rig count has increased by 79 units in the last 12 months to 1,104 rigs, which is in stark contrast what we're seeing in the US. In the international markets, oil producers need to increase spending and drilling work just to maintain output. I think international markets will continue growing in the future as they get support from oil prices which have somewhat stabilized in the $55 to $60 a barrel range and as global recession fears ease after the world's leading central banks take policy measures to protect economic growth. In this backdrop, Halliburton's international business will likely continue growing.What I also like about Halliburton is that it isn't chasing revenues. Instead, the company is concentrating on improving its profit margins, both at home and abroad. The impact of this approach was apparent in the latest quarterly results in which its adjusted operating margins improved on a year-over-year basis. Halliburton has witnessed improvement in pricing levels and it is actively working on capturing high-margin service contracts. Investors should expect further margin expansion from the company's international business.On the other hand, improving or even maintaining margins in a slowing market in North America, where customer activity and pricing are declining, is going to be challenging. However, the company has taken a number of measures to preserve its bottom line, including cost-cutting initiatives, improvements in service delivery, and an increase in focus on the high-return non-frac product lines. The industry is also experiencing equipment attrition and Halliburton, as well as a number of its peers, have been removing the excess equipment from the market. This has led to a reduction in the available horsepower supply which should also help stem margin erosion. One drawback of this margin-focused approach, however, is that the company's revenues could continue to decline. Halliburton reported a large drop in revenues from North America in Q4-2019, and I think the company will report a double-digit drop in revenues in 2020 as well. However, I believe Halliburton will still likely preserve its leadership position in the North American market since its rivals, including Schlumberger, have also adopted a similar strategy and are not interested in expanding their market share by sacrificing margins.I also expect Halliburton to report strong levels of free cash flows in 2020 as well. The company's cash flows will receive support from the growth in international business and margin protection efforts in North America. Halliburton has also announced a large cut in capital expenditures from $1.5 billion in 2019 to $1.2 billion planned for 2020. I think this 20% reduction in spending has put Halliburton in a good position to expand free cash flows in the current year. I expect it to use the excess cash primarily for debt reduction purposes.Halliburton carries high levels of debt. At the end of last year, the company had $10.3 billion of total debt, which translates into a loft debt-to-equity ratio of 129%. By comparison, Schlumberger's D/E ratio was 64% at the end of last year. Halliburton has $3.8 billion of debt maturing over the next six years, which will likely be the focus of the company's debt reduction efforts. I believe a meaningful cut in debt can have a positive impact on Halliburton's valuation. Once the company brings its leverage metrics down and eliminates near-term maturities, it can concentrate on using the free cash flows to reward shareholders with dividends and buybacks.Shares of Halliburton have remained largely flat in the last six months and have easily outperformed the VanEck Vectors Oil Services ETF (NYSEARCA:OIH), the industry's leading fund, which tumbled by 16% in the same period. The company should deliver a better performance than most of its North American peers, thanks to its exposure to the lucrative international markets. The company's shares, however, are looking expensive, currently trading 17.4x forward earnings, higher than the sector median of 13x, as per data from Seeking Alpha Essential. At this price, I would rate Halliburton as a hold."
4318678,61381,2020-01-23T14:51:50-05:00,"Halliburton North America's slowdown has a significant impact on the company revenues in the fourth quarter of 2019. The company posted a massive non-cash impairment of $2.2 billion this quarter.Conversely, Halliburton showed good progress in its international business. A similar trend than its main rival Schlumberger.I still think Halliburton as a decent long-term investment but should be viewed as a second option in the oil group. It could be wise to reduce your exposure.","Source: OilnowThe Houston-based Halliburton (HAL) is the world's second-largest oilfield services company after Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) that I covered recently on Seeking Alpha. Therefore, the two companies present many similarities in their business model, and I will compare them, in detail, in this article.As I have said in my preceding article, Halliburton has a strong presence in well completions and fracking in the US shale, which is a region suffering a severe business contraction and pricing reductions for a while now.Halliburton is the most affected by this ongoing struggle, with the North America region accounting for 44.9% of its total revenues.Those revenues have been drastically reduced, and the company was forced to impair its assets this quarter by over $2 billion and posted a double-digit decline in revenue.Jeff Miller, Chairman, President, and CEO, commented on the conference call:Meanwhile, the international segment is getting brighter:If we look at Halliburton's rival Schlumberger, the rhetoric this quarter was a little bit of the same. The company was delivering a bullish outlook for its international business and was scaling down its ailing operations in the North American sector.The investment thesis is, therefore, elementary here. As I said, Halliburton is an oilfield service company, and the global environment is challenging with the North America region in crisis. Yes, some progress here and there but nothing to celebrate.While North America's slowdown has a significant negative impact on revenues, the International segment is quite strong and supportive. This ambivalence creates a fragile status quo that is not inspiring, owing to that the condition could degrade further in 2020.Because HAL is a ""service,"" it is placed at a secondary level in this global oil paradigm and does not enjoy the same growth quality that we should expect from a regular oil investment such as Exxon Mobil (XOM) or Shell (RDS.A) (RDS.B).I still think Halliburton as a decent long-term investment but should be viewed as a second option in the oil group. Therefore, I continue to recommend to reduce your long position slightly for Halliburton and, above all, trade short term about 40% of your position to take advantage of the oil volatility that will dominate the sector.As I said above, Halliburton and Schlumberger have a very similar business model. Both companies have a significant presence in the US shale and therefore are quite sensitive to any economic changes in this region.Halliburton's business model relies on two distinct segments: Schlumberger's business model is very similar and quite more substantial in size, as we can see below:The North America region represents 44.9% of the total revenues of Halliburton in 4Q'19. Halliburton is present in every unconventional Basin in the US Shale (e.g., DJ Basin, Eagle Ford, Bakken, etc.)Comparatively, the North America region represents 34.6% of the total revenues of Schlumberger (including Cameron US). Below, I have indicated Schlumberger's revenue detailed per area for the last two quarters. As we can see, a sharp fall in revenues from North America. One characteristic that separates Schlumberger and Halliburton is that the latter has a stronger presence in the USA. Thus, any slowdown in this region will affect Halliburton's balance sheet more than its competitor Schlumberger. The graph below is demonstrating this fact.Schlumberger's North America represents 29.8% of the total revenues of the company. In contrast, Halliburton's North America represents 44.9% as we can see Schlumberger revenues from the Middle East and Asia are double what Halliburton is posting there. It is even more pronounced in Latin America and Europe/CIS Africa.As I said earlier, the North American business outlook continues to be an issue for both Halliburton and Schlumberger. As a result of the North American slowdown, the company took steps to scale down the North American business again this quarter and brought massive non-cash impairment charges.Both companies have suffered a significant retracement of about 18% and 26%, respectively, on a year to date level. Unfortunately, the decline resumed this year after a definite uptick at the end of 2019, as we can see in the chart below.Data by YChartsFinally, one slight positive for both companies is that they are paying a stable dividend that I do not see vanishing. Again, Schlumberger has an advantage and pays a better dividend than Halliburton.However, Halliburton's yield is 3.00% compared to Schlumberger's higher yield of 5.50%, which increases, even more, the performance gap between the two stocks, in favor of Schlumberger.Source: HAL filing and Morningstar1 - Revenues of $5.191 billion in 4Q'19. Halliburton reported a loss per share of $1.88 for 4Q '19 on $5.191 billion in revenues compared to $5.936 billion in the same quarter last year. Revenues for 4Q '19 were down 6.5% sequentially.North American revenues plunged 30.3% year over year to $2.333 billion. Though, revenues from Halliburton's international operations rose 11.5% from the year-ago period to $2.858 billion, a segment that continues to exhibit a healthy growth momentum.Net income reported for the fourth quarter of 2019 came in at a loss of $1,653 million, well below the $664 million for the same period last year (The company took a $2.2 billion non-cash impairment charge associated with pressure pumping and legacy drilling equipment).In short, HAL delivered better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings as robust international activity offset headwinds in North America.Lance Loeffler, the CFO, commented in the conference call:2 - Generic Free Cash Flow jumped to an estimated $827 million in Q4Free cash flow yearly is $915 million (""ttm"") with free cash flow estimated at $827 million in 4Q '19.The dividend payment is $0.72 per share, or a payout of $631 million annually is supported by the level of free cash flow generated by the company now. Lance Loeffler indicated in the 3Q conference call:I was quite doubtful that this goal could be achieved. I was wrong, and Halliburton managed to reach nearly $1 billion in free cash flow for 2019.3 - Net Debt is now $8.05 billion in 4Q'19Net debt is $8.05 billion with a net debt to EBITDA of ~2.4X, which is excellent and similar to Schlumberger (SLB's net debt is ~$13.1 billion).Net interest expense for the fourth quarter of 2019 was $141 million.Halliburton is engaged in all unconventional basins in the U.S.A and runs its business under two main segments: Completion and Production, and Drilling and Evaluation.The North America segment has been a headache for the company for a few quarters now, and Halliburton closed 2019 with massive non-cash impairment charges of $2.2 billion, which shows the severity of the operating environment in North America. Meanwhile, the International segment enjoys a better outlook.However, Halliburton sees some severe headwinds ahead and intends to preserve its cash flow (which is down $0.8 billion on a year over year) by spending $1.2 billion this year in CapEx, down 20% from $1.5 billion in 2019.For the first quarter of 2020, Halliburton predicts a margin decline of 1.25-1.5% for the Completion and Production segment. Also, the Drilling and Evaluation margins could drop by 2.00-2.5%.It is not what I am calling a ""perfect blue sky,"" and the risk of getting a mixed bag next quarter is quite high.Technical Analysis (short term)Source: Finviz and Fun Trading interpretations.HAL is forming an ascending wedge pattern with line resistance at $25.90 and line support at $23.70. Ascending wedge patterns are considered mostly bullish and show successive lower lows, as described in the chart above. However, the risk of a support breakout now is elevated.It will depend on future oil prices, which is uncertain with an overall bearish situation and potential of spikes due to geopolitical events and risks.If oil prices continue to weaken, HAL will probably experience a breakout soon. In this case, I believe HAL will quickly retest the $19.30 lower resistance. Conversely, HAL could get a boost if oil prices resume their bullish trend. In this case, HAL will retest $25.90 and eventually could cross-resistance and go to $28+, but I do not see it happening.The basic strategy is to cautiously buy at support and wait to see if support is holding to buy a little more and sell about 40% at resistance (depending on your potential gain) and wait for further development.Author's note: If you find value in this article and would like to encourage such continued efforts, please click the ""Like"" button below as a vote of support.

4318272,31441,2020-01-22T08:55:31-05:00,"HAL's Q4 revenue from North America fell over 20% Q/Q. The region still represents over 40% of total revenue.Cost cuts helped preserve EBITDA margins, but they may not be able to fully offset future revenue declines.I question the quality of HAL's earnings.Sell HAL.","Source: FortuneHalliburton (HAL) reported Q4 revenue of $5.19 billion, GAAP EPS of -$1.88 and non-GAAP EPS of $0.32. The company beat on revenue and earnings, and the stock fell slightly after the report. I had the following takeaways on the quarter.North America land drilling has been good to Halliburton, Baker Hughes (BKR) and Schlumberger (SLB) over the years. The segment faltered in the second half of 2018 and has faced headwinds ever since. Halliburton reported total revenue of $5.2 billion, down 6% sequentially. This followed a 6% decline in Q3.Revenue from two of Halliburton's four key regions declined. North America fell hard with a decline of over 20%; an oversupply of the gas market weighed:The U.S. is likely at peak economy. In the past OPEC supply cuts helped spike oil prices and spur E&P. If oil markets have to rely on consumer demand and/or industrial activity, then they could face headwinds for most of 2020. North America represented 45% of total revenue, down from 53% in Q3. It remains Halliburton's largest segment and could remain a drag on top line growth for the foreseeable future.International markets were a bright spot. Total international revenue was $2.9 billion, up by double digits. Middle East/Asia saw increased activity across multiple product lines, and rising well construction in the North Sea. The segment grew revenue by 19%. Revenue from Europe/Africa/CIS rose in the mid-single-digit percentage range, driven by activity in the North Sea and Algeria. 2020 could be defined by growth abroad versus a pullback domestically.Halliburton's management is excellent at cutting costs amid waning demand. The company engaged in cost containment efforts for most of 2019; Q4 was no exception. The company generated run-rate cost savings of $200 million during the quarter. Halliburton also took a $2.2 billion pretax impairment charge to help adjust its cost structure to reflect market conditions. EBITDA during the quarter was $918 million, down 4% sequentially. Total operating costs actually declined 7%, which allowed EBITDA to fall less than revenue. EBITDA margin was 18%, up about 100 basis points versus Q3. Halliburton was able to improve margins, despite the continued diminution in its top line.Management has been aggressive in addressing the decline in E&P in the oil patch. However, North America is still 45% of total revenue and it could be difficult to fully offset future revenue declines. I anticipate a decline in EBITDA margins by the second half of 2020.HAL has an enterprise value of $29 billion and trades at 7.9x last 12 months EBITDA. Going forward, its business prospects could be subjected to the vagaries of the global economy. Costs cuts are nice; they do not trump organic revenue and earnings growth, in my opinion. I believe the economy has peaked, which makes HAL fully-valued at this juncture.HAL is down over 20% Y/Y, despite the rise in financial markets. More headwinds likely lie ahead. Sell HAL."
4318266,33291,2020-01-22T08:15:27-05:00,"Back in October, we called the bottom for Halliburton.Sideways action of late driven by oil prices taking a breather.HAL optimized performance in North America as the market softened, and the international business grew for the second year in a row.We remain mildly bullish in 2020.","You may recall that back in October, we called the bottom for Halliburton (HAL). It was rather contrarian at the time but we are always on the lookout for names that are simply beaten down too far. It is part of our investing philosophy, finding names left for dead and profiting from the reversal. When we saw the stock touch decade-lows in the $17 range, given the price of oil, demand metrics, revenue impacts, and earnings, we felt that the worst was behind the stock. After the run-up, we felt that a $28 price target was reasonable, though we admitted the path to getting here may not be a straight line. With oil prices relaxing a bit in the last week or so, HAL stock has cooled a touch. That said, we remain bullish, and the most recent performance of the company, which we will discuss, supports this view.The company just reported its Q4 earnings, we saw a top- and bottom-line beat versus consensus estimates. The improvement in oil pricing that began in late fall is why performance was so strong, and was a key reason we were buying heavily when prices were in the high teens. Performance in Q4 was impressive, despite the start of Q4 having weak oil pricing. The second half of Q4 saw the ramp-up in pricing, and this led to beats relative to expectations.The fact of the matter is that you need to understand that oil prices are so strongly linked to performance of the company and the stock. As such, with wild moves in oil prices in recent years, the stock has taken it on the chin. Let us be clear. Businesses, and not those just in the oil sector, would like higher pricing, but what they really would like is more stable pricing. The stability removes a layer of uncertainty. The uncertainty makes decisions like capex and labor planning all that much harder. That said, Q4 saw weak pricing to start, and then pricing ramped up. Revenues actually were as expected down heavily from a year ago, declining 12.6% and registering at $5.19 billion in the quarter. Here is the recent Q4 trend:Source: SEC filings, graphics by BAD BEAT InvestingAs you can see, we saw a decline which we anticipated but was a lower decline than what was expected. At $5.19 billion, the company surpassed the consensus by $40 million versus consensus projections. The beat was welcomed. But where were the revenues generated from? Understanding trends driving these issues is important. Drilling down we can see where the strength and weakness resides.There was a divergence in operating segment performance relative to the sequential quarter. We saw lower revenues sequentially from Q3 2019 in the Completion and Production segment. Revenue here was $3.1 billion, a decrease of $448 million, or 13%. The decline stemmed from lower activity and pricing in multiple product service lines in North America land, primarily associated with stimulation services, coupled with reduced stimulation services in Latin America and well intervention services in the Middle East.Over in the Drilling and Evaluation segment, we saw improvement from the sequential quarter. Revenue came in at $2.1 billion, an increase of $89 million, or 4%. There was increased activity in all product service lines in Middle East/Asia, coupled with increased drilling activity in Europe/Africa/CIS and year-end software sales globally, while North America saw reduced activity. If it is not obvious, there is a growing dichotomy between North America and International performance.As we look to 2020, we are mostly interested in regional growth. International expansion was shown for the second year in a row, which is helping to offset the declines in North America. North America revenue in the fourth quarter of 2019 was $2.3 billion, a 21% decrease from the sequential quarter. The action is promising internationally. The company is successfully executing its strategy of controlling what expenses it can control and managing the business to perform well in any market conditions. International revenue was $2.9 billion, a 10% increase.We want to remind you, as we feel that it is important, when oil prices declined from 2014 forward, Halliburton worked diligently to cut expenses. Expenses have been well managed, but again, management has clearly stated that it is committed to further cuts. While the company cannot control pricing, it can control to a large degree expenses. This expense control ability was reflected in Q4, as adjusted operating income was $546 million, which was up 2% from the sequential quarter. Factoring in both the revenue being slightly better than expected, and all sources of expenses being less than expected, earnings per share were ahead of projections, though down from last year:Source: SEC filings (linked above), graphics by BAD BEAT InvestingAdjusted net income came in at $285 million, or $0.32 per diluted share. This compares to $0.34 taken in the sequential quarter. Most notably, this was a solid beat versus consensus of $0.29 per share, and $0.01 ahead of our own expectations.As we move into 2020, we expect modest improvement in earnings each quarter relative to 2019.Oil prices are higher than they were in Q3 2019, and we think that the U.S. trade tension with China has eased helping matters. While tensions with Iran were a big boost, that has fizzled. Chinese oil demand is already at a record high and will only get higher. Pricing has improved about 10-15% since Q3, and that is pretty bullish, and is a few dollars ahead of where it was a year ago.Halliburton continues to control costs, even as oil has rebounded a bit. Halliburton will reduce capital spending by 20% this year, to $1.2 billion, as North American customers further slash spending. It will recognize $50 million of the charges in the current quarter. The U.S. rig count has fallen by roughly 24% to 796 in the past year. Halliburton exited 2019 with 22% less working frack equipment than it began the year. Factoring in rig counts and contracts that we know were in place, as well as Brent at $65 per barrel, we are preliminarily looking for $22.0-23.95 billion for 2020 revenues at this juncture. Note, this could be flat to down from 2019. On an EPS basis, should expenses continue to be controlled, we are estimating $1.25-$1.45 per share in earnings in 2020. This would be low growth from 2019.We remain mildly bullish on the name for 2020, and after gains of 30% plus, we are cautious. We are proficient traders, and although we like Halliburton as a long-term investment, even at these levels, we understand that our traders do not want to leave juicy gains on the table. Those who do hold onto the stock for more potential oil-related upside will be paid a 3% dividend yield. We also believe that selling covered calls is a good option in this name against your position if you are neutral to very mildly bullish. We reiterate a price target of $28 on the stock."
4335534,25120,2020-04-01T17:18:54-04:00,"After years of stagnation and struggles, the coronavirus has the potential to bankrupt the oil E&P service industry.Halliburton is no exception despite currently profitable operations as there is no easy way for the oil glut to resolve, while debt is high.Ironically, a substantial part of the debt comes from a failed takeover attempt when Halliburton was (too) confident.Essentially shares are a gamble on a positive survival of the company through the crisis, with no imminent developments warranting a bullish thesis.","Halliburton (HAL) has been hit very hard just like all of its peers and eventually its end clients. Shares peaked in their $70s in 2014 amidst the boom of the US shale sector, they fell to their twenties in the aftermath of that bust, actually recovered to $60 and now trade at $6 and change. These levels are a true testament of the challenges faced by management and reveal how low expectations of investors are.Quite frankly, shares now represent more or less a call option on the survival of the company while investors can only hope this is a realistic path. Without a recovery (and without incurring too much dilution) the situation is simply very bleak.To understand where the company and its shares now are, we have to have a look at the operations and the current financial performance. In January, Halliburton reported its 2019 results, as the GAAP numbers were impacted by another set of multi-billion impairment charges.For the year, Halliburton reported a more than 6% fall in sales to $22.4 billion. These revenues are split across activities and geographical coverage. Completion and production is the largest segment with $14 billion in sales and saw the big decline in revenue last year, while drilling and evaluation reported a modest increase in sales to $8.4 billion.The company is largely reliable on North America, yet that reliance has been coming down a bit with sales down amidst capital spending cuts across the shale industry. Sales in North America fell 18% last year to $11.9 billion, while sales in Latin America, Europe, Middle East & Africa all were up year-over-year.More important is the margin base of these activities. Halliburton reported an operating loss of $448 million, yet that includes $2.51 billion in impairment charges, suggesting that EBIT otherwise came in at $2.06 billion. If not for these charges, the company would have reported earnings of $1.08 billion, or $1.24 per share with 876 million shares outstanding.The issue is of course that of the net debt load. Fortunately, the company ended 2019 with nearly $2.3 billion in cash and equivalents, providing quite some liquidity. The issue is that of $10.3 billion in debt, for an $8.0 billion net debt load, which kindly excludes a billion in operating lease liabilities as well.Note that with EBIT of $2.1 billion (on an adjusted basis) and regular depreciation and amortization charges totaling about $1.6 billion, I end up with a $3.7 billion EBITDA number for 2019, for a reasonable 2.2 times leverage situation, at least that was the situation back in 2019.Remember that shares of Halliburton started 2020 at just $25 per share as expectations were already low at the time. Given the share count of 878 million shares, this still represented a $22 billion equity valuation, or about $30 billion enterprise value. Equity is now valued at just around $5 billion, yet given the steep debt load, the company is still valued at $13 billion.Excluding impairments, the company was still solidly profitable as it posted margins around 10% last year and this is encouraging, although capital spending essentially already equaled depreciation charges in 2019, thereby not allowing for additional cash flows from net divestments, even with topline sales already under pressure. The company already guided for 2020 capital spending to fall to $1.2 billion when it announced the fourth quarter results, yet it is looking to cut this number further, as well as furloughed 3,500 workers for about 2 months to come.This is much-needed as the company is far smaller than it has been in the past. Remember that this was a +$30 billion business with EBIT of $5 billion during better times amidst the US shale boom, yet the current situation is much more dire than that previous downturn as the degree of oversupply is much greater now, while demand has fallen away as well.It will just be a guess what oil at $20 and the current conditions will do on the performance of Halliburton, but one should not be surprised to see the business losing a third or perhaps half of sales if conditions last for a while. Amidst these conditions, the company should of course freeze hiring, cut on spending as well as halt the dividend and suspend share repurchases.So basically in 2019 the company was demonstrating on about $2 billion in EBIT on $22 billion in sales. Assuming an $8 billion net debt load and about $400 million in interest expenses, as well as a 20% tax rate, the company could earn about $1.50 per share as this should easily support a $25 valuation. This was similar as levels we have seen in the shares at the start of the year, as those levels were far from peak times for the oil industry of course. Note that 2019 was a soft year already as the question is if the bright times for the sector return, with secular headwinds from renewable energy really starting to have an impact. Ironically, the long-term payback periods of renewable energy periods make that current low global interest rates favor long-term renewable investments over short-term energy investments.The question is what the downturn could look like, if the company will survive, and if the survival has implications in terms of dilution for equity investors. While net debt is high in absolute and relative terms, with EBITDA pressured in 2020 to a yet unknown degree, the good news is that there is liquidity and that the underlying business was profitable in 2019. It is further very ironic that half of the current net debt load stems from the steep break-up fee paid to Baker Hughes (NYSE:BKR) during that merger attempt, which actually might have better odds to make it through this period of turmoil without serious implications.The improved oil pricing simply has to come from an end to the coronavirus crisis across the globe, and more production constraints not just by OPEC yet shale players as well. The issue with shale players is that this is not a cartel and while depletion is not going quick enough to curb supply, this makes that absence of a quick solution to the coronavirus crisis, a deal with OPEC most likely is required.Basically we have established that a return to ""normal"" as seen in 2019 would justify a $25 per share valuation, with shares now trading at $6 and change. This means that the market is currently attaching a low estimate to return to normal without going bankrupt, or the market assumes that shareholders have to incur a lot of dilution along the way. This could severely impact the $25 per share valuation in my base case, in case of a recovery.The bad news is that leverage will increase a lot yet given the unprecedented times and importance attached to the energy sector, as larger players such as Halliburton with liquidity might be able to last longer and be eligible for some sort of support. Indirect support could come from purchases for the Strategic Petroleum Reserves, and perhaps direct through other measures as well.Hence, equity at this point almost represents a call option on a quick turnaround of the coronavirus, a brokered deal with OPEC, or perhaps receive support or be part of M&A activity (although the latter does not solve the entire situation either).With call options to the upside still being very richly priced, I notice that the $10 call for January 2021 trades around $1.50. Hence, one with an opportunistic view perhaps is better off simply holding the shares, recognizing that the situation is very speculative, with no silver linings to drive immediate appeal here."
4333949,103610,2020-03-24T14:59:25-04:00,Halliburton has fallen through multi-year lows with the collapse in oil prices.The company has been doing what is necessary to survive this sharp downturn.We discuss a recovery business framework that is likely to evolve post-Virus that is supportive of a recovery in its shares.We also discuss issues relevant to America's continued production from shale resources.,"Halliburton (HAL) is one of the key suppliers to the upstream oil and gas industry. Upstream oil has been suffering of late, dampening HAL's fortunes and stock price.To say that upstream oil has suffered of late is certainly an understatement. We will soon enter the 7th year of a record-breaking decline in upstream oil activity dating from mid-2014. Seven years! How many industries have had to weather a storm like that? There may be parallels, but I can't think of any.Companies like Halliburton have a history of funding capex to meet the last marginal barrel of oil development. It's not just them, this an industry plague: fronting capex and hiring to meet anticipated demand. Who else does this? It's nuts. But it is the way the industry has operated since time began. Note the optimism in Hally's 2014 Q-2 CC with then Chairman and CEO, Dave Lesar presiding.SourceOne can forgive Dave's historically wrong optimism in light of the double-digit growth they had experienced annually over the prior decade as oil had ramped to $120/bbl. Not content with throwing investor's capital down the well building frac equipment into a market that was getting ready to collapse, Dave would shortly announce the multi-billion-dollar acquisition of Baker Hughes INTEQ. We all know how that turned out. It added $3.5 billion to their long-term debt as they began to struggle with perpetual decline.The point of the preceding couple of paragraphs was to illustrate how clueless the industry was about the cataclysm that was about to envelop them. It shouldn't have been that hard to predict, particularly for a company that pays big bucks for market research. But, no one did. Not a single company in mid-2014 was preparing for the reality the next six years turned out to be.Seven years in which the company has lost 92.5% of its 2014 value. So, it takes a fair amount of chutzpah for me after a track record like that, to now come to you and say Hally is a buy.Investing is a lot about looking past what's happening today to see what might happen in the future. So, along with a thesis for Hally, we'll discuss our take on the next few months in the oil market.As I noted in a recent article, there is just an ocean of oil headed this way, from across the oceans. I'll let that article speak for itself here and only emphasize the point... we're going to have to work through some inventory before oil will get much of a lift. But, work through it we will.Shale production continues to defy gravity, although there are signs this may taper off soon, as activity declines. This continued buoyancy puzzles our major oil-producing competitors - OPEC and Russia. Where is the discipline in North American shale producers? Why will we continue to produce when we are losing money?The oligarchies involved simply cannot fathom the wild west market that reigns over here. A market with 100s of producers, all looking to scratch out whatever they can daily, from the dry Texas dust. By comparison, two people have the power to control the rate of flow of about 20% of global oil production. If Vladimir Putin and MbS say flip the switch, the switch gets flipped, and, of course, as in the current post - Vienna scenario, if they say... open the tap, well you know.The shale producers in Texas, unable to self-regulate, have taken the unprecedented step of asking the state to do it for them. I almost dropped my gum when I read this. The most independent, pure capitalist bunch of people on the planet are looking to the government for help. We are really in trouble when this bunch of snuff-chewing, free spirited individualists are casting tearful eyes toward Austin or even further east, toward D.C.They, clearly, have taken leave of their senses and forgotten one of the key underlying rules of the universe. TNSTAAFL (There's No Such Thing As A Free Lunch), meaning in this case help - of this sort, will leave them worse off than they perceive themselves being now. It's disappointing they are looking East for salvation, but I get it. Many are on the verge of foundering on the shoals of finance and are looking for a lifeline. We need only to look at past attempts to regulate our domestic oil market to catch a clue about the efficacy of dealing with the Gubba-mint.Production controls are the inverse of price controls, last time tried with oil in the early 1970s, ironically in response to actions by Saudi Arabia to bolster prices of crude oil. Anybody remember how that worked?EIANote the direction of the curve between 1970 and 1980 and you have your answer. Incentives to drill and produce here in the U.S. were largely destroyed. This idea is probably only topped in sheer lunacy by the one that came after it.The Windfall Profits Tax of the 1980s. The level of corruption and malfeasance that this loony attempt to regulate the oil set new records in an industry where a bit of 'fudging' has always been the norm. I know, I was a part of it as a crude oil buyer for an independent refinery. Now that the statute of limitations has expired, I may someday tell some stories from this era.OK, you folks didn't logon to this page for a history lesson. Suffice it to say, price/production controls never have their desired effect because at the end of the day, Mr. Market will take care of oversupply. Ruthlessly.One other quick topic before we move to what you paid your nickel to read, a thesis to buy into Halliburton at current levels.Collaboration between OPEC and shale producers. Danged, if I didn't drop my gum again. This story broke the other day and, honestly, I laughed so hard my dog began to bark at me. It had been a while since she'd see me laugh, given the market conditions we've seen.No way! I can't even believe that this discussion is being had outside of a B-School finance class. I am starting to chortle again as I write this, but I'm not going to develop this line of thought further. It is simply too absurd, and I think calmer heads will prevail before any serious discussions begin. Why spin your wheels, all of these good folks have more productive ways to spend their time.These parties have nothing in common save for the desire for a higher oil price. That is not a basis to form a cartel, which would be illegal in this country anyway. Why?The answer should be obvious... OPEC and U.S. Shale compete for many of the same customers. Has everyone forgotten the reason they raised output levels post-Vienna? It was because their U.S. market had declined 50% with soaring shale production, and the formerly oil-starved U.S had actually become a significant exporter to their remaining markets. The thought that under U.S. laws they could ""work"" together toward the common goal of raising prices or restricting production is just ludicrous.How about Big Red? Halliburton bit the bullet last fall and began writing down its shale equipment. It will continue to do so this quarter, I am confident. We are seeing a number of operating companies cut capex in response to declining market conditions; Schlumberger (SLB) just did it, and Hally just has now.SourceThis equipment will never burn another gallon of diesel, and there will be more of it as Halliburton CEO, Jeff Millar indicated in the Q4 call.SourceLast week, the company announced the furloughing of 3,500 employees. This is a positive sign as it conserves cash and maintains a core of key employees. The only reason to do this is because the company expects to need their skills in the not too distant future. A furlough is not a layoff, although it can turn into one. I lived through a few of these during my time in the oilfield, and unequivocally, I can tell you I preferred the shared sacrifice of the furlough to the unemployment line.Liquidity is the key here in making an investing decision. Generally, improving international markets had allowed the company to build a $2.3 billion cash position by year end in 2019. Additionally, it has $3.5 billion on a credit line available. For 2019, cash flow covered capex, dividends, and stock buybacks. Look for capex, dividends, and stock buybacks to be eliminated this quarter, providing the company with ample liquidity over the next year. In 2021, it has a big debt maturity - $697 mm, followed by a year of no debt coming due. In short, I don't think the company faces a solvency crisis as revenues crash this quarter.This makes the stock as current prices an outstanding buy for investors looking to average down their cost basis or make a bet on an improving market. I am adding at these levels.As we've established in prior articles, a number of things need to happen to breathe life into the oilfield service providers.1. Shale production must peak and start a decline. As noted above, we think this is underway and gradual slope downward will commence soon. Led by a decline in drilling activity which is uneconomic at current prices and followed by a continued decline in completion activity as frac spreads are idled. Worth noting, they dropped substantially to 280 last week as noted by Primary Vision.2. When the Covid-19 virus begins to crawl back into the hole from which it came and forecasts for oil demand start being raised, as opposed to being slashed. The decline in new cases recently seen in some of the early countries beset with this disease, China and Italy, give us hope that in a few weeks, we also will begin to report fewer cases.3. Long cycle projects need to be sanctioned. This was the breath of fresh air reported in most Q4 calls as, ""international activity."" This could take a pause as capex budgets are reeled in by the IOCs. But, perhaps not as much as feared as many international oil companies are national companies producing oil to meet significant chunks of domestic budgets. It's really too soon to tell how that will play out, but I don't foresee extended budget cutting by national companies, for the reason specified.Governments around the world are adapting to the new viral-reality. Trade is impacted, reducing demand. This won't last forever and as things begin to return to normal, demand for oil will pick up. Given the huge storage problem we are about to have, it will take some time before inventory levels come down.There is no way it will be ""business as usual."" I think profound changes are coming in supply chains, etc. But, the basic thesis for hydrocarbons remains intact, they supply an irreplaceable amount of energy for many key uses, transportation and power generation key among them.As the global economy recovers, this energy will be needed. And that creates an outstanding opportunity to buy shares of Halliburton at current prices. As I touch up this article for the free side, HAL shares have been up as much as 30% today. I have a buy in, but I am not chasing it. This rally is built on expectations of a government virus rescue package and not market fundamentals. I am suggesting patience and letting Hally come back to you."
4322776,53262,2020-02-10T09:30:00-05:00,"Several oil servicing companies can be nearing significant long-term bottoms.Schlumberger and Halliburton are two of the more established names with larger degree up-trends.Near-term setups for bounces that could grow into more.PTR could grow 5,760% over the next 4 decades.","Many oil servicing companies can be forming potentially significant long-term bottoming patterns.While some might need more of a bounce and then another low, there is potential to count larger corrections as complete even sooner, and at the very least, we see some good R:R setups for more ""bounces"" off recent lows.Before we get into the more detailed discussion of Elliott Wave counts, we will check in with our resident FA and Quant experts.From Lyn's desk:On the Quantitative side, our very own Harry Dunn shares with us:This fits with our cautious approach to scouting out the makings of long-term bottoms.Companies like Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) and Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) are heavily affected not just from the price in oil in a directional sense but also from volatility of that price. In comparing a longer-term chart of oil with the two companies, one can see how closely they correlate at times, but when oil gets particularly choppy, they get hit harder.However, as analyzers of sentiment, we avoid placing too much emphasis on correlation. It can work for a time and then completely disconnect. I like to think of things being ""in phase"" or ""out of phase"" viz sentiment and their EW patterns. Since mid-2013, many of the oil services companies discussed did not really participate in the 41-76 run for oil. Indeed, most peaked in a bounce around January 2018 and since January 2019 have been significantly diverging from oil. While oil has moved mostly sideways, oscillating between 50 support region and 65 resistance region, most of these names have leaked steadily lower. Out of phase with oil, but in phase with each other.Most of the charts are also at or near historic bottoming regions for P/S ratio. Metrics like this tend to work well long term as a type of oscillator, and while talking about reversion to mean for various metrics, we tend to see things plodding back and forth between extremes.With that ""out of phase"" non-correlation we discussed earlier in mind, the potential for a near-term bounce+ in oil seems less crucial, but still it couldn't hurt. Whether from the current 49 low or from a bit closer to 46/47, oil should get at least a corrective bounce toward 57-59.VanEck Vectors Oil Services (NYSEARCA:OIH) holds about 24 stocks, but SLB alone is a whopping 19.66% of net assets. With HAL another 10.42%, the names discussed here represent exactly 49% of OIH. While we say ""each chart on its own,"" the patterns off the 2014 between OIH and SLB and HAL are nearly identical. Since we already saw that the charts do not always correlate to the price of oil, maybe there is something else that is causing them to track so close. Perhaps, it is investor #sentiment and the perceptions of continued weakness that have caused them to decline in near lock-step.On OIH, it is possible to count the correction off 2014 as complete, but the pattern might ""look"" better with more of a bounce for a larger (4)th wave and then another low.Zooming in below shows the ideal path for the possible C up of (4) for OIH, and we will be watching for clues that it might be morphing into a more significant bottom.Schlumberger (SLB), as discussed in the video, has an extremely large degree Super Cycle (I.)-(II.). Similar to OIH though off the 2014 high, it might first need a Primary degree 4th wave bounce and then an attempt at another low, but the pattern for the (C.) wave up inside that ""bounce"" has great R:R and is certainly tradable.With the (C.) of P.4 targeting the 46 region, that is roughly a 34% gain from here over the next 6-12mo. On top of that, SLB currently pays a 5.7% dividend yield! Since we have clear support that needs to hold at 32.95, that gives us approximately 1:10 Risk:Reward, not including the dividend!Transocean (NYSE:RIG) and Diamond Offshore (DO) are in similar fifth waves off 2018 consolidations. They both allow for B-wave bounces inside the fifths, but both have high probabilities of making new lows, and those final lows can be fairly extreme. I consider them far more riskier than SLB and HAL.National Oilwell Varco (NYSE:NOV) has very similar C-wave up potential to OIH and SLB, but can then make another low.FMC Technologies (NYSE:FTI) has a similar large degree move up to NOV into its 2014 top, but likely only starting a Cycle b bounce but great R:R from a small retrace.FTI might give us several tradable swings off a support region in the 17s with support/invalidation just under 16 targeting 15%-20%, 20%-25%, and 30%-35% moves in progressively larger degree C-waves from the corresponding B-wave supports.Halliburton might be the most promising from the standpoint of immediate potential for the 5th of a Leading Diagonal pattern off the August 2019 low, which would be a strong indicator of a major bottom in place. HAL can more easily count as complete in a y wave for Super Cycle (II.) into that low just shy of a 50% retrace of the entire move up from December 2001. This initial green 5up would count best as only the wave (1) toward 27/28 off the recent low, inside an even larger wave one. The projected 5th wave toward 28 is close to a 30% gain that projects into March or April, should the recent low in the 21s hold.Core Laboratories N.V. (NYSE:CLB) is showing a similar ABC down to OIH and others near complete.PetroChina (NYSE:PTR) implies tremendous long-term Fibonacci extension potential in a high probability Cycle degree I-II setup. This name is highly volatile and not even a holding of OIH; its standard deviation is high, and that should certainly be a factor in sizing any positions.Zooming in the following chart shows the ideal sub-wave path off this 61.8% retrace in PTR for the start of Primary wave 1 inside the Cycle III. This is a great illustration of the Fractal nature of EW patterns, and just like this chart is looking initially for a ""1-2"" inside the (1)-(2) of an even larger Primary 1 to start the larger Cycle III... One can zoom in further on that 1-2 and look for a smaller i-ii and even a (i.)-(ii.) inside of that, which is what we will be doing in StockWaves.While not a directly related name, we posted about Marathon Petroleum (NYSE:MPC) in a February 3rd video for our StockWaves service and wanted to point out the little turn up from cited support.Also, it is not only the charts that are so similar..."
4320020,104714,2020-01-29T22:50:13-05:00,"Halliburton’s management expects the crude oil price to remain steady in 2020, which is a positive sign for the company’s business.However, North America will continue to remain subdued in Q1 2020, after exhibiting a weak performance in Q4 2019.An increasing share of the revenue from international markets will keep the company buoyant in 1H 2020.Although free cash flow can improve in 2020, a high debt-to-equity ratio can become a concern.","As Halliburton (HAL) increasingly diversifies its operations outside North America, it mitigates the risks arising from a North American slowdown. To protect margins, the company may not undertake projects and activities that provide low returns following the fracking and completions activity slowdown. Also, it is yet to clean up a leveraged balance sheet. However, the free cash flow (or FCF) is likely to improve in 2020 when capex falls. I suspect Halliburton stock price does not have enough catalysts to push it upwards in the short run.On the other hand, activity improvement, better pricing on new contracts and margin expansion in many of the international operations, particularly in the Drilling and Evaluation division, can mitigate some of the adverse effects. Halliburton has recently set a significant cost reduction target to improve margins. If the energy price environment improves, as expected by company management, it can get back in investors’ favor in 2H 2020.Although Halliburton is gradually shifting away from its revenue base, it will continue to be one of the top energy equipment and service providers in North America. Since Q4 2018, the company’s revenues generated in North America declined from 62% to 45% in Q4 2019. With a possibility of reducing 10% further reduction in capex, operators are likely to allocate the budget on completions activity rather than on E&P activities. Considering the steady fall in the natural gas price in the past year, the outlook in North America does not evoke much optimism. As the operators adjust budget and prioritize activity, Halliburton will target projects that offer either relatively higher returns or higher utilization of existing fleets, which means it may not undertake projects and activities that provide low returns. While this can protect margins, the top line in North America is more likely to decline in Q1 2020.To reduce capital outlay and improve margin, HAL may focus on technology-centric solutions like integrated completions offering and the iCruise rotary steerable system. As the hydraulic fracturing activities fell out of favor, the company has started focusing on increasing revenues from services per well. Investors may note that despite the onshore market softness, the company’s revenues from wireline and perforating services, artificial lift and specialty chemical product lines increased by double digits, which is remarkable. Since fracturing activity has become relatively less profitable, Halliburton is restructuring the ways to lower unit costs and improve margins.In recent times, multiwell pad penetration, increase in well lateral length and higher proppant use caused redundancy in pressure pumping services, which resulted in horsepower attrition in the market in 2019 compared to a year ago. The U.S. onshore rig count decreased by 11% in Q4 compared to Q3. Consequently, the company retired 22% of the available fracturing horsepower by the end of 2019, which will allow it to maintain a balance between equipment supply and anticipated demand in 2020. I will discuss the cost side of the initiatives in the following section.As a result of the pressure pumping and well construction activity weaknesses discussed above, Halliburton’s revenues from North America declined by 21% in Q4 compared to Q3. However, completion tool sales in the Gulf of Mexico did improve in Q4. We may be quite far from the end of this cycle. In early 2020, the service industry can augment the working fleets by cannibalizing idle equipment for parts and new sideline pumps. Ultimately, the total available horsepower capacity in the market needs to come down for profitable existence of the OFS companies.In Q4, Halliburton started a $300 million annualized cost savings and service delivery improvement strategy through personnel reduction and real estate rationalization. As a part of its strategy, the company is also exiting operations in which returns have fallen below its expectations. To that regard, in Q4, it recognized $2.2 billion of impairments charges (pre-tax) associated with pressure pumping and legacy drilling equipment. As a result of the decline in the asset base, it saved $35 million by way of a reduction in depreciation and amortization expense, which added $0.03 to the EPS.Halliburton’s management is relatively bullish about the crude oil price in 2020. Energy demand, according to company management, will remain steady, while U.S. energy production is likely to plateau due to capex curtailment. On top of that, the geopolitical factors, after discounting into the pricing, would keep it at an elevated level.So far, however, U.S. crude oil production has maintained its high growth rate. It grew by 9.4% in the U.S in the past year, while in the rest of the world it decreased by 2.5% during this period. Crude oil price has increased by 11% in the past year. Typically, the price stability would encourage the oilfield equipment & service (or OFS) providers, although lower U.S. production will hamper their healthy revenue and margin potential.The EIA expects crude oil prices to increase from the current level to $65 per barrel in 2020 and reach $68 per barrel in 2021, which is consistent with Halliburton’s forecast. Even Schlumberger’s (SLB) management believes that the tightening market fundamentals will be the primary driver of upward price pressures in the short-to-medium term. Before we see the upside from international energy markets, we must understand the North American side of the company’s business.As the international operation gains increasing prominence in HAL’s portfolio, I expect a considerable part of the North America deceleration will be compensated by growing international energy market activity. Halliburton's management expects international capex to increase by mid-single digits. The company expects to score a growth rate above the market capex growth as well as expand margin in 2020. I think the impending growth drivers will be the resolution of political issues in Latin America, an increase in the number of offshore project awards and natural gas activity expansion in the Middle East. The company’s Drilling and Evaluation division, in 2020, will benefit from the contracts in Norway and the rollout of the iCruise directional drilling platform. On top of that, I think higher utilization in the North Sea and the Asia Pacific will result in a higher operating margin in international markets in FY2020.In Q4, the most influential performer for Halliburton was the Middle East/Asia region, which saw revenues increasing by 18.5% sequentially. Higher pressure pumping activity in Australia and Asia, higher year-end incompletion tool sales and robust sales growth in multiple product service lines in India and China, along with the Middle East, resulted in the revenue jump. Latin America was relatively weak (1.6% sequential decline) due to decreased testing activity in Argentina. In Mexico and Colombia, however, performance improved in Q4 due to increased project management activity and higher tool sales.In contrast to North America, where pricing is still far from a recovery, pricing for its products and services is on an uptrend in international markets. With about one-third of the backlog coming from new contracts, the entire pricing economics is projected to move north with better pricing for new deals. I think with better capex management, improvement in pricing will mitigate much of the loss on the operating margin from North America.From Q3 to Q4, Halliburton’s Drilling and Evaluation (or D&E) segment revenues increased by 4.4%, while the segment operating margin inflated to 10.5% from 7.3%. The sales decline reflected an energy activity spurt in the Middle East/Asia. We can expect the D&E division revenue to continue to perform well in Q1 2020 following the international project commission and the iCruise drilling platform rollout. The Completion and Production (C&P) division, on the other hand, saw a sharp revenue fall (12.8% down) in Q4 compared to a quarter. The segment operating margin, however, remained firm in Q4.Halliburton has kept its dividend nearly unchanged for the past several quarters at $0.18 quarterly dividend per share, which amounts to a 3.0% dividend yield. That is lower than Schlumberger’s forward dividend yield of 5.4%.Halliburton’s free cash flow declined in FY2019 (19% down) compared to FY2018. Although the year-over-year cash flow from operations (or CFO) declined more sharply than the revenue fall in FY2019, lower capex and a modest improvement in working capital mitigated the drop in CFO partially.In FY2020, Halliburton expects to reduce capex by 20% from FY2019 to ~$1.2 billion. In FY2020, it plans to invest capex in the Production Group businesses, including manufacturing a chemical plant in Saudi Arabia and expanding the artificial lift product line. In the first half of FY2020, the need for working capital can increase. However, I think lower capex can lead to higher FCF in FY2020. Halliburton’s debt-to-equity ratio is 1.06x, which is higher than Schlumberger's (0.63x), TecnipFMC’s (FTI) (0.38x ) and Baker Hughes’s (BKR) (0.2x).Halliburton is currently trading at an EV-to-adjusted EBITDA multiple of 8.1x. Based on sell-side analysts’ EBITDA estimates, the forward EV/EBITDA multiple is 8.3x. Between FY2015 and now, the stock’s average EV/EBITDA multiple was 11.5x. So, it is currently trading at a discount to its past average.Halliburton’s forward EV-to-EBITDA multiple expansion versus the adjusted trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA is steeper than peers, which justifies the stock’s lower EV/EBITDA multiple compared to its peers’ (SLB, BKR and FTI) average of 8.9x. I have used estimates provided by Seeking Alpha in this analysis.According to data provided by Seeking Alpha, 25 sell-side analysts rated HAL a “Buy” in January 2020 (includes “Very Bullish”), while five recommended a “Hold.” Two recommended a “Sell” (includes “Very Bearish”). The consensus target price is $27.30, which, at the current price, yields ~24% returns.A year ago, Halliburton was critically dependent on the North American energy market (~60% of its revenue coming from North America). After Q4 2019, it is widely diversified, with more than 55% of its revenue generated from outside North America. So, the diversification strategy has lowered risks and should put a premium on HAL’s stock market price going forward.There are enough headwinds in North America. I think the upstream capex rationalization and reduced capacity in pressure pumping will lower Halliburton’s revenue in North America in 1H 2020. On the other hand, activity improvement, better pricing on new contracts and margin expansion in many of the international operations can mitigate some of the adverse effects. Much of the improvement would emanate from the Drilling and Evaluation division in Q1 2020.Halliburton has undertaken cost reduction initiatives by returning the underutilized equipment (primarily pressure pumping capacity) and restructuring management structure and operating facilities. The company’s balance sheet carries the weight of more debt than equity, which exposes the balance sheet to financial risks. If, however, the free cash flow improves led by lower capex, the risk factor will be partially offset. I suspect Halliburton stock price does not have enough catalysts to push it upwards in the short run, but with significant operational restructuring and cost-cutting measures, it can be back in investors’ favor in 2H 2020."
4318187,92586,2020-01-21T19:07:32-05:00,"Halliburton's 4Q19 earnings report provided further evidence that the energy services sector will play hardcore defense in 2020.North America revenues slid a whopping 30% YOY, but the company did an impressive job at keeping margins afloat.If I had to pick my poison, I would probably favor an investment in Schlumberger over Halliburton.","If there was any doubt earlier, it is official now: the energy services sector will play hardcore defense in 2020, in an attempt to boost earnings amid a highly unfavorable oil and gas drilling and production environment in North America.Further evidence came from Houston-based operator Halliburton (HAL). The company reported 4Q19 results on January 21, ahead of the opening bell. The modest all-around beat drew attention away from a YOY revenue drop of nearly 13%, the most severe of the past 12 quarters. Considering Halliburton's plans to ""focus on returns over growth"" in the home continent over the next 12 months, more top-line softness should be expected in the foreseeable future. Credit: Energy DigitalHalliburton's results and narrative did not differ much from those shared by key peer Schlumberger (SLB), only a few days ago. The international business grew as expected, reflecting a pickup in oil and gas drilling and production needed to replenish global reserves. The Middle East and Asia performed particularly well, while Latin America suffered from low levels of activity in Argentina. Europe may very well have benefited from a mild winter, as well construction looked solid in the North Sea.But North America, representing 53% of Halliburton's revenues in 2019 (down from 60% in the previous year), struggled due to a severely depressed onshore market. Pricing in pressure pumping and well construction seems to be in the gutter, and not even a more favorable deepwater environment in the Gulf of Mexico was enough to prevent segment revenues from sliding a whopping 30% YOY compared to Schlumberger's much tamer 13% decline. CEO Jeff Miller summarized the current state of the industry well:Source: DM Martins Research, using data from earnings releaseGiven the industry-level challenges, all that Halliburton could do was protect its margins by stacking equipment, reducing fixed costs, and improving efficiency whenever possible. This seems to have happened in 4Q19, as total company op margin improved by about 30 bps YOY. I believe early signs that Halliburton can tighten its belt and streamline operations successfully is the key driver behind the three-cent EPS beat in 4Q19 and modestly bullish market reaction to the company's earnings report.As I stated in my Schlumberger earnings review article, I do not think that pound-the-table bullishness in the energy services sector is easily justifiable. In the case of Halliburton, half of its business is undergoing perhaps the most severe trough in activity since the start of the current oil and gas downcycle, about five years ago. The company should be commended for having maintained margins and cash generation afloat so far, but the narrative for 2020 seems downbeat otherwise.Data by YChartsBecause I am a firm believer in the benefits of diversification, I defend that holding energy stocks in a well-diversified portfolio might still make sense. But if I had to pick my poison, I would probably favor an investment in Schlumberger over Halliburton, since the former's operations are better diversified outside North America. In addition, SLB offers an enticing dividend yield of over 5% that should keep investors entertained while they wait for the tides to turn, maybe in the second half of the year."
4314756,102107,2020-01-04T07:30:00-05:00,"We conclude our year-end Marketplace Roundtable series with the second half of our look at value investing in 2020.There are mixed views on the state of the market and what that implies for value investing as an approach.But our panel shares the opportunities they see available in today's market, ranging from sectors like energy to smaller niches and approaches.","2019 finishes with an extra kick for investors. Part of that is the continued strong run of the market, erasing memories of last year's near bear market and extending the decade-long bull. There also are plenty of market headlines and events that have sprung over the end of the year, from Phase 1 trade deals to M&A to political whirlwinds and more.More trivially, the 2010s are ending and the 2020s begin. It has been quite a decade for equity investors, with the S&P 500 returning more than 250% in that time. Even underperformance could leave a portfolio in good shape, and any alpha that was found would really leave investors well off.Where does that leave investors and the markets for 2020, at the start of a new decade? That's what we try to answer in our annual Marketplace Roundtable series. We are publishing roundtable discussions featuring more than 80 authors from across the spectrum of investing styles and focuses you find on Seeking Alpha: Macro to value investing, small cap to energy, gold to quant and alternative strategies, and more.Today's discussion is the second part of a two-part focus on value investing, our most popular category for this year-end series, perhaps due to the wide definition the style can cover. We're featuring the following panel:Questions are in bold header font, and disclosures are available at the bottom of the article.Michael Wiggins de Oliveira: Investing is less about ''market timing'' and more about ''time in the market."" Investors have irrational concerns about where the market is headed. Instead, they should think that they are deploying their families' hard-earned savings into a business that has strong cash flow potential and not paying a lot for the businessJeffrey Himelson: I believe we have some legs left in this bull market. Economic indicators remain strong. The unemployment rate is low, consumer spending is robust, debt levels are modest and there's still significant capital sitting on the sidelines. With the sentiment among investors being tepid over the past few years, valuations haven't reached absurd levels. To analogize to baseball, I believe we're in the sixth or seventh inning of this bull market.David Trainer: The market is flashing warning signs of an impending downturn. The market is already in an earnings recession, and it’s actually worse than it looks on the surface. GAAP earnings are down just 1% over the trailing twelve month period, but core earnings, which remove Earnings Distortion (non-recurring or unusual items) are down 6% over the TTM period. As it stands, earnings distortion is positive (meaning reported earnings are overstated) for the first time since 2007, and the highest it has been since 2000. We think all investors will remember what happened shortly after 2007 and 2000.Ranjit Thomas, CFA: Yes, last year's drop was an overreaction to rising rates. However, so is this year's rise due to falling rates. We've had stocks like Apple (AAPL) double in the last few years even as its operating earnings are flat, driven by buybacks and multiple expansion. Do you buy the stock market at a 25x PE or 4% earnings yield (yes, that's what it is if you don't back out pro-forma adjustments) against a 1.9% Treasury rate? TINA!Cory Cramer: For the past two years I've written over 60 bearish articles on high-quality, overpriced stocks, yet, I've suggested investors stay fully invested and hold defensive stock ETFs instead of cash. This strategy has worked extremely well for the past two years. Unfortunately, many classical defensive stocks are now expensive as well. Most value right now can found in beaten-down cyclicals, but they can still drop more if the economy rolls over (and they can do so without much warning). I'm continuing to stay defensive and buying select cyclicals, however, timing is going to matter more as we draw closer to the end of the macro cycle.Paulo Santos: My view is that the US market is significantly overpriced vs. many other world markets.Chris DeMuth Jr.: Where does the broad US equity market go next? I'm fairly certain no one knows and very certain that I don’t. Looking at its history, it has had a negative return from this total market capitalization relative to US GDP. The CAPE ratio is over 77% above its historical mean. The US CAPE ratio is higher than all but two other country markets – Ireland and Denmark. So, I don’t expect any particular tailwind from owning US stocks generally.Quad 7 Capital: Yes for years we have heard this. The thing is, it won't be true until it happens. We thought it was beginning a year ago this time, and instead, we came out and recommended some names that had been smashed like AT&T (T) and Phillip Morris (PM) as great names to pick up given the yield protection. Turned out, capital gains came with it. Now, that stated, until the economic data is consistently weak, we remain exposed. However, we have encouraged our members to be in 20%-30% cash and be well rounded. We believe that it will take a myriad of events to really give us a true stoppage of the music. We would like a 10% correction so we can do more buying. But longer term, we do think a bear market is pending, and we think the catalyst will be the US elections.Daniel Jones: It really depends. I see two scenarios here. One where trade wars remain or even worsen, and another where we truly do get past this. In the first case, a recession is inevitable, but perhaps 12 to 18 months away. In the second case, we could still be years away. Due to the economic recovery and subsequent growth under Obama and the continued growth under Trump (growth that in both administrations is slow to modest), there has been little chance for overcapacity to build up that might otherwise cause a recession. Absent a black swan event, then, or contamination from another major economy taking a hit, we could go on several years without another downturn.Michael Wiggins de Oliveira: My favorite lesson is that not only it is harder to avoid a loser than finding a winner, but that losers demolish your portfolio's returns. Never forget rule number 1: Don't lose money! An investor that's down just 25% needs a clean 33% return just to breakeven! Plus the amount of time it has taken to get back to breakeven. Having said that, the best analyst is only right two-thirds of the time. So it's about being humble enough to embrace failure, but at the same time attempting to avoid failure.Jeffrey Himelson: I learned that patience and dollar-cost averaging can be powerful tools so long as you continually check your thesis and confirm it remains intact. Over the course of 2019, I continued to purchase shares of Fitbit (FIT) and was able to average my cost down to around $4.30 per share. I believed the thesis was intact and haven't sold a single share. Going into the shareholder vote on the acquisition, I remain long, as I think there's still a chance a higher offer comes along and the stock is trading significantly below the $7.35 buyout offer price from Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Investors think that the DOJ may not approve this transaction, but in that case, investors are failing to take into account that FIT would receive $250M from Google and another entity, i.e. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), or a private equity firm (which wouldn't face the same antitrust scrutiny) could come along and snatch them up.David Trainer: Public markets still care about fundamentals and corporate governance. For years, investors complained about crazy unicorn valuations and unfair dual-class share structures, but they just kept buying each new IPO at higher and higher prices. We thought the same pattern would happen in 2019, but then Uber (UBER) and Lyft’s (LYFT) IPO’s flopped, and WeWork’s blew up on the launch pad. Public market investors have finally rediscovered the power they have to hold companies accountable for massive losses and conflicted governance. We expect them to they start using that power more for already-public companies like Tesla (TSLA) and Snap (SNAP) in 2020.Ranjit Thomas, CFA: Liquidity has an outsize contribution to stock prices. Don't fight the Fed!Cory Cramer: I spent a lot of time developing techniques to analyze stocks whose earnings are only partially cyclical. This is very useful because most investors do not take into account the moderate level of cyclicality found in many businesses. They also tend not to study a full cycle's worth of data when making their assumptions about the future earnings potential of a business (particularly now that the current macro cycle is longer than 10 years). Recognizing this phenomenon was my best lesson learned in 2019. Doing so helped me develop the ""full-cycle analysis"" which has been very useful.Paulo Santos: Not really a new lesson, but simply that markets - like the US market - can really run a lot on simple multiple expansion, even without significant fundamental improvement.Chris DeMuth Jr.: With expensive equity markets, more expensive credit markets, and very low returns on cash, I have been learning lessons about alternative asset classes. One major focus in 2019 has been our investments in SPACs and de-SPACed equities such as Broadmark (BRMK), one of my two favorite dividend payers. The company is well managed, unleveraged, and pays out a large monthly dividend. We were investors before day one and continue to own it and like it today. As the shareholder base turns over from SPAC investors to REIT investors, the stock is likely to continue to do well. As for next year, our major asset class focus for 2020 will be presented shortly on Sifting the World.Quad 7 Capital: We learned that everyone's style of investing is different and that there are many ways to reach the same goal. Although our service focuses on rapid return, short-term trades, we have had to make it clear that this approach should be used in tandem with others, that everyone should have a core, safe, moderate yield and growth portfolio on the long term, but that we need to directly tell followers this.Daniel Jones: Be patient, rely on the data, and things will inevitably sort themselves out. But don't be too patient when you see an idea you are convinced makes sense.Michael Wiggins de Oliveira: Truly does not matter. Buying up strong cash flow generating businesses and not paying a premium always works well over time. Everyone is looking for a ''get rich quick scheme'.' But even Warren Buffett only made the bulk of his money later in life. It takes time to build wealth.Jeffrey Himelson: I believe value as an investing trend will continue.David Trainer: For value as a factor to sustain a comeback, more investors must be equipped to perform real value analysis. As long as companies can manipulate their earnings and fool investors (as shown in a new paper from HBS & MIT Sloan), markets do not have a solid connection to core earnings power or value. Investors deserve a more holistic measure of value creation, one that comprehensively captures the underlying economics of businesses consistently across all companies. Investors also deserve a more holistic measure of stock market value, one that accurately measures the future cash flow expectations in asset prices. When investors have the right data to fully understand a company’s profits and valuation, a value strategy can outperform in any market.Ranjit Thomas, CFA: I think there has been a misunderstanding of what value is. A declining business with debt and a low PE is not value. I think true value has done quite well in the last decade, even as there has been froth in unprofitable growth.Cory Cramer: I think it's the start of a mini-trend, at least. Most really high-quality, steady-earning growth stocks are already nearly priced to perfection. With China and Brexit potentially moving to the back burner, there are cyclical values that can rise again before the end of the macro cycle. The tricky part is that value stocks that are priced low because their industry is being disrupted or they are over leveraged probably deserve to trade at low prices. So, picking and choosing is still important when selecting individual investments. Equal weighting the S&P 500 is the simplest way to play this theme without picking individual investments.Paulo Santos: It doesn't really matter, but as long as an investor is buying true value (high-quality companies at low valuations), value should outperform over time.Chris DeMuth Jr.: It doesn’t really matter. Value as a factor is not really what we mean by value - we’re looking at very specific firms at significant discounts to intrinsic value as well as specific corporate transactions that would unlock that value. Overall markets are just noise.Quad 7 Capital: It was sector specific. We found value in certain retail segments and in energy names. Other sectors, such as ""value in the cloud"" could face a lot more pressure. As an authority on short-term trading (weeks to months) it really does not matter where we were overall, there's always opportunity. Longer term, when we spot a deep value opportunity or value in a so-called compounder, then we would argue valuation metrics mean everything.Daniel Jones: Contrary to what some may think, value has been unpopular for a long time and it remains that way today. Long term, I don't really worry though, because value will always come back into play eventually. Just look at the cannabis sector. Market caps surged, but eventually came back down to Earth despite some very robust growth from those firms, because the value just was not there.Michael Wiggins de Oliveira: I never hedge my portfolio. If one needs to hedge an investment, that means the investment isn't a clear-cut value opportunity. Look for very easy investments, where the likelihood of failure is very small.Jeffrey Himelson: Since I'm young and have a high income and relatively low expenses, I'm seeking rapid appreciation and do not hedge portfolio risk very much. Moving forward, I will focus on generating some more cash flow with dividend paying stocks in my Roth IRA and that will be a hedge in the sense that it diversifies my portfolio a bit.Ranjit Thomas, CFA: It is important. Sell calls, short stocks.Cory Cramer: I don't hedge because my time frame for investments always extends beyond two years. I don't think I have much of an edge if I focus on shorter time frames than that. There are simply too many very smart market participants with more resources than me that focus their efforts on the shorter than two-year time frame. I do have certain triggers that I watch, which would cause me to move a large portion of my portfolio to cash if I determine a recession is imminent, though.Paulo Santos: Typically hedging could play a part, and portfolio risk would be balanced either by lower exposure (only including very undervalued situations) or by hedging with short positions. However, the current market has produced some situations which are so deep value that in my view a significant amount of hedging for those positions is not needed.Chris DeMuth Jr.: We short stocks to generate alpha. To hedge our portfolio, we’re pretty boring: We use cash and sizing discipline. With enough cash and with carefully-sized positions, we expect to be well positioned to weather market turmoil when it comes. When we have a quarter such as the one a year ago, we want to be able to be on offense, going through our shopping list of beaten-down bargains.Quad 7 Capital: Significantly important. Right now we have members hedging by building cash. We also recommend having 2%-3% of the total portfolio in precious metals, another 1%-2% in digital currency, and then we offer advanced strategies for maintaining and building capital. This can include specific options trades, playing income names, purchasing inverse funds, or playing volatility. A favorite levered play we like is TZA, and when the next real selloff gets going, our members stand to see their portfolios hold up well, if not make money. In the end, the best defense is being well rounded and able to quickly shift positioning.Daniel Jones: I don't personally hedge much. Sometimes I will engage in defensive hedging, but that's about it. Unless you have reason to believe something big will happen, and soon, it doesn't make much sense to hedge in my view.Michael Wiggins de Oliveira: Before making any consideration I always look at the balance sheet first and foremost. Then, I like to see businesses which generate so much cash that they regularly repurchase their own stock. The one factor I avoid is business which are very unprofitable and just as likely to make a loss and they are to make an income.Jeffrey Himelson: One of the first aspects of a company that I check is its management team. If I do not have trust in the management of a company, I will certainly not invest in that company.David Trainer: We invest unrivalled effort in calculating an accurate return on invested capital (NASDAQ:ROIC) for all stocks we consider for our Long Idea and Danger Zone reports. Improving ROIC is directly correlated with increasing shareholder value, and it should be a key metric in all investment decisions.Ranjit Thomas, CFA: Free cash flow (correctly calculated by excluding the stock comp add back) is very important.Cory Cramer: I always check earnings cyclicality first. That helps me determine what sort of technique I use to analyze the stock. IPOs always turn me away.Paulo Santos: The company needs to have both a stable to growing defensible business and be very cheap in terms of valuation. Large decreases in business activity with no thesis for an immediate turnaround turn me away, especially when mated with debt.Chris DeMuth Jr.: We always look for an explicit transaction for our capital to be returned. That can be an acquisition, spin-off, de-SPACing, or other event. All value investors want to buy $1s for $0.50, we also want to know how we’re going to get paid our dollar.Turnoffs include high management turnover. As an analyst, my job is to be an outsider with information and judgment that approximates insiders as closely as possible. If the insiders seem to be leaving as quickly as possible (WeWork, Tesla, etc.) that will turn me away.Quad 7 Capital: Without question it's management. As part of BAD BEAT Investing every Wednesday we have discussions with management teams of companies. Obviously they cannot disclose anything operationally which would violate SEC rules, but we do it to get a sense for their knowledge base, their communication skills, and experience. These are all aspects that make a strong poker player, and our general approach to investing is that it is one big poker game. Management is the player. You play the team, in conjunction with the statistics (valuation metrics), then make moves.Daniel Jones: I've come to prioritize cash flow about all else, especially relative to market value and enterprise value. Cash is king.Michael Wiggins de Oliveira: I used to be concentrated in investing. Then, my portfolio started to become more diversified. But presently, through my hard work, I have come to believe concentration suits me more: I want to be decisive and deploy significant capital behind a rare idea with a very positively skewed risk-reward profile.Jeffrey Himelson: I used to never believe in technical analysis, however, I've realized that since many investors do believe in technical analysis, it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy and it is prudent to read the charts. I primarily use technical analysis to determine an entry point to set my limit order to.David Trainer: We’ve added an Earnings Distortion Score to our research offerings this year.We measure Earnings Distortion using the proprietary data featured in research from Harvard Business School (HBS) and MIT Sloan. This research empirically concludes that street earnings estimates are incomplete and less accurate than earnings adjusted for the distortion that comes from items buried in the footnotes.Every week during the 2020 earnings seasons, we will publish a special Earnings Distortion Score for key companies reporting the following week. We will segment these companies into five categories:1. Strong Beat 2. Beat 3. Inline 4. Miss 5. Strong MissThese ratings indicate how likely companies are to beat or miss estimates based on how much their estimates contain unusual gains/losses which cause earnings to be over/understated.Ranjit Thomas, CFA: Not really. Maybe pay up a little bit more for good businesses.Cory Cramer: I've added the ""full-cycle analysis,"" which considers both market sentiment and earnings fluctuations for moderately cyclical stocks over the course of a full business cycle. This has allowed me to analyze a much wider range of stocks, which has, in turn, allowed me to invest in higher-quality businesses across the board because the universe of stocks I have from which to choose is now larger. I've also added a ""time until payback analysis."" This ignores market sentiment entirely and only focuses on the business' ability to pay for itself within a certain amount of time (typically, within eight years). And, right now, I'm working on a REIT analysis that utilizes a combination of ""time until payback"" using dividends, plus ""momentum sentiment"" from the market, to trigger buying and selling opportunities with REITs. This is useful because I've found that most investors don't fully understand the cyclical nature of REITs. I'll probably be writing on this topic much more in 2020.Paulo Santos: Not really. I'd desire to have more growth candidates for the portfolio, but growth has been overpriced for a while.Chris DeMuth Jr.: In one sense, I have not added any new steps or considerations to my investment process in the past decade. I know what I like to invest in, research intensively, and pull the trigger sparingly. But in another sense, my process changes as the opportunities shrink in some areas and grow in others. We have found the SPAC category particularly interesting this past year on both the long (BRMK) and short (WTRH) side.Quad 7 Capital: We have been running more calculations for members, and generally speaking, most of the time, offering options plays along with any stock we recommend (whether long or short). We also have been teaching people, since education is a key component of what we do.Michael Wiggins de Oliveira: Humility. Also, I'm super passionate about working hard and studying a lot.Jeffrey Himelson: I'm focused on growing my Roth IRA account with solid dividend paying companies and my taxable accounts with companies that will appreciate significantly in the next 1-3 years. I'm not focused on investments that may pay off in less than a year so I can take advantage of the lower tax bracket that long-term capital gains provides.David Trainer: We are dedicated to helping more investors combat earnings distortion.Earnings distortion from unusual items is an increasingly material force. For example, earnings for the S&P 500 were distorted by an average of 22% in 2018. In Core Earnings: New Data & Evidence, HBS and MIT Sloan professors show this distortion causes markets to be inefficient and that corporate managers purposely bury key data in footnotes to manipulate earnings.Only our research gives investors the tools they need to combat earnings distortion and manipulation, which recently reached levels not seen since right before the tech bubble and the financial crisis.Ranjit Thomas, CFA: Hold on to core positions and scour the market for additional opportunities.Cory Cramer: Unfortunately, timing the end of the economic cycle. If the market does rotate into value in the first half of 2020 and continues to rise at a quick pace, there won't be much value left in the market by mid 2020. Eventually, debt will become a problem for consumers, perhaps brought on more suddenly than expected if energy prices rise. The presidential election is another wild card. These dangers will start to converge by early summer. I expect I'll be taking profits in many of my individual positions by mid summer if the market keeps rising.Paulo Santos: As always, in finding new candidates to invest in which conform to the general philosophy of ""very cheap and with business being the same or better looking forward.""Chris DeMuth Jr.: One of our winners this year was a litigation stub that had a return of slightly more than 70% on a settlement that really split the difference between what the two sides thought that our case was worth. For 2020, I'm focusing on litigation as an asset class and five actionable equity investments with big upsides from potential litigation resolutions next year.Quad 7 Capital: Winning. And we think the elections in the US are going to be a much bigger catalyst than people think.Daniel Jones: I'm continuing to focus a lot on oil and gas.Michael Wiggins de Oliveira: My favorite idea is Bed, Bath, & Beyond (BBBY). On the surface (System 1) it is a retailer, which investors are avoiding investing in. But digging deeper, it is more than a retailer, it has two separate operations which will release pent-up shareholder value.Firstly, it will have a huge sale and leaseback of 4 million square feet of owned real estate which will approximate $500 million in cash, or 30% Bed Bath's market cap. Secondly, it's divesting of two business units which are expected to bring $450 million in cash. Thirdly, it's liquidating close to $1 billion of inventory. Fourthly, there is still Bed Bath's core operation. This is a heads, I win, tails, I don't lose much investment.Jeffrey Himelson: In 2020, my favorite investing idea is Maple Leaf Foods (OTCPK:MLFNF). MLFNF is a Canadian-based company that trades on the Toronto Stock Exchange and is not very well followed. It has a large meat-based segment that's profitable and also is a significant player in the new plant-based meats industry. In fact, it will soon have the largest plant-based meat manufacturing facility in North America, and its plant-based segment has a revenue run rate that's not far off of Beyond Meat's. MLFNF has not spent much to advertise and grow the brand of their plant-based products, but this has just changed and they've started a new advertising campaign with several celebrities including Ellen Degeneres, Kristen Bell and Dax Shepard. If you do decide to invest in MLFNF, since it's not widely followed and has a low volume, I recommending purchase shares with limit orders.David Trainer: Disney (DIS) - The huge launch for Disney+ reaffirms what we’ve been saying for the past three years. Disney’s unparalleled collection of IP, its unique brand, and its superior content monetization capabilities give it a significant competitive advantage over Netflix (NFLX) and every other content company.Disney stands to benefit as consumers become more overwhelmed by the amount of content and gravitate toward familiar characters and franchises. No other company can boast the familiarity or the same level of franchise IP. The company’s tentpole franchises don’t just help Disney attract new subscribers, their extraordinary popularity lowers subscriber acquisition costs, too.Furthermore, no other content firm monetizes content better than Disney. When Disney develops successful content, it can extract value across a wide array of businesses and channels. A hit franchise like Star Wars doesn’t just make billions at the box office, it also sells toys and merchandise, creates the potential for spin-off TV shows, forms the basis for attractions at theme parks, and now – with Disney+ – contributes to the library of a streaming service. Most importantly, Disney remains undervalued. If Disney can grow NOPAT by 9% compounded annually over the next decade (the default forecast in our model right now based on historical margins and analyst revenue projections) the stock has a fair value of $181/share, a 23% upside to the current stock price. As the market grows more skeptical of the growth expectations embedded in Netflix’s stock price – and as Disney+ continues to gain market share – we expect to see more of the capital invested in Netflix to flow to Disney.Ranjit Thomas, CFA: Danaos (DAC) is a shipping company trading at less than 2x EPS. After years of oversupply, the market is finally in balance and rates are rising. Read my article for why I think it could be a multi bagger.Cory Cramer: My favorite idea for 2020 is probably Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A) (BRK.B). It's one of the few large-cap stocks that's fairly priced that doesn't have problems. It's positioned well to take advantage of a market downturn with its large cash pile, and Buffett is still at the top of his game.Paulo Santos: MOEX in Russia, as the Russian economy grows. Emerging market mobile telecoms, on sheer undervaluation vs. everything else.Chris DeMuth Jr.: While I have not historically been fixated on dividends, a favorite idea for 2020 is another big dividend payer, our long position in Franchise Group (FRG). This is one of our largest investments. It owns Liberty Tax, Buddy’s Home Furnishings, The Vitamin Shoppe, and Sears Outlet. Over time, FRG will add companies that it can acquire at a discount to intrinsic value and recoup much or all of its acquisition costs through franchising. It will be light on assets and heavy on distributions to shareholders. It's starting with a quarterly $0.25 per share dividend, but my expectation is that figure will substantially grow over time. The goal is to distribute a large part of excess cash flow. This company has one of my favorite management teams and a promising opportunity for a rollup of companies well situated to be franchised. This company is small, new, and largely unknown. As with Broadmark, we were investors before day one but continue to own and like it today. FRG’s market cap is less than half a billion dollars today, but it will probably be 10 or 20 times that within the next decade.Quad 7 Capital: We became immensely bullish on energy in September-October this year. That has paid off with Schlumberger (SLB) and Halliburton (HAL). We think that natural gas is a place to consider. We have been pushing Southwestern Energy (SWN) for two months now and in that time it has rallied 40%. We think that so long as the weather is even average to below average temperatures, natural gas stocks offer strong value, despite the oversupply of the last five years. Oil has rebounded, and if it stays at current levels and natural gas rebounds to even a still super cheap $2.65 on futures for natty daddy, then we are looking at another 20% upside at least here, if not more.Daniel Jones: I'm an oil guy, so I really like crude and anything tied to it just about. Shale output is not as robust as a lot of people think, and we could actually see output from shale begin to fall before too long. This could create a surprise scenario that helps out oil bulls.***Thanks to our panel for chiming in on the state of value investing heading into a new decade.

4314903,31441,2020-01-02T11:10:43-05:00,HAL reports earnings January 21st.Last revenue from North America fell Q/Q by double digits.CLB just cut its earnings guidance. This could signal more headwinds in North America.Layoffs may not stop HAL's EBITDA margins from deteriorating.Sell HAL.,"Source: ForbesHalliburton (NYSE:HAL) reports quarterly earnings January 21st. Analysts expect revenue of $5.11 billion and EPS of $0.29. The revenue estimate implies a sequential decline of over 5%. Investors should focus on the following key items.North America land drilling has been the most attractive segment of the oil services market. The segment began to falter in the second half of 2018, likely due to budget exhaustion by certain oil shale plays. It faced headwinds for much of 2019. Halliburton reported total Q3 2019 revenue of $5.6 billion, down 6% sequentially. Two of the company's four major operating segments experienced revenue declines. North America was hit hardest due to a decline in pricing power in pressure pumping and well construction services. It could worsen. Active drilling rigs in the U.S. recently fell by 8 last week. Core Labs (NYSE:CLB) recently lowered its Q4 earnings forecast, citing declines in the U.S. rig count and ""slower-than-expected progress in client discussions for large international and offshore projects."" That sounds ominous for Halliburton, which received over half its revenue from North America.Halliburton's revenue outside of North America was $2.6 billion, and demonstrated flat growth Q/Q. Latin America showed some life on higher activity in Argentina and rising artificial lift sales across the region. Going forward, international revenue could be reliant upon the strength of the global economy. For now, Halliburton's fortunes could be driven mostly by how well North America performs.Halliburton cut into fixed costs for much of 2019. In Q2 2019, the company took a $247 million pretax charge related to asset impairments and severance costs. The company wants to adjust its capital structure to be more in line with the current operating environment. Last month the company announced it was laying off more than 800 employees amid a slump in the oil patch. It is too early to tell whether the layoffs will help the company preserve EBITDA margins.In Q3 Halliburton reported EBITDA of $953 million, down 2% sequentially. EBITDA margin was 17%, about 100 basis points higher than Q2. The margin improvement allowed EBITDA to decline less than revenue. Management is excellent at cost containment efforts and I expect cost cuts to continue. Halliburton's EBITDA margins are strong relative to Baker Hughes (NYSE:BKR) and smaller oil services firms. However, they are not on par with Schlumberger (SLB) which consistently reports margins north of 20%. If revenue continues to decline, then I believe Halliburton's EBITDA margins could fall, regardless of lay-offs.HAL has an enterprise value of $30 billion and trades at 8x last 12 months EBITDA. The company is cyclical in nature and could be subjected to the vagaries of the global economy. If Halliburton and other oil services firms have to rely on consumer spending and industrial production to drive demand for oil, then E&P in the oil patch could remain stagnant. HAL appears fully valued, but could slide further if EBITDA deteriorates.HAL is down by double digits Y/Y, despite the melt-up in financial markets. I expect more headwinds for the company. Sell HAL."
4314005,102107,2019-12-28T07:30:00-05:00,"Our year-end Roundtable series turns to the energy sector, which remains in search of the next bull market.Our panel is mixed on whether the game has truly changed for oil, but they still see plenty of opportunities in the sector.We discuss the risks that could face the sector as well as where upside catalysts might emerge from.","2019 finishes with an extra kick for investors. Part of that is the continued strong run of the market, erasing memories of last year's near bear market and extending the decade-long bull. There also are plenty of market headlines and events that have sprung over the end of the year, from Phase 1 trade deals to M&A to political whirlwinds and more.More trivially, the 2010s are ending and the 2020s begin. It's been quite a decade for equity investors, with the S&P 500 returning more than 250% in that time. Even underperformance could leave a portfolio in good shape, and any alpha that was found would really leave investors well off.Where does that leave investors and the markets for 2020, at the start of a new decade? That's what we try to answer in our annual Marketplace Roundtable series. We are publishing roundtable discussions featuring more than 80 authors from across the spectrum of investing styles and focuses you find on Seeking Alpha: Macro to value investing, small cap to energy, gold to quant and alternative strategies, and more.Today's discussion focuses on the energy sector, which continues its up and down ride. Our panel to discuss:Questions are in bold header font, disclosures are available at the end of the article.William Sabin: As long as the economy is strong, the party will continue. With our service, we can benefit with an up or down market. Life is good.Long Player: It's an old bull market that's only getting older. Therefore a correction is due. Many of the areas I follow have already corrected. Therefore I'm not really concerned what happens with the general market.Andrew Hecht: The 2020 election in the US poses a threat to the stock market as it will serve as a referendum on the policies that paved the way for many of the gains.Laura Starks: Easy to be anxious with the market this high as companies realize a perfect alignment of reduced taxes and economic growth provided by a business-friendly president. Threats to continued market exuberance include a) outcome of November 2020 elections, especially for president, but also Congress and in state governments, b) roller coaster negotiations on tariffs with China and other countries, c) higher energy prices in states and countries where hydrocarbons are increasingly shut out of the market, d) a catch-all black swan that we don't see now, particularly in the debt markets.Fluidsdoc: I'm not really negative on 2020. For the macro market, the accommodative stance by the Fed is expected to keep the rally going. The trade war is getting to be old news, which caps it on the downside. If a Phase-1 deal really comes together, then I see quite a bit of upside as some uncertainty leaves the market. On the energy side that I cover, there are some bullish sides for a modest increase in oil prices. We are seeing day-by-day that oil wants to go higher. If it can sustain above $60 for WTI, sentiment will shift to strongly bullish.Laurentian Research: I'm not sure following the consensus is a strategy to attain great returns. Thanks to those who stay on the sidelines, we still don't have a parabolic rise in S&P 500 yet. Until then, the index may continue to climb a wall of worry. The presence of worrywarts and lack of complacency actually suggest a rather healthy market sentiment. Furthermore, this perceived ""late-stage bull market"" doesn't have stratospheric oil prices to go with it, for the time being and in the foreseeable future. Given that high oil prices were the chief ""ruiner"" (or its key accomplice) of the party prior to previous recessions, we probably worry too much. Too much to notice certain value depressions, e.g., a slew of solid stocks in the natural resources sector.KCI Research Ltd.: This is a very difficult question, as projected real returns in the long term have been rarely lower in modern market history, with today's projected real returns lower than those that existed at historic market inflection points, specifically lower real returns projected today than even in 1929, 1999, or 2007. Having said that, there's an extreme amount of pessimism still present in the financial markets, and the easiest way to see that is in the historically high sovereign bond prices (historically low yields). How can this dichotomy be resolved? The answer is a historic capital rotation, greater than what we even witnessed from 2000-2007.William Sabin: Be more aggressive in investing, but hedge.Long Player: The cheap can get cheaper.Andrew Hecht: Never underestimate the potential for divergences to carry far beyond logical levels. Mean reversion can take a long time, making it impossible for investors and traders to hold onto risk positions.Laura Starks: As much fun as the upstream business is, 2019 has reinforced for me the need to be diversified across energy sub-sectors from producers to transporters to refiners to LNG to utilities and other energy consumers.Fluidsdoc: 2019 was a tough one in the oil business. So many levers and knobs being tweaked.Laurentian Research: I learned that in the age of social media, a tweet could set back the playing out of an otherwise valid investment thesis for a while. I haven't figured out how to take advantage of this new development yet.KCI Research Ltd.: Extremes can go farther than you can imagine.William Sabin: Until we truly remove our dependency on oil, oil will remain king.Long Player: Lower for longer still looks good. There's simply too much available at current prices and more than can easily be brought online. Therefore any rally, no matter how spectacular, will probably be short lived.Andrew Hecht: Since the US is the world's leading producer of oil and gas, the 2020 election will serve as a referendum on the future. The opposition party's platform is likely to contain initiatives sought by the progressive wing of the party such as the Green New Deal. While the world is moving away from fossil fuels, oil and gas will continue to play a major role in powering the globe for years to come. A significant change in US energy policy under a new administration starting in 2021 could hand dominance back to other energy producing nations, particularly in the Middle East.Laura Starks: There's always another boom left for oil. Financial institutions threw too much money at energy companies, especially during the downturn of 2015-2016, and now - reasonably - want to see better prospects of earning their money back. So capital availability - the ""fuel"" on which the horizontal drilling treadmill runs - has tightened. By the same token, we shouldn't underestimate the global financial and political security - and liberation from kowtowing to unfriendly oil exporting countries - that the U.S. enjoys by producing so much of its own oil. That stability is typically undervalued. From the operational side, it's also not well understood how radically steep horizontal well decline curves are. Nor are the ancillary costs of handling co-produced water and natural gas fully appreciated. Both factors will tend increasingly limit, as they should, uneconomic wells.Fluidsdoc: Boom is an explosive term, I avoid it when discussing volatile substances - oil and gas. Sorry for the pun. While I'm not seeing a boom in 2020, I do see a bottoming in drilling activity and expect an increase to maintain production. Also, I'm expecting a ~10% increase in oil prices in 2020 that should sustain activity for the same reasons. It's going to be harder and harder for shale drillers to show growth as acreage quality declines and financing is harder to come by. I think there's a reasonable chance market perception could swing from surplus to shortage in oil security next year. If that plays out, 2021 could see real growth.Laurentian Research: I focus on finding the E&P businesses that operate very low-cost assets, relative to their respective price realization, such that they thrive even in the current macro environment. As a result, my investment theses typically work without requiring high-flying oil prices. That said, I do believe the rise of U.S. shale has changed the E&P game. Unfortunately, the oil patch adjusted a bit too slowly to the new reality of oil plenty.KCI Research Ltd.: There's a material window for higher oil prices, and this could happen sooner than many think. There's a reluctance to embrace this view, after U.S. production surpassed almost all estimates to the upside from 2016-2019, however, that robust production growth, and the reasons for that robust production growth, including increased drilling productivity, are now in the rear view mirror.William Sabin: Strong 2020 as per normal cycles.Long Player: You have the last completions of a busier time coming online. The rig count reduction appears to finally exceed operational advances. Therefore a pricing turnaround appears to be in the cards within the next year.Andrew Hecht: Natural gas inventories moved into the winter season at around 20% above last year's level. Additionally, last year a large number of shorts pushed the price higher as they scrambled to cover risk positions. For the 2019/2020 peak season of demand, the season began with 3.732 trillion cubic feet in storage, enough to meet all demand requirements even if the temperatures are below normal throughout the winter months. Some technical formations above the market could act as a magnet and create short-term price recoveries, but selling should appear on rallies, capping the price of natural gas for the coming months.Laura Starks: I'm not optimistic about a rebound in natural gas prices. There's way, way too much U.S. supply overwhelming demand. It's easy to produce even more, and gas cannot be transported readily to markets that demand is giving us, for example, a temporary situation where the price of gas in the Northwest US was $160/MMBTU while in West Texas the price was negative at $3-4/MMBTU. Moreover, governmental regulations in a number of coastal states (and European countries) are moving in the direction of limiting the use of all hydrocarbons, especially for electric generation, which is a major market for natural gas.Fluidsdoc: There's just too much gas from shale drilling. Shale is gassy by its nature, and prices don't encourage anything but flaring -which is bad for so many reasons. Problems of oversupply tend to self correct through reduced activity. Take Chevron (NYSE:CVX) walking away from the Marcellus as an example (the subject of a recent article). Chevron is saying the gas market needs fewer players and relinquishing a huge acreage position in that play. Activities like that will help to reduce the extreme oversupply we have now.Laurentian Research: Over-investment has led to oversupply of natural gas. Too much cheap sources of piped natural gas and LNG probably mean the continued struggle of natural gas producers, especially those in the U.S. and Canada, in the foreseeable future.KCI Research Ltd.: I'm more bullish on natural gas prices than crude oil prices. Why? Demand is growing much faster for natural gas, natural gas prices have been in a longer bear market, and leading producers are farther along in their production response. Adding to the narrative, U.S. shale gas is a world-class asset, while U.S. shale oil is not a world class asset.William Sabin: Stay away, stay far far away.Long Player: Generally I don't buy IPOs. Most of the time you can get at least a 50% discount within 18 months of the IPO. So there's no need to buy at the initial offering.Andrew Hecht: Aramco came to market at a valuation of $1.7 trillion, and on the first day of trading on the Saudi exchange, the shares moved up, creating a market cap of around $1.9 trillion. The Saudis would be smart to continue selling shares to fill their sovereign wealth fund to diversify the economy away from dependence on oil revenues. An investment in Aramco comes with lots of risks including Saudi production risks in the turbulent Middle East, regulatory and reporting risks as Saudi Arabian compliance could be questionable, and others. I believe the company is overvalued at $1.9 trillion, but the Crown Prince believes it should be worth more than $2 trillion. I guess that's what makes a market.Laura Starks: The requirement for international-standard financial transparency appears to spook Aramco - hence its small percentage offering on a local market rather than in London or the NYSE. It's useful for the rest of the world to better understand - through that same required financial transparency - just how much oil Aramco can produce and at what price. In some ways Aramco is merely a size XXXXL version of every other national oil company - NIOC, Petrobras, Pemex, etc. in that the company will be run for the benefit (social and financial) of the country, which means that many decisions may not be strictly economic. Interestingly, with a clear line of sight between oil prices and Aramco's market capitalization, Aramco now seems more focused on maximizing oil prices. Then too, the Saudis have already tried unsuccessfully to flood U.S. shale producers out of the market with low oil prices, so they know that gambit doesn't necessarily give them the hegemonic pricing power they'd like to have.Fluidsdoc: I see the reaction to Aramco's IPO as a positive. More people wanted in than out, and Mohammad Bin Salman (MbS) got his $2 trillion valuation for the company after only a couple of days. It tells me that many players in the market are looking past the oil-asset shaming that's going on with some of the big funds. Admittedly some of the buyers were ""told"" to buy by MbS as a patriotic duty. That said, I think the dividend will pull investors in and new field discoveries (something that doesn't get talked about much) will enhance the value of the security. Oil is generally found where it has been found in the past. My bet is there are other Ghawars out there.Laurentian Research: Aramco holds some of the world's lowest-cost, long-life oil giants, which give it a wide moat and rich profits. I think the stock will prove to be a good investment, especially considering the kingdom appears keen to make the IPO a success. The market may have turned too pessimistic concerning the future of fossil fuels when it comes to valuing Aramco yet too blind to the potentially negative impact of the inefficiency resultant from meddling under state political agenda of the daily management of the now-public company.KCI Research Ltd.: This is a watershed event in the energy sector. Ironically, most record IPOs usually mark a top in the market, or in the favored sector. In this case, Aramco's IPO could mark the bottom.William Sabin: Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), USA growth.Long Player: The stronger gas pricing brought about by the current rig count reduction and lower activity in key basins.Andrew Hecht: US energy policy that could cause oil and gas prices to move higher and lower with the political polls in the US once the opposition party selects a candidate to take on President Trump.Laura Starks: The fact that China's move toward electric cars, including the battery technology, in fact dovetails with that country's need to control its own energy destiny. The result will be, in essence, coal-powered cars since China would prefer to use its own considerable coal reserves. And note that China is building more and more coal-fired electric generation both inside - and beyond - its borders.Fluidsdoc: I think the market is going to be surprised at a decline in shale growth. It's not currently a talking point for most folks, and there are going to be some heads turning by Q-2, 2020. Drilling activity in shale is inadequate to overcome the decline rate for shale. Chickens will come home to roost.Laurentian Research: I think we may talk more about clean energy, with topics ranging from fuel cell of hydrogen converted from fossil fuel, via nuclear energy as a green energy source, to renewable energy which more people - after the initial fascination - come to learn of its un-green side considering all the environmental impact caused by direct input, including metals (nickel, cobalt, copper, lithium, and so on) and plastics (fossil fuel), and indirect use of fossil fuel (especially coal). I hope a more rational and holistic understanding of what is green will emerge out of the talking.KCI Research Ltd.: Why more investors were not in the best performing sector of the market in 2020? The answer is simply, it is not easy to buy when there is proverbial blood in the streets, to the degree there is today.William Sabin: Recession risk from trade wars. Upside for the sector - war in the Middle East.Long Player: The major risk to the energy sector has always been politics both in the US and abroad. There probably will not be an upside pricing catalyst for a while unless there's a major sustained crisis. Most of the companies will be making profit improvements through continuing lower costs as innovations throughout the industry continue.Andrew Hecht: A global recession that would reduce demand for energy is the leading risk factor on the downside for energy prices. On the upside, Iran stands as a factor that could cause upside price spikes in the blink of an eye.Laura Starks: Utility culture of prudent operation relies on fuel diversity. When fuel options are narrowed and narrowed further such that they can't use clean coal, or natural gas, or sometimes nuclear - or even in the case of Eversource (ES) - renewable hydropower from Quebec - regulators are sledge hammering prudent operations. Yet the option to use different fuels is one that keeps lights on and houses warm 24/7 in the U.S., unlike in other countries. The absolute insistence by governors and regulators on prioritizing solar and wind, with their physics reality-based problems of diffuseness and intermittency over less expensive sources, leads to neglecting key infrastructure (like transmission lines) This will give us more situations like those we saw with Pacific Gas & Electric. Major upside - the expansion of LNG trains in the U.S. by companies like Cheniere Energy Inc. (LNG) widens options for U.S. natural gas markets.Fluidsdoc: I see the biggest risk to oil stability as being Iranian barrels coming back to market. Iran has made it plain they will produce to their max capacity when sanctions are lifted. That would bring a couple million BOD back to the market. A return to growth globally will lift a cloud from oil. That has been the biggest drag on prices this year. If market perceptions shift back to growth, and consumption estimates rise, oil could increase strongly from present levels.Laurentian Research: I believe a major risk for the energy sector for the next couple of years is how successful the heavily-indebted businesses in the sector will be in dealing with the wall of maturing debt. Wall Street, the chief abettor during the previous investment binge, has recently pulled a long face at the oil patch. Higher interest rates on rollover debt can be expected to further delay the achievement of positive free cash flow, which the banks now demand to see, and may even force a new wave of bankruptcies. On the other hand, capex cuts by shale producers, extended OPEC+ production curtailment, and a possible global economic recovery may help push the oil prices higher. However, I don't anticipate a lengthy period of high oil prices in excess of $85/bo like we had between 2007 and 2014, because I am not sure if U.S. shale producers will have requisite wisdom to decide between using the increased cash flow to pay down debt or using it to grow production.KCI Research Ltd.: Honestly, almost all the worst-case scenarios for energy equities have already come to pass. Said another way, most of the downtrodden energy equities are pricing in worst case scenarios. This applies to a stock like Antero Resources (AR), which is fully hedged in terms of natural gas prices for 2020 and 2021, yet they could still benefit from rising strip prices and rising liquids prices. Thus, most of the risks are priced in, including lower energy prices for longer, though that's the primary risk. Alternatively, higher commodity prices, particularly farther across the futures strip, which very few are anticipating, is a significant potential positive catalyst.William Sabin: Continues to be the new economy stocks - marijuana, and AI.Long Player: Yangarra Resources (OTCPK:YGRAF). This cheap Canadian producer has some of the lowest costs in the industry. Therefore weak pricing is not a worry for this company. It can grow in a wide range of industry pricing.Andrew Hecht: Sector rotation into energy-related stocks, for now. Volatility in markets across all asset classes should be higher in 2020 than in 2019.Laura Starks: I hope that as Exxon Mobil becomes more active in the Permian Basin with its fleet of 55 rigs and others, especially suppliers, benefit from XOM's deep pockets, long-term steady hand, high safety standards, and environmental focus, the company can in turn surmount PTSD from bruising legal battles that have targeted XOM as the representative of all hydrocarbon producers, shake off excess caution, and learn more nimbleness from fellow Permian operators.Fluidsdoc: The major oilfield service companies, Halliburton (HAL), Schlumberger (SLB) and Baker Hughes (BKR), are my top picks for growth. All are at multi-decade lows, even after a 30% rebound from October lows. Drilling activity is bottoming globally, and deepwater is seeing an increase in rig utilization and day rates. That bodes well for the big three. Absent, a major crash these companies are going to see improving fundamentals and analyst upgrades in 2020. This is already occurring and should continue.Laurentian Research: In the oil E&P space, I like Africa Oil (OTCPK:AOIFF) a lot, another Lundin family-associated business. Being a deep value and with little downside, the stock is loaded with powerful near-term catalysts, e.g., the closing of the acquisition of giant oil fields in offshore Nigeria and reaching FID on the high-impact Kenyan project. In the mining space, I reiterate my liking of Lion One Metals (OTCQX:LOMLF) which is drill testing a potentially enormous alkaline gold system in Fiji, a favored jurisdiction. The downside is cushioned by the highly economical Tuvatu gold deposit, part of the alkaline gold system.KCI Research Ltd.: Antero Resources is my top idea for 2020. Antero is already the second-largest natural gas liquids producer in the United States, only surpassed by the newly merged Occidental/Anadarko combined company, and Antero is poised to overtake both Cabot Oil & Gas (COG), BP (BP), and Exxon Mobil (XOM) to become the second-largest dry natural gas producer in the United States. Despite this size and scale, Antero's robust history of hedging success, and despite their ownership of one of the premier drilling inventories in the U.S., Antero has been left for dead. Why? From my perspective, this poor share price performance is partially due to their misunderstood cost structure, which they are addressing in a series of actions, starting with de-consolidation of their midstream company in 2019, and the poor share price performance is also due to the extremely bearish sentiment on future natural gas prices, which have been in a never ending bear market this is roughly 14 years in length now. The silver lining is that there is a massive adjustment coming in future supply/demand dynamics (low prices do cure low prices in commodities), that very few market participants are modeling in right now correctly, and this difference in my opinion, is creating a generational opportunity.***Thanks to our panel for sharing their thoughts on the sector.

4313165,33291,2019-12-18T13:18:26-05:00,"Back in October, we called the bottom for Halliburton.We saw the teens as an amazing long-term entry point.We expect a Q4 that is still down sizably from last year, but the back half of the quarter has seen solid pricing.We recommend two ways to protect the juicy gains you have made since our call.","Back in October, we called the bottom for Halliburton (HAL). It was a prescient call. That is our style of investing. We are always on the lookout for names that are simply beaten down too far. Our investing philosophy has us seek out both short-term gains and those setting up for a potential long-term holding in a quality equity that has been left for dead. While bottom fishing is dangerous, there is a method to our madness. When we saw the stock touch decade lows in the $17 range, given the price of oil, demand metrics, revenue impacts, and earnings, the worst seemed behind the stock. We saw the teens as an amazing long-term entry point. We believed oil was seeking and was set to rebound. We were a lone bull among from July to November:Source: Seeking Alpha Halliburton quote page, edited by BAD BEAT InvestingSo, it turned out to be a very rewarding call for our members, particularly those who chose to play call options. The stock has motored from the high teens to nearly $25:Source: BAD BEAT InvestingSo, the question now becomes, what do we do here?We want to say that the last quarterly report was Q3. When the company reported its Q3 earnings, we saw a top-line miss and a bottom line that matched estimates. You see, the stock rallied from October not because of its performance, even though it was pretty good, but because of the outlook, and improving commodity pricing. Take a look at the WTI price:Source: Oil Price Charts Via OilPrice.com Please note specifically how the price of oil has essentially rallied since our buy call. This is oil pricing finding equilibrium, while the demand side of the equation has been impacted by OPEC cuts and usage statistics.This improvement in oil is why performance is expected to improve. Performance in Q3 was decent, but the start of Q4 pricing was weak. The second half of Q4 has been stellar, however.With the understanding that oil prices are so strongly linked to performance of the company and the stock, it is no wonder the oil price volatility has hit the stock. Pricing was weakish for much of Q3, and so, we saw revenue declining slightly. Revenues actually were, in fact, down from a year ago and came in at $5.55 billion in the quarter. Here is the recent Q3 trend:Source: SEC filings, graphics by BAD BEAT InvestingAs you can see, we saw a decline which we anticipated but was a bit weaker than expected. Normally, a revenue number like this would hit the stock. At $5.55 billion, the company missed by $270 million versus consensus projections.This miss was concerning on the surface. However, as we drilled down, we understand where the weakness came from. Both segments saw lower revenues sequentially from Q2 2019. Drilling and evaluation revenues fell 4% to $2.05 billion, whereas completion and production revenue fell 8% to $3.5 billion. There also exists a dichotomy between North America and International performance, but we see both improvingAs we look to Q4, we are mostly interested in regional growth. The action is promising internationally, and North America seems to be showing signs of life. We think the weakness is temporary. We continue to believe that the overall risk is to the upside from here. The company is successfully executing its strategy of controlling what expenses it can control and managing the business to perform well in any market conditions.As oil prices declined from 2014 forward, Halliburton worked diligently to cut expenses. Expenses have been well managed, but management has stated that it is committed to further cuts. This is because, although the company remained profitable at $50 oil, the company can control expenses further to ensure profit. This expense control showed in Q3, as operating income of $536 million total was up from $303 million in the sequential quarter. Factoring in both the short revenues and all sources of expenses being less than expected, earnings per share were about in line with projections.While revenues missed expectations heavily, we were pleased that well-managed expenses offset this miss on the top line. Earnings per share were in line overall, even though they were down from last year:Source: SEC filings (linked above), graphics by BAD BEAT InvestingAdjusted net income came in at $295 million, or $0.34 per diluted share. This compares to $0.35 taken in the sequential quarter, but only about $10 million lower overall.As we move into Q4, we expect strong results.Oil prices are cautiously higher this month as the market wants to see action and not just promises on the U.S.-China trade agreement. We think that the U.S. trade tension with China has eased but not been resolved yet. If it is resolved, Chinese oil demand already at a record high will only get higher. Pricing has improved about 15% since Q3, and that is pretty bullish.Halliburton has been cutting expenses by way of layoffs. This comes even as oil has rebounded. Given that oil started off weak in Q3 but has turned back around and factoring in rig counts and contracts that we know were in place, we are looking for $5.17-5.35 billion for Q4 revenues at this juncture. Note, this is lower than a year ago. On an EPS basis, should expenses be about in line with where they were in Q3 (or better), we are estimating $0.30-0.32 per share. This would also be down 15-20% from a year ago.It may seem odd that performance will decline, but that is how bad oil pricing was to start the quarter. We are just seeing oil prices get back to around where they were now a year ago (before plummeting to end the year 2019).We are still bullish on the name for 2020, but obviously, after gains of 30% plus, we are much more cautious. We are proficient traders, and although we like Halliburton as a long-term investment, even at these levels, we understand that our traders do not want to leave juicy gains on the table. As such, we are recommending that you employ a trailing stop loss of approximately 5-7%. This allows the stock to pull back some but keeps you in it if the uptrend continues and protects your gains on the downside. It will automatically raise your stop loss level as the stock moves higher.A second approach if you do not mind selling the stock and also don't mind holding it longer with that 3% dividend yield, but feel upside is limited, is to sell covered calls that raise cash. Be warned that this defines your selling point to a particular strike, so you sacrifice any further upside. Both approaches are fine if you are looking to exit the name.We have a price target of $28 on the stock, so that means we see more upside. However, it does not mean the stock will go up in a straight line. We could see a 5-10% pullback before upside resumes. Much of that will depend on oil prices, and what comes out of Washington D.C.For now, enjoy the holiday gift that has been the gains of our Halliburton call. Take a little off the table."

Additional bloodletting likely reflects declining E&P in the oil patch.Falling industrial activity and the trade war with China could create more headwinds.Sell HAL.,"Source: ForbesEarlier this month Halliburton (HAL) announced it was laying off more than 800 employees amid a slump in the oil patch:Oil markets are cyclical in nature. Over the past few years oil prices may have become divorced from economic forces. They may have been more sensitive to OPEC supply cuts than actual demand for oil. Brent oil is now around $64. OPEC and Russia recently agreed on deeper supply cuts, which could prop up prices further. The question remains, ""Will demand be enough to spur E&P in the oil patch?""Industrial production fell 0.8% for the month of October, the largest decline in 17 months. Factories may be reticent to expand production unless consumer demand warrants it. The trade war with China has hurt global trade in general. It has also created uncertainty about the economy. Waning industrial production and manufacturing activity will likely hamper demand for oil. Oil companies appear to be responding by cutting drilling activity. The rig count recently fell for the seventh straight week, which likely connotes a slump in E&P. This cannot be good for oil services firms like Halliburton.Halliburton's Q3 revenue of $5.6 billion declined 6% sequentially. Its revenue in North America declined by double digits. North America represented over half of Halliburton's revenue and remained extremely important. The region was hard hit by a decline in pricing power pursuant to pressure pumping and well construction services. In response, Halliburton has been engaging in cost containment efforts to help maintain margins.Its EBITDA of $953 million fell 2% sequentially. EBITDA margin of 17% improved by about 100 basis points versus that of Q2 2019. Its operating costs were $4.6 billion. The following chart lays out Halliburton's operating expenses in comparison to that of Schlumberger (SLB) and Baker Hughes (BKR).Schlumberger and Baker Hughes reported total Q3 operating expenses of $6.7 billion and $5.1 billion respectively. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenue for Halliburton, Schlumberger and Baker Hughes was 83%, 79% and 87%, respectively. Schlumberger is one of the most-efficient oil services firms with a 21% EBITDA margin. To match Schlumberger's efficiency Halliburton would have to cut quarterly operating expenses by another 4% or about $212 million.This could prove difficult. First of all, Schlumberger has more scale than Halliburton. Its $6.8 billion in quarterly revenue is about 47% more than Halliburton's. Secondly, Halliburton is already implementing cost containment efforts. The company has been cutting fixed costs for much of the year. In Q2 2019 it took a $247 million pretax charge related to severance costs and asset impairments. Its 17% EBITDA margin partially reflects management's efforts to adjust its cost structure in the face of slumping E&P. Attempts to further improve Halliburton's EBITDA margin could come at the expense of customer service levels or employee morale.With an enterprise value of $28 billion HAL trades at 7.5x last 12 months (""LTM"") EBITDA. HAL is down over 25% Y/Y, despite the rise in broader markets. The Dow Jones (DIA) is up over 15% Y/Y, yet we may be facing a corporate earnings recession. The Federal Reserve has cut interest rates and is spending tens of billions per day to add liquidity to financial markets. If Fed intervention is not enough to buoy HAL then I doubt more cost cutting will do much to spur the stock.Oil markets may finally reflect the vagaries of the global economy, in spite of OPEC supply cuts. That sounds foreboding for HAL. Sell the stock."
4306977,31441,2019-11-15T08:28:24-05:00,"HAL's Q3 revenue fell 6% Q/Q. North America was particularly hard hit, falling by double digits.Can HAL cut costs rapidly enough to maintain margins in the face of revenue declines and deteriorating pricing power? I doubt it.Sell HAL.","Source: FortuneThe U.S. economy has been in expansion mode for the past decade. The trade war with China lingers on, which could cause the economy's vital signs to stagnate. The oil industry has historically been cyclical. However, since the Financial Crisis, oil prices have been buoyed by OPEC supply cuts and government stimulus designed to prop up the economy. That said, E&P is starting to stagnate, which could stymie Halliburton (HAL) and others. Halliburton reported Q3 2019 revenue of $5.6 billion, down 6% sequentially. This followed a low single-digit rise in revenue in Q2.Two of the company's four major operating segments experienced revenue declines. North America was hit hardest due to a decline in pricing power:Budget exhaustion from customers hurt E&P in the oil patch in the second half of 2018. At some point, E&P should be driven by demand for oil and not artificial spikes in prices from OPEC supply cuts. If industrial activity and consumer spending do not spur demand, then it would make sense for E&P to stagnate. If Halliburton's pricing power is deteriorating, then it could also impact smaller participants in the oil patch. Halliburton receives over half its revenue from North America. It may have to cut prices further in order to maintain share in its most important region. It could become a battle of the balance sheets. I favor bigger players like Halliburton, Schlumberger (SLB) and Baker Hughes (BKR) in this scenario.Halliburton's total revenue outside North America was $2.6 billion and showed flat growth Q/Q. Of note was that Latin America rose 6% on higher activity across product lines in Argentina and increased artificial lift sales and testing activity across the region. For now, Halliburton's fortunes will likely rise and fall with North America - its largest region. The U.S. rig count recently posted its 10th decline in the past 11 weeks. This portends North America E&P could remain weak. I anticipate more revenue declines in North America in Q4.Halliburton has been reducing costs. The company began to reduce fixed costs in North America this year. In Q2 2019, the company took a $247 million pretax charge consisting of asset impairments and severance costs. Halliburton is attempting to adjust its cost structure to better reflect the current operating environment. Smaller oil services companies may follow suit. If Halliburton and/or Schlumberger cut prices to maintain market share in North America, then smaller competitors may be forced to rationalize their cost structures.Halliburton's Q3 EBITDA of $953 million fell 2% sequentially. EBITDA margin was 17%, about 100 basis points higher than Q2. Its EBITDA margin was only 100 basis points lower than the year-earlier period, despite the fact that revenue fell 16% Y/Y. Cost cuts are helping the company protect its margins in the face of revenue declines. I expect Halliburton to continue to cut overheads and reduce overtime pay. Its EBITDA margins are robust in comparison to Baker Hughes and smaller operators, but not on par with Schlumberger which consistently reports margins north of 20%. Maintaining margins at current levels could be a chore for Halliburton going forward.With an enterprise value of $26 billion, HAL trades at nearly 7x last 12 months' EBITDA. Given the cyclical nature of its business, HAL appears fairly valued. However, I question the quality of the company's earnings. It needs to continue to cut costs simply to keep EBITDA from falling further. Secondly, I question if the bottom is really in. Oil prices hover above $60; if the economy declines further then oil prices and E&P could go much lower. In that scenario, Halliburton could be hard-pressed to reduce costs fast enough to offset declines in revenue. HAL's trading multiple appears in line. However, I believe there is a possibility the company's revenue, EBITDA and valuation could fall much lower if the oil patch continues to deteriorate.HAL is down over 35% Y/Y, despite the melt-up in broader markets. I believe there are more headwinds ahead. Sell HAL."
4300304,104714,2019-10-30T09:45:00-04:00,"The upstream budget cut and crude oil price volatility may hurt Halliburton’s growth in North America until Q1 2020.
        Higher FIDs in the international market can improve margin in the medium-term.
        Savings through cost reduction will keep margin steady in the short-term.
        The stock is not overvalued at the current level.","Halliburton (HAL) is the second-largest oilfield equipment & services (or OFS) company by market capitalization. The stock price is unlikely to exhibit strong positive momentum in the short-run, but expect it to rebound in 2020. The fracking and completions activity slowdown and upstream capex decline will halt its revenue growth in North America at least until Q1 2020.In contrast, the pressure on pricing has started to soften up in many international geographies following an uptick in investment. The Drilling & Evaluation and Completion & Production divisions will likely see a margin expansion through investment in technology, lower operating costs, and pricing improvement in 2020. As part of an on-going initiative, Halliburton plans to save $300 million through cost reductions. The company’s cash flow is not steady, while its balance sheet is more leveraged compared to some of its peers.A look at the primary indicators in the energy industry will help explain Halliburton’s business dynamics. EIA’s data shows that while the crude oil production in the rest of the world has decreased by 3.5% in the past year until September 2019, it grew by 7.5% in the U.S. The West Texas Intermediate (or WTI) crude oil price has declined by 18% in the past year. The price volatility does not encourage healthy revenue and margin potential for the oilfield equipment & service (or OFS) providers.The EIA also expects the crude oil price to increase compared to the levels experienced so far in 2019. However, for 2020, EIA has revised down its estimates by $5 per barrel in its latest short-term outlook compared to the previous forecast. I think higher inventories, following the lack of demand in the market and the trade disruptions arising out of the U.S-China trade negotiation, will keep prices in the first half of next year lower. In an environment when capital commitment from the upstream companies is uncertain, Halliburton, too, has made its adjustments to minimize the damage. But the situation may not improve before late-2020 as the energy supply, and demand balance tightens.As supply exceeded demand, there was a drastic fall in the price of equipment used in hydraulic fracturing since 2016, which led to equipment and rig stacking. The U.S. rig count, too, dropped by 11% in Q3 compared to Q2. The depression has adversely affected Halliburton’s drilling and completion services. In Q3, the company stacked more equipment than it did in 1H 2019. The excessive stacking has also kept operating costs down. However, the company will continue to hold sufficient material to maintain its position as one of the top suppliers in North America. Approximately 47% of the company’s revenues were generated in North America in Q3 2019.Despite the reduction in equipment, the oilfield service industry continued to build the service intensity as the multiwell pad penetration continued, lateral length kept growing, and proppant loading increased. I expect the horsepower requirement to fall in the market by the end of 2019 compared to a year ago. Some of the equipment providers can even use components of rigs to use in other operations. For example, in Q3, Schlumberger (SLB) recorded a $1.57 billion impairment charge related to the pressure pumping business in North America following a fall in demand in the market. In this environment, the company focuses on in-house manufacturing, digital preventative maintenance protocols, and automation efforts to increase equipment lifespan.Apart from the North Sea in Europe, HAL is working on integrated projects in the Bakken and the Permian in the U.S. These projects help upstream companies in rationalizing suppliers and keeping the most efficient service companies. The company aims to increase its market share by providing efficient solutions like this.So far, the oilfield service companies in the U.S. were mainly benefiting from energy production growth, primarily in the unconventional Basins. However, with the crude oil price volatility and higher decline rates catching up, the overall production will slow down in 2020 compared to the prior years. To address these challenges, HAL offers automated fracturing and distributed fiber optic sensing. While Q4 will decelerate the most, Q1 2020 may see some revival as the new capex funding begins.The company has restructured the North America organization by simplifying the management structure, partnering with the supply chain and logistics organization, and returning the under-utilized equipment. Through several re-organization and fixed cost reductions, it reduced ~$1 billion a couple of years ago. Although the operating income margin has decreased by 2% points in Q3 2019 compared to a year ago, it is significantly higher than in FY2016. For example, its integrated well completions offering improves efficiency, minimizes non-productive time, and reduces personnel costs by improving fleet utilization. With several cost management initiatives, I think the company will maintain a steady operating profit margin in the coming quarters.In 2020, given the customers’ feedback, the company’s management does not expect any revival in the rig count and completions activity, which stems from the concerns about oil demand, upstream companies’ free cash flow generation commitments, and the oversupply in the natural gas market. The company expects to save $300 million through cost savings in the coming quarters.As I was suggesting above, the fall in the U.S. crude oil production growth is likely to be compensated, even if partially, by an increasing international energy market activity. Some of the markets have been improving consistently, including Europe, Asia, and Australia. Quarter-over-quarter, revenues from North America declined by 11.4% in Q3 compared to Q2, while revenue growth in Latin America was the highest (6.5% up) during the same period. In the more mature fields of the Middle East, Europe, and Asia, the company executed multiple contract start-ups. In Latin America, the company’s SPECTRUM FUSION hybrid coil tubing has enabled real-time visualization in logging-while-digging, while circulating fluid to clean the well as needed. In Argentina, in the Vaca Muerta shale play, it delivered the highest number of frac stages to date in Q3. In the UK and Norway sectors of the North Sea, completion tools and cementing businesses increased.The international market is positioned to gain from the offshore market recovery. In 2019 so far, the sanctioned FID volumes are up 20% while the offshore rig count increased 19% year-on-year, led by project sanctions in Guyana, Brazil, and Azerbaijan. In October 2019, Halliburton Landmark’s Digital Well Program was selected by PTTEP, a national petroleum exploration and production company in Thailand, to automate drilling, completions, and engineering processes.In August 2019, Halliburton won a drilling and completion services for its deepwater field development campaign in offshore Senegal. In July, it won three and six-month integrated services contracts with Petrobras (PBR) for pre-salt development in the Santos Basin in Brazil. Going forward, the company plans to add well testing, well construction services, coring, and coil tubing to its offerings in the project.The management expects investment in technology, and additional investment in the offshore energy in international markets will start yielding results in Q1 2020. As a result, pricing in the international market will improve, which will drive the international margin upward, going forward.From Q2 to Q3, Halliburton’s Drilling and Evaluation (or D&E) segment revenues decreased by 3.8%, while the segment operating margin remained unchanged at 7% during this period. The sales decline reflected lower drilling and wireline activity in North America and more moderate project management activity in the Middle East/Asia. In Q4 2019, the company’s management expects revenues to remain flat. By a more aggressive estimate, it can increase by low single-digits. The operating margin is more likely to improve. The brighter outlook reflects year-end software and product sales in international markets, although depleted performance in North America onshore will keep a check on the growth.The company’s Completion and Production (C&P) division saw a sharper revenue fall (7.9% down) in Q3 compared to a quarter ago. The segment operating margin, however, inflated to 13% in Q3 from 12% a quarter ago. Lower pressure pumping activity, the pricing pressure in North America onshore, reduced completion tool sales in Latin America, and reduced stimulation activity in the Middle East/Asia region contributed to the revenue fall in Q3. The company estimates that in Q4, the revenue will continue to decline by low single-digits. The operating margin, too, can deteriorate in Q4. In this division, sales may weaken in onshore North America, Latin America, and Europe and Eurasia, although increased activity in Asia and the Middle East will mitigate some of the adverse effects.Halliburton pays a $0.18 quarterly dividend per share, which amounts to a 3.0% dividend yield. In the past five years, its dividend has grown by 6.5%. In comparison, Schlumberger’s (SLB) forward dividend yield is higher (5.7%).HAL’s free cash flow was marginally positive in 9M 2019. Despite that, it was a steep deterioration compared to a year ago. During this period, cash flow from operations (or CFO) declined more sharply than the revenue fall due to deterioration in working capital in 2019.In FY2019, HAL expects capex to be ~$1.6 billion, while in FY2020, it may fall well short of this figure. The lower capex would address the softness in North America while responding to international growth.HAL’s debt-to-equity is 1.06x. TecnipFMC’s (FTI) debt-to-equity is 0.35x. Schlumberger's (SLB) debt-to-equity stands at 0.67x, while SBM Offshore’s (OTCPK:SBFFY) debt-to-equity stands at 1.2x. So, Halliburton’s debt-to-equity ratio is higher compared to its peers’ (HAL, SBFFY, and FIT) average, and therefore, the balance sheet reflects higher financial risks.Halliburton is currently trading at an EV-to-adjusted EBITDA multiple of 7.5x. Based on sell-side analysts’ EBITDA estimates, the forward EV/EBITDA multiple is 7.6x. Between FY2015 and FY2018, the stock’s average EV/EBITDA multiple was ~13.6x. So, it is currently trading at a discount to its past seven-year average.Halliburton’s forward EV-to-EBITDA multiple expansion versus the adjusted trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA is in line with peers because sell-side analysts expect the company’s EBITDA to decline in line with peers in the next four quarters. This would typically result in a similar EV/EBITDA multiple compared to peers. The stock’s EV/EBITDA multiple, however, is lower than its peers’ (SLB, BHGE, and FTI) average of 8.7x. So, the stock is not overvalued at the current level. I have used estimates provided by Seeking Alpha in this analysis.According to data provided by Seeking Alpha, 25 sell-side analysts rated HAL a “buy” in October 2019 (includes “outperform”), while seven recommended a “hold.” None recommended a “sell.” The consensus target price is $26.4, which at the current price, yields ~29% returns.Halliburton’s outlook is getting divergent geographically. The upstream capex decline and fracking and completions activity slowdown may halt its revenue growth in North America at least until Q1 2020. On the other hand, activity improvement and margin expansion in many of the international operations can mitigate the adverse effects. While revenue and margin are not expected to improve in the D&E and C&P divisions in Q4, both the divisions will likely see a margin expansion through lower operating costs and pricing improvement in 2020.To counter the demand slowdown, Halliburton plans to save $300 million through cost reductions. The company’s balance sheet is more leveraged compared to some of its peers. I expect the free cash flow to improve in 2020 when capex falls while earnings start to strengthen. I do not expect the stock price to exhibit positive momentum in the short-run, and expect it to make a strong comeback in 2020."
4300055,40351,2019-10-29T16:15:08-04:00,"Halliburton’s revenues and profits came under pressure in the third quarter due to the tough market conditions in North America, which was expected.The business environment will remain challenging as shale producers continue to keep a lid on spending levels in North America.Halliburton’s international business has been doing well but the good times may not last as the global economic growth decelerates and oil prices remain depressed.Although Halliburton’s earnings might come under pressure, the company’s efforts to preserve profit margin will provide crucial support to its bottom-line in this difficult period.","Halliburton (HAL) has recently reported a drop in earnings and its profits could fall further in the coming quarters as the business environment remains challenging in North America where shale producers have slashed drilling activity. Halliburton is getting support from the international markets where it has grown revenues by double-digits this year but its long-term outlook outside of North America is also looking uncertain.Image courtesy of PixabayHalliburton has posted a profit of $295 million, or $0.34 per share, for the three months ended Sept. 30, down from $435 million, or $0.50 per share, a year earlier. The result was in-line with analysts’ estimate of $0.34 per share, according to Refinitiv IBES data. The total revenues dropped to $5.55 billion from $6.17 billion in Q3-2018. The decline came as Halliburton experienced weak demand for oilfield services from North American shale oil and gas producers. This was evident from the poor performance of the company’s business in North America where third-quarter revenues fell to $2.94 billion from $3.73 billion last year.Halliburton’s international revenues, on the other hand, increased to $2.6 billion from $2.43 billion a year earlier as drilling activity improved in the international markets. But this growth outside of North America couldn’t make up for the weakness at home and the company ended the quarter with lower revenues and earnings.Halliburton, however, managed to generate decent levels of cash flows, even as its profits came under pressure. The company delivered $871 million of cash flow from operations which was enough to fully cover the capital expenditure of $345 million. As a result, the company ended the quarter with free cash flows of $526 million ($871M-$345M).HAL Q3-2019 Results. Image: HalliburtonThe third quarter was widely expected to be a tough period for Halliburton as shale producers reduced spending levels and curtailed drilling activity. The total number of drilling rigs fell to 860 units by the end of the third quarter from 1,075 rigs at the start of the year, as per data from Baker Hughes (BKR). The onshore rig count dropped by 11% in the third quarter on a sequential basis, which was the first such double-digit drop in a decade. The company also faced pricing pressure as demand for fracking weakened and there was ample capacity of pressure pumping equipment available in the market. Due in large part to the pricing pressure, Halliburton’s operating margin dropped from 11.6% in Q3-2018 to 9.7% in the previous quarter.The good thing, however, was that Halliburton posted strong growth in international markets which softened the blow coming from the tough conditions in North America. On top of that, the company continued to generate robust levels of free cash flows. That being said, the business environment could become even more challenging in the future.That’s because shale producers continue to remove drilling rigs while slashing exploration budgets. The exploration and production companies are eager to show capital discipline to their shareholders who have been demanding better returns and higher payouts as dividends and buybacks. The shale investors aren’t interested in pursuing strong production grown anymore amid feeble oil prices. Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD), for instance, which is one of the biggest shale drillers, has tapered down its production growth plans and slashed the top-end of this year’s capital guidance by 4.5% as it focuses on generating free cash flows and returning capital to shareholders.Halliburton itself has also predicted low levels of drilling and completion activity in all basins in North America in the fourth quarter. The US rig count fell to 851 rigs at the end of the previous week, down from more than 1,000 rigs throughout most of 2018, and could drop further in the near-term. This will likely weigh on the performance of the company’s North America business.In the meantime, the strength in the international markets will continue to provide crucial support to Halliburton’s bottom-line during this difficult period. The company experienced healthy growth in some key geographies, particularly Latin America and Europe/Eurasia region, in the third quarter. Halliburton has been experiencing improvement in conditions in various international markets throughout this year, including Europe, Asia, and Australia. So far, in the first nine months of this year, Halliburton has posted a 10% increase in revenues from international markets to $7.67 billion and I believe it is now well-positioned to either meet or exceed its target of posting high-single-digit growth in international revenues.However, I think the long-term outlook for Halliburton’s international business is looking cloudy. Although oil producers in the international markets have been growing drilling activity, even as they face a multitude of challenges, it is unclear whether this steady pace of growth will continue with weakness and volatility in oil prices, waning global economic growth, ongoing trade conflicts, and increase in geopolitical tensions. The price of the international benchmark Brent crude has gradually fallen from more than $70 a barrel six months ago to $60 at the time of this writing as concerns mount about waning oil demand and growing supplies.The demand weakness is driven in part by the global economic slowdown. The world’s economy will expand by 3% this year, down from 3.6% in 2018 and 3.8% in 2017 as trade and geopolitical tensions escalate, according to the IMF. The GDP growth in a number of major global economies who are also some of the biggest buyers of crude oil, such as China and India, is decelerating. This could continue to weigh on oil prices. Prolonged weakness in prices can force international oil producers to reduce drilling activity which will soften the demand for oilfield services, dimming Halliburton’s prospects.Halliburton, however, has made the right decision of focusing on preserving its margins during this difficult period. The company isn’t prepared to sign contracts that come with weak prices and low margins. Instead, it has been stacking hydraulic fracking equipment. This may hurt the company’s revenues and it could even end up losing some of its market share to other oilfield service providers. But I believe this shows that for Halliburton, protecting margins is currently the top priority, which should please investors. This also sends a positive message to the broader oilfield services industry. If other companies also start following in Halliburton’s footsteps, then we could witness an increase in stacking activity. The removal of capacity from the market can help push prices higher.Halliburton is also trying to rein in costs to protect margins. The company has been streamlining operations and corporate functions which can deliver $300 million of cost savings on an annualized basis. The company has recently laid-off 650 workers in the Rockies region which is in addition to the promised 8% reduction in the North American workforce.Shares of Halliburton have fallen by 36.6% in the last six months, in-line with the 37% drop seen by the broader oilfield services industry as measured by VanEck Vectors Oil Services ETF (OIH). But Halliburton stock isn’t cheap right now, currently trading 16.6x forward earnings estimates, higher than the peer median of 12.9x, as per data from Seeking Alpha Essential. Halliburton is better positioned than most of the other oilfield services companies to face this downturn due to its dominating position in the North American market and its ability to generate superior levels of margins and free cash flows. But the company’s shares will still likely remain subdued as its earnings come under pressure in the coming quarters. I think investors should avoid Halliburton stock for now."
4299491,104744,2019-10-28T02:51:27-04:00,"Halliburton has been still suffering from the US shale slowdown; its LTM revenue dropped 3.53%.However, the opex optimization helped to show decent EPS and return to FCF generation.I reiterate my ""Hold"" rating.","On October 21, Halliburton Company (HAL) presented its results for the third quarter of FY19. The corporation failed to live up to analysts' revenue prognosis but managed to deliver a $0.34 GAAP quarterly EPS, in line with their expectations. Despite the same plethora of headwinds that the company had to address during the quarter that resulted in slipped revenue, EBIT, and profit compared to 3Q18, shares jumped ~8% after the announcement, as the firm assured that the cost-cutting program would continue, precisely like it was in July after the release of the 2Q19 results.Later, the stock continued to climb higher and ended the week with a $20.48 price. Among the stimuli was the overall market bullishness, bolstered by the news related to the US-China trade negotiations.Source: Seeking AlphaHalliburton reported total quarterly revenue of $5,550 million, the lowest results since Q3 FY17. As a reminder, HAL publishes its sales in two segments: Completion & Production and Drilling & Evaluation. Interestingly, D&A showed decent performance, as its sales increased both compared to 9M19 and 3Q19. The company also provides details on sales in North America, Latin America, Europe/Africa/CIS, and the Middle East/Asia. The table clearly illustrates that the North American segment is the principal culprit of lower total revenue, as, for instance, Q3 sales in Europe/Africa/CIS have been the highest since at least Q1 FY17 and equaled $831 million. That is impressive, but its impact on the consolidated top line is not substantial, as North American revenue was 3.5x higher (it contributed 54% to the consolidated revenue). So, positive developments in other regions failed to offset the repercussions of the shale slowdown on HAL's LTM top line, which dropped 3.53%.Obviously, the issues the corporation has to address are still precisely the same as they have been during the most part of this year. Shale slowdown still concerns the OFSE industry investors. Softening unconventional production growth in the Lower 48 and the frugality of E&P players have taken a toll on the top line of the OFSE companies, and HAL had not emerged unscathed. The bulk of upstream players grapple with such issues as negative FCF or unsatisfying ROCE and a growing debt burden, and it is unlikely that they will continue to expand capital budgets to propel production at all costs.HAL's margins remained under apparent pressure, as LTM EBIT margin dropped to 9.16% compared to 11.39% in FY18, and the operating cash flow margin slipped to 9.2%, while it was 13.1% in 2018. The Board put much effort into protecting EPS and curtailed operating expenses (cut jobs, for instance) to offset the burden on margins. The firm slashed G&A expenses (they amounted to $168 million in 9M19 compared to $195 million a year ago), so it is clear HAL grapples for every dollar of net income. Yet, opex cuts are somewhat positive, but with no fundamental changes in its key markets (mostly the US shale, to be precise), HAL's operating performance will be mediocre.I am not a huge fan of sophomoric EPS and revenue analysis, so, for a better understanding of the company's current state, let's assess a few metrics of much greater importance, like FCF and Return on Total Capital. As I mentioned above, the net CFFO margin slipped, but thankfully, HAL's cash flow was sufficient enough to cover quarterly capex. The firm also remained LTM FCF-positive. It is a good piece of news, especially because H1 FCFE was negative, and 1Q19 net CFFO was also below zero. Besides, the company's ROTC is currently standing at 6.54%, which is quite acceptable but unquestionably not stellar.Halliburton's closest peers are Schlumberger (SLB) and TechnipFMC (FTI). As a reminder, HAL has underperformed all its peers this year, while loss-making TechnipFMC has mostly performed better than the S&P 500, which looks decent, especially considering the mediocre returns of its peers. Yet, weak Q3 results spooked its investors, and the stock abruptly plunged immediately after the announcement. The profit miss again raised questions regarding the overall health of the OFSE industry.A perplexing matter is that though both FTC and SLB are loss-making (mostly because of humongous impairments), the market has been more confident of their future.Data by YChartsEV/EBITDA, ROTC, EBITDA margin, and FCFF margin, which I use in conjunction to gain deeper insights, are presented in the chart below.Source: Author's creation. Data courtesy Seeking Alpha PremiumIn sum, SLB trades at a substantial premium to HAL, likely because of higher EBITDA and FCFF margins and a more versatile portfolio, which helps to offset the repercussions of tepid shale production dynamics. However, HAL does not look substantially undervalued.Here, I suppose it is worth outlining a few hypothetical catalysts that might spur Halliburton's share price and bolster valuation. Importantly, I reckon none of these stimuli are going to materialize in the medium term except for the US-China trade agreement.HAL is a great company that invests in innovation and continuously adapts to the changing market environment. Yet, it is not enough. As the shale boom lost steam, investors are concerned regarding its top line and margins. The WTI rally is the primary catalyst that might revive HAL's bulls, but as global growth is decelerating, it's almost impossible in the near term, except for short-lived spikes like a one-day rally in September after the Houthis attacked the Saudi oil facilities - but they are coincidental and unpredictable in nature.HAL is undoubtedly not expensive, but it also not a bargain. After all, an investment thesis built solely on valuation is not a perfect one. Without powerful catalysts, a stock might trade at ridiculously cheap multiples or even become cheaper. For instance, Chesapeake Energy (CHK) has been trading at staggering P/E (it is ~1.7x now) for quite some time. So, I reckon that accumulating the stock above ~5.5x EV/EBITDA is far too risky now.HAL bulls surely have their point, as the company remains profitable and FCF-positive despite the unfavorable environment. Also, one insider has recently purchased the stock at a $19.35 max price per share. They will at least be pleased to receive a dividend while waiting for their thesis to materialize. The yield is quite generous now, at ~3.5%, as the stock price has been battered. Still, there are no clear prospects for dividend increases, as in the current situation, boosting shareholder rewards in order to artificially improve investor sentiment destroyed by the shale slowdown is nearly the most unreasonable step to take.In sum, due to the lack of clear catalysts and anticipated 2019 EPS drop, I reiterate the ""Hold"" rating that I gave to the stock in the previous article."

Trading HAL short term may help in this situation.","Source: OilnowThe Houston-based Halliburton (HAL) is one of the most solid oilfield services giants. The company presents many similarities in its business model with its main rival, Schlumberger (SLB), which I covered recently on Seeking Alpha.The company has a dominating presence in well completions and fracking in the US shale, which makes Halliburton sensitive to any variations in this particular sector as we have experienced recently. The revenues in North America account for 53.1% of its total revenues.It is not a secret. The US Shale growth is slowing. It is not an abrupt halt, but the pace of increase is significantly lower than a year ago. Guess which sector is feeling the pinch first?Fitch Solutions Macro Research said in August this year:Data by YChartsHalliburton noted last quarter that the market for oilfield services had touched a bottom during the first quarter and noticed some improvement in the second quarter of 2019. This optimism has nearly vanished now. Jeff Miller, Chairman, President, and CEO commented on the conference call:If we look at Halliburton's rival Schlumberger, the rhetoric was a little bit of the same. The company was offering a positive outlook for its international business and noticed some progress in the North American sector with further weakness in the third quarter.The investment thesis is still simple here. Halliburton is an oil services company, and the global environment is weak. Yes, some progress here and there but nothing to celebrate. Further, North America's slowdown has a significant impact on revenues, and it is not going away soon.Thus, it is not presenting the same growth quality we should expect from a regular oil investment such as Exxon Mobil (XOM) or Shell (RDS.A) (RDS.B). It is not the recent rally that will change the picture much.We have to be honest; the stock has sorely underperformed the oil sector in general and can hardly be considered as a proxy for oil prices. I still think Halliburton as a decent long-term investment but should be viewed as secondary in the oil group. Therefore, I continue to recommend holding your long position for Halliburton and above all, trade short term about 30% of your position to take advantage of the volatility.As I said above, Halliburton and Schlumberger have a very similar business model. Both companies have a significant presence in the US shale and therefore are quite sensitive to any economic changes in this region.Halliburton's business model relies on two distinct segments:Schlumberger's business model is very similar as we can see below:The North America region represents 53.1% of the total revenues of Halliburton in 3Q'19. Halliburton is present in every unconventional Basin in the US (e.g., DJ Basin, Eagle Ford, Bakken, etc.)Comparatively, the North America region represents 33.9% of the total revenues of Schlumberger (including Cameron US).One characteristic that separates Schlumberger and Halliburton is that the latter has a stronger presence in the US. Thus, any slowdown in this region will affect Halliburton more than Schlumberger. The graph below is demonstrating this fact.As I said earlier, the North American business outlook continues to be an issue for Halliburton and Schlumberger. As a result of the North American slowdown, the company has ""trimmed 8% of its North American workforce and shelving unused frack gear"" in July.Again, less a couple of weeks ago, the company announced that it was laying off 650 workers in Colorado, New Mexico, North Dakota, and Wyoming.Both companies have suffered a massive retracement of about 42.55% and 47.76%, respectively, the last two years. The decline has slowed down a little since January, though.Data by YChartsFinally, one slight positive for both companies is that they are paying a stable dividend.However, Halliburton's yield is 3.67% compared to Schlumberger's higher yield of 5.95%, which increases, even more, the performance gap between the two stocks, in favor of Schlumberger, unfortunately.Source: HAL 8k filing and Morningstar1 - Revenues of $5.550 billionHalliburton reported earnings per share of $0.34 for 3Q '19 on $5.550 billion in revenues compared to $6.172 billion in the same quarter last year. Revenues for 3Q '19 were down 6.4% sequentially.Net income reported for the third quarter of 2019 came in at $295 million, below the $435 million for the same period last year. As noticed in the second quarter of 2019, the North America region was the only region that showed a decrease of 11% sequentially, principally driven by customer activity declines.Lance Loeffler, the CFO, commented in the conference call:Highlights per region with comments from Lance Loeffler in the conference call.2 - Free Cash Flow jumped an estimated $526 million in Q3Free cash flow yearly is $389 million (""TTM"") with free cash flow estimated at $526 million in 3Q '19.The dividend payment is $0.72 per share, or a payout of $631 million annually is not supported by the level of free cash flow generated by the company. Lance Loeffler indicated in the 3Q conference call:I am quite doubtful this goal will be achieved. It means that free cash flow in Q4 should be over $600 million.3 - Net Debt is now $8.74 billionNet debt is $8.74 billion with a net debt to EBITDA of ~2.5X, which is excellent and similar to Schlumberger (SLB's net debt is ~$14.4 billion).Net interest expense for the third quarter of 2019 was $141 million.Halliburton's fate is attached to the US Shale, and it is clear that the slowdown is here to stay and seems worsening. Thus, it was with no surprise that Schlumberger announced a $12.7 billion impairment charge related to its North American business, and Halliburton's CEO said that the company stacked a more significant amount of equipment than it did the first two quarters of 2019.However, the business sentiment going forward seems to change for the international segment, especially in Europe, Asia, and Australia. Will it be enough?In short, this sector is struggling domestically, and it harms the stock. The trend is down and will stay that way for quite a while.It is what it is.The only conclusion for shareholders and investors is to adopt an accommodative strategy that could provide a profit under the circumstances. We are not in the business of changing the business outlook or searching for the ""why"" or the ""if"".We are here to make money, and I think it is possible by trading HAL knowing that the trend is down.It means to take a good profit on any rally and wait for the unavoidable retracement to accumulate again.Technical Analysis HAL is forming a symmetrical wedge pattern with line resistance at $20.75 and line support around $18. I do not agree with Finviz, and the line support is not indicated. It is the line formed by the low in late August and the low last Friday.The strategy is simple. I recommend selling about 30% of your position, assuming a profit between $20.50-$21 and wait for a retracement to accumulate again from $18.25 and lower. Despite the recent uptick, the trend is still down, which favors a trading behavior rather than an investing behavior.In short, any upticks should be an opportunity to take some profit off the table, expecting a potential retracement to support.However, if the stock can cross its $21 resistance meaningfully, which is unlikely, in my opinion, the next resistance is $24.Author's note: If you find value in this article and would like to encourage such continued efforts, please click the ""Like"" button below as a vote of support.

We are always on the lookout for names that are simply beaten down too far. Our investing philosophy has us seek out both short-term gains and those setting up a potential long-term holding in a quality equity. The stock touched decade lows in the $17 range recently, and we believe that, at this level, the worst is behind the stock. Under $20, we still see this as an amazing long-term entry point. We believe oil is seeking equilibrium after around the low $50 range or higher. At this level for oil, we believe performance of the name and the future outlook suggest the name is highly attractive here. Let us discuss.The company just reported its Q3 earnings, and we were are surprised at the response from the Street to a top-line miss and a bottom line that matched estimates. You see, the stock rallied, not because of its performance (which was decent overall) but because of the outlook. As far as the stock itself is concerned, it has been impacted greatly by the movement in crude oil pricing. The stock is attractive for a rebound as stellar demand continues, as well as a commitment to cost cutting by the firm. Make no mistake, we think that the decline in HAL shares to give us this opportunity to get long.Oil prices have held the $51-52 support level all year, with a few sizable bounces after rallying to start the year. Most recently, we saw a spike following the Saudi attacks, but those gains are gone:Source: Oil Price Charts Via OilPrice.comWe are operating under the ongoing assumption on this buy call that the $50 oil level will hold. If it does not, HAL could return to the $17 level. Our inclination is toward the upside, as we see oil moving trading around its equilibrium point, which we see as the $60 range. As such, we see short-term upside for HAL from the oil price standpoint alone. Operationally, the company is the healthiest it has been in five years, thanks to extreme fiscal discipline in recent years and with oil prices having rebounded.With the understanding that oil prices are so strongly linked to performance of the company and the stock, it is no wonder the oil price volatility has hit the stock. Pricing was weakish for much of Q3, and so, we saw revenue declining slightly. Revenues actually were in fact down from a year ago and came in at $5.55 billion in the quarter. Here is the recent Q3 trend:Source: SEC filings, graphics by BAD BEAT InvestingAs you can see, we saw a decline which we anticipated, but was a bit weaker than expected. Normally, a revenue number like this would hit the stock. At $5.55 billion, the company missed by $270 million versus consensus projections.This miss was concerning on the surface. However, as we drilled down, we understand where the weakness came from. Both segments saw lower revenues sequentially from Q2 2019. Drilling and evaluation revenues fell 4% to $2.05 billion, whereas completion and production revenue fell 8% to $3.5 billion. There also exists a dichotomy between North America and International performance.North America has been a concern for Halliburton investors for some time. While it remains a concern, we want to say upfront international demand was solid this quarter, and we see this continuing. That said, North America is still a growing energy market in the world and, of course, a leading producer and consumer. North America revenue was $2.9 billion, an 11% decrease sequentially. This decrease was primarily driven by lower activity and pricing in pressure pumping services as well as construction services.Internationally, we saw mostly flat revenues from the second quarter even with pricing concerns. Drilling down, we see where strength is coming from. Latin America was strong. Revenue was $608 million, a 6% decrease from Q2, mostly stemming from more testing activity and lift sales. In addition, it was noted there was improved activity in Argentina. Europe/Africa/CIS revenue was $831 million, a 1% increase from Q2. Revenues here were primarily driven by higher activity across multiple product service lines in the North Sea and increased well construction services in Russia, partially offset by reduced West African activity. Finally, Middle East/Asia revenue was $1.2 billion, a near 4% decrease sequentially. The demand helped offset Latin American weakness, which led to overall international revenues being about flat.As we look to Q4, we are mostly interested in regional growth. The action is promising internationally, and North America seems to be showing signs of life. We think the weakness is temporary. We continue to believe that the overall risk is to the upside from here. The company is successfully executing its strategy of controlling what expenses it can control and managing the business to perform well in any market conditions.As oil prices declined from 2014 forward, Halliburton worked diligently to cut expenses. Expenses have been well managed, but management has stated that it is committed to further cuts:This is because, although the company remains profitable at $50 oil, the company can control expenses further to ensure profit. This expense control showed in Q3, as operating income of $536 million total was up from $303 million in the sequential quarter. Factoring in both the short revenues and all sources of expenses being less than expected, earnings per share were about in line with projections.While revenues missed expectations heavily, we were pleased that well managed expenses offset this miss on the top line. Earnings per share were in line overall, even though they were down from last year:Source: SEC filings (linked above), graphics by BAD BEAT InvestingAdjusted net income came in at $295 million, or $0.34 per diluted share. This compares to $0.35 taken in the sequential quarter, but only about $10 million lower overall. This, to us, was a win, considering the revenue number.We think the worst is in. You see, the street is bidding the name up because the company is cutting costs to protect profit but has assured investors it will not lose leadership in the market because of such cuts. It made its workforce cut in the North American region during the second quarter, while keeping its headcount elsewhere roughly the same. The lower headcount is saving money. In addition, they have shelved their fracking equipment as energy prices have waned and producers are scrambling to cut their own costs.We also continue to love the shareholder-friendly nature of the company. Halliburton repurchased $100 million of common stock in the quarter and will continue to buy its stock here, boosting value. With the recent pullback, the annualized yield is 3.9%. This is now relatively high-yielding, so investors will be paid to wait.We see the stock as a strong buy. It has been beaten down, and the worst is behind HAL. We assign a strong buy rating."

Even though the company delivered mixed headline numbers at best, the stock still rallied strongly on Monday, probably aided by multi-year record levels of short interest ahead of earnings day contributing to a bear squeeze.Credit: Industry WeekIn my view, there was nothing to celebrate about a YOY total revenue drop of 10% that was the most severe observed since 2016. Total sales of $5.55 billion missed consensus estimate by the widest margin since the beginning of the five-year-long oil and gas downcycle, at least.To be fair, the North America segment (Halliburton's most important, accounting for 61% of revenues this time last year and 53% currently) was already widely expected to fare poorly once again this quarter. Schlumberger (SLB) had set the tone on Friday when the company's executive team displayed ""lack of confidence in growth opportunities, particularly in the home continent"".Source: DM Martins Research, using data from multiple company reportsBut Halliburton's top-line numbers looked particularly weak (see graph above). Both in North America and abroad, and both from a YOY and sequential perspective, Halliburton's revenues either grew more slowly or fell more sharply than its main peers. Lack of any meaningful sales traction suggests to me (1) loss of market share within an already deteriorating industry, at worst, or (2) quarter-to-quarter lumpiness in the project pipeline that could normalize in the next few quarters, at best.The silver lining came in the form of a sequential increase in margins across both drilling and production divisions (for comparison, total company op margin in 3Q18 had compressed by more than one percentage point), despite the severe loss of scale in North America. In my view, the improvement in profitability metrics, despite the odds, speaks to Halliburton's ability to effectively play full-on defense when needed and protect its bottom line in the face of a highly unfavorable sector landscape.See non-GAAP P&L below, along with estimated EPS impact analysis.Source: DM Martins Research, using data from company reportsExperts and main media channels credited bullish investor reaction to the executive team's commitment to additional cost cutting. I find it plausible that the company's focus on expense management justifies some post-earning optimism.But I also note that HAL's short interest had reached peaks not seen since 2016 just days ahead of the 3Q19 earnings release (see graph below). As bears bid share price lower (notice how the trend in short interest has been very much inversely correlated with share price movement in 2019), today may have been a good time to close a few short positions and lock in some of the 32% in losses that HAL has incurred so far this year.Data by YChartsIn my view, (1) Halliburton's poor top-line results in 3Q19, (2) an early read on fourth quarter performance that seems far from encouraging, and (3) the sector-wide deterioration in drilling and production activity in North America suggest that HAL is a stock to avoid at current levels. I am not quite confident that Monday's rally will be sustainable over the next few weeks or months, as I believe short-covering and optimism towards cost containment are likely to phase out soon."

I believe the company will have a tough time instilling confidence in investors, other than through cost-cutting, as the macro landscape for energy companies seems to be still largely unfavorable. Credit: Inside EnergyAnalysts expect revenues to dip 5% YOY, the largest contraction since 2016. Lack of top-line traction will probably be caused by a number of factors, although the most impactful should be soft drilling and completion activity in U.S. land. As a quick reminder, North America represented 56% of Halliburton's revenues in 2Q19 (see breakdown below).My suspicion is grounded on the fact that the management team seemed very content to adopt a defensive stance in the home continent last quarter, moving more aggressively to reduce headcount, cut capex and stack some of its fracking assets. Adjusted op income in the segment may still grow sequentially, however, as a result of cost mitigation initiatives.Source: Company's 2Q19 earnings slidesBut I am also concerned about the energy space more broadly. Since the spike in crude prices caused by the Saudi refinery attacks of September 14, oil has pulled back sharply to fresh 2019 lows. This is probably the result of weak global economic activity news spilling out of Europe, Asia, and now even the U.S. As I argued a while back, GDP growth is probably the best driver of crude oil prices - and things are just not looking that good right now:Therefore, when Halliburton reports earnings this month, I will be paying close attention to activity outside North America, an outperforming geographic segment that could be impacted by the macro headwinds listed above. With little conviction that the North America business will have recovered much if at all, the topic of discussion on this end of the business will likely revolve around Halliburton's success at tightening its belt.Given the narrative above, I stick with my previous opinion that HAL could continue to tread water in the foreseeable future. The stock is trading at a fairly de-risked EBITDA multiple of 6.7x that is a solid three to four turns lower than it was this time last year (see graph below). But the sector fundamentals just don't seem favorable enough to warrant a share price spike in the near term, in my opinion.Data by YChartsFrom the perspective of a diversified portfolio that is balanced properly across the different sectors of the economy, I would probably favor owning Schlumberger (SLB) over its Houston-based peer. The broader geographic diversification and position of leadership suggests that SLB might endure the potential sector headwinds a bit better, as it has been the case over the past 12 months."

However, the oil market sentiment is of greater importance here, as the oil price is crucial for upstream companies which decide if it is a right time to boost capital spending on the back of more resilient cash flow and invest in growth or not. This, in turn, indicates if the OFSE industry will thrive, generating more revenue together with greater flexibility regarding costs and investments, or not.In my view, HAL does not represent an unambiguous lucrative short-term value opportunity, because in 2019 the OFSE industry will likely continue to suffer from pressure on revenue and margins that stem from capex-cutting of oil & gas producers amid volatile oil price.This year HAL has been barely capable of outperforming the S&P 500 which, even despite a trade war and fears that recession is at the door, has climbed 19.6%. The stock also has failed to outperform one of the industry benchmarks VanEck Vectors Oil Services ETF (OIH) that seeks to replicate the performance of the MVIS U.S. Listed Oil Services 25 Index. Here, it is worth briefly clarifying that Schlumberger (SLB) has the highest weight in the index, 20.86%. Since the beginning of 2019, this company has fared much better than Halliburton as investors have been confident that it is more diversified and protected against the repercussions of the US shale drilling slowdown.Data by YChartsHalliburton also dropped lower than another industry benchmark iShares U.S. Oil Equipment & Services ETF (IEZ), while such peers as Baker Hughes, a GE company (BHGE) and TechnipFMC (NYSE:FTI) pleased shareholders with much better returns, mostly because BHGE and FTI have a substantial footprint in the liquified natural gas industry and have been benefiting from booming spending on the LNG projects across the globe.Data by YChartsTo rewind, in July HAL impressed investors beating analysts' forecasts on adjusted profit but, yet, missing on revenue. Just after the H1 2019 report was released on 22 July 2019 the market acclaimed HAL's outstanding results and operating improvements, the share price soared. Former laggard gained ~8% in a single day.Data by YChartsWas this jump justified? Likely not, as in August and September, the stock performance was lackluster, except for days when the market digested the news on the drone attack on the Saudi oil facilities and its possible repercussions, which swiftly propelled oil stocks' prices; yet, they dropped quickly. What is more, on September 3, CEO Jeff Miller told the Barclays Energy-Power Conference that the firm anticipated 3Q earnings to be at the lower end of guidance. This clearly denotes that the short-term future remains challenging.While 2Q adjusted profit topped forecasts, in H1 2019, the considerably leveraged company (Debt/Equity of 1.08) turned free cash flow negative due to humongous capital expenditures and unfavorable working capital change. More specifically, while H1 capex equaled $845 million, slightly offset by $87 million in proceeds from sales of assets, net operating cash flow fell nearly 3.7x from $1.53 billion a year ago to $407 million. Moreover, its LTM operating cash flow is on the lowest level in almost 10 years, excluding 2016, when the company's net CFFO was sub-zero. For broader context, its closest peer Schlumberger (SLB) has never been net CFFO negative since at least 2009.Halliburton's cash flow and capex. Author's creation. Data from Seeking Alpha Essential Schlumberger's cash flow and capex. Author's creation. Data from Seeking Alpha EssentialAlso, HAL's capital structure is much worse than it was in 2014, as total debt overlap equity after a series of debt issuances in the previous years. Thus, Return on Equity is irrelevant and misleading, and Return on Total Capital should be used as an alternative to gauge if the company proficiently uses funds or not. ROTC equals only 6.82%, which is not a stellar result.H1 operating results hint that something much more important is going on. First and foremost, HAL stressed that development activities in the North Sea are in full throttle; the CEO said during the earnings call:HAL's successes on large tenders are worth meriting as oil companies are dedicated to capex cutting amid volatile Brent price. For broader context, according to the data presented by McKinsey & Company, in 2Q upstream capital-expenditure spend fell QoQ despite an uptick in oil prices, while it was also emphasized that:At the same time, the company had to adapt to the shifts in the North American oil industry. The CEO mentioned that:It is not coincidental, as American shale-focused producers have to cover humongous capital needs that turn them FCF negative and jeopardize dividend (if they pay it) and, consequently, capital appreciation to some extent. Compared to wildcatters & producers overseas, their FCF margins are not stellar. So, most executives in the E&P industry expectedly reoriented their companies to costs and expenditures cutting and strict capital discipline.The unwillingness of E&P shale-focused players to increase drilling & completing activities is the principal risk to HAL's fundamentals. Why is it vital? The critical issue is that Halliburton, which reports sales in two segments Completion & Production and Drilling & Evaluation, generates the bulk of revenues in North America. Middle East/Asia is in the second place, but swings in the US shale are of greater importance. More precisely, in H1 2019, North America underpinned 56.5% of total revenue, while the Middle East/Asia brought only 20%. So, as upstream companies cut their capital budgets, HAL's revenue will be under pressure.Halliburton's closest peers are SLB, FTI, and BHGE. I will compare them using EV/EBITDA and ROTC; the latter helps to check if a company needs less capital to generate higher EBITDA than its peers and thus deserves higher multiple.In sum, HAL is imperfectly priced compared to peers, as its ROTC is the highest while EV/EBITDA is well below the median.Halliburton has an appealing dividend with an unbroken 10-year history of DPS increases. The stock slide propelled dividend yield to ~3.5%.Data by YChartsHowever, readers should take into account that HAL's operating cash flow is in decline, while its net CFFO margin equals only 8.5%, and current headwinds could make it tougher to cover the dividend.For oilfield service companies, commodity prices are of unquestionable importance, as they spur cash flows of integrated majors and pure E&P players, which, in turn, could spend more on property, plant & equipment. Higher prices also secure returns (e.g., ROCE) and revenue targets of upstream firms, and they could start to pour cash in value-accretive projects.WTI and Brent prices have partly recovered since a downward plunge last December, and since then OPEC+ has exerted muscles to keep the market balanced and save it from oversupply and inevitable glut.Data by YChartsThe Iran sanctions and tensions in the Persian Gulf also spurred oil price upward movement. Chinese economic data and a trade war did the opposite, testing Brent traders' sentiment. So, I do not expect Brent and WTI to rally this year, as demand concerns that stem from anticipated global economic slowdown are still relevant.Activities abroad and versatile portfolio together with proficient cost-cutting and capex discipline help Halliburton to offset to some extent the repercussions of the curtailed spending of E&P players in the US. For instance, in July the firm was awarded well construction and completions services for the Libra development in Brazil. In August, it won drilling, completion, and testing services contracts for SNE Field Development Phase 1 offshore Senegal. Yet, shale slowdown is still a drag on its revenue and margins. Given all enumerated above, I give it a ""Hold"" rating."

Investors should focus on the following key items:Oil services firms with outsized exposure to North America land drilling had performed pretty well over the past few years. I had been predicting a slow down in the oil patch due to waning demand. However, OPEC supply cuts had kept oil prices elevated enough to justify robust E&P. In the second half of 2018, Halliburton's management warned investors of a pullback in the oil patch due to budget exhaustion. The company is still feeling the effects of that pullback.In Q1 2019, Halliburton's revenue of $5.74 billion fell 3% sequentially. This followed a single-digit decline in Q4 2018 as well. Revenue from each segment fell except for Europe/Africa/CIS, which was flat.Revenue from North America was down 2% Q/Q. It was the company's largest segment at over 57% of total revenue. The region was hurt by declining pricing power for stimulation services, partially offset by higher activity for artificial lifts. I had assumed Halliburton would diversity more of its revenue away from North America land drilling, but that has not been the case. Middle East/Asia was the biggest decliner, falling 9% due to lower activity and declining pricing power in the region.North America will likely drive the narrative in Q2 and for the rest of the year. On the Q1 earnings call, management intimated E&P was trending higher. The U.S. oil rig count for the week ended June 12th fell 8 to 1,075 versus the previous week; this represented a double-digit decrease Y/Y. My question is, ""Where will future demand for oil come from?"" Industrial production perked up, but has been stagnant for most of 2019. The economy appears weak enough for the Fed to cut rates. At some point, oil prices could be driven by industrial and consumer demand instead of OPEC supply cuts. That sounds foreboding for oil services names.Falling margins could be another cause for concern. Operating income margins for Completion & Production and Drilling & Evaluation both fell 300 basis points compared to Q4 2018. Lower pricing for stimulation services and higher mobilization costs for international projects were the culprits. The fallout was that EBITDA fell 18% Q/Q, while EBITDA margin was off 200 basis points versus Q4 2018. On the earnings call, management indicated margins would improve in Q2:This implied Q1 margin declines may have been an anomaly. This is important; EBITDA growth (or lack thereof) could impact Halliburton's valuation. This also assumes earnings fundamentals matter to HAL investors. HAL trades at about 7x trailing EBITDA, which I do not deem as expensive. HAL is off over 45% Y/Y, despite having benefited from the recent melt up in financial markets.Fed rate cuts could buoy financial markets in the short term. However, the oil service companies appear vulnerable to the vagaries of a stagnant economy. Sell HAL."

The stock rallied 9%, providing shareholders with some relief after the company's equity lost 35% of its market value between first and second quarter earnings days.However, believing that better news could have come out of the North America business (the largest but only geographic segment to experience a decline in revenues in 2Q19), I was disappointed to see that soft demand in the home continent will linger, which I believe will bode ill for the stock after the excitement over improved margin driven by cost cutting wears off. Credit: Fox BusinessHalliburton's international business, accounting for only 44% of total revenues in 2Q19, performed as robustly as expected. Every geography experienced YOY growth of at least 9%, with the larger Asia segment lagging the rest of the world a bit due to lower drilling activity in the Middle East. In the earnings call, the management team spoke again of pricing power, which is always a good sign of robust demand for oilfield services abroad.The largest North America division, representing the other 56% of revenues, delivered a mixed bag of results that appears to have sparked bullishness. The company scaled down its operations in the continent to match weak demand, cutting 8% of jobs and stacking fracking equipment to reduce expenses. As a result, adjusted operating income of $550 million increased a healthy 29% sequentially, despite the lack of top-line traction - likely explaining the EPS beat.I, on the other hand, was less impressed by lack of any indication that the light at the end of the tunnel might be within sight in North America. Revenues dipped 13% YOY, even after depletion of U.S. inventories and commitment by OPEC+ countries to contain supply pushed crude oil prices about 30% higher since reaching a 52-week low in December 2018. Halliburton guided for decreased North America activity in the third quarter, especially in gassier basins, relying mostly on cost management and the strength of the smaller international business to keep earnings afloat.HAL is trading at multiples that I do not find necessarily rich: 18.0x current-year earnings and 7.4x forward EV/EBITDA, both metrics hovering below their trailing twelve-month average (see chart below).But for this stock to embark on a more sustainable recovery, I believe more robust demand and higher activity need to drive the rebound. Instead, the post-earnings spike seems to merely reflect cost reductions, capex cuts and asset stacking, all of which are needed to protect Halliburton's resources from an environment that is still highly unfavorable for the oilfield service operator in its key market.Data by YChartsFor this reason, I am highly skeptical that HAL has left its worst days behind. Absent unforeseen events, including a sudden jolt in crude oil or gas prices that are outside the company's control, I find it plausible that the stock could continue to tread water in the foreseeable future. In fact, I believe shares might test their five-year lows once again before a swift recovery in North America production can finally send them higher for longer."

        Pressure on Halliburton's top-line and operating margins will really strain its financials going forward.
        Management is now expecting stronger international performance to offset weakness in its domestic market.","Image Source: Halliburton Company - IR PresentationBy Callum TurcanThe oilfield services industry faces major headwinds that no operator in the space can fully escape. Downward pressure is coming from a steep drop off in offshore upstream spending since the oil price bust of late-2014, intentional production declines from the OPEC+ cartel which included curtailing upstream investment in the relevant nations, and overcapacity in the oilfield services space that caters to North America’s unconventional upstream industry. Halliburton Company (HAL) posted a second quarter 2019 earnings report that was positively received by the market, but we remain firmly on the sidelines as declining margins and top-line pressure points towards continued weakness ahead. Shares of HAL yield 3.1% as of this writing. Halliburton posted $5.9 billion in revenue in the second quarter, good for a 4% year-over-year decline, however, note that its revenue was up 3% sequentially. Management made it very clear right from the start of 2019 that Halliburton’s performance would improve heading into the second half of the year, considering the precipitous drop in raw energy resource prices at the end of 2018 followed by a slow and uneven recovery since then.‘Completion and Production’ revenue fell 9% year-over-year while ‘Drilling and Evaluation’ revenue was up 7% year-over-year in the second quarter, keeping in mind ‘Completion and Production’ activities represent about two thirds of Halliburton’s sales. North American revenue dropped 13% year-over-year, keeping in mind this division is responsible for ~60% of Halliburton's sales. When removing $247 million in restructuring and other charges, Halliburton’s operating income slumped 30% year-over-year in the second quarter. Adjusted for those restructuring charges, Halliburton’s operating margin dropped by almost 360 basis points in the second quarter of 2019 versus last year’s levels, highlighting the intense pressure a weak macro environment for oilfield services providers is having on margins. Oilfield services providers need to keep offering reduced rates to win over customers, and due to the overcapacity in the industry (such as in American pressure pumping services), those discounts can become quite large. Halliburton’s diluted GAAP EPS dropped to $0.09 in the second quarter of 2019, down from $0.17 in the first quarter and $0.58 in the same quarter a year ago.During the first half of 2019, Halliburton generated $0.4 billion in net operating cash flow versus $0.8 billion in capital expenditures, resulting in negative free cash flow. In the same period last year, Halliburton generated $0.5 billion in positive free cash flow. A large working capital build during the first half of 2019 played an outsize role in holding down Halliburton’s net operating cash flow. The company’s $0.3 billion in dividend payments were covered by free cash flows during the first half of 2018, but clearly were funded by the balance sheet during the first half of 2019. Halliburton's quarterly dividend has been flat since late-2014, due to the need to save cash flow during the raw energy resource pricing downturn and related collapse in upstream development activities. Management also allocated $0.1 billion towards share repurchases this year through the end of June, which we don’t see as a good use of capital in light of Halliburton’s large net debt load. At the end of June 2019, Halliburton was sitting on $1.2 billion in cash & cash equivalents and $10.3 billion in long-term debt, good for a net debt position of $9.1 billion. Considering ongoing weakness in the oilfield services space, it doesn’t make sense in our view for Halliburton to buyback stock when management should be positioning the company’s balance sheet so the firm can outlast the necessary consolidation in the space.Once an oilfield services giant, Weatherford International (OTCPK:WFTIQ) filed for bankruptcy this year as a mountain of debt crushed its ability to function. The company collapsed under ~$8.35 billion in debt and mounting losses. We don’t see Halliburton going under anytime soon but want to caution that even giants are being felled by macro headwinds, which is why we would prefer management prioritize strengthening the balance sheet over modest share buybacks.As mentioned previously, Halliburton is banking on a second half recovery to turn things around. Internationally (ex-North America), management was happy to tout 6% sequential growth in sales in the second quarter while Halliburton’s North American sales rose by less than 2% sequentially. Halliburton’s Chairman and CEO Jeff Miller stated:What we think is most interesting is how Halliburton mentioned that the North American upstream unconventional industry, colloquially referred to as “frackers” or something similar, is maturing. That doesn’t sound like the kind of assessment one would give if you were expecting a sharp rebound in the North American oilfield services industry and highlights how Halliburton seeks international growth to offset weakness in its domestic market. A mature industry plagued by overcapacity is hard to generate meaningful shareholder value in, and going forward, it doesn’t look like Halliburton sees a North American fracking rebound as the silver bullet to its problems. Down below is an excerpt from our 16-page Stock Report covering Halliburton;While Halliburton’s financial performance improved sequentially, that’s off a very low base. Exogenous factors, namely relatively subdued raw energy resource prices, intense competitive pressures in North America, and reduced activity due to the OPEC+ production curtailment deal, are stymieing Halliburton’s ability to perform. When Halliburton publishes its 10-Q SEC filing we will have more to say on the name, but we caution that its large net debt load, weakening cash flows, margin contraction, and top-line pressures will really strain its financials. We are staying away from Halliburton, even after its second quarter earnings beat.Editor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks.

4278721,40351,2019-07-29T14:52:52-04:00,"The market conditions for oilfield service providers remain challenging in North America, with weak investment from E&Ps and an excess capacity of fracking equipment.Halliburton is now focusing on reducing costs and improving its profit margins in North America.Halliburton, which has expanded its footprint outside of North America, will benefit from the ongoing recovery in international markets.","Halliburton (HAL) continues to face a tough business environment in North America. However, the company is taking a number of steps that should help it in preserving earnings and profit margins. Halliburton seems to be on the right track, one that could make it a high-margin operator that can generate decent profits and returns, even during challenging times.Image courtesy of PixabayThe oilfield service providers are operating in a tough business environment, as I’ve discussed in previous articles (such as here and here). The sector is still reeling from the impact of the oil price crash that began in 2015 and forced oil producers to slash capital expenditure, leading to significant losses and job cuts in the oilfield services space. The service providers, who gave steep discounts to the oil producers during the tough environment, gradually started increasing prices as oil recovered from less than $30 a barrel in early-2016 to more than $70 in mid-2018. But before the service companies could turn around, oil prices crashed again by 40% to $43 by the end of last year. Since then, prices have recovered to $56 at the time of this writing but the volatility has knocked the confidence of oil producers who continue to keep a lid on exploration and production spending. The shale drillers such as Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) and EOG Resources (EOG) are now focusing on returning cash to shareholders instead of aggressively growing production.Oil and gas producers have removed several rigs this year. There were a total of 954 rigs operating in the US at the end of last week, data from Baker Hughes a GE Co. (BHGE) shows, down from 1,046 rigs in the same period last year. Halliburton and Schlumberger (SLB), two of the biggest oilfield service companies in the world, have also talked about the weak state of the US market. Last week, Schlumberger said the exploration and production spending in North America’s land market will decline by roughly 10% this year. Halliburton has admitted that the hydraulic fracturing market is oversupplied. Rystad Energy has estimated that there will be 24.4 million horsepower of fracking equipment by the end of the year in a market where demand is expected to be just 14.5 million. This excess supply has put pressure on pricing levels. This puts Halliburton in a tough spot since it is the world’s biggest provider of fracking equipment and holds a leading position in the North America.However, what I like about Halliburton is that it is dealing with the market weakness in the best way it can by focusing on preserving its margins, returns, and cash flows. The company is trying to reduce costs and maximize equipment utilization to improve its profitability. Halliburton has restructured its North American business by removing layers of management which should not only make the company more responsive to changes in the market’s dynamics but also reduce its operating costs. The company has also trimmed 8% of its North American workforce. The company is also actively working to reduce input costs by collaborating with its supply chain and logistics partners.More importantly, Halliburton has previously captured market share from its rivals by maintaining ample supplies of fracking equipment and offering its services at discounts. But this time, Halliburton revealed that it shelved equipment in the previous quarter and could further reduce its fleet size as it tries to rebalance the market. I think this shows that protecting margins and returns has become a top priority. The company’s decision to stack equipment may drag revenues and Halliburton may even lose some market share. But it will also push the maintenance costs lower, utilization might improve, and the profit margins may also move higher.At the same time, Halliburton is doubling down on those businesses which offer high returns and have significant potential for future growth in North America’s maturing market where exploration and production companies are looking for ways to efficiently allocate capital. Halliburton can provide tailored solutions to oil and gas producers which will help reduce their cost per barrel. This includes technology-driven areas such as the open-hole wireline business which helps oil producers in making better decisions about future drilling and production.In the international markets, however, the drilling activity is gradually climbing which is in stark contrast to what we’re seeing in North America. That’s benefiting companies like Halliburton who have significant operations outside of North America. Halliburton posted a 12% increase in revenues from international markets in the second quarter to $2.60 billion while North America revenues slumped by 13.2% in the same period to $3.33 billion.Halliburton made the smart decision of increasing its international footprint before the ongoing downturn. For instance, it increased its service offerings, strengthened existing product lines such as production testing, established technology centers in Saudi Arabia, India, and Brazil, and enhanced its manufacturing capabilities at Singapore. This put the company in a great position to capitalize on the international recovery which we are seeing today. Halliburton has already benefited from the strong growth in activity in the UK and Norwegian North Sea, Malaysia, Australia, and India where it has seized new business opportunities. In fact, it has been so busy in some markets that it is now facing a shortage of drilling and wireline tools. The strong demand should lead to better prices in the future which will have a positive impact on the company’s earnings.For these reasons, I believe Halliburton’s profits should hold up well as the company refocuses on preserving margins in North America in this difficult period. At the same time, the growth of the international business should provide crucial support to revenues and earnings. Shares of Halliburton have performed poorly this year, falling by 10.3% on a year-to-date basis. Its rival Schlumberger, which has greater exposure to the international markets, has seen its stock rise by 10.2% in the same period. I expect Halliburton to continue to underperform in the near-term due to the ongoing weakness in North America.However, once oil prices stabilize and US oil producers start increasing drilling work and capital spending, Halliburton shares will rally. Activity will also likely pick up from next year in the Permian Basin in West Texas as new pipelines are placed into service which will ease the supply bottleneck and the oil majors Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) ramp up exploration and production work in the region.Halliburton stock is trading 12.7x 2020 earnings estimates, as per data from Thomson Reuters, which makes it considerably cheaper than Schlumberger which is priced almost 20x earnings. I think those investors who have a long-term horizon and can stomach further weakness should consider buying Halliburton stock, particularly if it drops to 10x earnings or lower."
4279651,104714,2019-07-31T14:39:43-04:00,"The crude oil price volatility and upstream budget cut may hurt Halliburton’s growth in North America in 2019 and 1H 2020.
        Higher FIDs in the international market can improve margin in the international operations.
        The company focuses on open-hole wireline, production testing, Sperry Drilling, and integrated perforating sus systems to boost international sales.
        Negative free cash flow and a leveraged balance sheet are HAL’s concerns.","Halliburton (HAL) is the second-largest oilfield equipment & services (or OFS) company by market capitalization. The energy market in North America faces a variety of issues. While sales may not decline steeply, the condition is unlikely to improve much until 2020. I do not expect Halliburton’s stock price to exhibit positive momentum in the short-run, but expect it to make a strong comeback in 2020.The energy sector faces strong headwinds inducing the upstream capex decline and fracking and completions activity slowdown. On the other hand, activity improvement and margin expansion in many of the international operations can mitigate the effects. Operationally, HAL’s current focus is on developing open-hole wireline, production testing, and Sperry Drilling. Its free cash flow has been negative in 2019 so far, while the balance sheet is more leveraged compared to some of the large market cap peers. Expect the free cash flow to improve in 2020 when capex falls.To understand Halliburton’s business dynamics, we need to understand the primary industry indicators. The U.S. shale oil production, aided by significant technological breakthrough and the use of techniques like horizontal and pad drilling, has started to exert considerable influence on the crude oil price. From EIA’s data, we see that while the crude oil production in the rest of the world has decreased by only 1% in the past year until June 2019, it grew by 14% in the U.S.As energy production swelled in the U.S., the demand-supply balance has tilted, leading to pressure on the crude oil price. The West Texas Intermediate (or WTI) crude oil price has declined by 18% in the past year. The crude oil price volatility reflects, among others, uncertainty about global oil demand growth and strong supply growth in the U.S. which has led to global oil inventories build up so far in 2019. However, decreasing supply in Venezuela and Iran and the OPEC’s decision to cut production through Q1 2020 did ease the pressure on prices to some extent. The price volatility does not encourage healthy revenue and margin potential for the oilfield equipment & service (or OFS) providers.The EIA also expects crude oil prices to increase marginally compared to the levels experienced so far in 2019. While demand may continue to grow, higher inventories will likely keep prices in 2020 at a similar level. In response, the upstream energy producers are now more focused on improving cash flows and returns. Many optimized their capex spend to maximize returns on investment. In an environment when capital commitment is uncertain, Halliburton, too, has made its adjustments to minimize the damage. Let us check out its current strategies to thrive in the U.S. and to remain prolific in other international territories.In North America, Halliburton improved both hydraulic fracturing and non-hydraulic frac services performance in recent times. In fracking, the company saw mid-single-digit increases in both completed stages and pumping hours in Q2 2019. The company’s pricing for its services offered in North America remained stable, while costs reduced and equipment utilization increased. Revenues from North America increased marginally in Q2 2019 compared to Q1 2019. This was no less-than-remarkable given the 13% drop in rig North American count and the fall in upstream operators’ capex during the same period.One of the services that led to the improved results in North America was cementing product line activity. With increasing well complexity and lateral lengths in U.S. unconventionals, Halliburton’s innovation in light cement slurry let it capture market more effectively. In the perforating gun market, it gained market share with the velocity modular gun, which is a proprietary integrated gun system. Since the system does not require any field wiring, the deployment is typically faster than the conventional perf guns. According to the company’s estimates, the modular guns saw a 40% increase in gunshots within a year of the launch.Halliburton has been focusing on the international energy market growth in the past year. From Q2 2018 through Q2 2019, the share of revenues from the international market increased from 38% to 44%. One of the products where the company has invested in improving technologies in Sperry Drilling which offers directional control for precise wellbore placement while providing necessary measurements during the drilling process. It has recently developed iCruise technology, which is a rotary steerable platform used for drilling onshore and offshore wells. Investment in drilling technology can be critical because this is one of the company’s higher-margin businesses. Replacing the legacy business with iCruise can result in lower maintenance cost and a higher margin. An improvement in drilling technology will also benefit the company’s well construction services.In the international market, the other product lines that are HAL’s current focus include open-hole wireline and production testing. As a result of deploying these new products and services, the company is seeing better pricing in many international markets. In particular, it increased pricing for the open hole wireline tools due to the tightness in the supply in some markets.The offshore international market is positioned to gain from the international energy market recovery. The offshore rig count has also been trending up in the past year. In July 2019, Halliburton won an integrated offshore drilling services contract with Kuwait Oil Company. The project includes six high-pressure high-temperature exploration wells on two jack-up rigs. Going forward, the company plans to add well testing, well construction services, coring, and coil tubing to its offerings in the project.In Q2 2019, the Europe/Africa/CIS region was the most prolific for Halliburton where revenue was up by 10% sequentially. A higher activity across multiple product service lines in the North Sea and increased well construction services in Russia led to this improved result. On the other hand, the Latin America region saw a 2.7% revenue decline quarter-over-quarter due primarily to lower software revenue and reduced fluids activity. Schlumberger (SLB), the market leader, witnessed strongly improved Latin American performance in Q2, as I discussed in my previous article.Before discussing the outlook and guidance for Halliburton’s North American and international operations, let us talk a bit on the strategies to improve the operating profit. To reduce operating costs, the company has restructured North America organization by simplifying the management structure. It has also partnered with the supply chain and logistics organization to minimize input costs. The other aspect of the margin improvement initiative was to retire under-utilized equipment. As the pressure pumping market remains oversupplied, the company has stacked additional equipment in Q2 until the supply and demand imbalance corrects itself. Although this strategy may reduce HAL’s revenues in the coming quarters, it will lead to higher savings from lower labor and maintenance costs.Looking at the demand-supply balance, I think pricing may not increase soon in the OFS business. Halliburton’s management expects pricing to reduce marginally in Q3 compared to Q2. In Q4, due to lower activity from the adverse effect of weather, pricing typically drops in North America. However, internationally, pricing is poised to gain as the supply of some of the equipment can fall below demand in the North Sea.The FIDs (final investment decisions) in the offshore projects typically have a more extended gestation period, and therefore, we should expect many of the projects to get started from 2020. HAL’s project in Kuwait, which I discussed earlier in the article, won’t start before the middle of 2020. As pricing improves in the international markets, Halliburton will look to improve margins by optimizing capex.In North America, lower upstream capex and cash flows will determine the project viability. I expect some of the projects, particularly in the completions side, to scale back. While some of the other energy producers may reduce rig count, most of them are likely to continue growing production in the U.S. shales. As a result of a change in the customer demand pattern, the company’s revenues from North America may drop in 2H 2019. On top of that, the slowdown can be more pronounced in the natural gas-centric basins as the natural gas prices have declined faster than the crude oil price in recent times.In Q3 2019, Halliburton expects to see a stable margin despite lower activity in the industry. The company plans to protect margin by bolstering its performance in the Completion and Production (or C&P) division. Increased completion tool sales and cementing activity, as I mentioned earlier in the article, would be a key factor for the company’s growth. Other activities would include higher artificial lift activity in North America, increased pipeline services in Europe/Africa/CIS, and increased stimulation activity in North America and the Middle East/Asia.Revenues in the C&P division may drop by low single digits in Q3, while the operating margin may remain flat. In the Drilling and Evaluation (or D&E) division, revenues may increase by low single digits due to activity increases in the North Sea and Asia. The division operating may also increase by 0.12% to 0.17%.Halliburton’s pays $0.18 dividend per share, which amounts to 3.0% forward dividend yield. In the past five years, its dividend has grown by 11.4%. Schlumberger’s (SLB) forward dividend yield is higher compared to HAL (5.0%).HAL’s free cash flow was negative $438 million in 1H 2018, which was a steep deterioration compared to a year ago. Cash flow from operations (or CFO) declined more sharply than the revenue fall in the first six months of 2019 compared to the previous year due to deterioration in working capital in 2019.In FY2019, HAL expects to increase capex by 20% to ~$1.6 billion. The higher capex is supposed to be spent on a new directional drilling platform and production business expansion. In contrast, in FY2019, Halliburton’s larger market cap peer Schlumberger (SLB) plans to spend $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion in capex, which would be a 26% fall compared to FY2018. Both Schlumberger and Halliburton look to improve cash flow in FY2019. However, in 2020, the company expects capex to reduce significantly. The lower capex would address the softness in North America while responding to international growth.HAL’s debt-to-equity is 1.1x. TecnipFMC’s (FTI) debt-to-equity is 0.35x. Schlumberger's (SLB) debt-to-equity stands at 0.46x, while Baker Hughes, a GE Company’s (BHGE) debt-to-equity stands at 0.20x. The company’s debt-to-equity ratio is higher compared to its peers’ (HAL, BHGE, and FIT) average, and therefore, the balance sheet reflects higher financial risks.Halliburton is currently trading at an EV-to-adjusted EBITDA multiple of 7.0x. Based on sell-side analysts’ EBITDA estimates, the forward EV/EBITDA multiple is 7.1x. Between FY2012 and FY2018, the stock’s average EV/EBITDA multiple was ~10.6x. So, it is currently trading at a discount to its past seven-year average.Halliburton’s forward EV-to-EBITDA multiple expansion versus the adjusted trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA is in contrast to the peers’ average multiple compression because sell-side analysts expect the company’s EBITDA to decline versus an EBITDA rise for peers in the next four quarters. This would typically result in a significantly lower EV/EBITDA multiple compared to peers. The stock’s EV/EBITDA multiple is lower than its peers’ (SLB, BHGE, and FTI) average of 9.7x. I have used estimates provided by Thomson Reuters in this analysis.According to data provided by Seeking Alpha, 27 sell-side analysts rated HAL a “buy” in July 2019 (includes “outperform”), while five recommended a “hold”. None recommended a “sell”. The consensus target price is $32.8, which at the current price yields ~42% returns.According to Seeking Alpha’s Quant Rating, the stock receives a “Neutral” rating. Its rating is high on profitability, while they are poor on EPS revisions, value, growth, and momentum. I agree with Seeking Alpha’s assertion of a low rating on growth. Not only was the revenue and profit growth lower than some of its peers, but its sales growth has also been inconsistent in the past quarters. I also think the low rating on EPS revision is conservative because its earnings beat analysts’ estimates thrice out of the past four quarters. I would rate its value higher than Seeking Alpha’s assertion. I think its relative valuation multiples are reasonably placed, as I discussed earlier in the article.The upstream capex decline and fracking and completions activity slowdown may halt Halliburton’s revenue growth in North America in 2019 and 2020. The beat the trend, HAL’s strategy is two-pronged – to capture a higher share of the international market which is on a recovery path and product developments. The company expects activity improvement and margin expansion in many of the international operations can mitigate the U.S. slowdown. It has recently invested in developing production testing, open-hole wireline, and gaining market share in the integrated perforating gun system markets.Halliburton’s balance sheet is more leveraged compared to some of the large market cap peers. I expect the company’s free cash flow to improve in 2020 when earnings increase and capex falls. I do not expect Halliburton’s stock price to produce robust returns in the short-run. In the second half of 2020, I expect the stock to make a strong comeback."

Oil prices have fallen from their October 2018 peak; the fortunes of oil services names have also fallen. Halliburton had a lot to prove in Q2 after reporting dismal results for the prior two quarters. The quarter was impressive, but was it sustainable? Q2 2019 revenue of $5.9 billion rose 3% sequentially. This was a sharp departure from the 3% decline reported in Q1. Three of the company's four key operating segments demonstrated revenue growth.Revenue from North America rose 2% Q/Q. The company's artificial lift business outpaced competitors, which helped lead the rebound:Budget exhaustion from customers stymied Halliburton in the second half of last year. Weatherford International's (WFTIQ) financial problems could mean there is more business to go around in the North America land drilling market. However, active U.S. drilling rigs fell by eight rigs, marking the 10th decline in the past 12 weeks; this implies customers may not be back in a big way.International revenue rose nearly 6%. Revenue from Europe/Africa/CIS rose by double digits on activity in the North Sea and well construction in Russia. Middle East/Asia revenue rose 7% from higher completions throughout the region and proved drilling activity in Asia. These regions were slight offset by a decline in Latin America. International markets could potentially counterbalance any headwinds in North America where Halliburton receives 57% of its revenue.Halliburton's management team is excellent at containing costs amid any slowdown in the oil patch. During the quarter the company took a $247 million pretax charge consisting of asset impairments and severance costs. The company is already adjusting its cost structure to better reflect the current operating environment. Smaller oil services firms could follow suit. Total operating expenses (not including restructuring charges) rose 1% Q/Q, less than the rise in revenue. As a result, EBITDA of $966 million rose 15%. The EBITDA margin of 16.3% was up 160 basis points versus Q1 2019. More cost cuts could drive EBITDA growth in the second half of the year.With an enterprise value of $29 billion, HAL trades at 8x run-rate EBITDA (first-half 2019 EBITDA annualized). Its valuation is more attractive than Schlumberger's (SLB) which trades closer to 11x run-rate EBITDA. HAL also appears to be fairly valued given the cyclical nature of the business. However, if global demand (and not OPEC supply cuts) is expected to drive future oil prices, then that could be foreboding. The U.S. economy is in such poor shape that the Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates after raising them in December. Secondly, what happens to Halliburton's earnings growth prospects when cost cuts dissipate?The global economy may have peaked, which does not bode well for oil prices or HAL. Sell the stock."
4274741,92586,2019-07-12T15:45:14-04:00,"Halliburton is days away from reporting 2Q19 earnings, and a shift in narrative regarding North America could be a bullish development.In addition to the recent recovery in crude prices, energy service operators have been reporting an increase in pricing power recently.Despite the potential upside, betting on a sector that, for the past several years, has been a falling knife is a risky proposition.","I know this may sound speculative, but energy services giant Halliburton (HAL) could be approaching a turning point.On Monday, July 22, the company is expected to share the results of its 2Q19. In terms of headline numbers, analysts are forecasting revenues to fall just short of $6 billion, representing a 3% dip YOY. On EPS, the estimated $0.30 would land much lower than last year's $0.58 - a tough compare that happened to be the best quarter of earnings since the start of the oil and gas bear cycle in 2014.But I believe earnings day will be important beyond the results of the most recent period. The narrative for the remainder of the year could turn more bullish, assuming a few trends are confirmed. Credit: HalliburtonHalliburton is less globally diversified than top peer Schlumberger (SLB), with operations more heavily concentrated in a region (North America, representing nearly two-thirds of the company's revenues) that has been facing severe operational challenges as of late. Bottlenecks have developed in the key U.S. shale oil production areas of the Permian basin, resulting in lower investments and an expectation for much more subdued production growth in the foreseeable future.But glimpses of hope have started to surface lately. For starters, crude oil prices have recovered about 30% since reaching a December 2018, 52-week low - supported by depletion of U.S. inventories and the most recent commitment by OPEC+ countries to contain supply. Perhaps more importantly, pricing power seems to be rising at last in the energy services space, as reported recently by a few operators.The price trend seems aligned with an observation made by Halliburton's executive team in the most recent earnings call:As I expect the international business to continue its recovery, particularly with the technically challenging winter season being over, an expected improvement in the outlook for North America could be what Halliburton needs to see its stock finally pull away from a five-year low reached only a few weeks ago.The narrative above sounds bullish for HAL at first glance. And, if the chips fall in favor of the Houston-based service provider on earnings day, a battered stock (down 65% since July 2014) could look inexpensive enough for value hunters to start bidding up the share price.Data by YChartsBut I would remiss not to point out the significant risks involved in betting on a sector that, for the past several years, has been a falling knife. Investors have been tricked plenty of times by rallies that proved to be short-lived, and there is a chance that even good news on the North America front could have a similar effect on the stock this time.For the reasons above, I believe buying HAL ahead of earnings could be a high-reward play that comes with significant downside risks. Within an unpredictable and volatile sector, I think that playing it safer might make more sense.This being the case, were I to place a wager on the energy services space today, I would likely start with an investment in SLB due to the company's position of market leadership and better geographic diversification."
4276907,61381,2019-07-24T01:52:29-04:00,"Halliburton reported earnings per share of $0.09 for 2Q '19 on $5.930 billion in revenues compared to $6.147 billion the same quarter last year. Revenues for 2Q'19 were up 3.4%.Personally, while I recognize some progress have been accomplished this quarter, I am still not impressed at all with Halliburton's performance.HAL could eventually recover nicely to $33 if oil prices turn very bullish due to geopolitical uncertainties, and a position around $23 is quite appealing now.","Source: OilnowI consider Halliburton (HAL) as one of the most solid oilfield services giants. The company presents many similarities with its main rival, Schlumberger (SLB), which I covered recently on Seeking Alpha.The company has a significant presence in well completions and fracking in the US shale, which makes Halliburton sensitive to any shifts in this particular region. The revenues in North America account for 58% of its total revenues.Halliburton noted that the market for oilfield services had touched a bottom during the first quarter and notice some improvement in the second quarter of 2019.If we look at Halliburton's rival Schlumberger, the rhetoric was a little bit of the same. The company was offering a positive outlook for its international business and noticed some progress in the North American sector with further weakness in the third quarter.Jeff Miller, the CEO, said in the second-quarter conference call:The investment thesis is quite simple here. Halliburton is an oil services company.Thus, it is not presenting the same growth quality we should expect from a regular oil investment such as Exxon Mobil (XOM) or Shell (RDS.A) (RDS.B).The stock has sorely underperformed the oil sector in general and can hardly be considered as a proxy for oil prices. I still believe Halliburton is an excellent long-term investment but should be viewed as less necessary in the oil group. Therefore, I continue to recommend holding your long position for Halliburton.As I said above, Halliburton and Schlumberger have a very similar business model. Both companies have a significant presence in the US shale and therefore are quite sensitive to any economic change in this region.Halliburton's business model relies on two distinct segments:Schlumberger's business model is quite similar as we can see below:The North America region represents 58.0% of the total revenues of Halliburton in 2Q'19. Halliburton is present in every unconventional Basin in the U.S. (e.g., DJ Basin, Eagle Ford, Bakken, etc.)Comparatively, the North America region represents 33.9% of the total revenues of Schlumberger (including Cameron US).One characteristic that separates Schlumberger and Halliburton is that the latter has a stronger presence in the US. Thus, any slowdown in this region will affect Halliburton more than Schlumberger.The North American business outlook continues to be an issue for Halliburton. As a result of the North American slowdown, the company is ""trimming 8% of its North American workforce and shelving unused frack gear.""Both companies have suffered a double-digit retracement of about 47% and 40%, respectively, in one year, proving that an investment in the oilfield services sector has been a terrible idea until now.Data by YChartsFinally, one slight positive for both companies is that they are paying a good dividend.Halliburton's yield is 3.03% compared to Schlumberger's higher yield of 5.06%, which increases, even more, the performance gap between the two stocks, in favor of Schlumberger unfortunately.Source: HAL filings and Morningstar1 - Revenues of $5.930 billionHalliburton reported earnings per share of $0.09 for 2Q '19 on $5.930 billion in revenues compared to $6.147 billion the same quarter last year.However, revenues for 2Q'19 were up 3.4% sequentially.Net income reported for the second quarter of 2019 came in at $75 million, well below the $511 million for the same period last year. As noticed in the first quarter of 2019, the North America region was the only region which showed a decrease of 13.2% this quarter.Jeff Miller, Chairman, President, and CEO, commented in the press release:Highlights per region with comments from Lance Loeffler in the conference call.2 - Free Cash FlowFree cash flow yearly is $231 million (""TTM"") with free cash flow estimated at $43 million in 2Q '19.The dividend payment is $0.72 per share, or a payout of $630 million annually is not supported by the level of free cash flow generated by the company. Those results despite a reduction Lance Loeffler indicated in the 2Q conference call:HAL is not passing the FCF test, especially when we read what the company has spent in 2Q'19 compared with the $43 million generated in FCF during 2Q'19:3 - Net DebtNet debt is $9.13 billion with a net debt to EBITDA of ~2.3X, which is excellent and similar to Schlumberger (SLB's net debt is ~$14.7 billion with a net debt to EBITDA of ~2.2X).Net interest expense for the first quarter of 2019 was $144 million.Halliburton was the worst performer in the S&P 500 Index over the past 12 months before the starting of this week. However, the stock has jumped significantly and reached a close of $23.74 yesterday.Personally, while I recognize some progress have been made this quarter, I am not impressed at all with Halliburton's performance.I wonder if this recent jump could be considered more like a ""head-fake,"" instead of something more permanent. Free cash flow is deficient, and the company expects more weakness in the North America segment in the third quarter of 2019. Yes, the company predicts its international revenue to grow at a high single-digit rate this year, with further improvement in 2020. But is it enough to get suddenly so excited?I do not see that as a time for celebration even if the results are considered ""better than expected"" in profit while posting lower revenues. Perhaps as a long-term investor's perspective, we could imagine now reliable support at $22.25 but nothing else.Technical Analysis HAL is forming a descending triangle pattern with line resistance around $23.75 (I recommend taking about 15% off the table depending on the oil prices situation,) and line support at $22.25 (I recommend buying and accumulating at this level).While HAL may cross the resistance this week, I do not see it going for long. If it happens, the upside should be limited to the next intermediate resistance at $25.50 in my opinion (I recommend selling another 10-15% at this level).However, HAL could eventually recover nicely to $33 if oil prices turn very bullish due to geopolitical uncertainties, and a position around $23 is quite appealing now.Author's note: If you find value in this article and would like to encourage such continued efforts, please click the ""Like"" button below as a vote of support.

4274159,63883,2019-07-09T19:48:21-04:00,"Halliburton has plunged 50% in the last 12 months and is thus now trading around its 10-year lows.While the energy sector has been in recovery mode in the last two years, Halliburton has exhibited lackluster results.However, thanks to the negative market sentiment, the stock has become extremely cheap.","By Aristofanis PapadatosHalliburton (HAL) is one of the more cyclical stocks in the S&P 500 Index. Due to its lackluster business performance, the stock has plunged 50% in the last 12 months. Consequently, while S&P is trading at a fresh all-time high, Halliburton is trading around its 10-year lows, where it was trading in the Great Recession.Although the market is justified to be disappointed by the slow recovery of the company, it has punished the stock to the extreme. As a result, the stock has become a conviction buy at its current level for value and income investors.Halliburton celebrated its 100-year anniversary this year. It is one of the world’s largest providers of products and services to the energy industry. It has operations in more than 80 countries but generates 60% of its revenues in North America.Halliburton was severely affected by the downturn of the energy sector, which began with the collapse of the price of oil five years ago. This is clearly reflected in the performance of the company, which posted losses in 2015 and 2016. However, the price of oil bottomed in early 2016 and has doubled since then. This rebound has led the energy sector to return to recovery mode in the last two years.U.S. oil production has been posting new all-time highs year after year and is expected by EIA to keep climbing to new record levels in the upcoming years. This production boom will continue to be driven by onshore oil production. As Halliburton heavily relies on this type of production, this trend should provide a strong boost in its results.Unfortunately, the recovery of Halliburton has been much weaker than expected. In 2018, the company posted earnings per share of $1.89, which were less than half of its pre-crisis earnings per share. Even worse, Halliburton is expected to post much lower earnings per share this year, around $1.35.In the first quarter, its revenue in North America decreased 7% over last year’s quarter while international revenue rose 11%.Source: Investor PresentationWhile the great divergence can be explained by the wide discount of WTI to Brent, Halliburton is also facing some negative trends in North America. Shale oil producers have become much more conservative in their budgets. They thus try to grow their output within the limits posed by their cash flows. This conservative approach has resulted from the recent fierce downturn, which drove some producers out of business and thus provided a lesson to the survivors.As U.S. onshore oil production has reached unprecedented levels, it would be natural to expect Halliburton to post strong earnings. As mentioned above, this has not been the case. The major reason behind this remarkable divergence is the great technological progress that has taken place in oil production in recent years. Oil producers are now able to extract more oil from a given number of wells and thus extend the lifetime of their wells.Source: Investor PresentationTechnology providers, such as Halliburton, should take credit for these major technological advances but they have been greatly hurt, as oil producers now extract more oil at a lower cost. To cut a long story short, Halliburton has been a victim of its own success. Due to the permanent gains of oil producers in efficiency and productivity, Halliburton is not likely to return to the record operating margins it enjoyed during 2012-2014. In other words, the company has incurred a permanent deterioration in its business and hence the stock is not likely to return to its all-time high of $74 for the foreseeable future.As the price of oil has doubled off its bottom in early 2016, it would be reasonable to expect Halliburton to greatly boost the prices it charges to its customers. However, these prices have remained at disappointing levels and thus they have exerted a strong drag on the results of the company. Despite the concentration of the oilfield service market in recent years, there are segments in this business that are still heavily oversupplied. This supply glut has resulted from the extensive investments in new equipment that took place at the peak of the previous cycle of the oil market, when oil was trading around $100 per barrel.In the conference call of the first quarter, the CEO of Halliburton stated that the worst of the pricing declines in oilfield services had passed. That statement triggered a 4% rally of the stock despite the lackluster results in the first quarter. However, as the CEO failed to provide solid evidence on his statement, the stock pared its gains on that day.Moreover, about two weeks ago, research firm Rystad Energy reported that oilfield service providers are beginning to raise their prices, mostly thanks to the consolidation that has taken place in the market in the last two years. However, the research firm warned that there is still great uncertainty in this business and thus more evidence is required to determine whether this is a sustainable trend.As U.S. oil production is expected to continue climbing to new all-time highs in the upcoming years, Halliburton will grow its revenues and its earnings. On the other hand, due to the aforementioned challenges facing oilfield service providers, we do not expect Halliburton to return to the record earnings per share of $4.03 it enjoyed in 2014. Overall, we expect the company to grow its earnings per share from $1.89 in 2018 to approximately $3.30 by 2024 for a 9.7% average annual growth rate.As the price of oil has more than doubled off its bottom in 2016, the business of Halliburton has been in recovery mode in the last three years. However, the stock of Halliburton has plunged 50% over this period. This is a harsh reminder that valuation is paramount for this cyclical and volatile stock. Therefore, investors should not rely solely on the underlying trends of the energy sector to invest in Halliburton; instead it is critical to pay attention to the valuation of the stock as well.Excluding the years in which the depressed earnings resulted in abnormal price-to-earnings ratios, Halliburton has traded at an average price-to-earnings ratio of 14.8 over the last decade. Given this year’s expected earnings per share of $1.35, the stock is currently trading at an earnings multiple of 16.8. This valuation may seem rich on the surface. However, it is important to realize that this year’s earnings have been negatively affected by some special factors, such as the suppressed oil prices in the winter, which adversely affected the budget plans of oil producers. As a result, we do not believe that this year’s earnings are representative of the earnings capacity of Halliburton.If we use last year’s earnings per share, we calculate a price-to-earnings ratio of 12.0. This valuation level is certainly cheap, particularly given that the company is still in the early phases of its recovery. As Halliburton continues to recover in the upcoming years, we expect the stock to revert to its historical price-to-earnings ratio. If this occurs within the next five years, the stock will enjoy a 4.3% annualized gain thanks to the expansion of its valuation level.Given all the above, Halliburton is likely to generate annual returns in the ~17% range over the next five years, thanks to 9.7% annual earnings-per-share growth, its 3.2% dividend and a 4.3% annualized expansion of its price-to-earnings ratio. This is an attractive expected return, particularly given the current all-time high level of the S&P.Due to the challenges that it has been facing in recent years, Halliburton has paid the same dividend for four consecutive years. While a frozen dividend is a red flag for some investors, the dividend of Halliburton is not as disappointing as it seems on the surface, at least for prospect investors. Thanks to the markedly poor performance of its stock price, Halliburton is offering a 10-year high dividend yield of 3.2%.Moreover, the payout ratio stands at 53% and hence it provides a meaningful margin of safety. Furthermore, Halliburton has a fairly healthy balance sheet. Its net debt (as per Buffett, net debt = total liabilities – cash – receivables) stands at $10.4 billion, which is approximately 6 times the annual earnings of the company, while its interest expense consumes 28% of its operating income.While this level of debt and interest expense are not ideal, they are certainly manageable, particularly given that the company is still in the early phases of its recovery. Overall, Halliburton is offering a decade-high dividend yield and is not likely to cut its dividend for the foreseeable future.Halliburton is a highly cyclical stock due to the dramatic swings of the price of oil. In the Great Recession, its earnings per share plunged 50%. The company was even more affected in the recent downturn of the energy sector, as it posted losses in 2015 and 2016. It is thus evident that the stock is highly vulnerable to recessions and even more vulnerable to downturns of the energy sector.As a result, the stock is volatile while the company does not have a reliable dividend growth record. To be sure, Halliburton is poised to distribute the same dividend for a fifth consecutive year in 2019. Overall, due to its high cyclicality and sensitivity to the price of oil and underlying economic growth, Halliburton is not a buy-and-hold stock and it is certainly unsuitable for income-oriented investors with a long-term horizon. On the other hand, thanks to its suppressed valuation level, the stock is suitable for those who want to take advantage of the extremely negative market sentiment for the stock right now.Despite the recovery of the energy sector in the last two years, the recovery of Halliburton has been much weaker than expected. As the U.S. oil production has kept climbing to new all-time highs for years, the lackluster results of Halliburton have been markedly disappointing. The main reason behind the slow recovery of Halliburton has been the fact that the company has been a victim of its own success. Thanks to technological advances, oil producers are now able to extract much more oil from a given number of wells and hence Halliburton earns much less than it used to at a given production level.Due to its high cyclicality and vulnerability to downturns, Halliburton is not a buy-and-hold stock. On the other hand, the market has punished the stock to the extreme. As a result, the stock is now trading near its 10-year lows. Thanks to its depressed valuation, the stock has become exceptionally attractive and thus it is likely to offer excessive returns to those who have the courage to take a contrarian view. Even better, those investors will be paid a 10-year high dividend yield of 3.2% while waiting for their thesis to materialize."
4268405,40351,2019-06-05T10:35:19-04:00,"Halliburton has been eyeing an improvement in pricing levels in North America that could drive margin expansion, but this might not materialize in the short term.Oil producers have released their quarterly results, and most companies have reiterated their commitment to capital discipline and have no plans to increase spending or drilling work.The oil price environment remains unstable, and with fluctuating prices, oil producers will likely continue exercising caution by keeping spending in check.","Oilfield services provider Halliburton (HAL) will find it difficult to recover in the near future as the oil producers seem more committed than ever to exhibit capital discipline while keeping strict control on spending. The recent weakness in oil prices might make things even more difficult for Halliburton. The company’s shares have fallen in the last few weeks and might continue to struggle in the short term.Image courtesy of PixabayThe last few weeks have been tough for Halliburton as the company’s shares have fallen by 22% since the start of May and are hovering close to their lowest level in more than three years. The dip was driven in large part by the growing realization that the shale oil producers in the US – who are Halliburton’s main customers – will continue keeping a lid on exploration and production spending, even if oil prices were to improve to more than $60 a barrel.Halliburton is the second largest oilfield services company in the world, behind Schlumberger (SLB), but it holds a dominating position in the US market. Halliburton reported weak results from North America, primarily the US, due to softness in drilling activity. In the first quarter, Halliburton posted a 7% drop in revenues from North America to $2.75 billion and an 11% increase from international markets to $2.46 billion. The weakness at home is concerning since unlike Schlumberger, Halliburton is a North America focused company which typically gets a majority of its revenues and earnings from here.Halliburton’s CEO Jeff Miller, however, painted a somewhat rosy outlook. In its first quarter press release, Miller commented that the ""worst in the pricing deterioration is now behind us. For the next couple of quarters, I see demand for our services progressing modestly.” During the first quarter conference call, Miller further predicted that Halliburton’s completion and production division, which typically accounts for a majority of the company’s revenues, will witness “mid single digits” growth in revenues and “50 to 150 basis points” improvement in margins as land activity and pricing environment in North America improve.In my view, the above-mentioned forecast initially seemed like a reasonable estimate, considering oil was trading more than $65 a barrel at that time which may have prompted oil producers to increase spending. Additionally, Halliburton also correctly pointed out that these days, the drilling operations have become more intense which is leading to equipment attrition. The oilfield services companies, on the other hand, have reduced their capital budgets and aren’t adding any additional hydraulic fracturing capacity to deal with the increase in service intensity. Halliburton itself has planned to reduce spending to $1.6 billion this year from $2.03 billion in 2018. Similarly, Schlumberger has also earmarked around $1.6 billion of capital expenditure for 2019, down from $2.2 billion last year. In this backdrop, the market could soon face a shortage of equipment that will push prices higher.Image: Author. Data: Seeking Alpha EssentialHalliburton has been struggling with declining earnings. In its latest quarterly results, the company posted an adjusted profit of $0.23 per share, down from $0.41 a year earlier. An improvement in service prices, however, could fuel Halliburton’s turnaround by pushing its profits and margins higher.Since Halliburton released its financial results, nearly all oil producers have also filed their quarterly reports and we have witnessed a notable shift in the mindset of shale drillers. During the quarterly conference calls, all oil producers reiterated their commitment to showing capital discipline by keeping spending in check, focusing on generating free cash flows, and returning capital to shareholders as dividends and buybacks. That’s in contrast to previous years when companies such as Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) and EOG Resources (EOG) talked primarily about aggressively growing production. Some E&P firms, such as Parsley Energy (PE) and Marathon Oil (MRO), went as far as to rule out the possibility of increasing drilling activity in the short term if oil prices were to improve. In this case, instead of accelerating their exploration and production work, some oil producers would rather spend the additional quantities of cash on hiking dividends and accelerating share repurchases. Those companies with relatively high levels of debt, such as Continental Resources (CLR), will also spend the excess cash on reducing debt levels.The fact that oil producers aren’t eager to increase spending anymore, even with higher oil prices, puts Halliburton in a difficult spot. The pricing recovery which Halliburton talked about earlier may not materialize, at least not in a meaningful way, if oil producers respond to an increase in service costs by delaying or curtailing drilling activity. In this case, Halliburton may not report a major improvement in revenues or margins for the completions and production division.WTI Oil Price. Image: Bloomberg MarketsFurthermore, I believe the recent dip in oil prices will further exacerbate the situation. The WTI oil price has fallen by 16% in the last two weeks from slightly above $63 to $53 a barrel at the time of this writing. The drop came as markets weigh the prospects of a slowdown in the global economic growth amid the Sino-US trade war. The White House has also slapped tariffs on Mexican goods and removed India’s special trade status (Generalized System of Preferences trade program). Analysts at JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Morgan Stanley have warned about the growing risk of a US recession in the second half of the year if the trade war gets worse.I think oil prices will likely recover in the near future since the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), together with its allies including Russia, will likely extend the production freeze agreement when it meets later this month or in early July. The cartel, led by its de facto leader Saudi Arabia, has been withholding supply since the start of the year to support the market. Earlier this week, the Saudi Energy Minister Khalid Al-Falih reiterated his commitment to “do what is needed” to stabilize the market. Nonetheless, oil’s rapid decline in a matter of days has likely shaken the market’s confidence. The oil producers are more likely to continue focusing on capital discipline rather than production growth in a volatile oil price environment. In my opinion, the oil’s latest rout could have further dimmed the chances of a meaningful recovery in service prices for Halliburton in the short term.Halliburton’s long-term outlook, however, is still looking good. The oil prices will likely improve in the long run due to the growing crude oil demand, supply cuts from the OPEC and its allies, decrease in oil exports from Iran, Venezuela, and Libya, weak output from non-OPEC producers (ex. North America) due to years of underinvestment, and slowdown in production growth from the US. This will eventually encourage US oil producers to increase drilling work and capital expenditure, particularly when it becomes clear at higher oil prices that they can create greater value for shareholders by spending money on production growth rather than on dividends and buybacks.Oil majors Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) will significantly increase drilling work at the Permian Basin of West Texas and southeastern New Mexico from this year and I believe the independent E&Ps could follow suit in 2020. It also helps that the regional oil prices at the Permian Basin, which is the premier US shale oil producing patch, have also improved substantially this year.Oil in the Permian Basin traded at as much of a discount as $18 a barrel below the NYMEX price in 2018 as growing production and a shortage of takeaway capacity created a glut of supplies. But that discount has now fallen to just $0.55 per barrel and will likely vanish in the future as new pipelines like the Plains All American (PAA)’s Cactus II gets deployed. The new pipes also give oil producers access to lucrative markets along the US Gulf Coast where oil trades at a premium over WTI. The increase in takeaway options and access to attractive prices should also encourage Permian Basin oil producers to accelerate production growth by increasing capital spending and drilling activity. That might lead to higher revenues and earnings for Halliburton.As indicated earlier, shares of Halliburton have performed poorly this year and are currently hovering close to multi-year lows of $21.14 at the time of this writing. Halliburton stock could stay low due to the challenging market conditions in the US. The company may face a delay in hitting its target of growing revenues and margins of the completion and production business, and that might also negatively impact Halliburton stock.Halliburton, however, is too cheap to ignore. The company’s shares are priced around 10.2x next year’s consensus earnings estimate, as per data from Seeking Alpha Essential. This makes it cheaper than Schlumberger, Technipfmc Plc (FTI), Baker Hughes A Ge Co (BHGE), and Helmerich & Payne (HP), which are all priced between 16.3x and 21.3x future earnings estimates. I think those investors who have a long-term horizon and can stomach further weakness should consider buying Halliburton stock."

Source: FortuneI have been a Halliburton (HAL) bear for a few years. Financial markets continue to melt up, which has helped the stock. Now Brent oil prices have advanced above $70, so Halliburton's earnings and its share price could rebound over the short term. Over the long term, its results could be volatile.In my opinion, Halliburton's Q1 2019 earnings were subpar. The company reported revenue of $5.74 billion and EPS of $0.17. Total revenue fell 3% sequentially. This followed a 4% sequential decline in Q4 2018.Revenue from Middle East/Asia was hardest hit, declining by high-single digits. The region was stymied by reduced fluids activity and lower pricing in the Middle East. North America remains the company's largest region, representing 57% of total revenue. Revenue from North America was down 2% sequentially, which was not very positive given the company's reliance on the region. North American revenue was disaffected by declining pricing power for stimulation services, partially offset by higher activity for artificial lifts.Halliburton's management team is top notch and has been forthright on issues affecting the North American land drilling market. Management previously warned investors the oil patch would pull back in the second half of 2018 due to budget exhaustion and seasonal issues. The question remains, has the pullback in North America subsided? Management seemed to indicate that things could be bottoming:It is difficult to predict the direction of future oil prices. Much is dependent on the actions of OPEC and whether future supply cuts are in the cards. Ultimately, oil prices should be impacted by global demand and industrial production. If a weakening global economy hurts production and demand for oil, then it could hurt E&P in the oil patch.Management has done an excellent job of containing costs amid the ebb and flow of drilling activity in the oil patch. However, this quarter the company's operating income margins fell precipitously. Operating income margins for Completion & Production and Drilling & Evaluation both fell by 300 basis points compared to Q4 2018 results. Completion & Production was hurt by lower pricing for stimulation services in U.S. land; Drilling & Evaluation income was hurt by higher mobilization costs for international drilling projects.Halliburton's EBITDA fell by double digits sequentially, while its EBITDA margin of 15% was lower by 200 basis points compared to Q4 2018. This implies the company is working harder to maintain its declining revenue stream. If management's expectations of higher drilling activity do not come to fruition and continue into the second half of 2019, then margins could fall further. This does not bode well for Halliburton.Management engaged in layoffs and cost cuts a few years ago when oil prices fell from above $100. Can the company benefit from further cost cuts to help keep its earnings stream from falling further? HAL is down over 45% Y/Y while the S&P 500 is up over 5%. If record low interest rates, tax cuts and OPEC supply cuts are not enough to spur HAL, then what happens when the punch bowl is removed? HAL trades at about 8x trailing EBITDA, which is not expensive. However, the company's best days may be behind it.The economic expansion cannot last in perpetuity. If the economy falters or the government ends stimulus efforts, then HAL could fall further. Sell HAL."

The revenues in North America account for more than half of its total revenues.Halliburton noted that the market for oilfield services had touched a bottom this first quarter and may rebound in 2019.However, the market did not get enough evidence and quickly sold off the stock on the news.If we look at Halliburton's rival Schlumberger, the rhetoric was a little bit different. The company was offering a positive outlook for its international business but was more cautious for its operations in the US shale which are seen struggling with investments expected to go down by 10% in 2019.Jeff Miller, the CEO, said in the first quarter conference call:The investment thesis is quite simple here. Halliburton is an oil services company, and thus is not offering the same growth quality that we should expect when it comes to an oil investment, especially compared to the oil supermajors such as Exxon Mobil (XOM) or Shell (RDS.A) (RDS.B).The stock has painfully underperformed the oil sector and can hardly be considered as a proxy for oil prices. I still believe Halliburton is an excellent long-term investment but should be viewed as secondary in the oil group. Therefore, I recommend a hold for Halliburton.As I said above, Halliburton and Schlumberger have a very similar business model. Both companies have a significant presence in the US shale and therefore are quite sensitive to any economic change in this region.Halliburton's business model relies on two distinct segments:Schlumberger's business model is quite similar as we can see below:The North America region represents 57.1% of the total revenues of Halliburton in 1Q '19. Halliburton is present in every unconventional Basin in the U.S. (e.g., DJ Basin, Eagle Ford, Bakken, etc.)Comparatively, the North America region represents 34.7% of the total revenues of Schlumberger (including Cameron US).One characteristic that differentiates Schlumberger and Halliburton is that the latter has a stronger presence in the USA.Conversely, while demand for North American completions services has weakened, the companies' international businesses are showing encouraging signs of recovery.However, both companies have suffered a double-digit retracement of about 40% and 33%, respectively, in one year.Data by YChartsFinally, while both companies are paying a good dividend, Halliburton's yield is 2.31% compared to Schlumberger's higher yield of 4.36%, which increases, even more, the performance gap between the two stocks, in favor of Schlumberger unfortunately.Source: HAL filings and Morningstar1 - Revenues of $5.737 billionHalliburton reported earnings per share of $0.17 for 1Q '19 on $5.737 billion in revenues compared to $5.740 billion the same quarter last year.However, revenues for the 1Q '19 were down 3.5% sequentially.Net income reported for the fourth quarter of 2018 came in at $152 million, well above the $46 million for the same period last year. The North America region was the only region which showed a decrease of 7% this quarterLance Loeffler said in the conference call:Highlights per region2 - Free Cash FlowI consider free cash flow as a good indicator of financial strength, and I always indicate it in my analysis.Free cash flow is generally used to return a dividend to shareholders and also allow share buybacks. When FCF turns negative for an extended period, it is a sure sign of trouble.The company will have to add more debt to compensate for the lack of sufficient cash available. Thus, monitoring the level of free cash flow quarterly is paramount.Free cash flow yearly is $659 million (""TTM"") despite a negative free cash flow estimated at $481 million in 1Q '19.The dividend payment is $0.72 per share or a payout of $629 million annually.Lance Loeffler indicated in the 1Q conference call:HAL is passing the FCF test.3 - Net DebtNet debt is $8.93 billion with a net debt to EBITDA of ~2.1X, which is good and similar to Schlumberger (SLB's net debt is ~$14.4 billion with a net debt to EBITDA of ~2.1X).Net interest expense for the first quarter of 2019 was $143 million. In the conference call, it said:Halliburton's business presents a high probability for some revenue struggle in 2019, and while it is a long-term investment, perhaps the best in this category, investors must be aware of the additional risks attached to an ""oil services company"" like Halliburton or Schlumberger.Despite an optimistic outlook provided by the company, the market remains unimpressed and continues to doubt that 2019 will be a year of a gradual recovery in the sector led by regular oil prices. In the conference call, Lance Loeffler said:The cut in CapEx by 20% from $2 billion in 2018 to $1.6 billion in 2019 is a clear sign that the company is expecting a slowdown of activity in the US shale this year, called the ""Shale maturation"" in the conference call. Schlumberger has been very clear about the shale slowdown while Halliburton has not provided enough clarification on this issue, in my opinion.Thus, with a mixed outlook, it is quite challenging to be optimistic about the stock price going forward, and I recommend trading regularly about 30%+ of your position short term, taking profit of the volatility using technical analysis and the RSI while holding your long-term position.Technical AnalysisHAL is showing a long-term symmetrical wedge pattern with line resistance at $32.00 (I recommend selling about 20% of your position at this level, especially if oil prices momentum starts to slow down) and line support at about $28 (I recommend buying cautiously at this level depending on the oil prices again).Symmetrical wedge patterns are not very indicative, and the chance of a decisive breakout can happen in both direction equally.If oil prices start to show some fatigue and retrace a little, I see a potential breakout on the downside with a re-test of the $25.00 (double bottom), which will be an excellent buying opportunity. On the positive side, the stock price could eventually re-test the next resistance at about $37, but it is only possible if the US shale shows renewed activities due to extra-bullish oil prices, which is not likely in my opinion.Author's note: If you find value in this article and would like to encourage such continued efforts, please click the ""Like"" button below as a vote of support.

The Street is betting on revenues of $5.52 billion, representing a 4% contraction YOY. Meanwhile, the estimated EPS of $0.22, if delivered, would fall well below last year's $0.41. Credit: Houston Business JournalAlthough expectations look de-risked on the surface, I fear about the impact that a potentially weaker-than-anticipated North America business may have on Halliburton's stock, considering that nearly two-thirds of the company's revenues are produced in the home continent.As a reminder, peer Schlumberger's (SLB) current-year outlook on the segment looked a bit more gloomy than I had expected it to be. In fact, I believe that SLB's 4% market value loss on Thursday was reflective of the following bearish earnings call remarks about the prospects in the region, which ended up muting the bullish impact of Schlumberger's all-around 1Q19 beat:Helping to counter the pessimism is the strong rebound in crude oil prices in the first quarter that came along a moderation in global supply. The likely implications are a revival in higher-cost exploration and production, particularly internationally and including the moribund offshore side of the business.But once again, because Halliburton is less diversified geographically, I expect that the cons (softness in North America) will be relatively more damaging to the company's financial results and stock sentiment, and will likely more than offset the positive impact of the expected ramp up in international activity.Halliburton is not known for disappointing on earnings day. In fact, it has topped revenue and EPS consensus each quarter since mid-2017. But if there is one quarter when the headwinds may have been strong enough to push results below expectations, 1Q19 could be the one. Irrespective of the actual performance delivered, a bleak outlook on the North America business could be enough to send investors rushing for the exits on Monday.HAL has performed poorly over the past six months, having lost one-fifth of its market value during the period. Therefore, some might understandably argue that share prices may already be discounted enough to reflect the current challenges.Data by YChartsBut I would instead defend that HAL's valuation looks a bit too rich, considering the unfavorable landscape. As the chart above indicates, shares currently sell at a current-year P/E of 23.3x. These are roughly the same levels at which the stock traded last summer, when the slowing of the North America onshore business was less of a concern. In addition, this is about as narrow as the gap to SLB's P/E multiple has been since at least this time last year.For the reasons above, I continue to believe that, within an unpredictable and volatile sector, playing it safer and better diversifying one's bets across different geographic segments make most sense. To that effect, I am much more inclined to invest in a stock like SLB than HAL, certainly for as long as almost two-thirds of the latter's revenues are tied to a region that will likely continue to underperform in the next few quarters."
4255756,92586,2019-04-22T14:30:39-04:00,"Halliburton's earnings day was anything but ""tense"", as a challenged North America region topped expectations on the results and outlook.Management now expects pricing deterioration to subside and service demand to pick up the pace modestly.Following Halliburton's better-than-anticipated earnings report, I have become just a bit less cautious about the stock.","What I had called a potentially ""tense earnings day"" for Houston-based Halliburton (HAL) ended up being much more uneventful than I originally expected.On Monday, the leading oilfield services company reported a modest revenue beat, accompanied by consensus-meeting adjusted EPS of $0.23 that helped to ease concerns over a deteriorating North America market. Probably most reassuring was the management team's vision for the rest of the year, which included the following remark:Credit: Houston ChronicleIn my view, the more upbeat narrative is a departure from what peer Schlumberger (SLB) discussed a mere few days ago. On Thursday, the main competitor spoke of ""lower investments with a likely downward adjustment to the current production growth outlook"" in North America, as well as of ""lower investments, increasing technical challenges from well interference, step out from core acreage and limited further growth in lateral length and proppant per stage.""On the Halliburton side, it was no surprise that international operations (43% of total company sales this quarter) picked up the home continent's slack, producing a solid 11% YOY increase in revenues. I calculate that Latin America alone, the smallest geographic segment, accounted for more than half of the company's top-line growth ex-North America, propelled mainly by strength across the board in Mexico and Argentina.Source: DM Martins Research, using data from press releaseBut this is not to say that North America severely underperformed. Despite the noticeable 7% segment revenue dip YOY, the top-line results in the region came in roughly $150 million above consensus expectation, which is an impressive feat. Pricing seems to have been a drag still, particularly in onshore stimulation services. However, activity appeared to be relatively strong in drilling and evaluation, enough to ease investors' concerns over what could have been a much less pleasant set of results.Regarding profitability, adjusted op margin of 7.4% dipped significantly over last year's 10.8%, likely a result of pricing pressures domestically and high mobilization costs internationally. It will be interesting to see if the margin begins to trend more favorably in the next few quarters, especially if management's thesis on the less severe pricing deterioration plays out.I will admit that, following Halliburton's better-than-anticipated earnings report, I have become just a bit less cautious about the stock. This is not to say that challenges will not continue to exist throughout the year. But the company seems to be navigating the choppy waters with dexterity, which in my view is a testament to the competence of the management team.In addition, with shares still down a sizable 40% over the past 12 months (although arguably still a bit richly valued on a P/E basis, see graph below), it is possible that the headwinds in North America may have already been priced into the stock at this point. Should the continent recover by late 2019 and join forces with a strengthening offshore and international businesses, a jolt in the stock's value within the next 12 months is not out of question.Data by YChartsFor now, I continue to hold SLB, feeling comfortable with my portfolio's current energy sector exposure. But if at one point I considered this name a much more compelling alternative to HAL, today I believe that the latter might be worth further consideration, particularly by those hoping to play a potential rebound off current levels."
4257620,103610,2019-04-29T07:30:27-04:00,"Q1 reported out much as it was forecast, although Halliburton managed to meet or beat reduced expectations.Recently, analysts have shifted their view toward this company, and see modest growth ahead for this oilfield stalwart.The market has misconstrued some commentary from the major services companies, and we provide a different perspective.Additionally, we think with shares under $30, this is a buying opportunity, and there is 20-40% upside in the next year.","Halliburton's (HAL) stock has yo-yo'd since striking a multi-year low in Dec. of last year. In spite of recent gains in the oil price that should build confidence in investors, the reverse has actually happened, leading to 10% sell-off in the stock over the last month. In a recent DDR internal article, I recommended buying Halliburton below $30 share.SourceHalliburton reported Q-1 earnings April, 22nd, and the expectations for sluggish sales and profits for Q-1 were actually exceeded. This comment by Halliburton CEO Jeff Miller from the press release had the stock up 4% at the pre-opening high.The market liked that comment. It was as if Miller was calling a bottom and forecasting better times ahead. He actually was, but managed to pour water on the positive tone of the call in an answer to an analysts probing a bit. Looking for ""color"" they call it.Miller threw shade conceptually on the shale parade in a couple of areas in his commentary and in the Q&A. The first bomb he threw had to do with the coming struggle to maintain production levels.To the untrained eye, Miller seems to be saying that the best days of shale are behind it, and I think that was what most of the analysts on the call took away. What he meant was, the easy stuff (accessible Tier I acreage) is largely behind us. Going forward, to try and stem production declines and actually increase production...it's going to take technology and more drilling. Time will tell if he's right or not. But let's give Miller his due, and acknowledge that he isn't the only Oil Exec saying this about the future of unconventional oil.That said, I am a little surprised he didn't have the wit to tie this thought to the natural consequence: this fact is good for Halliburton! Miller went into a lot of detail in another section of the call about how the company was rolling out new software architecture, Prodigi, and a new suite of Measurement While Drilling (MWD) tools - iCruise. These are premium, high-margin tools that have one job - make more oil for the client - and are charged accordingly. I'll discuss a little more about this technology later in the article.I was watching the tape as he spoke, and in the space of about 10 minutes, HAL dropped about a buck. I am going to guess that they don't have a TV with a NYSE rolling tape in the conference room, or somebody might've elbowed Miller in the ribs. Without that vital piece of feedback, he went on to discuss the North American Capex plan for 2019.Tying this into comments about pricing pressure that comes from too much competition chasing too few dollars, Miller then offered what I thought was the most cogent detail supporting a long-term thesis for investing in Big Red. And the funny thing was I seem to have been the only reviewer that caught it.What he then disclosed was an estimate of 7.5 mm HHP worth of frac equipment that would need to be repaired during 2019, along with a budgetary cost estimate of $1.7 bn. To this, he said essentially (paraphrasing): ""It's just not going to happen as these companies have cut Capex, reacting to diminished customer demand.""What this adds up to is whole fleets of frac gear bleaching away under the sunny skies of West Texas. We call this condition-stacked, and without steady maintenance, it will soon be scrap. And the companies that own them will go out of business. Clearing out some of the low-cost dead-wood keeping pumping prices below rates of adequate return on capital.The trends in fracking over the last year are now:All of this supports Miller's comments about maintenance. Every bullet above means more abrasion per job and shorter equipment life. When you add competitive pricing pressures into this equation, you can expect smaller players to begin to cavitate operationally. As any pump hand knows, once cavitation begins, trouble is on the horizon.I predicted some of this a year or so back in an article I caught a fair amount of heat for publishing. It should ring a little truer today, if you want to give it a read: ""Beware Small Shale Frackers...""With the company's focus on domestic fracking, there has been some pain as energy companies have cut their budgets in late 2018 into the first quarter of this year. The phrase ""Capital Discipline"" has crept into the lexicon in recent times to the detriment of service providers. One company's ""Capital Discipline"" is another company's ""Earnings Miss.""I may not be the only one who thinks that things could turn around for Big Red. An analyst at Raymond James has stuck his highly paid neck out and made a bullish call on Halliburton, suggesting it could hit $45 in the next year. I tend to agree that the back and forth trend for the company should soon be behind us, and the shares move up. Here is what the young financial sage had to say:Seriously??? This guy makes $2,000,000 a year to make pronouncements like that??? Sometimes it's better to be lucky than good, because it's clear he hasn't got the foggiest notion of why this might happen. Anybody know this guy? He could use a subscription to the DDR. Send him a link if you know him.Here is my thesis for what might help to pull Halliburton out its slump. DUCs!SourceYou will note that as of the end of Feb. 2019, there were a total of 8,576 DUCs across the shale basins of the U.S.What is a DUC, you may ask? It is defined in the paste above, so that should give you an idea. Practically, it means there is potentially about 17,152,000 BOPD that could be turned on over the next few months. Now, this will never happen, but if even 10% of it did, it would mean an extra $2.5 bn in revenues for companies like Halliburton.As an update to this section, I can report that DUCs have declined through March, but only marginally. Not enough to give this thesis any legs...yet! Stay tuned though; I think more of these will come out of inventory.It is mostly in the completions business; by a factor of about 2-1. What drives its revenue and earnings is stuffing the wells full of expensive jewelry, (valves, screens, packers), and fracking them to kingdom come. For that matter, Halliburton is the King of Frac with almost 4-million HHP available to split asunder the subterranean earth.That business has stagnated a bit over the last year for a lot of reasons. I'll list a few, and you all help me out if I miss anything obvious.2019 is the year a lot of those logistical issues are going away. Takeaway limits should be a thing of the past. And oil prices are improving. Gas is another story, but 3 out of 4 ain't bad!And let's not forget...a DUC is a made to order opportunity for Big Red.Perhaps you may have noticed recently two things have happened that might change the storage preference for these wells.First, oil prices have risen. Over the last four months, oil has nearly doubled. Something that you may not know is that well costs are skewed toward completion. About 70-80% of total well cost comes during the completion.If you are running an oil company, you want to allocate capital as efficiently as possible, so when oil prices are low, you keep your drilling crews busy building the wells, but keep the frackers in reserve for better days. In shale, so much of the total EUR of the well is recovered in the first year (remember, we have talked about the decline curve in shale), that waiting for better prices can make a huge difference in the ultimate profitability of the well.SourceThe graphic above put out by the EIA shows a decline in well productivity per rig. Let's not delve into the why's and wherefore's of that just now. Focus instead on the raw data and its implication. Wells are not as productive as a few years ago, and that means you better sell what you can for as much as you can.So, better pricing for oil could set the stage for the slow recovery that our intrepid analyst at Raymond James anticipates.""'Nuff said on this?"" Ask questions in comments if you want/need further elaboration to establish this point.Halliburton is selling at a discount to other major service companies and well below its historical multiple. Now I will agree that Schlumberger (SLB) deserves the highest multiple of the cohort. But-t-t-t-t-t Baker Hughes (BHGE) getting a higher multiple than Halliburton?????? That's not right, and at some point, the market will acknowledge this and give Halliburton a boost.SourceHalliburton Prodigi AB service is a step-change improvement over traditional fracking. In a high-level approach to fracturing, we understand that pressure is applied from the surface to a fluid column, creating pathways (fractures) for proppant to enter and hold the fracture open. With Prodigi, the pump rates are controlled by the software for more consistent results.SourceA look inside the frac cabin as Halliburton engineers monitor the progress of the breakdown of the rock. These folks may look young, but to sit in this cabin, they've gotten degrees in Petroleum Engineering and Geology, and had several years of specific training at Halliburton schools.For investors, the relevance of this section ties back to Miller's comments about technology making a difference going forward. This is a premium (read-value added) service that many companies might have eschewed previously, relying on brute force and sand volumes to deliver results.If Miller is right, those days are fading, and this is good for Halliburton! I thought he went on to summarize the future of shale quite succinctly.On to iCruise:SourceRotary Steerable Systems (RSS) are the sexiest thing in the oilfield. They are the oilfield equivalent of the Hennessey Venom F5. Unlike the Hennessey however, RSS units are fairly common; virtually everybody participating in the drilling services space has an entry.The mission with an RSS unit is to minimize drilling time, ensure that the well path is where the client wants it in the reservoir, and perhaps most importantly...not fail.What sets Halliburton (and the other big OSVs) apart is their footprint in the oilfield and the reliability of their equipment. When an RSS unit fails, a risky and time-consuming trip to the surface is necessitated to change out assemblies. Bad things can happen to the well during an unnecessary trip, and oil companies rain misery on RSS providers whose equipment doesn't live up to promises. On occasion, I've seen RSS providers have to ""buy"" rig time from the operator to compensate them for flat time expenses during a trip. Depending upon where you are, a trip can cost a million or more dollars in spread (the cost of the rig plus contractors) cost.Halliburton is committed to leadership in the premium RSS category, and by the end of 2019, iCruise will comprise a third of its RSS fleet.Revenue $5.737 bn vs. $5.740 bn in Q-1 of 2018, and down 3.5% from the prior quarter. This was due to lower completion activity in 2019 vs. the same period last year.Net income rose to $157 mm vs. $46 mm YoY.Free cash flow was negative for the quarter at -$481 mm as compared with cash flow of $659 mm for 2018. HAL says this will improve over the next few quarters and be a positive for the year.Capex for 2019 will be cut about 20% to ~$1.6 bn, reflecting the company's stance on stacking equipment not producing an adequate return vs. renting at a loss.Summary on financialsNorth America, to which Halliburton derived 57% of its total revenue, was the problem child for Q-1. A tightening of purse strings by operators was the underlying theme. Internationally, business was stronger in other markets, and particularly in offshore, deepwater markets. HAL sees stronger quarters ahead in North America and in the international plays.I view downside risk largely priced into this stock at current levels. That said, stocks can always go to zero, and you have to decide for yourself what will happen for the oil price that Halliburton depends upon. If oil tanks below $50, Halliburton's stock will retest the lows of 2016 and 2018. It's not far from that now, so we might even see a lower low for this stock. I will virtually guarantee it in that scenario.My thesis for ownership in the stock is based upon the fundamentals that appear to be playing out. Demand for oil remains strong globally, particularly in North America and Asia. Stocks are substantially below historic averages, leading to upward pressure on the commodity price. Geopolitically, the Saudis (the only actors who have spare capacity) have no interest in flooding the market, despite what President Trump tweets. If WTI stays above $55, life goes on as usual.Sentiment toward the direction of oil prices has shifted dramatically from one of ""OMG, there's too much oil,"" to ""OMG, we're gonna run out of oil."" Quite a swing, but that's the oil business. In recent days, the market has been edgier thanks to President Trump pounding the table on oil prices. With the current tightness in the market, I am not looking for that to have the same impact it did in the fall of last year.Over the short run, something we might as well get accustomed to is a lower range for OSV stocks. In the case of Halliburton, over the past few months, it has maintained a pretty flat trajectory between the high $20s and low $30s. I see nothing that will change that range before substantial improvements in the macro picture. Certainly not before the second half of 2019, assuming a recovery does occur.SourceI agree that Halliburton is under-priced at present levels, taking into account all of my commentary above. Given that, I would be buyer in the mid-$20s and trade out of about 25% of my position around $32/share.Long term, 2020 and beyond, I remain bullish on a substantially higher price for Halliburton and would want to maintain a core position to be long when the market reprices the stock."
4235338,33291,2019-01-24T12:55:04-05:00,"HAL stock looks promising under $30 for a number of reasons, but we note that Q4 was better than expected, despite the stock tanking several points, catching our attention.Oil began to rally for a few weeks to start the year, so hopefully, this is the beginning of oil finding equilibrium around  $50-$60 in the near to medium term.While we anticipate a bounce in the near term, if oil prices remain depressed, share repurchases and a dividend boost value if we get stuck waiting.","We are always on the lookout for a BAD BEAT, for both short term gains and those setting up a potential long-term entry point into a quality equity primed for a bounce. Halliburton (HAL) appears to be setting up for such a situation. This is a strong choice for an oil service stock and is our second choice behind competitor Schlumberger (SLB) long-term. As we all know oil has been looking for equilibrium after tumbling hard to end 2018. Here in 2019 oil has begun to rebound as did HAL's price. However, the stock is giving us another shot to come in possibly under $30 for the longer-term.The company just reported earnings, and we were are surprised at the response from the Street to a top-line beat and a bottom line beat. While it doesn't help that crude oil is falling this week, the quarter was better than expected. We think that the decline is mostly driven by oil, again, but in part over North American fears.The Street is interpreting the results as somewhat lackluster relative to consensus expectations, but we think this is misguided. The 5% plus selloff is an opportunity here. We know that Halliburton stock has rebounded nicely as oil prices have regained strength, but the stock has pulled back toward support levels today:As you can see in the current decade's chart, the stock has given up tremendous gains, then rebounded, then fallen again with oil cycles. We are emerging from a downturn in oil, and think that shares under $30 are worth considering especially if you get to play anything in the oil space. Without question, you will profit in the long term, though we suspect you can get away with holding for a few weeks to a quarter to see some quick gains. We see this $30 line as holding, so long as oil prices do not plummet to 20-30. We think this key level will hold, and investors should be looking to establish a position below this level especially if oil stays in the $50 range. We think a rebound toward $40 is likely based on the chart. That said, let's talk more about the fundamentals.Target entry: $28-$30Target exit: $35-$40Stop: $24Time frame: MonthsOil prices have rallied in recent weeks though today oil has receded a bit, but price remains in a short-term uptrend and are at a level where oil service stocks should remain profitable.Source: Oil Price Charts Via OilPrice.comWTI crude as an example here has support around $50, and bounced off heavy support at $42, and we believe this line will hold. If it does not, downside could be ahead for HAL, and we would want to watch the $28 level for HAL stock. Our inclination is toward the upside, as we see oil moving back toward equilibrium following this huge selloff, around $60. As such, we see short-term upside for HAL from the oil price standpoint alone. Operationally, the company is the healthiest it has been in five years, thanks to extreme fiscal discipline in recent years and with oil prices having rebounded. In short, we are again excited about the name with this recent pullback.Overall, oil has been looking for equilibrium between the peaks in 2007-2008, to the lows of 2009-2010. We have seen spikes and falls. Ultimately, we think the equilibrium price long term is in the $70-80 range, but in the near term is $60. This remains to be seen, however. With this understanding, and oil having fallen for most of Q4, we saw revenue declining slightly. Revenues actually were flat from a year ago (a big win) and came in at $5.94 billion in the quarter. Here is the recent Q4 trend:Source: SEC filingsThis top line is very strong considering the decline in oil. The chart is a major testament to how correlated revenues are to the price of oil. Our expectations were for $5.80 billion, and the company brought in an additional $140 million over our projections. We should note that consensus estimates were more liberal than our estimates, and Halliburton beat these by $80 million.Overall, this is flat from last year. It is nothing to get too excited about, but again, given the huge decline in oil, it's a win. We anticipate revenue growth will continue if oil stabilizes, and right now for Q1, we see revenues as flat again, depending on the next month of price action.The regional data could be causing concern, especially North America, which needs to be highlighted. As we know, this is a growing energy market in the world and, of course, a leading producer and consumer. North America revenue in the fourth quarter of 2018 was $3.3 billion, an 11% decrease sequentially. This decrease was primarily driven by lower activity and pricing in stimulation services, partially offset by higher fluids activity in the Gulf of Mexico.Internationally, we saw mostly increases from the third quarter despite pain in pricing. Latin America revenue was $607 million, a 16% increase from Q3, mostly stemming from year-end software and completion tool sales, but there was also higher stimulation activity across the region. In addition, it was noted there was improved activity in Mexico. Europe/Africa/CIS revenue was $746 million, relatively flat sequentially. Revenues here saw a seasonal decline in pipeline services across the region, as well as lower activity in the North Sea. On a positive note year-end completion tool sales in Ghana and Nigeria were up nicely. Finally, Middle East/Asia revenue was $1.2 billion, an 8% increase sequentially, stemming from year-end completion tool sales in the Middle East, coupled with higher project management activity throughout the region.So what about looking ahead? We think the decline in oil prices will pinch in Q1 and possibly Q2 depending on the trajectory in oil in the next few weeks, but we are mostly interested in regional growth. The action is promising internationally, though North America seems to be lagging. We think this is temporary. We continue to believe that the overall risk is to the upside from here as the rebound in oil is a long overdue reversion toward the mean, even factoring in the recent pullback in prices. If the company can continue its diligent expense management, we see earnings expanding.Keep in mind that as oil prices declined from 2014 forward, Halliburton worked diligently to cut expenses, first by cutting the fat, then by becoming surgical. It was operating at the bare bones levels, turning off rigs, cutting staff, etc. That said, to generate higher revenues, often time more spending is necessary to bring operations online, to fund labor, pay for expansion etc. We are now in an oil price environment where some of these precautions will be exercised again. Operating expenses were mostly in line with last year, and operating income was up.We were expecting a rise in costs but were looking for $5.3 billion, so the company spent nearly ~$28 million more than we anticipated at $5.328 billion to generate its operating income of $608 million total. Of course this is much lower than last year's income, but better than expected. Much of this was due to higher-than-expected revenues, though we note expenses were also driven up by increased drilling services and project management activity in Asia. Halliburton did see similar interest and lower corporate-related expenses. Factoring in both revenues and expenses, our estimates for earnings per share were exceeded.With the recent action in the stock, we can only surmise that the quarter is being interpreted as bearish by the Street, but again, the market is down overall, as is oil. So, we think this is a classic BAD BEAT. Revenues surpassed our expectations, while expenses were also slightly higher as well. The net impact led to earnings that exceeded our expectations and that of analysts but did decline overall, as operating income was of course down:Source: SEC filings (linked above)Adjusted net income came in at $358 million, or $0.41 per diluted share. This compares to $0.53 taken in during last year's Q4, adjusted for impairment charges. On the whole, earnings were well above the $0.38 we expected, and above that of the Street. It is a win. A major decline is an opportunity to get long sub-$30.As North American oil production reaches historic highs, operators focus on returns over growth, and the international recovery continues, Halliburton is well prepared to thrive. The company will dynamically respond to the changing market environment, reduce capital spending, develop differentiating technologies, and generate strong cash flow.It is a reliable investment each and every single time oil collapses. We wanted to see the results of Q4 before recommending it, but think you can absolutely rest assured you will have a positive return by purchasing this stock in the $20 range. We are just above $30 here. While it will be a rough year if oil remains in the $40 range, we think that oil will find balance in the $50 range, which suggests the stock will rally well above $30 and march toward $40 as oil approached $60.Halliburton repurchased $200 million of common stock in the quarter and will continue to buy its stock here, boosting value. With the recent pullback, the annualized yield is 2.3%. While this is not high-yielding, investors will be paid to wait.We remain bullish and think this is a classic bad beat under our philosophy of investing. While oil prices drive the major momentum in this stock and the sector for the most part, we have a rare opportunity to take advantage of a market overreaction that is mispricing the stock, in our opinion.With oil prices moving higher on the long-term chart and looking to stabilize around $50 short term and then $60 in the medium term, the company should have no issue exceeding expectations. We think you can safely buy under $30. Worst-case scenario it takes more than a few weeks or months to see a profit, but it's pretty inevitable. It requires patience."
4277266,33291,2019-07-24T19:27:50-04:00,Halliburton recently hit a near ten-year low.We are always on the lookout for both short term gains and those names setting up a potential long-term entry point into a quality equity primed for a bounce.Energy prices led to immense pressure on the firm but recent results suggest the name is a buy here at $22.,"We are always on the lookout for names that are simply beaten down too far. Our investing philosophy has us seek out both short-term gains and those setting up a potential long-term holding in a quality equity. Over 6 months ago we made a quick trade in Halliburton (HAL), but it now appears to be setting up for an amazing long-term entry point, and we think our followers need to know about this stock as we just came back into the name here at $22. We believe oil is seeking equilibrium after tumbling hard to end 2018 and then trading with high volatility here in 2019. We believe performance of the name and the future outlook suggest the name is highly attractive here. Let us discuss.The company just reported earnings, and we were are surprised at the response from the Street to a top-line miss and a bottom line beat. While it doesn't help that crude oil has been all over the map of late, the quarter was better than expected. This was in part driven by stellar demand, as well as cost cutting by the firm. Make no mistake, we think that the decline in HAL shares to give us this opportunity was mostly driven by oil prices as well as concerns over earnings which were clearly set to fall from years past. That said, we see better days ahead.Halliburton stock has rebounded to the $22 level here and looks to move higher. As traders we want to ride this wave higher, but looking at the name from a longer-term perspective, that stock looks set to move higher, provided oil prices stay at these moderated levels or higher. The long-term chart also suggests that the name is a buy:Source: Graphics by BAD BEAT Investing ChartistAs you can see in the current decade's chart, the stock has given up tremendous gains, then rebounded, then fallen again with oil cycles. We are emerging from a downturn in oil, and think that shares at $22 are worth considering. Right now this could be the best play in the space. Without question, you will profit in the long-term, unless you are so bearish on oil you see it trading at $30 for years to come, bankrupting the company. We see a bounce toward $30 line as highly likely and investors should be looking to establish a position now especially if oil stays in the high $50 range or better. We think a rebound toward $40 long-term is likely based on the chart. That said, let's talk more about the fundamentals.Target entry: $21.75-$23Target exit: $30 (short-term), $40 (long-term)Stop: $20Options play: Purchase the June $25 contract for $2.25Time frame: 3-6 MonthsOil prices have rallied in recent weeks though today oil has receded a bit, but price remains in a short-term uptrend and are at a level where oil service stocks should remain profitable.Source: Oil Price Charts Via OilPrice.comWTI crude as an example here has support around $50, and bounced off heavy support at $42 back in January. We are operating under the assumption on this buy call that the $50 oil level will hold. If it does not, downside could be ahead for HAL, and we would want to watch the $20 level for HAL stock as a stop. Our inclination is toward the upside, as we see oil moving trading around its equilibrium point, which we see as the $60-$65 range. As such, we see short-term upside for HAL from the oil price standpoint alone. Operationally, the company is the healthiest it has been in five years, thanks to extreme fiscal discipline in recent years and with oil prices having rebounded. We have seen spikes and falls in oil and will see them again. Ultimately, we think the equilibrium price long term is in the $70-80 range, but in the near term is $60. This remains to be seen, however. With this understanding, and oil volatile for much of Q2, we saw revenue declining slightly. Revenues actually were in fact down from a year ago and came in at $5.93 billion in the quarter. Here is the recent Q2 trend:Source: SEC filings, graphics by BAD BEAT InvestingThis top line is very strong considering the decline in oil. The revenue chart is prime evidence for how correlated revenues are to the price of oil. Our expectations were for $5.95 billion, and the company missed by $20 million versus our projections. We should note that consensus estimates were more liberal than our estimates, and Halliburton missed these by $40 million. That said, the slight miss was unconcerning, and we are looking forward to the next quarter. Revenues were nothing to get too excited about, but again, given the huge decline in oil, it's a win. We anticipate revenue growth will resume if oil stabilizes, and right now for Q3, we see revenues as down 4-5% again, depending on the next month of price action.North America has been a concern for investors for sometime. While it remains a concern, we want to say upfront international demand was solid this quarter, and we see this continuing given global energy use patterns. North America is a growing energy market in the world and, of course, a leading producer and consumer. North America revenue was $3.3 billion, an 2% increase sequentially. This increase was primarily driven higher stimulation, partially offset by higher fluids activity in the Gulf of Mexico.Internationally, we saw mostly increases from the first quarter despite some pain in pricing. Latin America revenue was $571 million, a 3% decrease from Q1, mostly stemming lower software. In addition, it was noted there was improved activity in Mexico. Europe/Africa/CIS revenue was $823 million, a solid 10% spike from Q1. Revenues here were primarily driven by higher activity across multiple product service lines in the North Sea and increased well construction services in Russia, partially offset by reduced software revenue throughout the region. Finally, Middle East/Asia revenue was $1.2 billion, an 7% increase sequentially. The demand helped offset Latin American weakness.So what about looking ahead? We think the volatile oil prices will squeeze Q3 revenues but should be roughly flat sequentially, although it is looking like we will see a year-over-year decline since oil is down 15 points a barrel. However, these results depend heavily on the trajectory in oil in the next few weeks and you never know what you are going to get out of OPEC or international relations or demand. As we look to Q3 we are mostly interested in regional growth. The action is promising internationally and North America seems to be showing signs of life. We think this is temporary. We continue to believe that the overall risk is to the upside from here. The company is successfully executing its strategy of controlling what expenses it can control and managing the business to perform well in any market conditions.As oil prices declined from 2014 forward, Halliburton worked diligently to cut expenses, first by cutting the fat, then by becoming surgical. We are now in an oil price environment where some of these precautions will be exercised again as the company controls what it can control. However, operating expenses were up from last year, while operating income was down. Take a look at expenses in Q2:We were expecting higher costs given the drilling and evaluation work being down, and were $5.5-$5.6 billion .At $5.62 billion the company spent nearly ~$20 million more than we anticipated to generate its operating income of $303 million total. Of course this is much lower than last year's income, since revenues were down as well. Halliburton did see similar interest and lower corporate-related expenses. Factoring in both revenues and all sources of expenses, our estimates for earnings per share were exceeded.While revenues just missed expectations and operating margin was a touch lower than expected, the company saw moderate expenses elsewhere and led to slightly better than expected earnings per share, even though they were down from last year:Source: SEC filings (linked above), graphics by BAD BEAT InvestingAdjusted net income came in at $303 million, or $0.35 per diluted share. This compares to $0.58 taken in during last year's Q2, adjusted for impairment charges. On the whole, earnings were well above the $0.32 we expected, and above that of the Street. It is a win.The company is cutting costs. It made its workforce cut in the North American region during the second quarter, while keeping its headcount elsewhere roughly the same. Overall it is down 8% of the workforce in North America which will benefit Q3. In addition, they have shelved their fracking equipment as energy prices have waned and producers are scrambling to cut their own costs. This will be great moving forward. As producers look to curb their appetite, it could generate further benefits in pricing as the supply/demand curve evens out.We continue to love the shareholder-friendly nature of the company. Halliburton repurchased $100 million of common stock in the quarter and will continue to buy its stock here, boosting value. With the recent pullback, the annualized yield is 3.3%. This is now relatively high-yielding, so investors will be paid to wait.We see the stock as a strong buy. It has been beaten down, perhaps a bit too far. We think a rally is in order, especially since the company is set to reduce costs. Oil prices are moderate and we see risk to the upside. The yield is north of 3%, and the repurchases directly boost shareholder equity. We like this play right here, right now."
4235412,104714,2019-01-24T15:45:07-05:00,The North American completion activity slowdown and global economic growth factors will affect Halliburton’s short-term growth.HAL is diversifying its revenue base geographically.International energy market recovery can pull HAL up in the medium term.Halliburton’s cash flow position is strong.,"Halliburton (HAL) is the second-largest oilfield equipment & services (or OFS) company by market capitalization. Faced with industry headwinds and demand growth concerns, HAL has opted to increase its share of revenues from international markets to partially offset the risk factors specific to the North America market.In Q1 2019, HAL cannot escape the negative forces, as both North America and international operations could decelerate. After that, HAL is likely to see a steeper growth trajectory based on its strong project pipeline, product innovations, and robust growth in the Asia Pacific and Africa markets. I expect Halliburton’s stock price to remain weak in the short-run before it makes a comeback by the second half of the year. In the past year, Halliburton’s stock price has gone down by 45%, and was in line with the VanEck Vectors Oil Services ETF’s (OIH) performance, which declined by nearly 43% during this period.To understand the current premises in which Halliburton’s business is established, we need to understand the critical energy industry dynamics. The U.S. shale oil production, aided by significant technological breakthrough and the use of techniques like horizontal and pad drilling, has started to exert considerable influence on crude oil price. From EIA’s data, we see that while the world crude oil production has increased by only 3% in the past two years until September 2018, its growth was 35% in the U.S. Also, EIA’s DPR data shows that the key U.S. shales accounted for the majority of this increase.As energy production swelled in the U.S., the demand-supply balance has tilted, leading to pressure on the crude oil price. The West Texas Intermediate (or WTI) crude oil price, which was making a recovery after the 2014-16 crash, has again weakened in 2018. In the past year, the WTI crude oil price has declined by 19%. However, the crude oil price has a multitude of drivers, and they are not unidirectional. The geopolitical issue, falling production in some of the traditional energy-producing regions, and an OPEC-led production cut still favors a long-term recovery or an increase in crude oil price. Add to that the maturing asset base in the Middle East, significant underinvestment in the non-OPEC region where upstream producers have once again begun making investments, and the steep decline curves of the new wells in U.S. shales – the picture becomes more evident that the OFS providers have a potentially strong long-term market.There have been some concerns about demand growth though. In a January update, the IMF revised down its October forecast following Germany’s introduction of new automobile fuel emission standards, concerns about sovereign and financial risks in Italy and some concerns in Turkey. Earlier, in its October report, concluded that although the global economy is still expanding, the downside risks to global growth have risen. The sanctions on oil supply from Iran and OPEC’s oil production target are the two most ambiguous geopolitical factors to affect crude oil price. The EIA also expects crude oil prices to remain lower than the levels experienced during most of 2018. Led by increased demand for light-sweet crude oil, crude oil price can make a comeback in late-2019 and 2020.In response to these developments, many of HAL’s customers have shifted their strategy from production growth to improving cash flows and returns. Many optimized their capex spend to maximize returns on investment. In an environment when capital commitment is uncertain, Halliburton, too, has made its adjustments to minimize the damage. Since 2016, Halliburton also got a sniff of things to come and undertook structural cost changes by reducing personnel costs, rationalizing real estate infrastructure, streamlining the manufacturing footprint, and product design changes to increase throughput. The company also maintains a coherent asset base. Halliburton’s frac equipment manufacturing centers enabled the company to keep its production costs lower.In the international market, Halliburton’s strategy is to focus on the energy market recovery by building mature fields capabilities in 2019 and beyond. Technology is another aspect of HAL’s strategic outfit. In 2018, the company received nearly 900 patents, a 10% year-over-year increase. Over the last few years, technological advancement towards enabling higher well productivity will drive efficiencies in North American onshore shale operations. HAL’s Prodigi AB Intelligent fracturing service is a case in this point. It helps automate the breakdown process of a fracturing treatment. This helps improve cluster performance, increases production, and reduces strain on HAL’s equipment. Despite HAL’s focus on technology, the spending on R&D decreased from 2.1% of its revenues in FY2015 to 1.7% in FY2017. The FY2018 figures are not available yet, as on the date of the report.Halliburton has recently signed two contracts with Eni (E) to provide integrated drilling services in Iraq. Under the agreements, Halliburton will mobilize four to six rigs over the next two years. Also in December 2018, HAL acquired SmartFibres. SmartFibres manufactures downhole fiber optic pressure gauges, which complements HAL’s production enhancement portfolio in the unconventional and mature fields.By segments: In Q4 2018, Halliburton’s revenues from the Completion and Production segment decreased by 8% compared Q3 2018 due to lower activity and pricing for stimulation services in North America. The segment operating income declined by 19% during this period.Revenues from the Drilling and Evaluation segment, on the other hand, increased by 5% due to higher software sales, increased fluids activity in the Gulf of Mexico, and improved project management activity in Latin America. The segment operating income remained nearly flat during this period.By geographies: On a quarter-over-quarter basis, Halliburton’s revenue growth was the lowest in North America (10.6% down), while it was the highest in HAL’s Latin America operations (16.3% up). The decrease was in North America was primarily driven by lower activity and pricing in stimulation services. However, increased fluids sales in the Gulf of Mexico mitigated some of the falls. Latin America operation was boosted by software, completions tools, and stimulation activity, particularly in Mexico.For the full year, HAL’s FY2018 revenue grew BY 16% compared to FY2017, while adjusted operating income increased by 35% in the past year. While HAL’s revenues increased handsomely in the first nine months of 2018, the growth retrenched in the final quarter following a crude oil price crash. Energy price continues to remain volatile.In Q1 2019, HAL’s revenue is subject to seasonality, while the Q4-end lump-sum sales of products and software could lead to a further decline. On top of that, HAL’s newly won contract prices were competitively placed in 2018, and so, the effect of reduced prices can lead to lower margin in Q1 2019.These adverse effects will gradually taper off as energy activities in various international geographies pick up, leading to an improvement in prices for HAL’s products and services. HAL’s management plans to spread its work efficiently among its geographies to seek higher returns. In particular, given the lower base in the Asia Pacific and Africa, the existing contract backlog and the project pipeline is expected to lead to single-digit growth in Halliburton’s international operations in FY2019 compared to FY2018.Halliburton’s management expects, despite the crude oil price pressure and completion activity slowdown, it will be able to generate positive FCF. In the Completion and Production division, HAL expects revenues to decline by a mid- to high-single-digits, while the segment operating margin can decrease by 3% to 4%. Investors may note that in Q4 2018, the segment operating margin was 13%.In the Drilling and Evaluation division, HAL again expects revenues to decline by a mid- to high-single-digits, while the segment operating margin can decrease by 1% to 1.5%. Investors may note that in Q4 2018, the segment operating margin was 8.8%. Regarding drilling activity slowdown in Q1, Halliburton’s management commented in the Q4 earnings call,HAL’s dividend: Halliburton’s pays $0.18 dividend per share, which amounts to 2.3% forward dividend yield. In the past five years, its dividend has grown by 11.4%. Schlumberger’s (SLB) dividend is higher compared to HAL (4.6%).HAL’s free cash flow was $1.1 billion in FY2018, which was a marginal improvement compared to FY2017. While cash flow from operations improved in line with the revenue growth in the past year, Halliburton spent a lot more in capex in 2018.In FY2019, HAL expects to increase capex by 20% to ~$1.6 billion. The higher capex is supposed to be spent on new directional drilling platform and production business expansion. In contrast, in FY2019, Halliburton’s larger market cap peer Schlumberger (SLB) plans to spend $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion in capex, which would be a 26% fall compared to FY2018. Read more on SLB here. Both Schlumberger and Halliburton look to improve cash flow in FY2019. However, compared to SLB, HAL’s free cash flow improvement would be more prominent because of the simultaneous increase in capex, which can be used to accelerate revenue generating opportunities or reducing debt.Regarding this, HAL commented in the Q4 earnings call,Under a 2017 share repurchase plan, ~$5.5 billion remained authorized for repurchase as of September 30, 2018. During Q4 2018, HAL repurchased shares worth $200 million. This leaves ~$5.3 billion for further repurchase.HAL’s debt-to-equity is 1.2x. Its debt-to-equity ratio is higher compared to its peers (HAL, BHGE, and FIT) average. Schlumberger's (SLB) debt-to-equity stands at 0.47x, while Baker Hughes, a GE Company’s (BHGE) debt-to-equity stands at 0.20x. TecnipFMC’s (FTI) debt-to-equity is 0.3x. With improved cash, HAL can look forward to a stable or a marginally improved balance sheet in FY2019.Halliburton is currently trading at an EV-to-adjusted EBITDA multiple of 8.0x. Based on sell-side analysts EBITDA estimates in the next four quarters, as provided by Thomson Reuters, HAL’s forward EV/EBITDA multiple is 8.0x. Between FY2012 and FY2018, HAL’s average EV/EBITDA multiple was ~10.6x. So, HAL is currently trading at a discount to its past seven-year average.Halliburton’s forward EV-to-EBITDA multiple expansion versus its adjusted trailing twelve months EV/EBITDA is in contrast to the industry peers’ average multiple compression, as noted in the table above. This is because analysts expect HAL’s EBITDA to decline marginally versus a rise in its peers’ average EBITDA in the next four quarters. This would typically reflect in a lower current EV/EBITDA multiple compared to the peers’ average. HAL’s TTM EV/EBITDA multiple is marginally lower than its peers’ (SLB, BHGE, and FTI) average of 9.2x.According to data provided by Seeking Alpha, 30 sell-side analysts rated HAL a “buy” in January 2019 (includes strong buys), while five recommended a “hold”. None recommended a “sell” on HAL. The analysts’ consensus target price for HAL is $40.8, which at HAL’s current price yields ~30% returns.While the energy production boom in the U.S. unconventional shales worked in favor of the OFS companies like Halliburton, excess supply and a global economic deceleration may put pressure on energy prices in 2019. While the energy market in North America is faced with a variety of issues including completion activity slowdown and midstream infrastructure bottleneck, many of HAL’s international operations will come to the rescue, or at the least, can mitigate the effects. Towards this goal, HAL has been able to improve its share of revenues from international markets to 44% in Q4 compared to 39% in Q3.However, in Q1 2019, HAL cannot escape the negative forces and is likely to decline compared to Q4 2018, as both North America and international operations could hit a brake. After that, HAL is expected to see a steeper growth trajectory based on its strong project pipeline, product innovations, and robust growth in the Asia Pacific and Africa markets. Halliburton’s cash flow is also steady, but its balance sheet is more leveraged compared to some of the large market cap peers. I expect Halliburton’s stock price to remain weak in the short-run before it makes a comeback by the second half of the year."
4257503,40351,2019-04-28T13:13:23-04:00,"Halliburton expects pricing levels to increase in the short-term, which is understandable due to two reasons.However, the market is also facing some headwinds, including the fact that some shale drillers in the US have reduced drilling activity and dialed back their production growth plans.International markets are recovering and the US could witness a surge in activity at the Permian Basin from late-2019 as new pipelines are deployed and the majors ramp up drilling.","Halliburton (HAL) struggled in North America in the first quarter of 2019, but it is expecting a turnaround in the coming quarters. Although the company's forecast is understandable, I believe investors should remain cautious since the weakness seen in the first quarter could linger on for a while. The good thing, however, is that the international markets are recovering, and the US could witness a surge in exploration work at the Permian Basin from late-2019 which can fuel Halliburton's recovery.Image courtesy of HalliburtonHalliburton recently released its quarterly results, in which it generated an adjusted profit of $201 million, or $0.23 per share, from revenues of $5.74 billion. The company's profits dropped by almost 44% from last year as it continued facing pricing pressure while revenues were largely flat on a year-over-year basis. I believe the highlight of the quarter was the contrast between the state of North American and international markets, and this is what underpins Halliburton's future outlook.In the first quarter, the company posted a 7% drop in revenues from North America to $2.75 billion and an 11% increase from international markets to $2.46 billion. The weakness at home is concerning, considering Halliburton is a North America focused company which typically gets a majority of its revenues and earnings from this region.Halliburton, however, is optimistic about the future. ""We believe the worst in the pricing deterioration is now behind us. For the next couple of quarters, I see demand for our services progressing modestly,"" commented Jeff Miller, Halliburton's CEO. I believe some optimism is justified.That's because firstly, the oil price environment has improved substantially this year. The US benchmark WTI crude has climbed 37% in 2019 to $66 a barrel at the time of this writing. I believe the prices could remain high due to growing crude oil demand, supply reduction from the OPEC and its partners, decrease in Iranian oil exports, and weak output from non-OPEC producers (ex. North America) due to years of underinvestment. This should give confidence to US shale drillers and encourage them to increase drilling activity.Secondly, although the total rig count in North America hasn't increased in the last 12 months, the drilling operations have become more intense. For instance, Halliburton's fracking equipment is consuming 30% more sand currently than in 2016. That's leading to equipment attrition. Since oilfield services companies have reduced capital budgets and aren't adding new hydraulic fracturing capacity, the increase in service intensity could create a shortage of equipment. As the demand for oilfield services exceeds supply, the pricing levels should move higher. An improvement in pricing should push Halliburton's earnings and profit margins higher.On paper, it seems like Halliburton's North America business should start to recover in the coming quarters, but I think the reality could turn out to be slightly different and the actual improvement may get delayed. That's because there's been a change in the mindset of US shale drillers. The oil producers in the US have been focusing on rapidly growing volumes and, in doing so, many outspent cash flows. This includes companies such as Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD), which is one of the biggest operators at the Permian Basin, which is the most prolific shale oil play in the US. Last year, Pioneer Natural Resources posted a strong production growth of 17.5%. But this growth came only after the company spent $3.52 billion as cash capital expenditures which exceeded the operating cash flows of $3.1 billion. As a result, Pioneer ended up outspending cash flows by $420 million ($3.1Bn-$3.52Bn).But now, these shale oil producers are facing growing pressure from Wall Street to start generating value for shareholders. A number of shale drillers have dialed back production growth plans and will instead spend cash on various shareholder-friendly initiatives, such as dividends. Pioneer Natural Resources, for instance, has cut its drilling, completion, and facilities capital budget from $3.3 billion spent in 2018 to 2.8 billion-$3.1 billion (midpoint $2.98Bn) for 2019. The company will remove rigs and reduce drilling activity as it focuses on generating strong levels of excess cash flows (free cash flows) in 2019 and aims to return cash to shareholders as dividends and buybacks. Other shale drillers have also taken similar steps which have led to a reduction in the US rig count in 2019. This bodes well for shareholders of oil producers, but not for Halliburton.Image: Author.In addition to this, shale oil producers are also facing productivity challenges, such as the parent-child well problem, which relates to the poor performance of the new ""child"" well drilled close to an existing ""parent"" well and a shortage of sweet spots which has forced some oil producers to move into less productive areas to pump additional volumes. These factors can also negatively impact production growth moving forward.If shale oil producers continue to keep a lid on spending levels and drilling activity, even as oil prices improve, then the demand for oilfield services could decline. In this case, the tightening of fracking equipment supplies which we discussed earlier may not materialize. Consequently, the pricing environment could remain weak.That being said, there are some bright spots. The recovery in the international markets is finally gathering momentum, led by national oil companies that have increased exploration work. Offshore drilling is also improving as explorers increase spending and deploy more rigs, particularly in places such as Brazil where Halliburton has recently secured a major contract. As per Halliburton's estimates, international offshore spending will increase by 14% this year. This uptick in spending and drilling work has already fueled double-digit growth in Halliburton's revenues from outside of North America. Note that the company has managed to increase its market share in key geographies in the last four years, which puts it in a better position to capitalize on the international recovery. Moving forward, I believe Halliburton will continue posting strong growth numbers from international markets which will soften the blow coming from weakness at home.However, I believe there is light at the end of the tunnel for Halliburton's North America business. Exploration work could recover in the Permian Basin as pipeline constraints which have hampered production growth are gradually removed. The Permian oil producers have struggled in the past due to a lack of takeaway capacity which pushed regional prices lower. Some Permian Basin producers who lack firm transportation contracts have been forced to curtail drilling activity. But once pipeline operators such as Plains All American (PAA) and Phillips 66 Partners (PSXP) bring major projects online - such as the 670,000 barrels per day Cactus II line which is slated for the 3Q19 startup - the drilling activity could improve, possibly from late-2019. This should lift Halliburton's price levels and profit margins.Additionally, the oil majors Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) will also significantly ramp up drilling activity at the Permian Basin in the near future. Exxon Mobil has already said that it will deploy an astonishing 55 rigs at the Permian Basin, where it owns 1.6 million acres, as it aims to increase its regional production by five times to a million per day by 2024. Meanwhile, Chevron, which holds seven billion barrels of resources at the Permian Basin, aims to increase output to 900,000 boe per day by 2023. I believe Halliburton, with its dominating position in the US, could be a big beneficiary of this growth.Shares of Halliburton have risen by 13.3% this year, underperforming the VanEck Vectors Oil Services ETF (OIH), which climbed by 27% and the broader energy industry's benchmark fund SPDR Energy Select Sector ETF (XLE), which posted 17% gains in the same period. I believe Halliburton's stock could continue to underperform in the short-term if the recovery in the North American market fails to materialize. The company's shares are priced 14.2-times next year's earnings estimate, as per data from Thomson Reuters. Although this makes it cheaper than Schlumberger (SLB), which is trading 21-times earnings, Halliburton is not exactly a bargain. I don't see any compelling reason to buy the stock at the moment, but it is worth closely following since the company's long-term outlook is still looking good."
4236258,40351,2019-01-29T10:44:21-05:00,"As expected, Q4-2018 turned out to be a tough period for Halliburton as it reported a drop in revenues from North America, lower profits, and shrinking margins.The oil producers will likely exercise caution by trimming their budgets and slashing drilling activity due to the uncertainty related to oil prices.Halliburton will likely experience further weakness in profits and margins, though market conditions may begin to improve from late-2019.Halliburton's operating cash flows will likely fall in 2018 but it could still generate enough cash flows to fully fund its CapEx, thereby reporting free cash flows.","Halliburton (HAL) will have a difficult year due to weakness in North America. The company’s latest quarterly results have shown how the tough market conditions can hurt Halliburton’s bottom line. Its profits will likely head lower in the coming quarters. The business environment, however, will eventually improve, particularly from the fourth quarter of this year due to the expected increase in drilling activity at the Permian Basin. That may have a positive impact on Halliburton’s earnings. But for now, I believe investors should stay on the sidelines.Image: HalliburtonThe fourth quarter of last year was always going to be a difficult period for Halliburton as the North American market softened, particularly in December when the oil rig count dropped by 2 from the previous month to 885 units, as reported by General Electric Co.’s Baker Hughes (BHGE) in its highly followed report. That was the first monthly decline in six months. The demand for completion services dropped in the fourth quarter as oil producers reduced drilling activity following the dip in oil prices to the lowest level in more than a year of under $43 a barrel in December. Halliburton has recently released its quarterly results in which it confirmed the market’s weakness.For the fourth quarter, Halliburton reported flat revenues on a year-over-year basis of $5.94 billion as revenues from both Completion & Production and Drilling & Evaluation segments remained largely at the same levels as last year. Revenues from North America dropped by 1.7% which highlights weakness in this crucial region. International revenues climbed 2.2% to $2.6 billion due to the strength in the Middle East/Asia markets. The company’s operating income dropped 21% to $608 million which shows the pricing environment for oilfield services has worsened and that’s dragging profit margins. The operating margin has dropped from almost 13% in Q4-2017 to 10.2% in Q4-2018. And things aren’t getting any better.The oil price environment continues to look uncertain. Although the commodity has risen by more than 20% since late-December to $52 a barrel at the time of this writing, the price level is still considerably below last year’s average of $65 a barrel. The weakness has been driven in large part by growing supplies, particularly from the US, high levels of OECD crude oil stockpiles, and mounting concerns regarding weakness in demand amid the ongoing US-China trade war.The extended US government shut down can also negatively impact oil demand. A number of analysts, including those from the US Energy Information Administration, believe prices will remain depressed this year. The agency expects an average price of just $54.19 a barrel for 2019. However, I believe there are some factors which can push prices higher, including strong demand from emerging markets (ex. China) and the conclusion of the US sanction waivers on Iran.In an oil price environment whose future looks uncertain and lacks visibility, I believe the oil producers will exercise caution by keeping a lid on exploration and production expenditure. Instead of growing volumes, the oil producers will focus on generating decent returns and delivering free cash flows in a weak oil price environment. Some of the major producers, such as Occidental Petroleum (OXY) and Anadarko Petroleum Corp. (APC), have announced plans to slash capital expenditure. Although most of the oil producers will release their capital plans with their fourth quarter results in the coming weeks, I am expecting flat-to-low levels of capital guidance for 2019 as compared to 2018. This drop in expenditure will create problems for oilfield services companies, particularly Halliburton which dominates the North American market and gets 60% of its revenues from this region.Halliburton, on the other hand, was a bit more optimistic. During the fourth quarter conference call, the company’s CEO Jeff Miller said that most of the large-cap independents have planned their budgets around $50 a barrel. Miller said the oil majors won’t significantly change their plans and will continue to spend heavily to develop their shale oil and gas assets. However, Miller did warn that the small exploration and production companies who have limited access to capital can aggressively cut capital spending if prices stay weak.Additionally, the CEO said the pricing pressure will persist throughout the first quarter. The company has forecast smaller margins for both Completion & Production and Drilling & Evaluation segments for Q1-2019 as compared to Q4-2018. The C&P margins, which is Halliburton’ biggest segment, could drop by 4 percentage points in the first three months of this year as compared to Q4-2018.In other words, Halliburton will continue reporting weak profits and margins, at least in the first quarter of 2019. The business environment, however, can improve meaningfully once oil prices recover which will encourage oil producers to increase capital expenditure and drilling activity.Additionally, I expect market conditions to improve from the final quarter of 2019 once new crude oil pipelines are deployed at the Permian Basin in West Texas and New Mexico. The Permian is the most prolific shale oil-producing region in the US but it has been struggling with weak regional prices due to a lack of takeaway capacity. Some Permian Basin producers who lack firm transportation contracts have been forced to curtail drilling activity. But once pipeline operators such as Plains All American (PAA) and Phillips 66 Partners (PSXP) finish working on major projects like the 670,000 barrels per day Cactus II line, the drilling activity will improve, likely from Q4-2019. This should lift Halliburton’s price levels and profit margins.The good thing is that Halliburton understands how tough the market will be in 2019 and its cash flow from operations will likely fall. As a result, the company has planned to reduce its capital expenditure by 20% to $1.6 billion which will help Halliburton in preserving its cash flows. Note that Halliburton generated $3.15 billion of cash flow from operating activities. This means that even if Halliburton sees a 49% drop in operating cash flows to slightly above $1.6 billion, it will still be able to self-fund its CapEx from internally generated cash flows. However, I am not expecting such a large drop in operating cash flows and believe the company will likely continue reporting free cash flows (albeit lower than what we've seen in 2018).For now, however, Halliburton will remain under pressure. Moving forward, the company will likely post lower levels of profits, margins, and cash flows on a year-over-year basis. This will likely have a negative impact on Halliburton stock. I believe investors should stay on the sidelines for now but keep this stock on your watch list since Halliburton will be one of the biggest beneficiaries of the eventual US recovery."
4234164,20715,2019-01-17T21:01:56-05:00,Halliburton is set to release fourth-quarter earnings results on Tuesday morning.Analysts are overwhelmingly bullish on the stock and the short interest ratio is low.The stock has been moving lower within the confines of a trend channel since last May.,"Halliburton (HAL) is scheduled to release fourth-quarter earnings results on Tuesday morning and the sentiment toward the oil services firm is rather optimistic ahead of the report. The stock is a favorite of analysts and it has been that way for as long as I can remember - but I don’t get it.There are 38 analysts following Halliburton and 34 of them have the stock rated as a “buy.” There are also three “hold” ratings and one “sell” rating. With that kind of love from analysts, you would think the stock and the company had been doing extremely well over the last few years, but that is far from the case.The stock hit an all-time high of $68.93 in July of 2014 and it hasn’t gotten anywhere close to that level again. After that high the stock fell to $26.26 in January 2016. From there it rallied up to $56.81, fell again and then rallied up to $56.83. This could be viewed as a double-top pattern and it would have been confirmed when the stock fell below the low between the two highs. That low was in the $37.25 area and the stock dropped below that level last September.Halliburton fell all the way to $24.70 in December and has since bounced back slightly. The recent bounce has moved the stock out of overbought territory, based on the weekly stochastic readings and the 10-week RSI.Turning our attention to the daily chart, we see that the stock has been trending lower since last May with the upper rail being formed by the highs in May and October. The lower parallel rail is defined by the lows in July and September. The low in December actually dipped slightly below the lower rail.The daily overbought/oversold indicators moved sharply higher after the December low and recently moved into overbought territory. The stock has stalled at its 50-day moving average and hasn’t been able to reach the upper rail of the channel.Looking at the downward trend Halliburton has been in for the last year and how far it is from its 52-week high and all-time high, how can 34 out of 38 analysts rate the stock as a buy?Given the bullish analysts’ ratings and how the stock has been moving lower, you might think Halliburton’s fundamentals were out of this world, but that is not the case at all. The company’s earnings and sales have been flat over the last three years. Earnings did jump 19% in the third quarter and sales were up 13%.Analysts expect the company to show earnings growth of 52.5% for the year as whole and sales growth of 15.9%.Even the management efficiency and profitability measurements aren’t all that great. The return on equity is currently at 12% and the return on assets is only 6.98%. The profit margin is 6.9% and the operating margin is 12%. There is an abundance of companies with a better profit margin and ROE - companies whose stocks have performed much better than Halliburton and without all the bullish ratings.Analysts expect the company to report earnings of $0.37 per share and that consensus estimate declined from $0.38 in recent days. The company reported earnings of $0.53 in the fourth quarter of 2017, meaning the expectations are for a decline of 28.3% on year-over-year basis.The company has beaten earnings estimates in seven out of the last eight quarters, but that hasn’t mattered much as the stock has trended lower in most instances. The company doubled the EPS estimate in January 2017 and the stock moved up to $58.78 a few days later. However, after the initial little bump in price, the stock fell to the $47 area before the next earnings report.Last January the company beat estimates by 14.3% and the stock moved up slightly to a high of $57.86. The stock fell below $45 by mid-March. Of course the overall market was moving lower in the first quarter of 2018, but that wasn’t the case in the first quarter of 2017.I have already mentioned one sentiment indicator that shows extreme optimism - the analysts’ ratings with 34 out of 38 rating the stock as a buy. The other sentiment indicators are mixed, at least to a degree.The short interest ratio is low at 1.39 and that is after the number of shares sold short increased from 17.2 million to 19.4 million.The put/call ratio is currently at 1.0 and under normal circumstances I would consider that a high reading. In the case of Halliburton, the put/call ratio has been above 1.0 for the better part of the last year. When the company reported earnings back in October, the put/call ratio was at 1.18.Given the whole picture for Halliburton - the fundamentals, the technicals, and the sentiment toward the stock, I don’t see any reason to own Halliburton for the long term. There might be a gap after earnings, but it could be in either direction based on the most recent earnings reports.The long-term trend is to the downside and the fundamentals are below average. The sentiment is skewed to the bullish side and leaves little reason to believe a rally is imminent.Personally, I will steer clear of Halliburton until the trend changes and the fundamentals improve. It could be a while before that happens."
4232166,90425,2019-01-08T15:36:12-05:00,"The stock is now down more than 50% from its high and is heading towards prices not seen in a decade.Contrarian investing should work well with this premier firm.Third quarter earnings are down from second quarter earnings.The market fears lower capital budgets leading to lower drilling and weaker service pricing.The oil market does not appear to be far out of balance, so this period of weakness should quickly reverse.","Sometimes, Mr. Market gets so convinced that the future is bleak that the really great names in industry go on sale. Halliburton (HAL) is one of those key oil and gas industry names that are now in the bargain bin.Source: Seeking Alpha Website December 24, 2018The stock of this industry leading company is now heading towards prices not seen since the end of the last decade. ""Buy straw hats in January"" applies here. When the market is ""sure"" that the future looks grim enough to send the stock of a company of this stature to new lows, that is one the investor needs to step up to the plate and buy.Contrarian investing is never easy. That is especially true in this day and age when many authority figures are broadcasting to ""run for the exits"". You do not necessarily have to buy this minute. The current market atmosphere is unlikely to abate quite that quickly. But it is time to read the annual report and all the filings as well as plan an appropriate investment strategy.My late uncle who recently passed away was an Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) executive who used to tell me to buy Halliburton when the stock price is $8. I sincerely hope it does not come to that this time around. But, over the years, he got away with that strategy far more times than I thought anyone had a right to. It was patience in the extreme that came off successfully. Of course, he had a list of other once-in-a-lifetime buys and would just wait for them. That patient strategy enabled him to pass along a decent estate to his only son and two granddaughters. This time, I think and hope the stock stops long before we get to $8.There is a couple of reasons to begin a dollar cost averaging investment soon. First, the oil and gas market is really not all that much out of balance. So, any oil price downturn should end relatively quickly. Despite all the headlines, the market does not yet appear to be swimming in oil.Second, the market usually fears a downturn far more than it happens. Louis Rukeyser of ""Wall Street Week"" fame used to state that the market ""correctly predicted 11 of the last 7 recessions"". The currently strong economy appears to belie a recession on the way. That could always change of course. But right now, there appears to be no slowdown in sight.That leads to the obvious conclusion that as long as the economy is doing ok, then oil and gas demand should continue to grow. If the supply of oil gets a little ahead of demand, then short-term price weakness should fix that problem effortlessly.Halliburton reported $.50 per share earnings in the third quarter. Mr. Market is probably overly worried that the earnings were down from $.58 per share in the second quarter. Then, there is the headlines proclaiming lower capital budgets across the industry leading to less drilling and weaker supplier pricing. These weak periods have happened before and will undoubtedly happen again in the future.The worst time was probably a few years back when oil prices literally crashed and the beginning of 2016 looked absolutely horrible for the industry. Even then, it was not long before prices firmed and began to rally. That has led to some of the strongest oil pricing earlier this year. These last three years have not been the greatest for the service industry. But that is no reason to lose faith in the future. This company has survived many industry shakeouts. So, one more really does not matter that much.This company is well-entrenched in the industry. Along with Schlumberger (SLB), Halliburton is ""go-to company"" and in many ways like a Walmart (WMT) superstore for the oil and gas industry. During times of industry uncertainty, the flight to quality in the industry will benefit companies like Halliburton and Schlumberger. Less well-established and smaller names will suffer far more. Companies want a service company that will not ""go under"" during the downturn. It is very hard for a buyer to go wrong with the top two names in the service industry.Earnings were hurt both in 2017 and 2018 by the writedown and then writeoff of Venezuela assets. Otherwise, earnings for the fiscal year would have been better by $265 million pretax. It is too soon to yet tell just what the future holds. But an earnings of nearly $2 per share before the writeoff of Venezuela assets appears to be a reasonable rough approximation. Therefore, the stock is now approaching about 13 times those projected earnings.Oil prices should definitely rally by the second half of 2019. Most likely, they will rally long before then. Even so, by that time, Mr. Market will have a far more sanguine view of this company's future.The company reported about $6 billion in working capital at the end of the third quarter. The $10 billion of debt slightly exceeds shareholders' equity. Cash flow from operating activities topped $2.3 billion at the nine-month period. That appears to indicate an annual cash flow in excess of $3 billion.While at first glance the cash flow appears to be a little low compared to the debt, the $5.5 billion of accounts receivable provides quite a cushion during a downturn. Most likely, working capital needs would decrease during a downturn. That accounts receivable balance and the $2 billion cash balance provide a ready source of liquidity to rapidly pay off debt during an industry downturn. The pressure would be on management to sufficiently manage the downturn to realize that cash. However, this management has been through more than one industry cycle. The odds heavily favor an appropriate strategy of layoffs and cost-cutting during an industry downcycle.Halliburton needs no introduction to the industry. This premier player is a ""go-to"" company during a downturn. The finances appear to be adequate with plenty of liquidity before considering bank lines of credit. Oftentimes, this company acquires competitors during downturns as part of a cheap expansion policy. So, it would not be unreasonable for a few acquisitions to be made during the next industry downturn. This company is typically a beneficiary of industry consolidations. It is usually not a victim. This next downturn will not be any different.What is different this time is the lack of faith Mr. Market has in the future of the company. That has led to some very low stock prices lately. The stock is now getting into low territory not seen in several years. Investors can expect this management to continue growing the company through good and bad industry times. The management acumen of this company is well documented.By all means, investors should do their due diligence and consider this investment. Oftentimes, premier companies such as this one provide as good a return during industry recoveries as the far more speculative plays in the industry. The risk of investing in a company like Halliburton is much lower for that great recovery investment return.Disclaimer: I am not an investment advisor, and this article is not meant to be a recommendation of the purchase or sale of stock.

The company has a substantial presence in well completions and fracking in the US shale, which makes Halliburton very fine-tuned to any variations in this particular region.The company has noticed declining demand for its oilfield services as U.S. oil and gas producers are scaling down on spending due to the oil prices plunge experienced in the fourth quarter of 2018. Also, acute transportation bottlenecks in the Permian Basin of west Texas and New Mexico aggravated the downturn.As explained in my preceding article, the situation is clear and doesn't need sophisticated developments. Because Halliburton is an oilfield services company which means that as long as oil prices stay volatile and weak, the company will struggle with lower revenues and the stock will probably languish. Unfortunately, oil volatility is an unavoidable component of the oil sector and investors will have to deal with successive bearish and bullish cycles.The oil outlook looks a little bit better for 2019, but I do not buy the actual excitement, the economy is showing signs of fatigue and oil demand will go down. It is more likely that oil will weaken again later this year, despite OPEC+ efforts to support the bottom line.Jeff Miller, the CEO, said in the fourth quarter conference call:Halliburton and Schlumberger have a pretty similar business model. I have previously warned that slowing growth in the largest U.S. shale basin would impact their results, especially during 2019 and until the end of 2019 with the possible resolution of pipeline bottlenecks in the Permian Basin and better oil price potential which remains to be seen.Halliburton's business model relies on two distinct segments:Schlumberger's business model is quite similar as we can see below:The North America region represents 56.3% of the total revenues of Halliburton in Q4'18. Halliburton is present in every unconventional Basin in the U.S. (e.g., DJ Basin, Eagle Ford, Bakken, etc.)Comparatively, the North America region represents 34.5% of the total revenues of Schlumberger (including Cameron US).When we compare revenues per region, it is evident that Halliburton has a stronger presence than Schlumberger in the USA.Conversely, while demand for North American completions services has weakened, the companies' international businesses are showing encouraging signs of recovery.However, both companies have suffered a double-digit retracement of about 45% in one year period.SLB data by YChartsSource: HAL filings and Morningstar.1 - RevenuesHalliburton reported earnings per share of $0.76 for Q4'18 on $5.936 billion in revenues compared to $5.936 billion the same quarter last year. Earnings were boosted by a one-time tax benefit of $306 million due to a change in its corporate structure.However, revenues for the 4Q'18 were down 3.8% sequentially. The results beat Wall Street's estimate, and it was a surprise because of strong company association with the US shale and judging by the way management was addressing investors at the end of the third quarter.Net income reported for the fourth quarter of 2018 came in at $664 million, well above the minus $824 million for the same period last year.In the conference call:Highlights per region1 - In North America, revenue decreased by 11% (Q4 revenues $3.341 billion): Lower activity and pricing in stimulation services were to blame, whereas higher fluids activity in the Gulf of Mexico helped to mitigate the loss of revenue.2 - In Latin America segment, revenue increased by 16% (Q4 revenues $0.607 billion): The year-end software and completion tool sales and higher stimulation activity across the entire region was a good contributor. Furthermore, improved movement across multiple product service lines in Mexico are also contributing to this significant jump.3 - In Europe/Africa/CIS, revenues were flat (Q4 revenues $0.746 billion): Seasonal declines in pipeline services across the region did not help, and the company noticed a decreased activity across multiple product service lines in the North Sea sector. The completion tool sales in Ghana and Nigeria at year-end were helpful.4 - The Middle East/Asia revenue increased 8% (Q4 revenues $1.242 billion): The year-end completion tool sales in the Middle East and higher project management activity throughout the region contributed to this increase.2 - Free Cash FlowFree cash flow is an excellent indicator of financial strength. The free cash flow is used to cover for the dividend and also pay for shares buyback. Without a sufficient FCF, the company will have to divest non-core assets or add more debt, which is not good for the long-term stability of the company. Thus, monitoring this indicator on a quarterly basis is paramount.Free cash flow on a yearly basis was $1,131 million (estimated by Fun Trading), and the company is spending $632 million annually to pay for dividend and also $400 million for the shares buyback program in 2018.Jeff Miller indicated in the Q4 conference call:HAL is passing the FCF test.3 - Net DebtNet debt is $8.77 billion with a net debt to EBITDA of ~2X, which is excellent and similar to Schlumberger. For comparison purpose, Schlumberger has $13.27 billion in debt.Net interest expense for the fourth quarter of 2018 was $137 million, and the company expects the same amount for the first quarter of 2019.I believe we have entered a consolidation and accumulation phase, and I recommend adding HAL for the long term on any significant weaknesses (see technical analysis below) which are likely to occur in this challenging year.However, what I have said about Schlumberger earlier is also true for Halliburton. The most valuable takeaway is that the company continues to be a substantial long-term investment offering financial security, low debt profile, and a secured sizable dividend of $0.72 per shares or a yield of 2.3%. While the dividend is great, it is still nearly 50% lower than the 4.5% paid by Schlumberger.Halliburton is an oil services company particularly focused in the US shale, and consequently, the company will suffer the most on any oil price weakness in this region.Halliburton business presents a high probability for some revenue struggle in 2019, and while it is a long-term investment, perhaps the best in this category, investors must be aware of the extra risks attached to ""oil services company"" like Halliburton. In the conference call, Lance Loeffler said:The cut in CapEx by 20% from $2 billion in 2018 to $1.6 billion in 2019 is a clear sign that the company is expecting a slowdown of activity in the US shale this year, and we have to adapt by applying the right investing strategy.A good solution is to trade regularly about 30%+ of your position short term taking profit of the volatility using technical analysis and the RSI.Technical AnalysisHAL is showing a long-term descending channel pattern with a line resistance at $32.80 (I recommend selling about 25% of your position at this level) and line support at about $25 (double bottom, I recommend buying and accumulating at this level.)Descending channel patterns are considered short-term bearish which is another sign pushing me to recommend selling on bullish outburst."

Management has been open and honest about oil prices ever since it diverged to the downside in the second half of 2014. In Q2 2017, management intimated shale oil plays could tap the brakes on additional E&P. However, the rig count did not stall as expected and oil companies continued to expand supply. Heading into Q3 2018 earnings, Halliburton suggested budget exhaustion could cause some clients to slow down work in the Permian or other basins.The company's Q3 2018 revenue of $6.2 billion was flat sequentially. Revenue from North America fell 2%, which was to be expected given management's reservations about the region. Halliburton also implied operators' budgets could be replenished next year and activity and pricing could rebound. Schlumberger's recent concerns over North America could throw cold water on that thesis.Secondly, Halliburton receives about 61% of its total revenue from North America versus 38% for Schlumberger and over 60% for Baker Hughes (BHGE). If Schlumberger catches cold in the region, then Halliburton could catch pneumonia. In the past, North America land drilling was white-hot, and it played into Halliburton's strengths. What was formerly Halliburton's strength - outsized market share in North America - could become a weakness.The situation could worsen. Brent oil prices are now below $55 per barrel. This is a sea change from when prices exceeded $80 earlier this year. Now Russia is blaming the recent Fed rate hike for the slump in oil prices:Fed Chairman Jerome Powell intimated there were more rate hikes ahead in 2019. I believe Powell wants to burst the bubble economy built up by trillions in stimulus provided over the past decade. The criticism from Rosneft indicates just how dependent oil prices are on Fed intervention or OPEC intervention. At some point oil prices will have to be driven by demand. Weak industrial activity could connote less demand from the industrial sector going forward. That cannot be good for oil services firms or Halliburton.Halliburton's international revenue grew 5% Q/Q last quarter. There is no guarantee international can make up for a potential double-digit decline in North America. I believe a price war in the region could ensue. Halliburton, Schlumberger and Baker Hughes have big balance sheets and enough liquidity to sustain a price war. Halliburton has $2.1 billion in cash and its $10.5 billion debt load is only at 2.3x trailing EBITDA. The company's 18% EBITDA margins could take a hit without impairing its credit rating too badly. Management has also proven its ability to manage costs in a downturn. However, I still remain bearish.If Schlumberger catches cold in North America, then Halliburton could catch pneumonia. HAL is off over 40% Y/Y and will likely fall further. Sell HAL."

We've dusted off the portfolio and found reasons to love the same stocks we only liked a few weeks ago. We're in it to win it.We proudly present our Top Ten list for your consideration. Junk in the hole? Or Gushers in waiting?","It's tough being an oil bull right now. You can be right, but still be wounded by the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune. What a difference a few weeks makes.When we go into a restaurant and expect to be shown to our favorite table by the window, the Maitre D. looks sheepish and instead guides us to one near the kitchen door. A glance over at 'our' table as we pass, secures an image of an oil bear, charmingly companion-ed and amply wined, and throwing a slight, superior 'I told you so' sort of sneer in our direction. He is living the life we had just a short time ago.To add injury to insult, the Maitre D., then asks if he can take an imprint of our credit card, ""Before you order Monsieur, Ve haf had...ze dine and dash problem, I am sure you vill understand."" He stands there until we hand over the card.Two things become clear, as we sit ignored and surrounded by the clatter of the kitchen. One, oil bulls are not getting invites to the 'cool-kids' parties anymore. And, two... that is our leased GMC Denali pickup truck hooked up to a repo truck, and gaining speed out of the parking lot.It's tough being an oil bull right now.I hope you will forgive the little vignette that precedes the serious part of this article (assuming it makes it past editing). I am a frustrated writer of fiction and have written the 'great American' novel a number of times. While we've indulged in a bit of exaggeration for effect, the truth isn't far off the mark. It's been tough staying long oil.However, we think oil has put in a bottom recently. It has stabilized in the mid-$50s, and with just a hint that, OPEC might take significant production of the table, rebounded several dollars a barrel. That's positive.We put out a thesis for oil recently in the October edition of the Daily Drilling Report's Almanac and Gazette. If you missed it, here's a link. So far, it's being proved up to be fairly accurate as measured by events as they've unfolded. The key of course will that production come off the table? We won't know until the announcement in a couple of weeks, but we think now is the time to buy more of some of our favorites. Many at 20-25% discounts to September prices.Buy low, and sell high still works. Here are some ideas previously discussed in The Daily Drilling Report.Pick #1, China National Offshore Operating Company (NYSE:CEO)I wrote a long article about CNOOC back in January. It doesn't get a lot of coverage here, or anywhere else. If you haven't read it, you can be forgiven as it was before I started the DDR. Give it a read. They are into everything. You want China offshore, they are the biggest operator in Chinese waters, as their name might imply. You want exposure to Brazil, they are partners in a number of blocks with Total (NYSE:TOT) and Petrobras (NYSE:PBR). You want GoM? They are there as well, partnering in some of the biggest projects many of our favorites have going. Read the article if your portfolio has room for a stock in this price range.SourceCNOOC doesn't report until January, but I expect a strong improvement in EBITDA based on crude prices for most of this half year so far. They had cracked $200/share before the current rout. When the market turns back the other way, CNOOC has the potential to rise sharply. I can't afford this one in my portfolio, perhaps you can.You will note that CNOOC can be pretty volatile, ranging from $132 to $202 this year. That said, I might watch it a bit for a better entry point, somewhere sub $150/share. That may not happen this close to the OPEC meeting, the outcome of which we expect to be positive for oil.Pick #2, Royal Dutch Shell, (RDS.A, RDS.B)I have written a lot about this company. At least four or five articles. The ones I'll link here are two of the longer ones where we discuss the company, soup to nuts. Shell-Part 1, and Shell-Part 2. Give these a read for background detail. One of the things that gives us comfort currently is the best in class dividend (comfortably covered w free cash) Shell pays. Scuttlebutt includes a modest raise soon to match the one BP (NYSE:BP) put out for this quarter. The current market slide could impact that likelihood somewhat.One of the things I really like about Shell is their gas business, much of which was acquired in the BG transaction. LNG is going to rock and roll over the next decade, and Shell is perfectly positioned to reap the rewards.Source: Seeking AlphaShell is a top performer, has a ton of drillable prospects in its portfolio and is generating cash like a beer stand in the Sahara. If it cracks $60, I am on it like a duck on a June bug.Pick #3, BPBP has rebuilt itself over the past few years. The Macondo story is largely in the rear view (some $65 billion paid out so far). A streamlined portfolio that is much higher quality and nicely split between conventional, deep water, and shale. Remember that $10 billion they spent a quarter ago on BHP's (NYSE:BHP) U.S. assets? Here is the most recent long article on BP.BP pays a nice dividend, just raised as mentioned above.Source: Seeking AlphaPrices sub $40 are a gift and should be strongly bought.Pick #4, Apache (APA)The energy market is getting killed right now, right? Of course, it is... except for one thing. Natty. Natural gas has gone through the roof recently, and it's not just the onset of winter (although winter is coming - you didn't really think I'd miss an opportunity like that, did you?).SourceAmerica is the Saudi Arabia of natural gas. As I have discussed recently, the shale bounty. And, Apache has a lot of gas through its Alpine High franchise. Here is the most recent article on them.SourceApache is being dragged down by the general selloff in oil. It makes no sense. I am a buyer at current levels.Pick #5, Exxon Mobil (XOM)A great American company with a global reach. I've recently argued that XOM is a buy under $80 and maintain that position now. XOM has tried valiantly to go up since I published this article in October. One of the things I discussed was the possibility of XOM drilling on Wall Street. They are doing some drilling financially today, but with a privately held company. I will take a bow for guessing right on this one, even if I had the address wrong. They haven't got it yet, but they've certainly tipped their hand as to being in an acquisitive mood. Here's a link to my long articles on XOM. XOM-1, and XOM-2SourceI would probably monitor them a bit if I was going long (I'm not, there's no room in my portfolio). But if I were, the mid-$70s is where I would step in.Pick #6, Golar (GLNG)Golar is an LNG shipping story. It should not be a difficult sell. But it is currently. Golar has moved down after earnings, in sympathy with crude oil, with which it has nothing in common!!! Golar should be leveraged to Natty for heaven's sake.SourceTo recap the thesis for Golar.This should all equate to tanker rates going up. And, they are. Here's a quote from Golar's CFO off the CC.All of this should add up to an improved stock price for Golar. I called out 30% in the article. I was probably conservative there. I am buying more GLNG today.Pick #7, Energy Transfer (ET)The subject of a bullish article just this week from Callum Turcan is emphasizing an aspect of ET that doesn't get covered a lot. Give it a read if this one interests you. ET is in the midstream crude/gas transportation business. It's treading water to up slightly today, no mean feat given the current sentiment regarding anything oil.SourceSourceYou've all heard about the Permian takeaway concerns. Now, the Bakken seems to be having trouble finding takeaway capacity. This is music to ET's ears. It means they and other midstream providers are running at capacity. In fact, ET has just announced an expansion of the Dakota access pipeline to carry another 100K BOPD to market. Cha-ching!This is a fee-based business moving petroleum products from one place to another. And, you all know about fees... in a tight market, they go up. ET should prosper in 2019 and pays a dividend of almost 8% at current prices. I plan to add more ET.Pick #8, Matador Resources (MTDR)Matador is down 20% from where I recommended it in September (how long ago that seems now). Currently at a one-year low. If you read my article, I thought they had great potential to increase earnings through increased production. Some of that enthusiasm has to be tempered by the selloff in crude. If you accept my thesis that there is a rebound coming, perhaps as soon as the Dec. 6th OPEC meeting, then you will view this decline as a gift in a strong company that will grow revenues through increased production.SourcePick #9, Schlumberger (SLB)This category leading, diversified energy services provider is now trading below where it did when oil was $26/bbl. In no universe does this make any sense, and patient investors should be adding Big Blue to their portfolio.SourceI am buying SLB today.Pick #10, Halliburton (HAL)The same logic that applies for SLB applies for HAL. It is nearly back to early 2016 levels. I am buying Big Red today.SourceBonus Round, Core Labs (CLB)Core was crushed after earnings with a somewhat dour forecast for the 4th qtr. In fairness, it actually read like every other service provider's forecast for the same period. Good numbers, thanks to rising oil prices, but cautious about the future.Core is reinventing itself and finding relevance in new markets. Specifically, shale operators are starting to spend money on reservoir description services that traditionally have only gone toward big mega projects.Further, operators are finding value in coupling Core's moated reservoir description services - they are the gold standard in this niche, with the advanced perforating technology they deploy through their Hero Perfrac technology.SourceWe think CLB is seriously mispriced to the downside currently, and soon, Mr. Market will realize this mistake, taking the price back to its usual range. It is happening already, as can be seen in this capture. Our bet is it continues to move up.The energy-oriented market has been in a politically-driven rout in recent times. To be interested in the energy space, you have to believe the bull thesis will revive. I've put one out that seems reasonable to me. Some of it seems to be being realized even before the ink has dried - figuratively speaking. There are others out there as well. You should read them all before investing.If the bull thesis for doesn't revive, then these investments could decline, or at best be dead money... for years.We won't have long to wait. The market breathlessly awaits the outcome of the party in Vienna, Dec. 6th.Now, excuse me. I am canvassing the repo lot looking for my truck.Disclaimer: I am not an accountant or CPA or CFA.

4229915,102107,2018-12-26T06:30:00-05:00,"Energy trading this year felt a little like groundhog day as hope vanished in the second half of the year. Where does that leave us for 2019?Our Marketplace Roundtable panel sees differences between now and 2014, but there are questions over whether that means it's time to play offense or defense.We discuss the less obvious stories of 2018, as well as key things to watch for in the energy sector in 2019 and top ideas for the year ahead.","2018 seems to be ending on the wrong note in the markets. December is setting the wrong kind of records, and Q4 has been a bumpy one in general. This is what happens in the stock market sometimes, but it's been easy to forget over the decade-long bull market.We're using the end of the year as a chance to lift our heads, survey the market, and see what might be coming ahead. To do so, we're inviting our Marketplace authors to do a series of roundtables. 2018 was another steady growth year for the platform, and we have a lot of great voices on the Marketplace, so we wanted to share their perspective with you.Our Year End Marketplace Roundtable series will run through the first full market week in January. We'll feature ten different roundtable discussions, with expert panels chiming in on Tech, Energy, Dividends, Other Income strategies, Gold, Value Investing, Small-Caps, Alternative investing strategies, Biotech, and the Macro outlook.This roundtable looks at energy, which has especially struggled in the back half of this year. Does the recent bear market in oil mean we're back to lower for longer, or is this a different era? Is Natural Gas back? We break it down with our energy-focused panel:Kirk Spano: OPEC+ increased their production by nearly 2mbd heading into the Iran sanctions. Saudi Arabia was about a million barrels per day of that with over half going to the U.S. They did that at the request of President Trump, who then double-crossed Saudi Arabia by granting waivers to 8 nations from the Iran oil sanctions amounting to about a million barrels per day more than expected. In a thin market, traders were able to pound down oil, causing margin calls forcing hedge funds and others to sell and taking oil and oil stocks down further than warranted.We are now in a snapback position with OPEC+ announcing cuts of 1.2mbd, Saudi Arabia stating they will dramatically cut exports to the U.S. and Canada piling on with their own export cuts to the U.S. The combined export cuts from Saudi Arabia and Canada will lead to reductions of U.S. oil inventory of 20-25 million barrels per month beginning in January. For context, American oil inventory stands at about 450 million barrels which is over half of global OECD inventory. I am buying the U.S. Oil Fund (USO), the SPDR S&P Oil & Gas E&P ETF (XOP) and calls on several oil stocks, mainly those that are Permian focused.Fluidsdoc: The framework for the bull thesis on oil had been weakening over the summer, with inventory builds thanks to relentless shale production, and the Saudis increasing exports to the U.S. The strong dollar and fears of global growth slowing had also contributed to a 'sell the rally' mentality in traders. The market had priced in Iran's production leaving the market in what we were told would be a strict, 'no exceptions' ban. The reality of waivers for about 75-80% of their daily production, knocked the last support of an over-supplied market, and prices plummeted. The impact on key producers and particularly service companies has been so severe that buying on the way down, has become a case of 'catch the falling knife'. I have been making incremental buys focusing on quality recently. An example would be Schlumberger (SLB), currently at lows not seen in over 25 years.Daniel Jones:  This current downturn is really being caused by two things: fears of a slowdown caused by trade wars and by an overreaction of an overreaction by OPEC and non-OPEC nations regarding sanctions on Iran. The latter is being addressed now through a joint cut, but the former is tough to measure. This is especially true because in the countries most affected by the trade war (think China), demand is more elastic than it is in developed nations and information from those nations is also harder to come by. I believe the trade war concerns will be largely resolved, and I believe that OPEC and Russia are on the right path toward resolving the other problem, so I am all long right now.Laura Starks: I think we know far less about China, and its demand situation, than we should. I think demand has dropped there more than anyone is admitting. I haven't changed the way I position - I look for companies with operations sturdy enough to weather the ups and downs, both of which have their challenges.Long Player: I think if you review my answer to the last questionnaire that I stated the rally would end sooner than most think. Your latest question proves that answer correct. Oil production grew more than many thought possible while OPEC and other exporters also increased to more than offset demand. In the meantime, fears have set in for another recession. However, things are not way out of balance as they were in the 1980s when Saudi Arabia re-entered the market and pushed the price of oil down to $10 a barrel for a while. Anyone who invests in oil and gas should know that the commodities are volatile and the latest round proves that. Now some decent bluechips like SLB are entering bargain territory and can be picked up as a core position or to trade. Now is the time to buy good industry leaders for your portfolio.Andrew Hecht: I am in wait and see mode. Increased U.S. production, growing inventories, exemptions from sanctions for some purchasers of Iranian crude, and Saudi capitulation to President Trump's request for increased output in the aftermath of the murder of the Washington Post journalist and Saudi national created a perfect bearish cocktail for the price of crude oil.Robert Boslego: The market became over-inflated in expectation that the U.S. sanctions on Iran would remove more oil from the market than could be added by Saudi Arabia and friends. But Trump had a few policy tools to prevent that from happening, and he used waivers to reduce the impact of the sanctions. He could have also announced a drawdown of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, but he did not need to do that.I was clear that Trump would not cause oil prices to spike going into the mid-term elections, and it was clear that he wanted lower prices to keep the economy humming. So, I was short oil and increased short positions right before the sanctions went into effect. I again re-shorted when it became clear to me that the global market was going to be in a glut as a result of the OPEC meeting.Laurentian Research:  The new episode of oil crash is a classic case of unintended consequences resultant from interference with the operation of the oil market by politicians. On the one hand, the Trump administration coerced the OPEC+ bloc toward a production increase ahead of the Iran sanction, taking advantage of the weakness of the Saudi regime in the wake of the murder of Jamal Khashoggi. Such a production ramp-up in haste led to oil oversupply. Further exacerbating the oversupply, the Trump administration turned around giving the Saudis and the world a big surprise by granting waivers to main importers of Iranian crude oil. On the other hand, the U.S.-China trade war dimmed global economic growth prospect, causing widespread jitters about the outlook of oil demand. Putting salt on a wound, the damaged crude oil supply-demand was magnified by commodity traders, humans or algos, into extreme gyrations of oil prices. At The Natural Resources Hub (TNRH), our policy has been to pick stocks based on (1) the quality and growth prospect of assets and (2) the management's operational skill and interest alignment with that of the shareholders, and (3) to take advantage of deep-value opportunities presented to us by the market. So, we first switched to risk-off and then to quality-on during the course of the oil crash.Kirk Spano: There is no echo at all of 2014. That is a fake narrative. Oil supply and demand remain tight due to very little spare capacity in the global system for production. Consider that Saudi Arabia got tricked into using half of its 2mbd spare capacity to inadvertently drive oil prices down vs. 2014 when they did it on purpose. From June 2017 to June 2018, Saudi Arabia tapped the breaks on oil exports to the U.S., and we saw that huge rally in oil. Now, Saudi Arabia and Canada are cutting exports to the U.S. of oil vital to refining operations by a rate of double that we saw from mid-2017 to mid-2018. Oil prices will rebound relatively quickly, likely by June of 2019 to between $70 and $80 per barrel WTI.Fluidsdoc: I think there are some parallels to 2014-2016 and have noted that in the Daily Drilling Report. Chief among them is the slope of the decline, combined with Saudi Arabia's determination to raise prices by restraining production. I would also say the key difference is the aggressive posture the U.S. government has taken with regard to the Saudis at present. We have sent them some mixed messages regarding our intentions on enforcing sanctions recently. Their decision to take some oil off the market in the recent OPEC meeting was an out-growth of them.Daniel Jones: Other than prices falling, there's not much in common. Back in 2014, you had OPEC refusing to cut and, instead, deciding to boost output while US output (mostly in the Permian) was on the rise. OPEC has learned that it cannot wage a war against shale, so it has and will continue to make room for it in this market.Laura Starks: Russia is more explicitly involved in decisions about oil supply, while Saudi Arabia and OPEC generally now know the U.S. shale guys won't bail out. At the same time, capital providers to the U.S. shale industry are less forgiving and less patient when producers outspend their cash flow than in 2014. In 2014, some bankers felt they'd missed out on the first shale run-up and were willing to help finance the next one by continuing to throw money at companies that in other circumstances might have gone bankrupt. Which is not to say we didn't have many oil sector bankruptcies in 2014-2015. We did.Long Player: In 2014, no one had any idea how out of balance things were and how unconventional production had grown in influence. No one had any idea how much the unconventional costs had dropped. Instead, they were focusing on history. Nor did many analysts capture the effect of hedging that allowed production to grow in the face of an oil flood. This time, the market appears to be adjusting a lot faster. The economy is still relatively strong, so oil prices are unlikely to sustain a deep drop.Andrew Hecht: No two bull or bear markets are alike. This time, OPEC have no illusions that they will push oil to a level where U.S. shale producers fold up and go out of business. The U.S. has established itself as the world's swing producer. The longer oil sits near the lows, the higher the chance of a new and lower low.Robert Boslego: As in 2014/15, a global glut developed causing prices to collapse. But this was due to OPEC, led by Saudi Arabia, raising oil production in an attempt to bankrupt American shale oil producers. Now, OPEC has agreed, together with some non-OPEC producers, led by Russia, to cut 1.2 million barrels per day for the first six months of 2019. The problem is that that is not enough.Laurentian Research: The current crude oil environment echoes 2014 in that it is also caused by an oversupply shock created by the bloc led by the Saudis. However, there are important differences. This time around, the oil companies are less leveraged and have ampler liquidity, so most of them can afford to reduce their capital plans rather moderately. After all, this is considered to be a correction within an oil bull market, rather than a recession heading for a long-term bottom. However, constrained by serious infrastructure bottleneck, the U.S. shale and Canadian producers may not be able to raise production as unfettered as in 2014. Another difference lies in that the market worries a great deal about near-future oil demand as the Chinese economy slows down amidst trade disputes with the U.S. The 4Q2018 oil crash appears to be driven by both supply and demand, while the 2008 flash crash resulted from demand decimation, and the 2014 recession was caused by an artificial oversupply.Kirk Spano: The politics are overdone. The real story is the Fed. They are sucking $50 billion per month from the financial system and, by extension, the economy with so-called QT or Quantitative Tightening. We have seen markets thin out because of that. If they keep it up, we'll have a recession by 2020 because fiscal stimulus is largely unaffordable globally without expanding monetary policy. Watch the ECB to see if they really start to tighten in 2019. I doubt they can, but will they anyway like in the U.S. where Fed Chairman doesn't really understand the global ""slow growth forever"" economy. If the Fed does not back off, I'll be taking oil profits in 2019. If they do, we'll see how well these highly profitable shale plays do. The low debt shale plays with ""good rock"" have a run in them coming, the question is will the environment come summer be good enough for them to break to new highs or will they hit resistance near their old highs?Fluidsdoc: I think the overarching story lies in the blossoming relationship between Saudi Arabia's Mohammad bin Salman and Russian President Putin. The two countries together account for about 25 mm BOPD of production, or about 25% of the world's daily supply. In my view, Russia made more of a political decision than an economic one to support Saudi in cutting daily production to raise prices. Russia's economic interests would actually be better served by defending their legacy markets in Europe that are now receiving tanker loads of crude, and LNG from the U.S. Instead they've thrown their lot in with the Saudis for political gain in an area where their influence has previously been limited. This outcome is bullish for oil prices, and I think we should see some floors being set for beleaguered oil service suppliers as a result. I am adding to positions in SLB and Halliburton (HAL), in particular.Daniel Jones: To me, the fundamentals are the most important. Yes, political is a concern, especially the trade wars and the risk that that could spill over and negatively affect oil demand. That said, we haven't seen any real signs of that yet (not on a scale large enough to hurt demand) and forecasts from two of the three big oil groups suggests that there won't be an impact on demand. Ultimately, though, this is uncertain and while stories like Iran's sanctions are always important, the political story that will cause the bullish oil thesis to live or die is ultimately trade war based since economic factors are harder to estimate than things like supply. If the global economy tanks, oil tanks. If the global economy does fine, oil will very likely be fine.Laura Starks: The back and forth on Iranian tariffs has rocked the market's stability mercilessly. The Saudi Arabian-Iranian hatefest will continue to impact the Middle Eastern suppliers and by extension the rest of the world's producers. I think it's great that Qatar finally dropped out of OPEC - Qatar is a gas producer, not an oil producer. The ongoing intellectual property theft and tariff tangle and general territoriality struggle with China will be interesting. For example, ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) got a pittance from Venezuela for COP's assets appropriated there, but who is joint-venturing now with Venezuela? China.Long Player: My take has always been to buy bargains when they appear and hang on through the volatility. Sanity always returns to the oil and gas market at some point. What matters the most right now is the relatively strong and growing economy. A close second has to be the erratic leadership signals from Washington that may cause business to become overly cautious and possibly bring on a recession. Next is the unbalanced budget that may cause an overheating of the economy through another asset bubble similar to 2008.Andrew Hecht: Trade issues between the U.S. and China could impact global economic growth. The Middle East remains the most turbulent region and the potential for hostilities is always present in the oil market.Robert Boslego: The relationship between Trump and the Saudis matters most right now in the oil market. Trump spent the first part of his term establishing a warm relationship with the king and deputy crown prince, Mohammad bin Salman. KSA has come to realize that it needs to transform its economy and needs U.S. help to do so. In addition, it remains dependent on the U.S. for its security, and Trump is fond of reminding them of that. Before Trump announced the re-imposition of sanctions on Iran, he obtained promises from KSA that it would offset any oil export losses from Iran. Of course, KSA was more than just pleased that its arch-nemesis was going to be hammered by the U.S. And so Trump gained enormous leverage over Saudi's oil policies. And KSA leads OPEC, and so OPEC was also weakened. OPEC cannot even use its once-powerful jawboning about cutting production further without a tweet from Trump undercutting them. I am much more comfortable going short oil as a result. But I am quick to exit to wait for the next catalyst to come along.Laurentian Research: In investing, there are things we can do nothing about and there are things we can do something about. Investors are supposed to focus on the controllable factors and be prepared to take advantage of the opportunities presented by forces out of our control. I think Geopolitics is beyond the ken of those of us who are not George Soros. Short of being able to prophesy which direction the geopolitical wind is to blow, we'd better settle for taking advantage of the market dislocations created by geopolitical events. Of course, to be successful in investing, we should work toward making our investment portfolios resilient in face of geopolitical risks and full of quality companies that have multiple ex-geopolitical factors going for them.Fluidsdoc: Natty (natural gas) has indeed been the freakezoid of the energy market this year, shooting through $4/mmbtus in the 4th quarter. I think early cold in North America is helping this story, but for the first time, there is another leg to it. Exports of LNG. Much of the shale production we are feasting on is very gassy, and this has been part of the Permian takeaway bottleneck... too much gas. Now with the pipelines being completed and compression plants being built to export this incredibly abundant resource the investment thesis for LNG is overwhelming, and by extension for companies that produce, transport, and compress it. The amazing thing is the market is not acknowledging that the American gas story has nothing to do with the oil story, and shares of these companies remain depressed. At some point, the market is going to wake up and assign higher multiples to companies like Energy Transfer (ET), Cheniere Energy (LNG), Golar (GLNG), and even to the larger shale players like Shell (RDS.A) (RDS.B) who is the largest player globally in gas and BP.Daniel Jones: Unlike oil, which seems to be in a sweet spot and may be in a state of a very slight glut or getting there, chronic underinvestment and high consumption of natural gas has created a massive shortage, so to speak, of natural gas. Inventories in the US are below their prior 5-year range, plus we just dealt with a massively-cold period during Thanksgiving with more cold, likely, on the way. So long as the cold continues, I think natural gas will remain attractive.Laura Starks: It helps that more gas transportation capacity and export capacity is in place, but natural gas is super-easy to produce and we have years of it: wink in the direction of the Marcellus and we'll be oversupplied with natural gas again. The fact that we're a little light on gas in storage is a one-year anomaly. Plus, see the answer below.Long Player: The unconventional revolution has also revolutionized gas production. Places like the Cotton Valley were experiencing a revival even at lower prices. Therefore right now, the rise in gas pricing appears to be seasonal. There are several basins that could supply a significant amount of gas if pricing remains high. The current oil boom almost assures an increase in the gas supplies even if we continue to lose a few rigs. The continuing well improvements should more than offset the lower rig count unless it accelerates.Andrew Hecht: Inventories were too low compared to past years, and the rally was overdue. We have seen the supply and demand side of the fundamental equation for natural gas grow - Massive supplies in the Marcellus and Utica shale regions versus more gas demand for LNG and power generation. This year, stocks going into winter are at the lowest level in many years which supported the price, it was as simple as that. Going forward, remember that NG is historically one of the most volatile commodities of all.Robert Boslego:  After a string of warm winters, some cold weather caused the price spike. Nat gas is highly weather-influenced so it does not imply much about the future. If anything, rising shale production is likely to keep a lid on gas prices.Kirk Spano: There are five types of money not flowing into the markets right now that we saw flowing in from 2009 to 2015. The Boomers are retiring en masse so not investing anymore, the institutions - many of which are pensions - are now in net withdrawal, the Fed is pulling money out of the system rather than putting money in, the Chinese have cut their investing into the U.S. to next to nothing, and now, hedge funds are liquidating at a record pace (which is probably good long run, but hurts short run). That leaves for very thin markets with very few marginal buyers. In other words, the buy the dip crowd is gone for now. We need for the Chinese to come back to the American markets, along with some other foreign buyers, as well as, for the Fed to stop ""normalizing"" its balance sheet. The Fed balance sheet can be normalized in about 20 years after all the Boomers are well into retirement and the demographics curve starts to smooth.Fluidsdoc: We hear endlessly about how more, and more oil is being fracked out of the ground in America. Currently, the EIA is estimating our daily production to be around 12 mm BOPD and is forecasting that production to grow another couple of million barrels increase for 2019. Something that doesn't get a lot of traction is the quality of the oil that is being produced in America. Much of our new-found wealth is relatively high gravity (>50 API), and that is a problem as most refineries run best on lower gravity crude, ~32, or so. That means you have to blend the lower gravity material to optimize refinery through-put. And, there-in lies the rub. Most of the higher gravity crude comes from conventional reservoirs in this country and from Mexico, and Venezuela, and Canada to mention a few. You don't have to read too many articles on SA to understand that this is an area that has lacked investment over the last few years, as the cost of extraction is very high. I am not going to connect the dots here, I'll leave that to the reader. Suffice it to say, this is not an imbalance that can go on forever.Daniel Jones: I don't know how ""under the surface"" the story could be considered, but definitely what's going on in Venezuela. I believe average production next year will be lower than it is this year by around 0.50 million barrels per day. This will reduce the country's exports to practically zero and cause a true economic collapse if nothing changes. China recently injected $5 billion into Venezuela's economy to boost production, and Russia more recently did the same. We saw no impact from China's move, and I doubt we'll see any from Russia's either. All that money will either be taken through corruption or will be spent in other areas. This is critical because oil is the lifeblood of the country, and they can't even afford to keep output flat. I think people will be surprised this time next year how much of an impact Venezuela's collapse will have on oil prices.Laura Starks: a) There is so much oil-associated gas, especially in the Permian, that its value has turned negative at times--essentially a waste product. As Permian oil production ramps back up, this associated gas could continue to impact all U.S. natural gas markets. b) I have felt for some time that people at large don't understand what a geopolitical and international security advantage the U.S. now has by being able to produce so much of its own energy, vs. relying on imports. There's a gigantic difference in our position, our swagger, when we can now produce 11 MMBPD of oil or more, vs. only 5 MMBPD in 2005.Long Player: A few years back, the Murphy Oil (MUR) CEO was stating he wanted his company to be able to thrive with oil in the WTI $30s range. That still seems like good advice when considering an investment in oil companies. Low costs and clean balance sheets are the key. Depend upon operating leverage for above average profits. As both CRC and DNR are demonstrating, financial leverage rarely delivers long term (although short term trades can be very profitable). With declining well breakevens, lower for longer still appears to be a good long term strategy.Andrew Hecht: OPEC is run by Russia...100%Robert Boslego: It's not really under the surface but the markets may not fully appreciate the growth trend in U.S. oil production. It is likely that the U.S. will be technically oil by 2020; i.e., net oil imports are zero or negative. That does not mean the U.S. will stop importing oil. It just means exports will match imports. There will be a lot of trading. This implies a permanent shift down in oil prices. It also will improve the U.S. balance of trade, which will support the dollar. The U.S, is already the dominant oil producing country in the world. What is not broadly reported is that petroleum liquids added to crude production are over 18 million barrels per day, far ahead of Russia and Saudi Arabia.Laurentian Research: As investors, our main task is to manage risks that threaten our investments. I think it is important for investors to understand all jurisdictions have their own flavor of risks; not to take any country as a permanent safe haven, nor to dismiss any country as forever un-investable. It is also important for investors to take an integrative approach in risk evaluation by combing all forms of uncertainties, including external ones (security, fiscal, commodity price, and financial, e.g., interest and exchange rates) and endogenous ones (strategic, operational, etc.); not to favor nor bias against any country for one single factor. For example, Canada, traditionally a favorite destination for energy investment, appears to be chasing away fossil fuel investments via regulatory burdens and carbon tax levied by the liberal Ottawa and by environmentalist activism on both coasts. The U.S. struggles with growth pain caused by old and insufficient infrastructure. Africa continues to be plagued by violence, rising resource nationalism, and local corruption. Asia's main challenge is subsurface in nature. Latin America stands out globally but there are security, regulatory, fiscal, or financial risks on the individual country level. It is ideal to find an investment target that offers outsized gains at limited risks, regardless of whether we are sentimentally biased toward the environment it operates in.Kirk Spano: A very large rally in H1 and then we'll see if the economy really slows or not. If it is visibly slowing, due to a tightening Fed, or a brutal trade war with China, or for whatever reason, then we'll have to take profits on that trade. If the economy is growing and the Fed allows a slightly less strong dollar with some inflation, then we can hold oil and the oil stocks longer. We'll see which way it goes. We'll have a good idea by April.Fluidsdoc: The main thing that I am watching for is something I am probably not going to see. That would be capex increases for deepwater exploration and development. To a great extent, the oil industry modeled itself to thrive on the deepwater, marine environment over the last twenty years. In fact, the oilfield's most prestigious exposition and conference is the Offshore Technology Conference-OTC, held every May in Houston. The pull back and under investment in this area has hobbled many of the of the oilfield's premier companies. Particularly hard hit are the offshore deepwater drillers. Companies like Transocean (RIG) and Ensco (ESV) are near all-time lows with fleet utilizations and day-rates that will ultimately lead to bankruptcy if things don't change. It's a bit of a conundrum that oil companies haven't responded better here. Rig rates are a third of what they were a few years ago. Scrapping has modernized the available fleet. We have learned to operate efficiently in deepwater. Years ago, a deepwater well might take several months to drill and complete. Now, I get stories from my students (I teach classes in several of the major drilling fluids service companies), that on projects they are working on, wells are being drilled and completed in a few weeks. Oil companies have also redesigned their projects to break even with oil prices in the low $30's... so what is the hold up? I really don't know, and it's a topic of interest for me.Daniel Jones: We need to watch really three things that, collectively, will be significant contributors to the oil supply/demand balance: global demand growth, US production, and what happens from OPEC nations. If any one of these things surprises to the upside or downside, it will have a material impact on prices. In particular, this is true of OPEC, where uncertainty over sanctions, a question about how the group works together moving forward, and the collapse in Venezuela will all be material factors next year.Laura Starks: Tangentially, this story about three offshore Massachusetts wind leases going for $135 million apiece to European companies like Equinor (EQNR) is interesting. On a broad basis, it's all just about oil supply from Saudi Arabia, Russia & the US and demand from China & India, with anecdotes about Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), the Midland-Cushing oil price differential and IMO2020 (the rule reducing the sulfur content of marine fuel) thrown in.Long Player: I watch for bargains and when they appear, I grab them. Right now, the Canadian market has a lot of outsized bargains. A basket of decent Canadian stocks should outperform the market without a lot of risk.Andrew Hecht: Trade issues, the dollar, U.S. interest rates, and the political temperature in the Middle East.Robert Boslego: I will be closely watching the global oil supply/demand balance to see if supplies outpace demand because this would pressure oil prices lower. If demand somehow outstrips supplies, prices would rebound, and I would want to be on the long side.Laurentian Research: There are a number of trends I will be watching closely in 2019. Firstly, how OPEC+ will implement its production reduction plan in face of a surging U.S. shale production. It is not much easier to broker a consensus within the OPEC and with Russia than herding cats, let alone enforcing an agreed plan of production cut. Secondly, the GDP growth around the world, particularly China, India, Europe, and the U.S. amidst a trade war, due to its impact on global oil demand. Thirdly, the pace of the Fed's interest rate raising. To the energy companies with an enormous amount of debt maturing beginning 2020, a high interest rate is bad news. Fourthly, the pipelines from the Permian Basin are scheduled to come on stream in late 2019 and the fate of the Trans Mountain pipeline in western Canada is to be decided around that time. The year of 2019 is also right ahead of the implementation of IMO-2020, which requires ocean-going ships to consume low-sulfur fuels. Significant changes in the refining and shipping sectors as well as in crude oil differentials are expected to result beginning in mid-2019. Lastly, speaking of the energy markets, investors appear to be warming to uranium as a zero-carbon, efficient source of energy; henceforth, uranium producers may finally see the inflection point in 2019 after a decade-long bear market. So, in my opinion, the key words in the new year for energy market watchers are OPEC+, trade war, the Fed, pipelines, IMO-2020, and uranium.Kirk Spano: Clearly, oil and oil stocks in H1 of 2019 are the play I am overweight in for the reasons discussed above. But another important story is the ""smart everything world"" I wrote about a few months ago. Folks need to buy the profitable beaten up tech names like Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet/Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and PayPal (PYPL), which are 4 of my top 10 holdings, and hold a long time. These companies are vastly undervalued now for their current and future cash flows. Apple is converting to a services company from a product company, and they could see a huge surge in revenues as the ""smart everything world"" takes hold with their access to 15% of global households from the iPhone penetration. Amazon is a juggernaut, don't discount the Whole Foods purchase, and they will eventually spin off Amazon Web Services creating two massive S&P 500 companies in the process. Googlebet, which I call them, is a cash flow machine that won't get hit the way Facebook (FB) will on the regulation narrative. Folks need to buy that stock because soon enough, there will be ""baby Googles,"" probably six or seven within a decade, and most will be S&P 500 sized companies day one. PayPal is already worldwide and about to make huge forays into cash transfers, not only peer to peer, but bank to bank. Their blockchain technology makes them the perfect partner for the banking system to facilitate much faster, as in seconds, wire transfers. I can see PayPal being bigger than Visa (V) sometime in the 2020s.Fluidsdoc: I think service companies have been punished far out of proportion by the market. Halliburton for example is selling for less than it did when oil was $25.00 a barrel. It makes no sense. So I think as oil prices stabilize and improve as the supply cuts work through the market, these companies will rebound to at least levels seen in late September of this year. For Halliburton that would be about a 30% pop. Other companies like Schlumberger, and Baker also have the same potential. One area of the service business that should really shine is anything associated with natural gas. Companies like Energy Transfer, Golar, and Cheniere should really do well as an example. They are being paid fees for services, and that business is forecast to grow. I like the LNG story and am invested in it.Daniel Jones: I think my best idea for 2019 is Legacy Reserves (LGCY). Simply put, and as I have illustrated in prior articles, LGCY is cheap. Yes, they have leverage, but they are comfortably within their covenants, have a massive quasi-activist firm owning nearly a fifth of their stock, and even with oil at $50, the business generates significant operating cash flow and EBITDA. With oil prices near $50, markets have punished shareholders by pushing the stock south of $2, but I believe the chances of a permanent loss of value (so long as energy stays where it is or moves higher) is incredibly small. The true value of the firm will likely be known once management introduces 2019 guidance (probably during fourth quarter results). If it even comes close to what Baines Creek Capital has suggested, shares will probably climb to $10 or higher. Even a forecast that's lower but still suggests substantial operating cash flow and EBITDA growth will easily reward shareholders.Laura Starks: While I keep my preferences on upstream companies mainly for discussion and review with my EBEI subscribers, over the last year, I've remained fond of refiners and become fonder of utilities, and that continues into 2019. NextEra (NEE) is a utility hit with investors for its focus on renewables, and I really like refiner Marathon Petroleum Corp (MPC) for its good operational ethic and now its new, larger position resulting from the Andeavor acquisition. Valero (VLO), too, continues to perform well in the refining space. Refining requires continuous adaptation to changes in supply, demand, and product, safety, and environmental specifications.Long Player: Current outcast Cenovus Energy (CVE) has been hated since the day it bought the partnership interest in the thermal production from ConocoPhillips. Yet the company has produced decent cash flow ever since the acquisition and paid down more debt than management ever promised. Yet the market focuses on the thermal spot pricing that management has relatively well insulated the company from. There was a quarter of unusual volatility that did hurt company results (combined with the usual turnaround maintenance for a quarter). But the quarters before and after that had decent cash flow. The expiration of hedges almost assures an excellent cash flow year for 2019.Andrew Hecht: VLO and OIH on a scale down basis leaving plenty of room to add on further weakness...it is impossible to pick bottoms.Robert Boslego: As implied by those answers, I will be trading oil, both long and short. However, I would be more comfortable looking for short trades since they seem to pay off more quickly and I believe supplies will be abundant. However, there will come a point where low prices will impact oil supplies and I would want to be on the long side then.Laurentian Research: The 4Q2018 oil crash has created a lot of deep value companies in the energy sector, from which a truly contrarian investor would love to pick stocks. However, one may want to stick with quality now that he is inundated with cheap stocks. At The Natural Resources Hub, our in-depth research led us to a number of best ideas for 2019. Below is just one example of such ideas, specifically for an investor with a relatively low risk appetite. GeoPark Ltd. (GPRK), the king of Latin American independent oil companies, saw its share price was cut by half in the recent oil price downturn. The company boasts a highly visible runway of profitable production growth at around 20% per year, which is backed by low-cost conventional assets managed by one of the most talented management team who owns over 1/4 of the shares outstanding. Valuation suggests the stock has the prospect to be a double in 2019 yet the associated risk is rather low, considering that it has a stellar balance sheet and that 85% of its production is operational cash flow positive at a $25-30/bo oil price. In addition to a slew of near-term catalysts, the company just started a 10% stock buyback program.***Thanks to our guests for combing through these energy sector questions. If you'd like to check out our panelists' work, here are the links to their profiles and Marketplace services:Stay tuned to this account for the continuation of the Year-end series.

4228662,103610,2018-12-17T06:39:34-05:00,Softening of the Permian and lack of conventional capex have driven Halliburton to 1-year lows.We think this is an overreaction by the market that in no way reflects the company's near-term prospects.We lay out a thesis for a rebound in upstream oilfield service companies.,"The upstream oil service industry is being written off for dead as oil prices have tanked in Q-4. To be frank, there were structural problems in some of the shale plays that were impacting results and share prices for the previous half year for companies leveraged to shale. Halliburton (NYSE:HAL), as a prime example, has struggled most of the year. If you initiated a long position anytime after Dec 2017, you are underwater in it, uncomfortably so in many cases.It's been years since I've seen the sentiment quite so negative on this sector of the energy industry. I suppose 2008-9 would be the most obvious analogue. The financial world was imploding, destabilizing entire countries in some cases and the commodity super-cycle story that had helped to propel oil to a mid-year high in 2008 of nearly $150/bbl, came to an abrupt, screaming halt. It was the zombie apocalypse.Buck, the 'Survivalist' next door climbed into his H-2, loaded up the fam, and set out for his bunker in Montana (after cleaning out all the beef jerky from the Walmarts (NYSE:WMT) along the way). He was convinced the long-awaited hour had come, and the zombie horde was on the march. In a couple of months as Buck and the fam listened in the near dark of a single light bulb to the outside world on the single-side band, it was clear that this was again, a dry run for the real thing that was still hanging out there.Just time for Christmas, which Buck had decided was going to come after all, Buck made the call, and loaded the fam up in the Humvee for the ride home, (stopping at the same Walmarts for laxatives - jerky is binding as a steady diet), and called his boss to say he'd be back at work on Monday. Then he logged into his trading account, and bought a few shares of Halliburton. Heck, he figured, he'd been chewing Big Red for the entire Fall, might as well own some. Buck had finally done something smart.That year Halliburton, fell from a high of over $53/share to $15/share in less than six months. December 2nd, 2008 was a very good time to buy as it turned out. Over the next three years, as oil prices stabilized and rose, the company surpassed the 2008 high, and by 2014 had reached over $70/share. July 24th, 2014 was a very good day to sell.So, is that it? Are we to sit on our decimated upstream portfolio as Halliburton continues to wither, eating away more of our capital as it does? Should we take tax loss sales? Or, is it getting near time to double down?I just don't buy this post-oil, ""it's all down from here,"" claptrap that is permeating the blogosphere. America is currently producing about 12 mm BOPD. It uses about 21 mm BOPD. So we're importing the difference from other places. Fine, that is not the point I am making here.Of that 12 mm BOPD, about 7.4 mm is coming from unconventional shale plays. That leaves 4.6 mm from conventional onshore plays, offshore, and deepwater. The EIA tells us that 1.8 mm BOPD is coming from deepwater, leaving the balance to come from shallow water wells, and vertically drilled onshore wells.It shouldn't come as a surprise that this segment of the market has been largely ignored by oil companies recently as capex for shale has sucked the proverbial air out of the investment room. If it were otherwise, I wouldn't be writing this article from its current perspective. The question before us is, does this continue? Can shale supply an ever-growing slice of American energy needs?Or, are we going to need these conventional, and particularly deepwater resources. The oil bears say no. Shale and green energy will fill the gap as conventional deepwater production winds down. I have my doubts about this outcome. I will ignore the crude quality argument regarding shale. It's real, but I have to limit the scope of this article, or it will never get finished.Let's focus on deepwater as it is most out-of-favor. One thing that doesn't get a lot of traction in the blogosphere is that drilling in deepwater is not as expensive as it used to be. Rig rates are in the cellar. The time it takes to drill and complete these wells is 25% of what it was a few years ago. Host designs have been modified to reduce billions of dollars of upfront capex the older designs required. In short, first oil on new deepwater projects is coming at a break-even price of $35 for the oil. That is quite a bit less than the rolled up costs for wells in many shale basins. There is just no reason not to drill in deepwater.I'll conclude this section with the admonishment that the time is coming when oil operators again hire these companies and probe the ocean's depths for conventional oil and gas. I can't say exactly when, but I am confident in this outcome. Better days are coming.Halliburton is in the business of helping O&G companies with their work scope of exploiting petroleum reservoirs. They are good at it, and are considered one of the top providers of these needed services. They divide the company into two reporting divisions.Drilling and Evaluation - about 40% of revenueCompletions and Production - about 60% of revenue (take note of this figure as I will relate something to it shortly.)In Q-3, they managed to make 6.172 bn from these activities, but warned in the call that Q-4 revenue would be off sequentially, due to seasonal and budget exhaustion reasons. Halliburton gets about 40% of its revenue from North America, so weakness here is magnified in their bottom line.Still this is a company generating significant free cash, supporting a small dividend with it, and buying back stock.Source: SA, Chart by AuthorOver the last couple of years, they have also paid down debt to the tune of $2 billion.So, let's move past the notion that this is a company in terminal distress, and circling the drain. Halliburton is managing its resources in a very challenging market and preparing for a near-term future, say, in the back half of 2019 for a more normal operating environment.Drilled, but uncompleted wells - DUCs. There is an inventory of some 8,545 wells awaiting stimulation in the shale plays across the U.S.SourceA few comments on them. Oilmen have another saying. ""The cheapest storage is in the ground."" Meaning that if commercial conditions aren't right, they can just leave the oil right where it's resided for lo these millions of years. As prices have been fairly supportive for the time period covered, we have to view the Permian bottleneck issues - sand supply and off-take capacity, as the primary driver for this increase in DUC inventory.You remember I asked you to keep in mind the 60% of revenue coming from completions for Halliburton? This was the reason, DUCs. Let's say a 10K foot horizontal well costs $6 mm to D&C. Times 60%... means that there is about $34 bn of revenue hanging out there if we were to reduce the DUC inventory to zero.That won't happen, but let's imagine that the takeaway issues are resolved as various pipelines come to fruition. Then let's imagine that the OPEC initiative to raise prices from the current low $50s is successful. If those things come about, there could be a DUC shooting gallery come next summer.Obviously, this is something we will only know with hindsight, but there is probably a little more to come in erosion of the share price in my estimation. I think it will decline when the company reports Q-4. Probably in amount proportionate to the decline in revenues, pending guidance about Q-1. That will likely knock another $2-4.00 off the share price absent other extraneous factors. That would be the level where I would accumulate new shares.The company is currently selling for approximately 18.5 X 1 year's Free Cash Flow. This is an irrational fear-driven aberration that should be taken advantage of by investors. In 2017, the stock averaged about $44.00/share which would give it a price to cash flow multiple of 27.5. As business improves in the 2nd half of 2019, the market should reprice Halliburton's shares to higher multiples.Halliburton is one of the giants of the oil industry. It is not going bankrupt. At current levels, I am very interested to lower my average cost of ownership.I've put my case out there, Now you have to decide for yourselves if an eventual recovery is more than illusion. Oil doesn't come out of the ground by itself, it needs to be coaxed. That is Halliburton's business, and I expect it to improve.Worth noting, is the fact that many of the shale players are reaffirming 2019 capex guidance. Among them are Chevron (NYSE:CVX), ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP), and Occidental (NYSE:OXY). A hugely positive reference point for gauging an uptick in activity later next year.A final point. The expectation is that shale production will grow 15% a year for at least the next decade. I am not going to address whether that is realistic, or not. My point is for that to happen companies like Halliburton are going to have to keep fracking the stars out of shale.Disclaimer: I am not an accountant or CPA or CFA.

However, the company is quite bullish for 2019.The most important takeaway is that Halliburton remains an excellent long-term investment that offers financial security and a secure sizable dividend yield of 2.5%.","Source: OilnowHalliburton (HAL) is one of the largest providers of hydraulic fracturing services and is often considered as the rival of Schlumberger (SLB) in this segment that I have covered recently.The company has seen demand for its services weakening as U.S. oil and gas producers are scaling down on spending, and transportation bottlenecks in the Permian Basin of west Texas and New Mexico pushed the price of regional crude lower.The situation is clear and doesn't need sophisticated developments to explain the obvious. Halliburton is an oil service, and as long as oil prices stay weak, the company will struggle with lower revenues and the stock will suffer. Oil volatility is an unavoidable component of this sector and investors will have to deal with successive bearish and bullish cycles.What I have said about Schlumberger is also true for Halliburton. The most important takeaway is that the company remains an excellent long-term investment that offers financial security and a secure sizable dividend yield of 2.5%.Thus, if you intend to ""marry"" the stock for the next two or three years or more, chasing a bottom becomes a bit futile. Therefore, I believe we have entered an accumulation phase, and I recommend adding on any weaknessHowever, not all oil operators intend to reduce spending and according to ConocoPhillips (COP) on December 10, 2018, the company plans to keep its capital expenditures flat at $6.1 billion in 2019 (flat,) with the Lower 48 region expected to account for about half of this CapEx. Also, Chevron Corp. (CVX) raised its spending budget for the first time since 2014 to $20 billion in 2019, doubling down on U.S. shale. However, it is clear that if oil prices continue their slide something ""has to give.""Wood McKenzie said recently:Jeff Miller, the CEO, said in the conference call:Both companies have previously warned that slowing growth in the largest U.S. shale basin would impact their results, especially in the fourth quarter of 2018 while expecting a better outlook at the end of 2019 with the resolution of pipeline bottlenecks in the Permian Basin.Halliburton's business model is based on two primary operating segments:Schlumberger's business model looks similar.The North America region represents 39.4% of the total revenues of Halliburton in Q3'18 while; the North America region represents 37.5% of the total revenues of Schlumberger total revenues. Halliburton works in every unconventional Basin in the U.S. (e.g., DJ Basin, Eagle Ford, etc.) Conversely, while demand for its North American completions services has weakened, the company's international business is showing early stages of recovery.Both companies suffered a double-digit retracement of about 40% in 2018.HAL data by YChartsSource: HAL filings and Morningstar.1 - Revenues Halliburton reported earnings per share of $0.50 for the third quarter of the year on $6.172 billion in revenues. It is an increase of 19% from the third quarter of 2017. The results beat Wall Street’s numbers estimate.Net income reported by Halliburton for the third quarter of 2018 came in at $435 million, well above the $365 million for the same period last year.In the conference call:On a side note, the Drilled but Uncompleted wells count or DUC in North America for October 2018 is now at a record of 8,545 per the EIA. It is an essential element that could provide a substantial boost for Halliburton next year if oil and gas operators start working those wells.2 - Free Cash FlowFree Cash Flow is an excellent indicator of financial strength. The free cash flow is generally used to pay for the dividend and also shares buyback. Without a sufficient FCF, the company will have to divest non-core assets or add more debt which is not good for the long-term stability of the company.Free cash flow on a yearly basis is $1,402 million and the company is spending $632 million annually to pay for dividend and also $200 million for the shares buyback in Q3.HAL is passing the FCF test.Jeff Miller said in the conference call:3 - Net DebtNet debt is $8.4 billion with a net debt to EBITDA of 1.9X, which is good and better than Schlumberger with a net debt to EBITDA of 3.7X.Chris Weber, the CFO, said in the conference call:In short, the situation is serious but not desperate. The company is still confident about 2019 and views these recent tough winds as only temporary in nature. In fact, when you listen to Halliburton management, 2019 is going to be a good year. Jeff Miller said:I am not as confident as Jeff Miller about next year. I think some weakness will linger in this sector and continue to affect revenues in H1 2019. However, it is the perfect time to initiate a long-term accumulation with a 2019 target at $45.Technical AnalysisHal is forming a falling wedge pattern with line support at $28.50 (I recommend buying the stock and accumulating if lower) and a line resistance at $32.25 (I recommend selling about 20% of your position unless the oil market turns extremely bullish, which is unlikely). The long-term target is $45."

The melt up in financial markets and oil prices have inured to the benefit of Halliburton and other oil services names. That melt up may have reached an inflection point. Even with oil prices above $70, E&P may be drying up in certain markets.Halliburton's Q3 2018 earnings were nothing to write home about. The company reported revenue of $6.2 billion and EPS of $0.50. Total revenue was flat sequentially. This compared unfavorably to the 7% revenue growth reported in Q2. North America represented the company's largest segment at over 60% of total revenue. Revenue from North America fell 2% Q/Q, which followed a 9% increase last quarter. Halliburton even under-performed Schlumberger (SLB) who reported low single-digit revenue growth in the region.Heading into the quarter, Halliburton implied North America shale plays could suffer from budget exhaustion. Management's prognostications were realized. Budget exhaustion and capacity constraints hurt demand for completion services, which likely caused North America revenue to drop. On the Q3 earnings call, management intimated North America could be in the doldrums in Q4 as well:This does not bode well for Q4 earnings. Can HAL bulls stomach a potential decline in revenue next quarter? If E&P is not robust with oil prices above $70, then what could possible spur additional activity in the company's largest region? Halliburton has billions in liquidity, but a slowdown in North America could hurt smaller operators. A diminution in pricing power could lead to a battle of the balance sheets over the next few quarters.International revenue of $2.4 billion grew 5% on higher completion services in the Eastern Hemisphere and higher drilling activity in Latin America. International activity is picking up as North America land drilling appears to have stalled. It could partially offset declines in North America going forward. That said, Halliburton lacks the deep water prowess of Schlumberger and Baker Hughes, A GE Company (BHGE). If deep water awakens at oil prices above $70, then Halliburton could be left wanting.Halliburton has recovered from its failed acquisition attempt of Baker Hughes. The company has pared its debt load, repaired its balance sheet, and avoided having its debt potentially downgraded to junk status. However, the company had help. OPEC supply cuts buoyed oil prices and spurred global E&P, which inured to the benefit of Halliburton. Between record low interest rates from the Fed, tax cuts from President Trump, and oil supply cuts from OPEC, how much more market intervention can Halliburton receive?At some point, the market intervention will likely subside and cyclical names like HAL will be subjected to the vagaries of the U.S. economy. The majority of stimulus efforts have been aimed at corporations. However, without a strong consumer, who will be there to buy the products and services corporations are building? Animal spirits in the industrial sector sound nice, but without a strong consumer, it could lead to the type of over investment that caused the Financial Crisis of 2008.At some point, oil demand could fall and take prices and E&P with it. That does not bode well for Halliburton and other oil services names. HAL has a 2% dividend yield, which compares unfavorably to the 2.8% yield offered by 2-year Treasuries. HAL trades at 8.8x trailing EBITDA and is down over 15% Y/Y. I do not see a compelling reason to own the stock at this time.Economic expansion cannot last forever. The economy will eventually fall and so will HAL. Sell HAL."

It is going to discuss the company's performance and outlook while I will also look at the company's ability to deliver valuable insights when it comes to (expected) global and domestic drilling activities. And even though I am not a shareholder, I expect to use the data from both the most recent Schlumberger (SLB) earnings and Halliburton to get a better picture of the international drilling recovery. So bear with me.Source: HalliburtonThird quarter EPS came in $0.01 above expectations at $0.50. This is 19% higher compared to Q3 of 2017 and one of the strongest quarters since the start of the recovery in the first half of 2017. It is also quite remarkable how accurate Wall Street predictions have been over the past few years. It makes sense given the size and 'predictable' market environment of Halliburton but it is still interesting to mention given the absence of any major outliers.Source: EstimizeAnyhow, sales growth also did not disappoint. Third quarter sales came in at $6.17 billion. This is slightly above expectations of $6.13 and 13% higher compared to the prior-year quarter. The only problem is that sales growth hit a cycle low which could be bad news given that oil is not at all in a major downtrend.Source: EstimizeSo far so good, but what is really interesting and even more important is the story behind these results. Quarterly reports from oil related companies do not decide whether a trend dies or continues. They are mainly a source of insights and expectations. For example, Halliburton's management mentioned the challenging environment in Q3 of this year. This might seem to be a strange thing given that oil was close to $70 in the third quarter. The main reasons why growth was slow was a combination of off-take capacity constraints as well as exhausted budgets that lowered the demand for completion services.This is almost certainly going to continue in the fourth quarter as operators are already starting to take extended breaks given that most companies already hit their full-year production targets. Most companies are also not very eager to invest while off-take capacity issues are still not solved.With that in mind, there are massive opportunities in 2019 and beyond.One of the problems I also discussed in my article about Schlumberger, is the fact that stocks of drilling companies are at levels that are quite common with oil prices below $40. Both stock prices are absolutely disappointing as you can see below. They completely ignored the most recent oil rally.HAL data by YChartsOne of the reasons why these companies are down this much is the distrust of investors. Oil exploration & production companies immediately benefit from rising oil prices while equipment & service giants like Halliburton and Schlumberger depend on bigger investments. These investments are obviously not sustainable when oil prices are low.Additionally, Schlumberger and Halliburton get a big part of their sales from international markets. Halliburton for example generates 55% of its sales outside of North America. In other words, only half of the company's sales were generated in the 'only' region that had a significant recovery after the oil bottom of 2016 when it comes to production volumes.Halliburton's biggest bull case is a situation where higher oil prices trigger international investments in oil production. This includes a rebound in the US after a slow Q3 as I discussed in the first part of this article.That being said, just like Schlumberger, we also get positive signals from Halliburton when it comes to the global capex recovery.Catalysts are higher customer budgets going into 2019 and stronger hedging positions as oil is currently close to $70. This will enhance cash flow and unlock possibilities to increase capex. It can also be expected that off-take capacity problems will be solved as MLPs continue to invest in better pipeline networks in the Permian Basin and Marcellus.These improvements will increase overall demand for services and equipment which stimulates prices. In other words, the real sales recovery of Halliburton has not even started yet. The entire rebound of 2017 and 2018 was due to small investments in US oil production after a the oil crash of 2014/2015.Also, Halliburton mentioned that there is an increased willingness to increase production in the US as well. The DUC count (drilled but uncompleted wells) is at an all-time high. Halliburton offers the tools that will be needed once these wells are finalized.Halliburton also expects that the new recovery will be led by government owned companies that will focus on increased production to increase utilization rates.This would further accelerate the need for high-tech drilling solutions.Moving over to the stock price, I believe that almost everything is priced in right now. The stock is back at levels not seen since Q1 of 2016 when oil was at $40. The most recent recovery has slightly increased the company's earnings which puts the PE ratio slightly above 30. However, the PEG ratio of 0.60 shows the company's real potential. The current sales improvements are not even close to what the company can achieve once the international market shows improvements. This could easily push the stock up to $70 or $80. Especially if oil continues its rally to the $80-$90 area.Halliburton is in a very interesting place right now. The company has benefited from the oil recovery since 2016 by slightly increasing total sales. However, the real potential has not been unlocked yet. Investors continued to sell the stock as the international production recovery has not yet shown real results.However, there are clear signs that global oil production and E&P investments will accelerate in 2019 and possibly beyond. This would finally trigger the catalysts that are needed to push this stock up to $70-$80.The biggest risk is a mid/long-term oil price decline which would lower the urgency to increase E&P investments.On a side note: I really recommend you to read my Schlumberger article as well. It shows the global recovery from a similar perspective.I'll keep you updated!Thank you for reading my article. Please let me know what you think of my thesis.

4214195,38631,2018-10-25T08:17:41-04:00,"During the last two years, Halliburton has lost 22% whereas the price of oil has rallied 50%.
        As the earnings of Halliburton greatly increase with rising oil prices, investors should delve into this divergence.
        Moreover, while the U.S. oil production is at an all-time high level, the earnings per share of Halliburton are half of its record earnings per share.","Halliburton (HAL) reported its Q3 results this week. The company disappointed with its performance and thus the market punished the stock with a 3% plunge on the day of the earnings release. Regardless of the short-term implications of this earnings report, investors should learn two precious lessons from the recent performance of Halliburton.1. Valuation is paramountDuring the last two years, the oil market has eliminated its supply glut and thus the price of oil has enjoyed a breathless 50% rally. Halliburton has dramatically underperformed, as it has lost 22% during this period.This should be surprising, as the earnings of Halliburton increase almost exponentially with rising oil prices. In addition, Halliburton has pronouncedly underperformed S&P in the last two years, as the index has rallied 30% in this period. It is thus evident that the market rushed to price the strong recovery of the oil sector very early in the stock.Many investors have incurred significant losses, as they invested in Halliburton in the early phases of the recovery of the oil market, thinking that the oilfield services provider was a good proxy for the oil price. However, they missed the fact that the market was too early in pricing this growth potential in the stock. It is thus paramount for investors to always check the valuation of a cyclical stock before purchasing it.Two years ago, Halliburton was trading at $46.6. As the company was posting losses back then, investors could not use the commonly used P/E ratio to draw conclusions for the valuation of the stock. However, they should have noted that the company had posted record earnings per share [EPS] of $4.11 in 2014, just before the downturn in the oil sector began. Thus, the stock was trading at 11.3 times its record earnings. A P/E ratio of 11.3 at peak earnings is certainly rich valuation, particularly given the highly cyclical business model of the stock. Therefore, it becomes evident that the market had fully priced the subsequent recovery in the stock two years ago. Investors should have paid attention to the rich valuation of the stock before the beginning of the recovery of its business in order to avoid its subsequent dramatic underperformance.As a side note, thanks to the poor performance of its stock price, Halliburton has become much more attractively valued than it was two years ago. It is trading at a forward P/E ratio of 15.4, which may not be extremely cheap for a cyclical stock but it is a reasonable valuation at this phase of the cycle of the oil sector. Overall, Halliburton is much more attractive now than it was two years ago from a valuation point of view.2. Technological progress is a major factor in the oil industryAs the oil market has become remarkably tight, the oil price has posted a relentless rally this year and is now trading near a 4-year high level. As a result, U.S. oil production has posted new all-time highs this year and is expected by EIA to climb to new all-time highs next year. Even better for Halliburton, the onshore production activity is the type of production that has reached unprecedented levels.Nevertheless, Halliburton reported poor performance in North America in the most recent quarter, with a 2% revenue decrease in the region compared to the previous quarter. Overall the operating income and the EPS of the company decreased 9% and 14%, respectively, compared to Q2. Part of this disappointing performance was attributed to the budget exhaustion of some customers and the resultant decrease in the demand for oilfield services. Management views this as a temporary factor and hence investors should not pay too much attention on this factor.On the other hand, it is critical to note that the disappointing performance also resulted from the great technological progress that has taken place in the onshore production in recent years. Oil producers have been able to extend the lifetime of oilfields and increase the total output from a given oilfield thanks to the technological progress achieved by Halliburton and the other oilfield equipment providers. Halliburton’s management recently admitted that the company was a victim of its own success. In other words, Halliburton now earns less than it used to at a given level of oil production due to its own technological advances. Consequently, although the U.S. oil production has reached a record level this year, the earnings of the company are half of the record earnings it posted four years ago.Investors should thus realize that technological progress plays a major role in the oil sector. Those who do not realize this are poised to face many negative surprises in the future. For instance, those who did not expect the shale oil boom, which resulted from great technological progress, believed that oil would remain around $100 per barrel for decades, only to see the oil price plunge to $27 in 2016.The bottom lineThe example of Halliburton offers two precious lessons to investors. These lessons can save them from investing disasters in the future. When the sector of a company is in the early phases of a long recovery, investors should not blindly invest in the stock, resting assured that the prolonged recovery will generously reward them. The market priced the recovery of the oil sector in the stock of Halliburton before its recovery even began. Moreover, investors should keep in mind that technological progress plays a major role in the oil sector. While the earnings of Halliburton have been considered to rise in tandem with the level of oil production, the company now earns much less than it used to at a given production level due to the increased efficiency achieved thanks to the equipment of the company."
4213179,92586,2018-10-22T13:54:24-04:00,"Halliburton's 3Q18 results were nowhere near disastrous, as the company beat expectations on revenues and earnings.But it looks like the pain caused by the North America land bottlenecks is only getting started, with 4Q18 EPS projected to land well below consensus.Without the appetite for a risky play in the energy space, I choose to stay away from HAL.","I can't say it was a shocker.On Monday morning, ahead of the opening bell, oil and gas service provider Halliburton (HAL) delivered an all-around beat that failed to fuel bullishness. Despite the better-than-expected 3Q18 results, the now well-known issues with the North America onshore business (i.e. production and distribution bottlenecks, particularly in the Permian basin) manifested themselves in the form of dismal guidance for the upcoming period. Credit: Inside EnergyRevenues of $6.17 billion surpassed expectations by a timid $60 million, while EPS of $0.50, eight cents lower sequentially, landed a penny above consensus. While the top line remained stable sequentially, margins dropped rather noticeably, justified by ""the softening North America market for completion services"" that attentive investors should have already been anticipating. It's worth pointing out that, internationally, completion and production looked much healthier, helping to lift segment revenues by 5% sequentially (vs. -2% in the home continent).See summarized P&L below, and further notice how an effective tax rate that was the lowest so far this year helped to add a few cents, perhaps surprisingly, to per-share earnings - likely doing little to provide investors with comfort over the robustness of Halliburton's operations.Source: DM Martins Research, using data from company reportsGiven the confirmed headwinds, I was surprised to see that third quarter results were nowhere near disastrous. But considering the EPS guidance for 4Q18 of $0.37 at the low end of the range (a pronounced drop of 13 cents quarter-over-quarter that came in 12 cents below consensus), it looks like the pain is just about to get started. Halliburton's management team warned of ""capacity constraints and customers’ budget exhaustion (leading) to less demand than expected for completion services,"" although clarifying that the pressures should play out primarily in the short term (which I understand to be the next few quarters through the back end of 2019).The less-than-encouraging narrative is very much aligned with peer Schlumberger's (SLB) earnings report, which in turn triggered the cautious stance toward HAL that I recently published in my earnings preview. For this reason, I'm not surprised at all to see HAL drop 4% mid-trading session on Monday, even after the stock already had endured a 25% dip YTD.Third quarter results and guidance might have been the catalyst for a needed correction in HAL's stock price, given the company's exposure to the North America onshore business. I agree with Halliburton's and Schlumberger's executive team that the production and distribution bottlenecks are most likely to impact results in the near term, opening up an opportunity for value investors to ""buy the fear"" and hold on to shares for a potential longer-term market value gain.At the same time, timing an entry into the stock and trying to catch it at a bottom is no easy feat. This is particularly true of HAL, since I expect a hypothetically more pronounced deterioration in the North America landscape to impact it more so than its more geographically diversified peer SLB.For this reason, I have added SLB to my portfolio in an attempt to capitalize on the short-term worries without exposing myself to the same level of downside risk that HAL might be faced with. The latter continues to look cheap on a next-year earnings basis (15.0x vs. SLB's 24.2x, see graph above), but I believe the valuation discount could very well prove to be justified.Without the appetite for a risky play in the energy space, I choose to stay away from HAL, and will continue to monitor the stock price in search for a better entry point."
4205735,104714,2018-09-12T08:30:28-04:00,Halliburton provided a strategic update at a recent conference.Expects production weakness in the international market to continue beyond 2020.Capacity constraints issues to hit some U.S. shales harder than earlier anticipated.Halliburton revised down its Q3 2018 earnings.,"On September 5, Halliburton’s (HAL) CEO Jeff Miller spoke at the Barclays CEO Energy-Power Brokers Conference. His notes on the economy, industry, and the most recent trends in Halliburton’s geographical segments provide a clue as to which way the company is moving. It is also worth noting if there has been any change in the company’s stance on these drivers since the company’s last guidance provided during the Q2 2018 earnings conference call.Any change or shift in the outlook can have material short term and long-term effects on its financial performance. Plus, what oilfield equipment & services (or OFS) industry leader like Halliburton has to say can have a bearing on the overall industry’s outlook.For comparison, I have also included Schlumberger’s (SLB) commentary on similar issues, so that investors can draw a parallel and see if there are any divergences in their outlook.Let us now see Halliburton’s perspective on the economy and the energy sector. Halliburton’s management believes global demand for energy remains robust based on the GDP growth estimate for 2019, affordable fuel prices and demand for petrochemicals. Energy supply, on the other hand, is a different story. The 2014-2016 energy price downturn and the following under-investment in E&P are resulting in a supply shortage. The effect of supply shortage can spill over to 2020 and beyond, as opposed to HAL’s earlier version of staying within the 2019 limit.Barclays Conference: The supply shortage following under-investment in exploration & production activity means increased completion activity. This indicates upstream producers can now resort to drilling more mature fields, infield drilling, and production optimization.Q2 2018 earnings conference call: According to Halliburton management, the international market was “challenging.” This included pricing for Halliburton’s offerings and upstream energy market activity. The recent tender activities in the global market came at the bottom of the cycle, meaning upstream companies received competitive prices. But this also indicates, according to HAL’s management, any incremental activity can see improved pricing.Barclays Conference: Let us start with Halliburton’s outlook on the North Sea in Europe. Halliburton now sees long early-cycle tenders in Saudi Arabia and Europe, meaning the positive effects of new projects will take longer than expected earlier. The trend indicates the beginning of an upcycle and a tightening of spare service capacity in those geographies. You may note that these regions saw excess OFS capacity since upstream activity contracted in the past couple of years.In the near term, HAL now sees slower-than-expected activity in the Middle East new projects. This can affect HAL’s short-term results negatively. The Middle East/Asia region, which accounted for 18% of HAL’s Q2 2018 revenues, saw 11% revenue growth compared to a year ago. Increased drilling services, project management activity, and completion tool sales boosted Q2 revenues in Saudi Arabia.Q2 2018 earnings conference call: HAL said the North Sea was recovering, and additional activity is starting to reduce excess capacity. It expected pricing to improve in the North Sea and Saudi Arabia in 2019. HAL’s wireline and Sperry technology were leading its recovery in the North Sea. In Saudi Arabia, HAL received one of the largest unconventional completion contracts ever awarded in the Middle East. This expands Halliburton’s role in the unconventional drilling activity in the Middle East.HAL’s Q2 drivers in the North Sea: In Q2 2018, Halliburton’s revenues from the Europe/Africa/CIS region increased 7% compared to Q2 2017. This was led by higher pressure pumping and pipeline services, partially offset by lower completion tool sales. The Europe/Africa/CIS region accounted for 12% of HAL’s revenues in Q2 2018.Barclays Conference: Offshore and deepwater projects have long cycles, and they typically lag onshore projects’ recovery. However, HAL commented, “structural improvements in Mexico and Brazil and selected parts of West Africa will over time drive incremental demand for our services.”Q2 2018 earnings conference call: Halliburton was particularly positive about shale activities in Argentina. In Q2, HAL’s revenues from Latin America declined 6% compared to a year ago. Latin America accounted for 8% of HAL’s Q2 2018 revenues.Barclays Conference: Halliburton now considers North America production as “less of a swing producer” – meaning short-term price changes will not affect output much particularly for the tight oil producers in the North American shales. Halliburton’s prediction of a pricing weakness made in the second quarter call has now spread to several basins, including in the Permian.In response to infrastructure constraints in the Permian and other basins, Halliburton now finds some upstream operators re-allocate capital to other basins, while some are facing a slowdown. Regarding the overall outlook on North America, Halliburton remains optimistic for a strong activity in 2019.Halliburton now estimates that its weakness in some of the North America shales, coupled with a slowdown in Saudi Arabia, can reduce Q3 2018 earnings by $0.08 to $0.10 per share.Q2 2018 earnings conference call: Halliburton noticed three trends in North America - a downturn in activity due to budget constraints and takeaway issues, a decrease in customer urgency, and pricing pressure.Along with the Permian Basin infrastructure issues, Halliburton’s management sees similar problems in the Williston and in the DJ Basin (or Denver-Julesburg Basin). Earlier, the DJ suffered constraints on natural gas takeaway. HAL’s management believed that the obstacles in this basin could lessen in early 2019 as additional off-take capacity comes on-line. Also, production in the Marcellus Basin began to slow down and is expected to remain muted in the second half of 2018. As a result of this temporary production slowdown and oilfield services companies’ additional capacity, energy pricing recovery can get delayed.HAL’s Q2 drivers in North America: In Q2 2018, Halliburton’s revenues from the North America region increased 38% compared to Q2 2017. Increased pressure pumping, drilling, and artificial lift activity boosted HAL’s revenues in North America in Q2. The region accounted for the majority (62%) of HAL’s Q2 2018 revenues.Now let us see what Schlumberger, the OFS industry leader and Halliburton’s competitor, had to say in the Barclays conference call on September 4. Paal Kibsgaard, SLB’s CEO, concedes that the current investment levels in the international markets are not sustainable to meet medium term or long-term reserve replacement needs. Typically, the legacy wells have a steep decline rate, and therefore, over time, needs either investment in new wells or higher investment in old wells to increase productivity to maintain the production level.Even assuming a higher efficiency level achieved through technological innovation and better drilling techniques, the actual investment is falling short of what is necessary. Also, additional investment will be required to replace the Venezuelan and Iranian production, which is likely to stop coming into the market.In North America, SLB believes that the Permian off take constraints should be resolved by 2019. But the damages that it would cause by then would reduce production growth, wellhead prices, and investment levels in the following years. Also, in places like Eagle Ford, the techniques of boosting output by using longer laterals, pressure pumping, and proppants are producing short of the desired results. A similar trend can happen in the Permian also, which can result in lowering the region’s growth potential. This, however, can be corrected through the increased application of efficient OFS solutions and innovative techniques.So, we see that the undertone in HAL’s and SLB’s commentary on the energy market demand and supply are similar. Both harp on under-investment and supply tightness in the international market, and the effect of the infrastructure bottleneck in the U.S. shales going beyond 2019. While this indicates a production slowdown, it also increases OFS companies’ involvement to help raise the productivity level. Halliburton’s categorical depiction of the regional trends points towards a slowdown, which can reduce HAL's Q3 2018 earnings."
4200661,31441,2018-08-20T16:38:19-04:00,"HAL delivered solid Q2 results, but it could be too dependent on North America for future revenue.Its lack of a sizeable subsea presence could mean limited upside going forward.I rate HAL a hold.","Halliburton (HAL) is one of the stocks that has perplexed me over the years. I have focused on the company's revenue and earnings trends, and its valuation. However, one must also be cognizant of the direction of oil prices and the constant melt-up in financial markets. Both have inured to the benefit of Halliburton and other oil services names over past few years. However, HAL has had a flat return over the past year.The company has rebounded from its failed merger with Baker Hughes (BHGE), which required Halliburton to pay a $3.5 billion deal break-up fee. The sizeable payout came as oil prices were in the doldrums, and Halliburton's revenue and earnings were in decline. The situation appeared bleak in the first half of 2016 when the company's debt was approaching junk levels. However, OPEC's supply cuts buoyed oil prices and changed Halliburton's fortunes.Brent oil prices over $70 should be extremely positive for Halliburton. However, the stock is down about 3% after Q2 earnings. The company reported total revenue of $6.1 billion, up 7% sequentially.North America represents over 60% of total revenue; as North America goes, so goes Halliburton. Revenue from the region was up 9% Q/Q. This was consistent with growth in the rig count, which was also grew in the high single digits. Meanwhile, North America revenue for Baker Hughes and Schlumberger (SLB) was up about 7% and 11%, respectively.Ironically, North America was a point of contention in Q1; Halliburton experienced rail disruptions in the region which created challenges. Management worked through complexities of sand logistics to minimize the damage, yet investors wanted to ensure problems did not spill over into Q2. According to management, the company's use of trucks for sand is causing inflationary pressures:For now, revenue growth from North America is consistent with rig count growth and that of competitors. The company's EBITDA margin of 19% was higher than the 18% reported in Q1. The rising costs have not negatively impacted margins as of yet, but it could come into focus in the second half of 2018.A few quarters ago, Halliburton's management implied North America was plateauing, and shale plays could eventually pump the brakes on new E&P in the region. Since then, oil prices have continued to rise, and the rig count has risen in response. Halliburton has so much exposure to the region that if North America falters, it could hurt sentiment for the stock. Secondly, Schlumberger has acquired assets in North America land drilling and now receives about 38% of its revenue from the region.An aggressive Schlumberger in North America would not be good for prices in the region. Secondly, outside of North America where will the next catalyst materialize? With oil prices hovering around $70, deepwater drilling is showing signs of life. Schlumberger beefed up its deepwater presence with its 2015 acquisition of Cameron. Baker Hughes added a sizeable presence after its merger with GE (GE) Oil & Gas. The popular narrative after Q2 results is that the subsea sector could be making comeback. This was echoed by both Schlumberger and Baker Hughes. In particular, Baker Hughes saw its largest order flow for the subsea segment since 2015:For now, there could be enough business to go around in North America. If any of the large oil service firms in the region becomes more aggressive on taking market share, then the upside could be limited. It could be difficult for Halliburton to capture any potential upside in the subsea since it does not have a sizeable presence in the sector.HAL trades at just over 10x trailing EBITDA. This is low compared to previous quarters when it traded at 13x to 14x EBITDA. It is also paltry compared to the 15x EBITDA multiple of Schlumberger. Given limited opportunities for Halliburton to grow revenue outside of North America, I believe its valuation is more than fair. If any hiccups occur in its largest market, then the stock could go lower.At 10x trailing EBITDA, HAL trades at a discount to SLB. Despite ebullient oil prices, HAL's upside could be limited relative to SLB and BHGE. I rate the stock a hold at these levels."
4210912,31441,2018-10-10T13:07:20-04:00,"HAL reports earnings October 22nd.Shale plays in North America could suffer from budget exhaustion, which could hurt HAL in the region.Future catalysts could come from subsea where the company has less of a presence versus competitors.HAL is a hold into earnings.","Halliburton (HAL) reports Q3 earnings October 22nd. Analysts expect revenue of $6.14 billion and EPS of $0.5. The revenue estimate implies flat growth sequentially. Investors should focus on the following key items:Halliburton, Schlumberger (SLB), and Baker Hughes, A GE Company (BHGE) dominate the North America land drilling segment. For the past few years, this segment has been white-hot, while deep water has languished. Brent oil north of $80 is more than high enough of shale oil plays to make money. The more activity in North America bodes well for the big three oil servicers. Pricing has also been robust enough for smaller firms like Oil States International (OIS) and Weatherford (WFT) to make money.Halliburton receives about 62% of its revenue from North America. In the past, I deemed 50-55% concentration in the region as risky, but 62% could make the company highly-vulnerable to a pullback. In Q2, Halliburton's total revenue was up 7% sequentially. North America led the way with high single-digit growth, while other regions grew in the low to mid-single digits.The U.S. oil rig count for the week ended October 5th fell 2 to 861 versus the previous week; however, this represented a 12% increase Y/Y. Nothing lasts forever, does it? The U.S. rig could stall at some point, connoting a plateau of drilling activity in the region.At the recent Barclays Energy Conference, Halliburton described what it called budget exhaustion in North America:This budget exhaustion could cause some clients to slow down work in the Permian or other basins. It could also create pricing pressures for the second half of 2018. However, management envisions budgets of operators could be replenished in 2019 and activity and pricing could rebound. Short-term downward pricing pressures could hurt firms like Weatherford with less liquidity than Halliburton and extremely high debt loads.I thought Halliburton's concentration in North America would come back to sting the company. That has not been the case thus far as oil prices have continued to rise. Outside of North America, what other catalysts does the company really have? Its Q2 revenue from international markets was $2.3 billion, up only 4% Q/Q. Latin America represented 8% of total revenue, down from 12% in the year earlier period. It cut exposure to Venezuela due to credit risk to that country's state-owned oil company. The economies of Venezuela and Brazil are not on strong footing, which could stymie progress in Latin America going forward.Halliburton anticipates pricing will stabilize in international markets, leading to higher margins. The company is witnessing a rise in the international rig count that could lead to double-digit growth in E&P spending in 2019. However, the biggest opportunity going forward could be in the subsea segment where Halliburton does not have a sizeable presence vis-a-vis Schlumberger and Baker Hughes. Schlumberger acquired Cameron in 2015, which gave it a presence in subsea. Baker Hughes' merger with GE's Oil & Gas instantly made it a large player in the segment.Oil prices may need to remain above $70 for an extended period before subsea drilling becomes profitable. With oil prices above $80 subsea is seeing signs of life. Both Baker Hughes and Schlumberger are seeing large orders in the subsea market, and I expect this to drive the narrative for the second half of 2018. Subsea contracts can be highly profitable. If the next catalyst is in deepwater drilling, then Halliburton could miss out on earnings opportunities going forward.The good news is that Halliburton has a fortress balance sheet. It has cash of $2.4 billion, and its $10.9 billion debt load is only 2.4x trailing 12 months EBITDA; its debt load is manageable. It generates about $1.2 billion in quarterly EBITDA, so it can survive any slowdown in North America. I doubt it has the dry powder to make a large scale acquisition in subsea. Such an acquisition could be expensive now that subsea is showing life again. Halliburton could tread water for a few more quarters with the portfolio of businesses it currently has.HAL trades at just over 10x trailing EBITDA. The stock is off 5% Y/Y, yet I expect HAL to tread water for a while. I rate HAL a hold into earnings."

But the company will likely come back strongly in 2019 as the North American market recovers and the international markets strengthen further. The company’s shares are hovering near 52-week lows and I believe that for long-term oriented investors, this could be a buying opportunity.Image: Halliburton.Halliburton has recently released its financial results for the third quarter in which it posted a profit of $0.50 per share from revenues of $6.17 billion. The company managed to beat both revenues and earnings estimates by $60 million and $0.01 per share respectively. On a year-over-year basis, the company’s revenues and profits climbed by 13.4% and 19% respectively. But on a sequential basis, revenues were largely flat while profit dropped by 13.8%. The drop was driven by weakness in North America, which is typically responsible for a majority of Halliburton’s revenues and earnings.Halliburton has said that the demand for completion services in North America was hit by infrastructure constraints and customers’ ""budget exhaustion.” The shortage of takeaway capacity in the Permian Basin located in West Texas and New Mexico, in particular, which is the leading shale oil play in the US, has driven a decline in drilling activity. Due to a shortage of crude oil pipeline and rising production, a supply bottleneck has emerged that has pushed the region’s oil prices lower and forced a number of exploration and production companies, such as Halcon Resources (HK), to cut down drilling activity. For Halliburton, this had a negative impact on pricing levels and equipment efficiency. In this backdrop, the company’s revenues from North America declined by 2.5% on a year-over-year basis and 18.2% on a sequential basis to $3.74 billion. But the worst isn’t over.Halliburton has warned that activity could weaken further due to continued budget exhaustion and seasonal issues. The last six weeks of the year will likely be tough as Halliburton believes that the exploration and production companies will take extended breaks, “some even starting before Thanksgiving.” As a result, the company’s profits will decline further. In fact, Halliburton itself has predicted a double-digit drop in profits in the fourth quarter. The company has said that it will earn between $0.37 and $0.40 per share in the fourth quarter. That’s going to translate into sequential and year-over-year drops of 23% and 27.4% respectively at the mid-point. That’s also substantially lower than the analysts’ consensus estimate of a profit of $0.50 per share for the fourth quarter.The gloomy outlook for the short term has pushed Halliburton stock lower. But the company’s warning shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone since the capacity constraints that Halliburton talked about are well documented. In fact, Halliburton itself also warned in early-September that the weakness in Permian Basin will have a negative impact on its future earnings. The company has also previously talked about the customers’ budget exhaustion and how it might impact activity moving forward.Moreover, the business environment in the Permian Basin has already started to recover as the region’s oil prices have risen substantially. The Midland WTI, Permian Basin’s benchmark, dropped to as low as $17 a barrel below the benchmark US crude futures in August. But now, the Midland WTI futures are priced less than $6 a barrel below the US benchmark, as per data from CME Group. The increase in prices levels has come as some of the leading midstream companies, such as Plains All American (PAA), Phillips 66 Partners (PSXP), and Epic Midstream, are working to deploy additional pipeline capacity from as soon as the fourth quarter of this year.The increase in oil prices in the Permian Basin will encourage oil producers to ramp up drilling activity, particularly from early-2019 as exploration and production companies start working under new budgets. Halliburton’s CEO Jeff Miller has also said that the company is experiencing high demand from customers for 2019. “They’re eager to get back to work. I hear it. I’m hearing this from our business development organization who are busy responding to inbound 2019 demand,” Miller said during the second quarter conference call. That’s going to fuel the turnaround of the company’s North America business.Furthermore, drilling activity in international markets has finally started to recover and that’s softening the blow coming from weakness in North America. The negative impact of the drop in North America revenues on a sequential basis in Q3-2018 was partly offset by a 5% increase in revenues from international markets to $2.43 billion. Halliburton has posted across the board growth in the three operating regions outside of North America (Latin America, Europe/Africa/CIS, and Middle East/Asia regions).Due in large part to the strength in oil prices which have largely stayed above $65 a barrel (Brent) throughout 2018, the international markets will continue to recover as oil producers will look to develop mature fields, unconventional resources, and expand offshore programs. Russia and the Middle East, in particular, could register a meaningful uptick in activity as they increase production in order to offset the impact of the decline in volumes from Iran and Venezuela. Halliburton believes that the rebound in the international market will be driven by national oil companies who have a government mandate to grow production.Shares of Halliburton have dropped by almost 9% this week to close at $34.23 on Wednesday, near 52-week lows of $34.19. The drop came on the back of the gloomy fourth-quarter outlook and the broader stock market sell-off which also pushed the Dow and S&P-500 lower. But I believe Halliburton’s future outlook is looking good and the company will likely report strong growth in earnings in 2019 as the North American market rebounds and the recovery in international market gathers pace. I believe long-term oriented investors should consider buying Halliburton stock on weakness.Note from author: Thank you for reading. Please share your comments below.

This Friday morning, peer Schlumberger (SLB) did not do much to ease concerns over onshore bottlenecks in its home continent, which I believe could impact Halliburton much more (nearly two-thirds of total revenues are produced in North America) vs. its more geographically diversified competitor. Credit: Yahoo FinanceWhat has helped Halliburton a bit in the past few quarters are results that continued to look robust, on the back of an oil and gas business that began to recover from the 2014-2018 downcycle faster in North America than internationally. Last quarter, when management's more pessimistic narrative about the foreseeable future sent the stock down 18% over the ensuing six weeks, the company's financial performance looked much less concerning: 24% YOY top-line growth coupled with GAAP op margin that increased by a whopping ten percentage points over 2017 levels.My fear is that, this time, softness in North America's onshore business may finally present itself more clearly on the P&L, particularly in the form of slower revenue growth and less-than-impressive profits. ""Increased activity throughout the United States land sector, primarily pressure pumping,"" will probably turn from a tailwind in 2Q18 to a headwind in the third quarter. I believe that the completion and production segment, traditionally a much more profitable business than drilling and evaluation, is likely to suffer the brunt of the pipeline constraints, lack of proper transportation infrastructure and supplies needed for hydraulic fracturing in the Permian basin - possibly pressuring total company margins due to the revenue mix dynamics.Whether the more pessimistic projections will materialize remains to be seen. But I do not find it comforting that the Street still anticipates a healthy 13% increase in revenues this quarter along with a seven-cent YOY rise in EPS. Even next year's 7% top-line growth estimates could prove to be too aggressive, considering the challenges in North America are unlikely to subside until the end of 2019 or beginning of 2020.More information will hopefully come to light when Halliburton reports earnings on Monday, October 22, ahead of the opening bell.I have just bought a few shares of SLB, proving that I'm not overly concerned about the state of the oil and gas service business in a two-to-five-year time horizon. My optimism, however, does not apply as much to HAL, considering how much more exposed to the short-term headwinds in domestic activity the company seems to be over the next few quarters.True, HAL trades at a sector-low, current-year EV/EBITDA multiple of only 9.5x that compares favorably to SLB's much richer 13.8x. But in my view, the stock is discounted for a good reason, and I find it hard to confidently predict the impact of the expected softness in North America on Haliburton's financial statements.In my view, the O&G space already is volatile and unpredictable enough, given its exposure to bouncy crude oil prices. Therefore, I find it too speculative to add a layer of risk by investing in HAL at current levels. I continue to think that the company is of high quality, but at the same time suspect that the stock could see further downward pressure before it can finally recover some of the lost ground that has sent shares to their current two-year lows."
4214339,104714,2018-10-25T12:41:14-04:00,"Year over year, HAL’s revenue and earnings registered steady growth.HAL anticipates a slowdown in key U.S. shales in the near term.HAL expressed concerns over Q4, but is more optimistic of a 2019 turnaround.HAL plans to latch on to the international market recovery.HAL’s FCF has fallen steeply, but its balance sheet is strong.","Halliburton (HAL) is the second largest company in the oilfield equipment & services (or OFS) industry. In Q3 2018, HAL’s revenues and earnings increased steadily over a year ago. However, the recent negative reaction in the market follows HAL’s comments over the anticipated decline in the upstream activity in some of the U.S. resource shales in Q4.Come 2019, I think Halliburton is poised to get over its weaknesses and will find itself in a firm footing to gain from an international energy production recovery. By then, the U.S., too, will make adjustments in its infrastructure which will support higher activities. Let us now check in details what transpired for HAL in Q3 and what awaits in the medium term.In Q3 2018, HAL’s revenues increased 13.4% over Q3 2017, while its adjusted earnings per share (or EPS) increased 19% during the same period. Segment-wise, the Completion & Production segment primarily accounted for HAL’s revenue growth in Q3. An 18% revenue growth in Q3 2018 over a year ago was led by increased completion tool sales, higher well intervention services in the Eastern Hemisphere, and higher stimulation activity in Mexico.HAL’s Drilling and Evaluation segment growth were relatively muted (5% up) during this period. Increased drilling-related service revenue in Latin America was partially offset by declines in drilling fluids activity in North America.Investors should note that the demand for HAL’s C&P business is correlated to changes in the total number of wells drilled, total footage drilled, the number of drilled wells that are completed, and the use of hydraulic fracturing techniques. Until August, recovery in crude oil price and rig count has led to 22% higher drilled wells and 17% higher completed wells in the key U.S. shales, according to the data provided by the EIA.This indicates things continue to move forward for HAL. If crude oil price stays strong and operators’ margin expand, they will complete many of these wells in the near term. Higher completion intensity will translate into potential revenue for HAL’s completion-directed services.From Q3 2017 to Q3 2018, HAL’s revenues from North America increased by 18%. North America accounted for 61% of HAL’s Q3 revenues. There are concerns over HAL’s near-term performance in North America, which suffers from upstream operators’ budget exhaustion and seasonality factor due to the ensuing winter season. HAL’s management expects the slowdown in the pressure pumping activity level and lower pricing will reduce its Completions & Production division operating margin by a low double-digit percentage in Q4. The Drilling and Evaluation division, however, is expected to perform steadily in Q4.Despite lower pricing for stimulation services and reduced drilling fluids activity in the U.S., HAL’s management seemed more upbeat about North America in the medium to long term. It now believes the catalysts in North America will press ahead despite the short-term headwinds in the Permian. In the earnings press release, HAL commented:HAL’s most recent comments also seemed more optimistic compared to its observations made in a September presentation. Read more on this in Halliburton Is Getting More Concerned About The Market.Halliburton’s management expressed some concerns over the production slowdown in the Northeast as the upstream operators have already met the production target. Over the medium term, additional pipeline capacity is expected to alleviate some of the natural gas pricing discounts in this region. Completions activities in the DJ Basin, too, have been curtailed as the infrastructure bottleneck has put an adverse effect on the pricing economics.The story in the Eagle Ford and the Midcontinent Rockies is not different either. However, HAL’s management strongly believes in a rebound in 2019 as pipeline capacity additions take place and improve pricing in these regions.It was the Permian Basin that opened the can of worms. During Q2 2018, it became apparent that the growing oil production in the Permian Basin oilfield was temporarily exceeding the capacity of the region’s pipelines to transport oil from oil wells to oil refineries. The takeaway capacity bottleneck in the Permian has led to reduced local crude oil pricing as compared to WTI and Brent-linked benchmarks. So, the region’s pipelines constraints can lead to its customers reducing their drilling and completion activities.This puts RES’s near-term financial results on risk. According to BP Capital Fund Advisors, by the end of 2018, Permian production could exceed available pipeline space by 300,000 to 400,000 bpd. By late 2019, the gap could reach 750,000 bpd. The fallout of the capacity constraint is higher prices for crude oil transportation, or a production shift from Permian, or both.From Q3 2017 to Q3 2018, HAL’s revenues from its international operations increased by 6.7%. Increased revenues from the Middle East and Asia led the charge for HAL’s improvement in international revenues. Regarding recovery in the international energy market, HAL’s management commented in the Q3 earnings press release:From June until September of 2018, the international rig count increased by nearly 5%, which outperformed the 1.3% decline in the international rig count from March until June. This indicates the energy operators are more confident about E&P activities in the international markets. The improved condition also makes Halliburton a prime candidate to benefit from it. However, it may not be until 2019 that the paybacks of higher activities start pushing HAL’s financial results in the upward direction.Halliburton’s Q3 2018 FCF saw a sharper dip (52% down) compared to a year ago. Despite the revenue rise, HAL’s year-over-year CFO decreased in Q3, while its capex increased leading to the free cash flow decline.Halliburton’s cash flow may stay subdued in 2018 given the headwinds in the U.S. operations and the more extended turnaround period in the international projects, but in 2019, cash flows should swing upwards, unless the crude oil price stages any dramatic fall.As of September 30, 2018, Halliburton’s year-over-year net debt decreased by 7% to $8.4 billion. Halliburton holds back its earlier plan to repay a $500 million debt in 2018 and instead may use that fund to repurchase stocks or seek M&A activities. HAL’s internal financing looks strong enough to fund its capex, share repurchase and the remaining debt repayment for FY2018.Year-to-date, Halliburton’s stock price has decreased by 25%. In comparison, the VanEck Vectors Oil Services ETF (OIH), which represents the oilfield equipment & services industry, has declined 12% year-to-date. During this period, the U.S. rig count increased 15%, while West Texas Intermediate (or WTI) crude oil price increased ~14%.HAL’s stock price has dropped 6% since its Q3 financial results were released. During this period, the WTI crude oil price has declined 3%. The supply-side boost coming from higher Saudi production market’s overcoming of Iranian supply-sanction is keeping crude oil price down. However, there have not been any fundamental changes to the energy economics, and in the medium term crude oil price is expected to stay strong.According to data provided by Seeking Alpha, 30 analysts rated HAL a buy (includes strong buys), while six recommended a hold. The analysts’ consensus target price for HAL is $51.2, which at HAL’s current price yields 40% returns.At the moment, Halliburton’s stock price is still adjusting to the management comments over the near-term weakness in the U.S. shales and crude oil price’s softness over the past couple of days. I think Halliburton will gain from an international energy production recovery in 2019. By then, the infrastructure bottlenecks in some of the U.S. shales will be alleviated, too. Investors should consider low prices of HAL as an opportunity to buy."
4200040,40351,2018-08-17T09:07:04-04:00,"Halliburton has grown revenues and profits and posted strong levels of free cash flows in 2018.
        The ongoing issues in the Permian Basin may drag Halliburton’s profits in the short term but new pipelines will help resolve this problem.
        More importantly, the global oil market remains strong and international activity is recovering in a number of regions, including the Middle East where Halliburton has won a major contract.","Halliburton (HAL)’s earnings may come under pressure due to the weakness in the Permian Basin. However, it is important to remember that the issues in the Permian Basin will get resolved in the near-term. The oilfield services company, however, will likely get support from international markets which have finally started showing signs of life. The company may witness strong growth outside of North America in the short-term which could offset some of Permian Basin related issues.This has been a tough year for Halliburton’s investors since the company’s shares have fallen by 18% on a year-to-date basis. By comparison, shares of its closest rival Schlumberger (SLB) have fallen by 5.9%. The broader oilfield services sector, as represented by VanEck Vectors Oil Services ETF (OIH), has dropped by 7% in the same period. The market has wiped out more than $10 billion from Halliburton’s value from its January peak. Although I believe that some share price weakness is understandable, as discussed later in the article, an underperformance of this magnitude isn’t justified. I believe Mr. Market may have overreacted.Halliburton’s poor performance wasn’t due to any operational or financial issues. The company, in fact, has reported an increase in revenues and earnings this year. The company has posted 28.7% increase in revenues to $11.89 billion while it swung from a loss of $4 million to a profit from continuing operations of $555 million in the first six months of this year. The company has posted an increase in revenues and profits from both completion & production and drilling & evaluation segments.Halliburton’s cash flows have also improved significantly as compared to last year. The company generated $1.53 billion of cash flow from operations in the first six months of this year which easily covered capital expenditure of $1.07 billion, leading to free cash flow of $462 million. The free cash flow is the difference between operating cash flow ($1.53Bn) and capital expenditure ($1.03Bn). This year's free cash flow was considerably better than last year when it faced a cash flow shortfall, or negative free cash flow, of $241 million.Halliburton, however, is seeing some signs of weakness in the Permian Basin and it seems like investors’ fear that this could turn into a major headwind. The company talked about this during the latest conference call and the management’s comments may have spooked investors.The Permian Basin, located in the West Texas and New Mexico, is the most prolific oil-producing region in the US. It alone accounts for nearly half of the onshore rigs and a third of the completed wells in the US. Drilling activity at the Permian Basin has remained strong throughout the downturn but the region’s oil producers have pumped so much oil that it has overwhelmed the oil pipelines. Consequently, a supply glut has emerged that has pushed Permian Basin prices more than $10 per barrel below the benchmark. The weakness in prices is already forcing some oil producers to reduce drilling activity and others could follow. Halliburton has also confirmed that this has already started. The company has said that it could experience pricing pressure in some areas. This may have a negative impact on Halliburton’s earnings and margins moving forward.The weakness in the Permian Basin is going to hit a number of US-listed oilfield services companies. The mid-to-small-cap onshore drillers that operate primarily in the US, like Patterson-UTI Energy (PTEN), will likely be the hardest hit. This will also affect the big boys of the industry - Schlumberger and Halliburton. Schlumberger, however, looks well positioned to face a dip in drilling activity at the Permian Basin since it is an international market-focused company that gets a small part of its revenues from North America, as I’ve discussed recently.Halliburton, on the other hand, is a North America-focused company which typically gets a majority of its revenues and earnings from this market. In the first six months of 2018, Halliburton got almost 62% of its total revenues from North America. On top of this, Halliburton's above-mentioned growth was also powered by the North American market. The company has posted 47% increase in revenues from North America to $7.35 billion while its international revenues have grown by just 7% to $4.53 billion.That being said, the problems in the Permian Basin will likely get resolved by the second half of next year. The takeaway constraints will evaporate as some of the major pipelines, like Phillips 66 Partners (PSXP)'s Gray Oak and Plains All American (PAA)'s Cactus II, come online in the second half of 2019. Around 2-3 million barrels per day of pipeline capacity will get deployed at the Permian Basin in the near term, as per my rough estimate. This should ease the takeaway constraints and push the region's prices higher which will fuel an increase in drilling activity.Still, the weakness in the Permian Basin may drag Halliburton’s earnings in the coming quarters. The company’s short-term outlook, therefore, may not look great but I believe investors also shouldn’t lose sight of the big picture.The oilfield services companies are operating in a favorable global business environment which is getting better. Although prices have fallen in the Permian Basin, they’ve remained strong in the rest of the world. The prices of the US benchmark WTI crude and international benchmark Brent crude have risen by more than 10% each this year to $69 and $73 a barrel respectively.The prices have remained much higher than last year, even as key OPEC members and its allies have started to increase production. The strong global economic growth combined with production disruptions in Venezuela and Libya and the looming threat of US sanctions on Iran continues to support prices. Only a handful of OPEC countries can actually grow production since most have little to no spare production capacity. At the same time, global oil production from mature fields continues to decline at a fast pace. A number of energy companies have been saying that just a few major projects are expected to come online in the coming years and the associated oil and gas output won’t be enough to meet the strong demand. The oil and gas producers must increase their exploration and production expenditure significantly in the future in order to meaningfully grow production, particularly in the international markets that have lagged behind the US. That increase in expenditure should fuel the growth of oilfield services companies in the long run.The international markets have started to recognize the need to increase drilling activity and grow exploration and production budgets. Oilfield services companies, including Schlumberger and Baker Hughes (BHGE), have witnessed an uptake in drilling activity and spending levels outside of North America. Halliburton is also seeing this trend and expects an improvement in pricing in the coming quarters. Jeff Miller, Halliburton’s CEO, has said that the company is “better positioned than ever” to capitalize on the international market’s recovery. That’s because, in the previous cycle, Halliburton mainly offered just the wireline services in key international markets but since then, it has significantly grown its portfolio and offers a number of services in all major regions.Remember, Halliburton is not as big of a player outside of North America as Schlumberger but it still gets around 40% of its revenues from international markets. Halliburton has a meaningful presence in a number of key regions, such as the Middle East, and this could come in handy in the short-term.Halliburton has already won some major international contracts, particularly related to the development of unconventional reserves in Saudi Arabia which was the largest unconventional completion contract in Middle East’s history. I think this could open doors to a number of opportunities for Halliburton in the Kingdom which is eager to tap into its shale gas reserves.I believe that in the coming quarters, Halliburton may post strong growth in revenues from international markets. The earnings growth may accelerate in 2019 if we move into the next phase of recovery and pricing improves. Halliburton posted 6%, 4% and 3% increases in revenues from international markets in the second quarter on a sequential basis from Latin America, Europe/CIS/Africa, and the Middle East & Asia regions, respectively. This growth may accelerate in the near future which could soften the blow coming from weakness in the Permian Basin.As mentioned earlier, Halliburton stock has underperformed this year. This has made it one of the cheapest large-cap oilfield services stocks. In terms of EV/EBITDA (fwd.) ratio, the company’s shares are trading at just 9.4x, which makes it cheaper than Schlumberger and Baker Hughes who are priced above 14x, according to data from YCharts. Similarly, in terms of P/E (fwd) ratio, Halliburton is priced at 18x while Schlumberger and Baker Hughes are both priced above 33x. Halliburton stock looks attractive and I believe the weakness could be a buying opportunity. The stock should move higher as a recovery in international markets provide support to Halliburton's earnings in the short-term and a turnaround in the Permian Basin from 2019 lifts its earnings in the long-term.

        We thought this was an extreme over reaction, and dipped into the piggy bank to buy more.
        We think the market will realize that Hally has better days ahead and give it a bid.
        Discussion follows.","They say perception is 90% of reality. Truer words were probably never written, at least in the investing space. Halliburton hit on every metric they told us to measure them by in Q-1, and got dumped by the hedgies like the un-pretty girl at the dance. Hedgie know Hally as a frac story and that's about it. There is more there if you look.It was awful. I mean it's one thing entirely for a stock miss it's projections or consensus estimate, and drop the way Hally did. But, Big Red hit them most of them dead on.There is no justice. So, now what? First, full disclosure, I went long this stock in the high $40s. I was way early in my call. And, early is wrong. The Fluidsdoc has a ""live by the sword, die by the sword"" philosophy in writing.When I am right, I'll brag. When I'm wrong, you'll hear it first from me.That out of the way, let's see if we can pick out some diamonds from the call. Is the investment thesis still intact for this stock at current levels? Or should we sell out and head for our shack in Montana?Let's spud in.What is it the hedgies didn't like about Hally's quarter that they deserted it in droves? Falling back last week to levels not seen since mid 2016. Remember back then? The oilies had flirted with the abyss in Feb, and were just getting used to the idea that tomorrow might still come. Scary days in the oil patch!SOURCEWhat conceivable sin had Big Red committed in Q-2 to knock it back so profoundly? Was it improving revenue and operating income QoQ to $6.1 billion and $789 million respectively? Notes and quotes from Jeff Miller, Hally's CEO on the call.How about their strongest deliverable from Q-1? Completion and Production, which had already grown YoY 100%+. Nope, that area improved against strong competition as well. Hally's commentary there.No great surprise here as Hally is the frac master. D&E was a little less, but still an increase. Revenue increased by 3% while operating income increased 2%.What about Geomarkets? Did they get crushed by the competition and left for dead?North America-International markets?When you go through the earnings call where these quotes were taken, you're not thinking, ""Aha, that's why they tanked."" You're thinking ""Go Big Red"", until you check your ticker bug, and see the stock swooning.Here's a comment from Jeff Miller, Halliburton's CEO that struck me.This only possible from a company that is executing like a champion. Think about it. Margins are near peak margins from 2014, the last great year for the oilfield. I was in the industry then. We were hitting operators with prices increases monthly, in the first half of the year anyway.Miller went on to discuss some weakness in the Marcellus, and Permian basins that are impacting operations today. Now some of this is spin, putting a brave face on a tough situation. My comments follow in italics.Let's get real. The Permian isn't going anywhere. Hundreds of billions of dollars are committed here by some of the world's most experienced energy companies.What is being experienced in the Perm is a temporary capacity constraint that will start diminishing over the next few months and be completely rectified by the middle of next year.This is all truck-trailer equipment. It's on wheels! Halliburton will send it where it is needed.This is good news. Longer laterals means more oil. So Hally gets more pumping time, sells more sand, more slick-water chemicals, etc. The Marcellus has take-off constraints because the production is so high currently, infrastructure hasn't kept up. It will get better.I am willing to give them the benefit of the doubt here. They have been competing against the dozens of other companies providing pressure pumping and growing revenues and margins. Hally is a preferred brand.ESPsHally is more than just a bunch of big pumps. Last quarter they featured their Summit ESP acquisition on the call. How's that coming along? One of the reasons Hally wanted Baker (remember that $3.5 bn debacle) was for their ESP division. They didn't get Baker, so they did the next best thing. They bought Summit. Artificial lift is a big deal. All wells are likely to need it at some point. You can pull it from above, or pump it from down below. Miller opines here.SourceChemistrySo now with the Athlon Solutions business, Hally is basic in a lot of chemistry they've been buying out previously. This is a measure that will control costs and lead to innovation going forward.SourceThis is all about growing the business. I like what is happening here. These are steps Hally should have taken years ago. Too bad they had to go through a failed merger to learn this lesson.Schlumberger, (SLB) has always been the default provider in IOC/NOC markets. That is changing in a couple of key areas. One of which we've discussed internally.Hopefully you recall this item. I wrote an entire article on it. This was a huge win for Hally, that hasn't hit the bottom line yet. They are just ramping up. Here's a link to the older article. ""Earl P. Would Be Proud...""The North Sea is going through a huge resurgence. If there is a place to be gaining share, the NS area is among the best. If you follow the OSD space, you will note this is one of the few areas of strength for them.In our last article on Hally we talked about the CS Neptune marketing agreement they put in place with Tetra Technologies, (TTI). This potentially transformative technology for oil and gas well completions in deep water. I mention this as there is significant work coming for CS Neptune in GoM, and Brazil over the next couple of years.Here's a link to it, as this article would not be complete without its mention. ""Tetra Technologies and Halliburton..."" Give this a read for more information. In it I discuss current technology that most companies are restricted to, and how CS Neptune changes the game and drives the bottom and top line for Tetra.I think this is a realistic expression of the company's prospects. Until the take-off problems are worked through there is going to be softness in North America. Miller closes the call.SourceIn my view there is no justification for last weeks +/- 15% sell off in Big Red. This week it has bounced a bit, as buyers seemingly recognize this one is too cheap. Once again, the company grew earnings over 100% YoY (0.58/sh vs. 0.23), not too shabby!The company projects Q-3 revenues on a par with Q-2 due to some the NA market issues we've discusses. This equates to earnings in the $2.20-2.30/share range for the year. With +/- 875mm shares outstanding the stock is priced at roughly 16X earnings. This compares quite favorably with historical values in this stock and against peers.I used the big drop last week to build on my position.I think Hally is a strong buy at this level, and will reward us for our patience. A small div (0.18.sh is payment for this patience!Hally is not just a North American frac story. That's just the icing on the cake!A last favor.

4189466,33291,2018-07-24T11:12:21-04:00,"Under our investing philosophy, a BAD BEAT is a special situation in which a stock is hammered harder than it deserves, setting up a potential long-or short-term entry point.Halliburton is down 9% on a quarter that we thought was relatively strong.We discuss key trends in operational performance and offer a technical picture that suggests $41 is a key level, which also serves as an entry point for the value-oriented investor.","We are always on the lookout for a BAD BEAT, a special situation in which a stock is hammered harder than it deserves, setting up a potential long-term (or short-term) entry point into a quality equity primed for a bounce. Halliburton (HAL) appears to be setting up for such a situation. This is a strong choice for an oil service stock and is our second choice behind competitor Schlumberger (SLB) long term. We recently were encouraged by Schlumberger's performance and think that Halliburton, much like its competitors in the sector, will benefit longer term from the oil market which has been turning positive as it finds equilibrium.That said, the company just reported earnings, and we were are surprised at the response from the Street to a top-line beat and an in-line bottom line. The Street is interpreting the results as somewhat lackluster relative to consensus expectations, given the strength of the oil sector in recent months. However, we see a 9% decline in share prices on this news as overdone. We know that Halliburton stock has rebounded nicely as oil prices have regained strength, but the stock has pulled back toward support levels today:Source: BAD BEAT InvestingAs you can see in the two-year chart, the stock has given up tremendous gains. With shares at $41, they have approached what our chartist considers a battleground level. Several closes under $41 could be bearish, with shares likely to recede toward the $36-37 level. We see this line as holding, so long as oil prices remain stable. That said, we think this key level will hold, and investors should be looking to establish a position here, even if oil stays in the $60 range. We think a rebound toward $45 is likely based on the chart. That said, let's talk more about the fundamentals.Oil prices have rallied in the last two years. In recent weeks, oil has receded a bit, but price remains strong and at a level where oil service stocks should remain very profitable.WTI crude as an example here has support around $65-66, and we believe this line will hold. If it does not, downside could be ahead for SLB, and we would want to watch the $41 level for HAL stock. Our inclination is toward the upside, as we see oil moving back toward $70. As such, we see short-term upside for HAL from the oil price standpoint alone. Operationally, the company is the healthiest it has been in five years, thanks to extreme fiscal discipline in recent years and with oil prices having rebounded. In short, we are again excited about the name with this recent pullback.We believe that the performance of the name and our expectations moving forward continue to justify a positive outlook on Halliburton.We have discussed in past pieces looking at the oil sector and Halliburton, in particular, that expected a rebound in oil but not this quickly. We were eyeing 2020 as the target year when we would see a regression to the mean in oil prices but were pleased it occurred ahead of this goal. Overall, oil has been looking for equilibrium between the peaks in 2007-2008, to the lows of 2009-2010. We have seen spikes and falls. Ultimately, we think the equilibrium price is in the $80 range. This remains to be seen, however. With this understanding, and oil having been in the $60-70 range for most of Q2, we saw revenue growth coming for the company. Revenues grew to $6.15 billion in the quarter:Source: SEC Filings, graphics by BAD BEAT InvestingThis is an immense return to top-line growth. It is a major testament to how correlated revenues are to the price of oil. Now, as we watched oil prices remain strong in Q2, we of course were expecting strong revenue growth, thanks to the move in oil prices. Our expectations were for $6 billion flat, and the company brought in an additional $150 million over our projections. We should note that consensus estimates were more liberal than our estimates, and Halliburton beat these by $40 million.Overall, we saw growth of 24% from last year. That is stellar, and we anticipate revenue growth to continue, even with oil slightly retreating in recent weeks. There were several pockets of growth to be aware of. North America needs to be highlighted. As we know, this is a growing energy market in the world and, of course, a leading producer and consumer. On a year-to-date basis, Halliburton grew revenues 47% versus last year. The U.S. land rig count has increased 16%. We also want to point out that Completion and Production revenue was $4.2 billion, an increase of $357 million, or 9% from Q1 2018. There were higher completion sales in Europe and Africa, while increased pressure pumping in the United States was noted.We continue to believe that the overall risk is to the upside from here as the rebound in oil is a long overdue reversion toward the mean, even factoring in the recent pullback in prices. If the company can continue its diligent expense management, we see earnings expanding.Keep in mind that as oil prices declined from 2014 forward, Halliburton worked diligently to cut expenses, first by cutting the fat, then by becoming surgical. It was operating at the bare bones levels, turning off rigs, cutting staff, etc. That said, to generate higher revenues, often time more spending is necessary to bring operations online, to fund labor, pay for expansion etc. That said, with revenues rising so sharply, we were not at all surprised to see that spending ticked up from last year as more operations were brought online. Operating expenses were up from last year:Source: SEC Filings, graphics by BAD BEAT InvestingWe were expecting a rise in costs but were looking for $5.3 billion, so the company spent nearly $60 million more than we anticipated at $5.36 billion to generate its operating income of $789 million total. Much of this was likely due to higher-than-expected revenues, though we note expenses were also driven up by increased drilling services and project management activity in the Middle East and India.That said, Halliburton did see similar interest and lower corporate-related expenses. Factoring in both revenues and expenses, our estimates for earnings per share were met.With the action in the stock today, we can only surmise that an in-line quarter is being interpreted as bearish by the Street. We think this is a classic BAD BEAT. Revenues surpassed our expectations, while expenses were also slightly higher as well. The net impact led to earnings that met our expectations and that of analysts but, most importantly, show continued growth:Source: SEC Filings, graphics by BAD BEAT InvestingAdjusted net income came in at $511 million, or $0.58 per diluted share. This is strong growth from the $0.23 taken in during last year's Q2, adjusted for impairment charges. On the whole, earnings were right about what we expected. Nothing to get too excited about, but nothing to be concerned about. A 9% decline is an overreaction.Considering the stock has pulled back this much, coupled with the fact that we interpret the results as mostly good news, we see opportunity. Moreover, there is room for international growth. Of all the commentary in the release from Jeff Miller, President and CEO, one line stood out. He stated in the earnings release (linked in the introduction):This statement is highly bullish when we couple it with the fact that the North American business is remaining solid. Considering today's pullback to $41, the stock is attractive on a valuation basis. This is because we foresee a strong 2018 from the company. With oil prices even stabilizing in the $60 range, we are expecting margin expansion on the back of diligent expense management, and strength especially coming out of North America.With our outlook and our expectations for the year, we remain bullish on the stock for 2018. On the top line, we are still anticipating revenues of $22.8 billion to $24.55 billion under the assumption of oil remaining at present levels or higher. Assuming this growth and managed expenses that expand margins, we are targeting earnings per share of $2.20 to $2.50 (a slight revision down from $2.25-2.55). This prices the stock at just 16.4 times 2018 earnings on the high end. This is attractive, from our viewpoint, especially when we factor in the $0.18 quarterly dividend. With the recent pullback, the annualized yield is 1.6%. While this is not high-yielding, investors will be paid to wait.We remain bullish and think this is a classic BAD BEAT under our philosophy of investing. While oil prices drive the major momentum in this stock and the sector for the most part, we have a rare opportunity to take advantage of a market overreaction that is mispricing the stock, in our opinion. With oil prices moving higher on the long-term chart and stabilizing in the $60 range in the near-term chart, the company should have no issue meeting our expectations.

4189729,101863,2018-07-25T00:20:59-04:00,"Halliburton has significantly underperformed its peers and oil prices.Yesterday's earnings announcement plunged the stock.This article discusses the reasons behind the underperformance, the key near-term risks facing the company, as well as my rating on the stock.","Halliburton Company (HAL) yesterday announced its 2Q18 results:The announced results were in-line with analysts' earnings expectations and beat the average revenue expectation by $40 million.Despite the results meeting expectations, the stock dropped significantly:HAL Price data by YChartsAs of noon on Tuesday, the stock had declined by nearly 10 percent since before the earnings announcement.The following graph compares Halliburton's balance sheet leverage to that of its primary competitor, Schlumberger (SLB):HAL Debt to Assets (Quarterly) data by YChartsHalliburton's balance sheet leverage doubled in late 2015 and early 2016, which has increased the company's risk profile. In addition, its profit margin has struggled to recover with oil market fundamentals:HAL Profit Margin (NYSE:TTM) data by YChartsHalliburton's high balance sheet leverage and negative profit margin have kept investors at bay, leading to stock price underperformance.Investors ""grew worried about demand for the company's oilfields services slowing down in the Permian Basin, a key region for the company,"" but the fact is that the Permian Basin's bottlenecks are only temporary, as a fellow contributor pointed out with the following graph:Beyond the next six to twelve months, the U.S. oil producers, especially in the Permian Basin, will need to participate in the solution to the deepening production declines in Venezuela:I discussed the worrying situation in Venezuela, which is directly relevant to Halliburton investors, in my article: Venezuela: The Key To Oil Prices.The following graph illustrates the persistent rise in oil prices since January of 2016, and the acceleration in July of 2017:WTI Crude Oil Spot Price data by YChartsI expect oil prices to accelerate again in the second half of this year, and headlines are starting to point to the same:The noted geologist and writer, Art Berman, also finds this scenario credible:Finally, a prominent oil hedge fund manager, Pierre Andurand, also agrees:The following graph compares Halliburton to its peers and oil prices:HAL data by YChartsIn the last one-year period, Halliburton has declined by 8 percent, whereas Schlumberger has remained relatively flat, the energy sector has increased by 16 percent, and oil prices have pushed higher by nearly 50 percent.The following table illustrates that analysts on average expect the company's earnings to increase by one-third from $2.38 per share to $3.16 per share:The range in estimates, however, remains high from a low estimate of $2.02 per share to a high estimate of $3.85 per share. The uncertainty in forward estimates, I believe, has capped the stock price from reflecting the fundamental improvement in oil market demand and supply balance.The recent underperformance in Halliburton's stock price, combined with analyst expectations of increasing earnings, the significant improvement in oil market fundamentals, and the potential black swan events due to plunging Venezuela oil production as well as Iran sanctions lead me to rate the company BUY. I will monitor Halliburton's balance sheet leverage and other fundamental developments for my followers and Value Portfolio subscribers."
4189309,92586,2018-07-23T21:20:52-04:00,"There was nothing particularly worrisome about Halliburton's 2Q18 results, yet the stock was down 8% on Monday.
        The selloff seems properly justified by the company's apparent under-performance in a continent that could see slowing growth rates overall.
        I continue to favor an investment in SLB, awaiting to see if Halliburton might prove me overly cautious about an investment in its stock.","Judging by today's stock price reaction alone (down 8%), it would be hard to guess that Halliburton (HAL) delivered a revenue beat and robust 24% YOY top-line growth earlier this morning. Even management's narrative seemed strong enough, at first glance, to at least prevent the bearish reaction from taking place: ""Halliburton is better positioned for the international recovery than it has ever been"", while a strong performing North America segment is shaping up to be ""the largest and fastest growing energy market in the world"".Credit: Industry TrendIt looks like pessimism started to take hold only after the earnings call kicked off (shares had been down a mere 1% ahead of the opening bell) with a discussion about operational bottlenecks in the Permian basin possibly impacting demand for oilfield services in this crucial hydrocarbon-producing region. Interestingly, nothing about the 2Q18 results, press release highlights or historical rig count trends (see chart below illustrating relative strength in the Permian region) seemed to anticipate the potential headwinds.Source: DM Martins Research, using data from Baker Hughes (BHGE)My knee-jerk reaction was to consider the 8% drop in share price an overreaction. Peer Schlumberger (SLB), a key player to which I tend to pay close attention when setting expectations for the sector, seemed quite optimistic about the overall landscape for the oil and gas service industry, speaking of a ""broad-based global activity upturn that is now emerging"". In addition, Halliburton reported margins that have nearly rebounded back to pre-oil bear levels, which I find very encouraging and indicative that post-recovery profitability could exceed my projections.But then I remembered one of the key reasons why I have always prioritized an investment in SLB over HAL. As I argued this time last year, ""if I were to seek exposure to the energy services sector today, I would probably favor SLB as a result of greater geographic diversification that helps to spread out operational risk"". With a whopping 62% of Halliburton's revenues being originated in North America (vs. Schlumberger's 38%), I believe HAL investors can very well get overly sensitive to any perceived deterioration in the O&G exploration business in the continent -- particularly when the headwinds come from the U.S. region in which nearly 50% of the country's rigs currently operate.It probably does not help much that the Permian is Halliburton's home turf, and it looks like the company may have lost seven percentage points of hydraulic fracturing market share between the first and second quarters of the year. This may suggest that the growth slowdown in North America could more severely impact Halliburton than its main competitors, particularly when further rebounding in drilling and production activity is most likely to come from international rather than North America operations.There was nothing particularly worrisome about Halliburton's 2Q18 results. What seems to explain today's stock selloff, justifiably so in my opinion, is the double-whammy impact from (1) growth in activity that is likely to shift from North America to other regions in the world and (2) Halliburton's potential under-performance in its own home continent.Given the recent developments, I reinforce my convictions that, within an unpredictable and volatile sector, playing it safer and better diversifying one's bets across different geographic segments make most sense. Yes, HAL seems to be trading at more enticing multiples (see above), and the recent share price slide (-16% YTD vs. SLB's -5%) could position the stock for a more robust rebound, if or when it happens. But for now, I continue to favor SLB as a higher quality play in energy services, awaiting to see if Halliburton might prove me overly cautious about an investment in its stock."
4187981,104457,2018-07-18T08:19:46-04:00,"USO is up significantly for the year due to robust demand coming from overseas, and long cycle investing being replaced by shorter cycle investing which creates large supply deficits.Volatility may exist with USO and energy companies, but dips should be viewed as a buying opportunity, especially within certain industries in energy.Companies that benefit from higher oil and gas prices are experiencing record production and efficiencies, such as midstream players, services, and drillers, and all should be bought on dips.","United States Oil Fund LP Units (USO) has been in a firm uptrend for the year, despite recent share price weakness.With backwardation in full effect, deficits in crude inventories being reported weekly, breakevens falling monthly (now down to an industry average of about $35), and continuous geopolitical instability to worry about, investors in the energy space have plenty to cheer for. Other positive underpinnings, such as global demand increasing from rapidly growing countries who need to switch to cleaner fuels, such as China, are driving record shale production in the U.S. As a result, fundamentals for crude oil remain strong.Although volatility may exist regularly in USO and commodities, dips should be viewed as buying opportunities in the current environment for North American energy companies, such as midstream players like Energy Transfer Partners (ETP) and MPLX LP (MPLX), services players like Halliburton (HAL) and Hi-Crush Partners (HCLP), and drillers like Chesapeake Energy (CHK) and Continental Resources (CLR), which we will discuss more in-depth below. USO started off the trading week on a sour note as Russia hinted towards a production increase to fill impending supply gaps. But, with shale breakevens falling to an average of $35-$45 industry wide in North America, short cycle investing in shale will remain the preferred method of choice for e&p operators.The chart for USO below certainly reflects the current dynamics unfolding for the shale drilling industry. Prices are up over 50% for the year and the uptrend looks firmly intact, as many areas of support lie beneath current share prices, such as the 50 day moving average, 100 day mavg, 150 day mavg, and, ultimately, the all-important 200 day mavg (black line). Source: E*TRADEThe MACD did just have a bearish cross to the downside. But the RSI is already quite low at 50, indicating that there is not much downside left before the RSI becomes completely oversold at 40, where the ETF has bottomed in times past. Plus, by the time USO share prices become oversold, the 150 day mavg or 200 day mavg should then be in play, where the price action reversed and turned higher, in times past. So, powerful indicators for USO and the energy sector, as a whole, are aligning. Let’s take a closer look at the breadth of the energy sector, starting with midstream players. With oil prices and USO making new highs for the year, seemingly on a regular basis, pipeline operators are getting crushed. This has been a paradox found throughout the sector. Companies like Energy Transfer and MPLX are adding gathering systems and takeaway capacity at a high rate, and volumes being delivered on those systems are hitting all-time records. Energy Transfer Partners, for example, is adding more takeaway and processing capabilities via their Frac V, which is a 120,000 barrels per day fractionating facility that splits natural gas liquids into its five components of ethane, propane, normal butane, isobutene, and natural gasoline (pentane plus). Source: E*TRADEIn addition to Frac V, Frac VI is expected to be in service in the second quarter of 2019. Similar to Frac V, Frac VI is fully contracted under long term agreements. With the success that ETP is having with adding takeaway and fractionation capacity, it is no wonder that the company is yielding such a high dividend, nearly 12% at current levels. Yet, the stock is hovering near all-time lows, for reasons unknown. Investors could say that DAPL was the problem, or that it was unfair rulings by judges that sank their shares. But, this is a disconnect seen widely seen throughout the midstream universe, not just with ETP. MPLX is another company that is addressing widening differentials and limited takeaway capacity by adding more gathering systems to their suite of midstream services, yet their stock remains at depressed levels. MPLX has not had the same headline problems as ETP, either.So, investors must find another reason for why midstream players are suffering. Interest rates rising can affect high yielding dividend stocks, who can take on large amounts of debt to finance operations. But, interest rates are still low on a historical basis. So, without any material reason for the insistent selling in pipeline companies, a dislocation of prices is possibly forming that investors might want to take advantage of. MPLX is the largest processor and fractionator of natural gas liquids in the Marcellus, and they continue to add to their ethane fractionation capacity (about 80,000 barrels a day, which set volume delivery records last quarter) further solidifying MPLX's dominant position in the Northeast. Source: E*TRADEMPLX also continues to grow its position in the Permian Basin by doubling their processing capacity in the Permian through their Argo facility, and they have commenced construction on their Omega plant in Oklahoma, which is the next area of focus for the company since oil and gas activity is growing rapidly there, without the hassle of traffic congestion and bottlenecks seen in the Permian. In addition to having multiple catalysts to drive earnings for the stock, MPLX is currently yielding a 7% dividend but is hovering near all-time lows. As a result, investors looking for a safe yield should consider buying MPLX at these levels. Much like midstream players, services companies in the energy sector have significantly lagged the recent rise in oil prices. It is widely known that costs are higher for services companies when they scale business operations up and down, and this could be the reason for their underperformance. After the investment in new infrastructure and equipment has been made, though, costs should begin to diminish and be replaced, instead, by fixed cost absorption. On top of gaining leverage on more fixed assets in place, transitory factors from last quarter have been reportedly resolved. As a result, investors should have problems poking holes in services players going forward. High-intensity, slick water fracs are changing the energy equation of the world. With short-cycle investments directing most oil & gas activity in 2018, parts suppliers like Halliburton could experience growth again similar to their start-up days. But, Halliburton may be the biggest beneficiary of all services players, since the high-intensity nature of slick water programs degrade parts so quickly. Source: E*TRADEAs investors can see by the chart above, HAL continues to consolidate along the 200 day mavg. Along with that positive development, the MACD also got a cross to the upside recently, which is usually a foreshadow of a breakout. $45 also seems to be solid structural support, and the RSI has plenty of room to run. As a result, King HAL is a buy at these levels on both, short term and long term timeframes. The historical shift from gel fracs to slick water fracs, beneift sand companies like Hi-Crush Partners (HCLP) tremendously, since drillers are using 3-4 times the amount of sand today with slick water fracs, than compared to gel fracs in 2014. HCLP is also sold out of all of its sand, is fully contracted for years out, is gaining fixed costs absorption through unit train capabilities, and pricing only continues to appreciate. Source: E*TRADEThe stock is yielding a nearly 7% dividend at these levels, and trades at under 10x earnings, which is dirt cheap compared to the S&P 500 (SPY), who historically trades between 15x-20x earnings before being labeled as expensive. HCLP is also showing a bullish technical setup, even with share prices hovering near all-time lows, since now Hi-Crush is on the 200 day mavg that is has successfully tested and held more than 5 days in a row. Source: E*TRADEThe stock just doesn’t want to go any lower, perhaps because of the bullish story, or the fact that the company is buying back shares with a $100 million buyback program. For all of these reasons, and more, frac sand players like Hi-Crush should be bought hand-over-fist at current levels. Drillers are trying a multitude of strategies to lower their costs and increase production such as using pad drilling, zipper fracks, longer laterals, experimenting with more sand and spacing strategies, eliminating casing strings, and the list goes on. Much like pipeline companies, Anadarko Petroleum (APC) is switching to a “tankless”’strategy and is now moving their oil directly from the wellhead, underground, through the more than 200 miles of piping strategically laid throughout the Permian, to their state-of-the-art regional oil treating facility. However, premier drillers like Chesapeake and Continental have some completions breakthroughs of their own worth celebrating. CHK saw 11% production growth last quarter, which was attributed to innovations in their completions techniques, such as using pad drilling, longer laterals, and modifying slim hole casing designs (reducing the hole and casing sizes for each hole interval). They are also possibly ramping to a fifth rig in the Powder River Basin due to the strong economics seen in the area. Additional takeaway capacity is being added by midstream players like Williams Company (WMB), which should allow the ramping process to be aided with less growing pains. Source: E*TRADEChesapeake is also trading at a mere 5x earnings, and share prices are hovering near all-time lows while business is expanding rapidly, a constant trend in which investors are beginning to see the irony of. The chart for CHK below looks constructive, though, as the stock is moving up along the 20 day mavg in an orderly fashion. Source: E*TRADEThe MACD did cross to the downside, though, and the RSI is getting overbought, which means that perhaps investors want to start ringing the register on CHK, short term. Long term, this stock still has plenty of upside, as former highs reached by the company reached $30 in the years past. With all of the innovations they are witnessing in their completion programs, $5 per share still appears to be a strong value, long term, despite short term indicators being overheated. Investors should wait for a dip to be 50 day mavg on this one to start a position, if they haven’t done so already. Continental is another best of breed driller that is setting records in the Bakken and Midcon Basins with their completion techniques. CLR believes, for example, that drilling costs in the Midcon can be reduced by as much as $1 million per well through zipper fracs. Less interference between wells, combined with more stimulation (zipper fracs), also allows for shorter drilling times, which saves on costs dramatically. In similar fashion to the way Chesapeake reduced their slim hole casing designs, CLR has found a way to eliminate casing strings, all together, potentially saving hundreds of millions in future drilling programs. Eliminating the use of casing strings also reduces the amount of drilling days on site, further lowering on costs. Source: E*TRADE Similarly to other drillers, but unlike services and midstream players, CLR is getting overheated, and investors may want to think about lightening up in positions short term. Long term, as seen by the chart above, Continental still has room to move higher as former share prices traded around the $80 level, at one point. Old highs can be taken out in this best of breed, high flyer as production is growing at record paces while millions will be saved in the future on their vastly improved completions techniques. In conclusion, USO has been a strong performer YTD, due booming demand coming from overseas, and the current weakness shown should be used as a buying opportunity for selective names in the sector. With companies like Exxon Mobil (XOM) being affected by nearly $500 million in revenue for every one dollar that oil fluctuates, it is not hard to imagine drillers suffering the same fate, even with all of the advances in drilling and completions designs being made. That’s why I prefer the midstream and frac sand players over drillers. But, with oil and gas prices expected to remain strong, the names discussed above have a high probably of outperforming USO and the North American energy sector."
4187548,101450,2018-07-16T14:34:25-04:00,"The past four earnings, Halliburton has averaged revenue growth of 38.4 percent as a result of a recovery in oil prices.Both WTI and Brent spot prices stormed past $70 in Q2 2018 to stoke optimism for further earnings growth.Halliburton's new capital expenditure plan has increased for a second time, to $2 billion in 2018, approaching 2015 levels.","On July 23rd, before the market opens, Halliburton (HAL) kickstarts the week with its earnings report. The oil and gas services company will look to impress by beating expectations in a rising oil price environment. The beat could reverse a two-month downtrend that saw the stock fall from $55 in mid-May to about $45 in mid-July. Investors' eyes will be on management’s outlook for energy commodities in the second quarter with OPEC making moves and on capital expenditure and investment in the energy sector after the tax cuts.From FinvizAs expected, HAL’s earnings history tracks the price of energy commodities. As spot prices have rebounded to around $70 over the past year, HAL’s year-over-year revenue rates have skyrocketed. Over the last four quarters, that year-over-year growth rate averaged 38.4 percent. The EPS numbers reversed as well. On October 19th, 2016, HAL’s EPS was reported at $0.01, and a year later, the EPS grew 42x to $0.42. Analysts expect to see another robust expansion this second quarter, with estimates of EPS growing to $0.59 on higher commodity prices.Those estimates have plenty of optimism to run on with management’s comments in the conference call on the business environment. Based on tender activity in the first quarter, “2018 is on a pace to double 2017 levels,” according to management. Additionally, leadership was chipper about the U.S. environment saying, “activity in the U.S. remains resilient as our customers have a large portfolio of economically viable projects in today’s commodity price environment.”From EIAThe optimism was valid based on the trend in commodities at the time. With the current trend, the optimism should heighten. Despite a slight drop in natural gas prices in the second quarter (most likely due to seasonality), all signs point to heightened activity in HAL’s key markets. Baker Hughes (BHGE) also points to this possibility with rig counts at near-tern highs. Of course, all this optimism contradicts the current trend in trading of HAL suggesting something should change fundamentally or technically.Geographically, most of the strength came from North America which saw revenue grow by 58 percent in the last quarter. Europe was the next largest at 19 percent growth, and Latin America and the Middle East followed at -6 percent and 7 percent. As production in the North Sea and the North American oilfields strengthens, those regions will continue to be the sources of growth for HAL through the rest of 2018. HAL may also see a nice bump in the two lagging regions, Latin America and the Middle East, as OPEC members start to revamp their production. However, political risk in countries like Libya and Venezuela still exist as risks.From WSJTo encourage the continuation of robust expansion, HAL plans on adding almost $700 million of new capital expenditures in 2018 over 2017. In the first quarter, capital expenditures reached $501 million as a plan for $2 billion was introduced because “customer demand supports this investment.” This approaches the capital spending seen in 2015 when HAL first began cutting back due to the major slump in oil prices. However, this $2 billion plan will benefit from three years of improvements in efficiency, consolidation, and technological advancements in the oil and gas services market which should enable HAL to make better return on its investments.As an investor, macroeconomic forces suggest that investing in the oil and gas services industry is an easy play. The challenge is in choosing the right stock to outperform its peers in a hot market. The three major players in the space are Schlumberger (SLB), Halliburton, and Baker Hughes.Earnings for companies in the energy sector this quarter have the potential to move their companies in either direction. According to FactSet, the energy sector is expected to see earnings growth of 145.3 percent this quarter. Oil and gas services specifically are expected to grow earnings by 69 percent. While the numbers might not be as high for HAL (because of its large market cap), investors will require impressive top- and bottom-line numbers for a reversal to be sparked. HAL has good prospects but investors should wait until it gets the signal from good fundamental numbers to buy into a reversal."
4184409,103610,2018-06-28T03:32:35-04:00,"Last week OPEC rattled the energy markets. The final statement called them somewhat. We were glad we'd loaded up on beaten down oil stocks earlier in the week.
        This week the winds of ""Trade War"" rattled Mr. Market. We think these fears are way over blown.
        It was a lively week and topics as diverse as Halliburton, Shell, BP, and why there won't be a trade war were discussed.
        A topic overview on each follows.","Oil was the focus of the energy markets last week as OPEC met to haggle over the existing production agreement, that had taken about 1.8 mm barrels of the market. It was clear going in that some increase was in the offing.Evidently it was nip and tuck to the end, but on Friday, June 25th an agreement was announced that calmed market fears and oil shot up as a result. The announcement was for a million barrels of reduction in the agreed cut would be added...as market needs dictated. So we all slept well over the weekend.By Monday, the markets were roiled once again as the specter of trade wars was sharply in the minds of the hedge fund managers, as they dove for cover and in so doing, unloaded big positions in good stocks to capture profits as the quarter nears a close. Inexplicably energy stocks were hit especially hard, causing some to question the investability of the energy space.Source Hedgies diving for cover on Friday.By Tuesday things were looking up for the gooey black stuff as the API announced a massive draw of over 9 mm bbls in crude stocks.Members of the DDR had been told beforehand this was likely so they wouldn't be subjected to the silly temptations to dump perfectly good energy stocks. We try to be smarter than the Hedgies here at the DDR.Source By Tuesday the Penguins were back on the ice buying up the stuff they'd sold on Friday.The Daily Drilling Report (NYSE:DDR) has a comprehensive energy thesis that is discussed in detail internally with members. The upshot of this thesis is that is oil is headed higher in the near term.Oil in tankers???At the DDR we look at all angles. Up and down. Bull and Bear. Admittedly we like the bull stuff better. Nonetheless an article caught our eye that had us scratching the old noggin initially. And, then a light dawned; we're good at this stuff after all. That being, with all the light oil being produced in the U.S. these days, and only recently eligible for export for the past couple of years, it is reasonable to suppose that perhaps we are taking markets from Nigeria. It was confirmed that the oil Nigeria was having difficulty unloading was in light oil of the Akpo and Agbami grades.We decided as a result there was no impairment to the storage aspect of the DDR's energy thesis, and moved on.HalliburtonOne of the big topics of discussion in the DDR in the last week was Halliburton, (HAL). Since Hally fell below $50 the DDR had been looking hard for an entry point. We took one at $48 a couple of weeks ago, and as is so often the case, it kept falling. Not a problem, we left money in the budget to buy more if it hit a preset lower level.Hally is taking its core competency abroad and in a little noticed bulletin last week announced it had inked a deal with the Saudis to become the sole source fracker for the Kingdom for two years guaranteed, and possible bonus year. We discussed the Saudi interest in developing their unconventional resources in a detailed article, ""Earl P. Would Be Proud..""The upshot of all of this is a potentially huge deal for Big Red. And, one that's not currently priced into the stock. We think significant upside remains for Hally.Whoa-PECTo say that the party in Vienna last week dominated the business news and chat shows, really doesn't do it justice. It was all that mattered for the price of our favorite goop. Once again the hedgies sold off everything oil in advance the meeting. We took a position in an article, ""Does OPEC Kill The Goose?"" that turned out to be spot-on as to announcement of a 1-million bbl reduction in the cut.The essence of this article was that the Saudis to appease President Trump would schmooze the Russians into just filling the gaps that would be left by Venezuela, and Iran (as their oil becomes off-limits due to American sanctions), and those OPEC members who for various reasons simply can't maintain, let alone increase their production. That's pretty much what happened.Frack School 101We like Carbo Ceramics, (CRR) for growth in deep water. This has been the subject of a couple of articles in the past where we discussed the technology moat that CRR has in its ceramic proppant, Kryptosphere. Carbo was also featured in a free article done on Shell's likely completion scenarios for the Appomattox project entitled, ""Shell Fracs The Norphlet...""In an article dedicated to the computed architecture CRR deploys in support of their proppant products, we delved deeply into the science of creating fractures in the deep underground. You might be surprised at all the questions you have to answer before you show up on location with pumps!SourceAt the DDR we think the more information you have about something, the better your decision making will be. That was the spirit of this article.The winds of trade war and their effects on Shell and BPThe next topic that rose to the top of the article pile was the fiery rhetoric going back and forth on trade. Monday, two of the stalwart members of the Daily Drilling Reports Oilfield All-Stars, Shell, (RDS.A, RDS.B) and BP, (BP), just got hammered. Was it time to bail? We'd made quite a bit of money. No one ever got hurt taking a profit. Some discussion was called for and we took a macro approach in an article entitled, ""Do The Winds Of Trade War Make Shell And BP Any Less Desirable?Demographics is something that is seldom discussed in financial articles dedicated to energy topics. We rectified that in the article mentioned above, discussing how China's half a billion strong baby boomer class are remaking the country, and some actions the government must take to accommodate this retiring cohort. A cohort that has been producing into their economy for the past 40 years, and now will become pure, and well-heeled consumers. China faces the same challenges that the U.S. does, magnified 10X.In this context we concluded the trade war talk is mostly posturing and rhetoric, and will have no last effects on the markets.Finally, we concluded that of course Shell and BP are still sound investments, and have rallied strongly over the last couple of days. This is a topic that will be revisited soon from an NGL angle. The Chinese can't get enough of the stuff. Guess who is the world's low cost producer? You got it. Us.Hydrocarbon sourced energy is going to be the main driver of the world's economies for the foreseeable future. We are in the process of moving from an era of surplus to one of potential shortages of this precious commodity. Our energy thesis is strongly intact, and we feel it is more likely than not oil and gas prices will move higher this year.In that scenario, we think investing in energy related stocks is a good way to build our retirement portfolios as this era unfolds. Even though many of these stocks have had strong runs, there is still upside potential in many of them.Discovering the hidden gems there-in is our focus going forward.The Halliburton and Carbo Ceramics articles will come to the free side soon. If you're interested in either of these two companies, or would just like a look behind the scene of fracking, please look for them!Disclaimer: I am not an accountant or CPA.

4167286,31441,2018-04-29T03:03:39-04:00,"HAL's Q1 revenue was off 3% sequentially.Latin America was a major headwind, while North America could be peaking.Without a strong international presence or deepwater presence, where will the next catalyst come from?HAL remains a sell.","Venezuela President Nicolas MaduroHalliburton (HAL) reported revenue of $5.74 billion and EPS of $0.41. The company missed on revenue by $10 million. The stock has been flat since earnings were released. Below are my takeaways on the quarter:Halliburton and Baker Hughes, A GE Company (BHGE) are the kings of North America land drilling. North America was the runt of the oil services segment shortly after oil prices diverged to the downside in the second half of 2014. Over the past 18 months, the segment has been white hot. That has been good for Halliburton which receives over 60% of its revenue from the region. Cash flows from the segment also helped the company repair its balance sheet after it incurred fees from its failed merger with Baker Hughes. This quarter the company's total revenue fell 3% sequentially, while North America was up 3%.During the quarter, the North America rig oil-directed rig count increased 203 rigs, or 27% Y/Y. Improvement in the average rig count drove completions higher. Halliburton experienced increased activity throughout the North America land sector across product lines, particularly in pressure pumping and artificial lift. The rig count continued to improve, yet it only drove revenue up by single digits sequentially. When happens if the sector stalls?Halliburton has always been dominant in North America, but having over 60% of its revenue in the sector could be a risk. Over the past few years, the company has increased its market share in the region. If the sector turns down, it may have to take share from others in order to keep revenue and earnings from falling. That does not bode well for lesser-capitalized firms.Halliburton's international revenues were in the doldrums this quarter. Total international revenue outside was $2.2 billion, down 12% sequentially. In the Middle East and Asia, modest increases in activity were offset by pricing pressure. Seasonality in Europe, Africa, CIS caused revenue from the region to fall 8%. Meanwhile, Latin America was a major drag. I suspected the region could create headwinds after Schlumberger (SLB) reported a double-digit decline in Latin America in Q1.Halliburton's revenue from Latin America was off 26% Q/Q. The low light was a $265 million write-off of assets related to the Venezuela operations:Schlumberger has curtailed its operations in Venezuela due to state-owned PDVSA's inability to pay its vendors in a timely manner. The country could become a headwind for Halliburton as well. Latin America represents only 8% of Halliburton's total revenue. However, Halliburton may need to rely on other catalysts in case North America stalls. For now, international markets likely will not be it.Halliburton is dominant in North America, while Schlumberger is considered stronger than Halliburton in international markets. Schlumberger also has a presence in the deepwater segment via its acquisition of Cameron International. Cameron represents about 17% of Schlumberger's total revenue. GE's (GE) Oil & Gas brought deepwater operations to the table when it merged with Baker Hughes; deepwater could now be a hedge for Baker Hughes, A GE Company if North America turns down. The question remains, ""Will Halliburton seek to acquire assets in the deepwater market to round out its product offerings?"" Deepwater may not rebound unless oil prices remain above $70 for a sustainable period. If it does bounce back, then Halliburton could be found wanting.HAL trades at 13.9x trailing EBITDA. The upside in North America may have already been achieved. I rate HAL a sell."
4183263,103610,2018-06-22T01:57:00-04:00,Around the end of next year Shell will begin completions on the Appomattox project.We take a look at a likely scenario for this activity based on similar projects in the Deepwater GoM.We also speculate on the strongest candidates to receive certain aspects of this work.,"A beautiful sight below, don't you think? When I look at that behemoth below, I think of massive amount of technology that it represents. To sit above a field of oil and gas, and another tens of thousands of feet of sediments, and extract them at a profit! It's not exactly on a par with going to the moon, but it's pretty darn near.Source The Appomattox hull and topsides leaves Ingleside, for its ultimate mooring spot in the Eastern GoM.I think of all the hundreds of my fellow oilies who will have well paid work, as a result. As a matter of fact, if you add in all the subs, and contractors...literally thousands of people have a chicken in their pot tonight, thanks to this hunk of iron and light bulbs floating out to sea.Source Artistic representation of the Appomattox host and subsea drill centers.When Shell, (RDS.A, RDS.B) and partner Nexen (CEO) gave the final green light to this project back in 2015, they set off a chain of events that will finally produce oil and gas in 2020. That is produce oil and gas from the Norphlet reservoir in Deepwater, something no one else is doing at present.How we got here was discussed in a previous article, ""Shell Makes A Big Bet..."" It might be worth giving it a read if you missed it. I received a lot of nice comments for the technical detail that formed the foundation of this article. That said, we'll move along.In this article we are going to take a look at what I believe will be the most likely completion scenario for the wells in this project. I will also name some of the companies who may be called upon to provide equipment and materials to Shell when they enter the completion phase.In order to stuff a bunch of fancy hardware down there, we are going to need to make (drill) the hole. This is typically done in sections according to the geology of the formations. The actual design has traditionally varied from well to well and operator to operator. Shell has moved away from the bespoke approach and standardized their casing designs for Appomattox, to save money. It's not necessary for this article to have Shell's exact casing design,(although it would have been nice). The typical design proposed in the graphic taken from an article published by Halliburton, (HAL), last year serves our purpose. So the well, when it is handed over to the Completion Team, will very likely bear a strong resemblance to the schematic you see below.SourceEnough on drilling, for now. I am a completions guy!I am going to go out on a limb and suggest that Shell will install a series of Cased Hole Frac Packs in the Norphlet wells. Frac packing has been the dominant completion style in the GoM for about twenty (20) years now. Frac packing injects huge amounts of proppant into the reservoir, increasing the permeability thousands of times and making it easier for hydrocarbons to flow into the bore hole.What does a Cased Hole Frac Pack (CHFP) entail, you may ask. Good question. First, the well is drilled through the productive interval and then a final string of casing is run and cemented as shown in the graphic above.The well is now ready for completion. After a well bore cleanup to get rid of any residual mud film, and to scrape packer setting areas, a perforating string (guns) is run to re-connect the hole with the reservoir. The guns are then withdrawn-VERY CAREFULLY, we have a live well now! (Coming out of the hole after perforating is a big deal, particularly on a high rate gas well. If you go too fast and swab in gas, you may have to fight a kick for days.) A series of packers and screens are then run to stabilize the well bore and isolate zones of production. Once these are in place the well is frac packed.In the last few years there has been a step-change improvement in this technology that save a number of trips in the hole, in wells where you are going to treat several zones. Trips are the running and removal of drill pipe and tools in the well. A trip from +/-30,000' feet will take more than a day. On a Deepwater rig, that's big dollars just yo-yoing pipe.Source: Halliburton presentionThe illustration above is probably a little abstract for the casual reader. I'll try and help. You can see in the graphic above that once you are in the well with the completion hardware (The shifting tool, packer, screens and isolation packers), the treatments can be placed across each selected interval. Once one zone is packed, the tool allows the treating tool to be placed across the next interval without a separate trip out of the well first. That's the big deal here as we have discussed above. Every time you trip out of the well, you are increasing the mechanical risk, and spending rig time. So this improved method of placing a multi-zone frac is a huge improvement over the previous stack-pack technologies. Hope this is helpful. It is worth mentioning that all of this equipment, the wetted parts manufactured out high strength chrome that resists the corrosive effects of acid gases like carbon dioxide, and hydrogen sulfide, are worth several million dollars per well.SourceSourceAbove we see a modeled representation of a stimulation treatment in the left side graph. On the right is the job as pumped. In this job a proppant known as Carbo HSP was the media pumped. Carbo has since replaced this designed with the Kryptosphere proppant mentioned below.Multi-zone frac packs enable the treating of several zones in the same trip, saving the time it would take tripping with the older style completion equipment to pick up the upper zone tools.Source Shown is Halliburton's Stim Star IV stimulation vessel. This boat carries the proppant and has the pumps that will fracture the rock thousands of feet below the mud line (BML).Halliburton, (HAL), first developed and field tested this type of completion on Chevron's, (CVX) Jack, St Malo projects. Chevron was going to install completions in the Lower Tertiary formation- a hot, high pressure sand stone reservoir, much like what Shell expects to find in the Jurassic Norphlet, and needed to minimize the number of trips in the well to control cost. In fact controlling this cost led to rig time savings of about $20 mm/well.SourceGiven Halliburton's experience installing these extreme environment completions in the GoM, I am giving them an edge over Baker Hughes, (BHGE), and Schlumberger, (SLB). This is only part of the reason. Shell and Halliburton have a long history of working together in this area. On the many projects I worked for Shell in my active career, I cannot think of a single instance where Halliburton did not provide the lower completion equipment and the pumping. The two companies have such an extensive relationship that in 2016, Halliburton was awarded Shell's Global Wells Supplier award.It's about more than the equipment. It's about people. The Shell engineers working this highly complex, high risk project need to have confidence in the people supplying them with critical services. They need to know that the people Hally has involved in this project are the best of the best. An accident here for any reason could have disastrous ramifications. Shell is not going to 'get to know' anyone on Appomattox. They will take the best team along, and my bet is its going to be Halliburton. It is a big reason I am long this stock, and will accumulate more in the low 40's.I have no doubt that when the frac packs are pumped, the proppant used to hold the fractured rock open will be Carbo Ceramics, high spec proppant, Kryptosphere. Take a look at the spec sheet below, or better yet, click the link and go to the Carbo site for a complete read. Ceramics are it when it comes to resisting the compressive forces at 28,000' BML. Also note the sphericity of the ceramic beads. The rock itself, is tightly compacted as the earlier articles thin-sections showed. The permeability is fairly low, in the 150 millidarcy range. Injecting millions of pounds of Kryptosphere into the fracture is going to create a highly permeable conduit back to the well bore. This is what is needed to assist the maximum amounts of oil and gas to flow toward the well bore.SourceThe upcoming work on Appomattox is the primary reason I am long this stock. It's now selling off a bit, after a heroic run to $11.38 over the previous couple of months.SOURCEThe stock has been selling off after a recent ramp above $11.00 that was basically a 'melt up' along with other oilfield issues. I don't expect it will revisit the lows of Mar/Apr, unless the OPEC announcement tanks the oil market. The fundamentals for the company are improving as you can see below. The worst of the downturn is behind them.SourceThere are two main risks for these stocks at the present juncture, as relates to the work discussed in this article.1. Sentiment has been shifting toward Deepwater work recently as evidenced by the run up in the OSD stocks, Ensco, (ESV), Transocean, (RIG). This is driven by the stability of the oil price over the last six months. This stability over $60.00 is primarily what's led to this. The OSD stocks are a pure play on Deepwater. If the oil price were to drop below $60.00/bbl for a any significant time, both Halliburton, and Carbo could be adversely affected.2. If Shell were to experience any delays in the Appomattox development, like the host sinks or is blown away in a hurricane, both stocks could be adversely affected.Halliburton has been selling off in the face of good news (as measured by recent press releases. I think this presents an opportunity to own this stock at a good price. If the North American frac activity (in which Halliburton is a major player) continues, and I am right about their being the lower completions provider for Appomattox, this stock could run into the high $60s, in the next year or so. It has already seen the high fifties, so this isn't a huge stretch. In a real Deepwater revival, where other operators start sanctioning Deepwater work, Hally could see the upper eighties.Carbo is a pure Deepwater play in my estimation. This is true despite their nascent attempts to diversify. At one time, this stock was $168.00 share. I am not expecting this peak to be revisited anytime soon, it should be mentioned. I think CRR is a decent two-bagger prospect at current levels. Ceramic proppant has good margins. It's the best for its application, deep, hot, high pressure wells. But, if no one is drilling them, all that beautiful proppant sits on the shelf. Shale wells typically don't need proppant of this caliber. I am in Carbo at these levels for the long haul. I am not going to trade it. If it continues to drop, I will increase my position.Disclaimer: I am not an accountant or CPA. This article is intended to provide information to interested parties.

4181651,104457,2018-06-14T11:11:16-04:00,"A switch to higher-intensity slick water fracs is causing more wear and tear on equipment. Halliburton is a prime beneficiary of this trend.HAL's financials are strong. Despite facing supply chain headwinds and bottlenecks in the first half of 2018, earnings should become less volatile.Halliburton's chart is flashing a serious buy signal, and is offering an attractive entry point for long investors.","High-intensity, slick water fracs are changing the energy equation of the world. With short-cycle investments directing most oil & gas activity in 2018, parts suppliers like Halliburton (HAL) could experience growth again similar to their start-up days. Institutional investors are usually anticipatory of such powerful dynamics and get in before the little guy can. However, I believe HAL has powerful catalysts working in its favor that institutional investors are overlooking, such as drillers choosing to pursue short cycle operations, pumpers switching to slick water fracs, financial conditions improving from alleviated supply chain restraints and rail issues, and technical indicators flashing buy signals on the 200 day moving average.In other words, the stars are aligning for Halliburton, who is providing, potentially, an opportunity of a lifetime for long investors. I have already written about the historical shift from gel fracs to slick water fracs, and how sand companies like Hi-Crush Partners (HCLP) benefit, since drillers are using 3-4 times the amount of sand today, compared to 2014. But, Halliburton may be the biggest beneficiary of all, since the high-intensity nature of slick water programs degrade parts so quickly.In fact, HAL stated that for every new build of horsepower that comes on, only 50% translates into new crews. Or, as new horsepower comes online, half is being used just to replace old equipment or crews already in the field. So, wear and tear on parts and horsepower is very real problem for drillers, and new builds won’t even be able to keep pace with the extreme rate of degradation seen from slick water jobs. This mega trend will play right into the hands of Halliburton.International activity is on the rise, too. Argentina is seeing record production and stage counts in the Vaca Muerta shale basin, and the Middle East and Asia are seeing increases in completions activity, too. Mexico and Brazil are auctioning blocks off as well, and will only drive future revenues for Halliburton. In addition to having powerful catalysts, Halliburton’s financial condition is strong. Revenues for the quarter were $5.7 billion, with net income coming in at $619 million. This represents a year-over-year increase of 34%, and over 200%, respectively. These results were primarily driven by increased completion and production activity in North America, where operating income tripled to $500 million.Source: E-TradeInternational revenues for completions were strong as well, particularly in Argentina and the Middle East. Latin America, Mexico, and Venezuela, however, offset some of this strength. Drilling revenue also increased 15%, showing drillers willingness to add to DUCs, not just complete current drilled but uncompleted wells. HAL’s balance sheet also shows that the company is in heathy financial condition, with assets just under twice more than liabilities. The company is coming out of one of the worst commodity-price downturns in history, so this is not alarming to see, as long as revenues and net income are expected to grow (which they are).Source: E-Trade CapEx of $2 billion appears high. But, with revenues of over $5 billion quarterly, and operating income set to rise since rail and supply chain issues are in the rear view mirror, HAL should have no problem spending within cash flow from future operators. Cash flow from operations during the first quarter was $572 million with capital expenditures of $501 million, proving HAL can spend within cash flow.Source: E-TradeWhile revenues and cash flow have been strong for Halliburton, net income has been a bit bumpy. This inconsistency in net income seen in the last few quarters is primarily attributed to rail issues, supply chain constraints, and poor weather which are, again, largely transitory issues for HAL. Along with game-changing catalysts and improving financial conditions, Halliburton’s one-year chart (below) is setting up for a multi-year bull run. The stock is trading at just under $50 a share, and is perched on the all-important 200 day moving average (black line). Source: E-TradeAlong with being on the 200 day mavg, HAL’s RSI is oversold at 40, increasing the odds of a bounce up to the 100 day mavg (brown line at around $50). If HAL’s stock can then hold $50 a share for a few days, the nine day mavg would have a chance to loop sideways and press into the 200 day mavg, forming strong support. A golden cross of the 9 day mavg through the 20 day mavg, subsequently, would be the next key development to watch for HAL. HAL’s one-year chart is bullish, and so is a max-timeframe chart. Formally trading at $70, HAL has almost 50% upside from current levels at $50 a share. Source: E-Trade HAL’s stock on a max-time frame is also showing a golden cross, with the 9 day mavg crossing up through the 50 day mavg. When a golden cross sets up on both time frames like this, a powerful move to the upside is probable. Analysts seem to agree that HAL is primed for a move higher. The low target of $54 implies great value, as the stock is trading below $50 a share; while the high target of $79 implies more than 65% upside. Source: E-Trade So, when a stock is trading below its low target, and yet has a high target of over 65%, a price dislocation could be occurring, presenting a serious buying opportunity for long investors. Halliburton has risks to their story that could obviously derail their future performance, such as rising interest rates, inflation from an overheating economy, consumer demand softening for petroleum products, governments shakeups in foreign economies, and scaling business activity up and down quickly, which is why I like frac sand players as an alternative to traditional oil and gas investments.A large portion of Halliburton’s capital expenditures will be spent on R&D and new product lines, so there’s always a risk to executing such endeavors. There are some promising products in HAL’s pipeline to be excited about, though, such as ICRUISE, which drives down drilling times with improved rotary steering technology, and EARTHSTAR, a new software platform which has “comprehensive mapping abilities” that could rival Carbo’s (CRR) fracking software.HAL did mention, though, that short cycle drilling reduces the risks of boom-bust times, which has affected the oil & gas sector for decades. The shift in CapEx allocation to shorter cycle plays are due to the returns and lower risk profile that North American shale provides to e&p operators. As a result, more consistent earnings growth, over longer periods of time, should be seen from energy companies like HAL, and drive more institutional investment towards the space. The stars are aligning, indeed, for Halliburton. Having major catalysts working in its favor, such as a shift to worldwide short cycle drilling, and higher-intensity slick water jobs, will be driving record earnings for Halliburton. In addition to short cycle drilling driving historical earnings, since HAL is trading below analyst targets, is sitting on the 200 day moving average, and has put their rail and supply chain issues behind them, investors should strongly consider going long HAL anywhere under $50."

We recently were encouraged by the latter's performance, and think that Halliburton, much like it competitors in the sector, will benefit longer-term from the oil market which has been turning positive.That said, the company just reported earnings and we were are surprised at the somewhat lackluster results relative to consensus expectations given the strength of the oil sector in recent months but have few complaints since results also did not disappoint. We know that Halliburton stock has rebounded nicely as oil prices have regained strength, but the stock has pulled back in recent weeks:Source: Quad 7 Capital, BAD BEAT InvestingIn our estimation, the company is the healthiest it has been in five years thanks to extreme fiscal discipline in recent years operationally and with oil futures at multi-year highs. In short, we are again excited about the name especially as it looks to dip under $50 a share.It is our thesis that the performance of the name and our expectations moving forward continue to justify a positive outlook on Halliburton.As we had alluded to in past pieces in 2017 looking at the oil sector and Haliburton in particular, we expected a rebound in oil but not this quickly. We were eying 2020 as the target year when we would see a regression to the mean in oil prices. We are happy to have been wrong on this front as the rebound in oil prices is well ahead of our expectations.We had anticipated a rebound in oil prices would provide a future bounce to revenues, but the growth returned much sooner than anticipated. That said, revenues grew to $5.74 billion in the quarter:Source: SEC FilingsThis is an immense return to top line growth. It is a major testament to how correlated revenues are to the price of oil. Now, as we watched oil prices remain strong in Q1, we of course were expecting strong revenue growth thanks to the move in oil prices. Our estimates were for $5.7 billion, and the company brought in an additional $40 million over our projections. We should note that consensus estimates were more liberal than our estimates, and Halliburton just missed these by $10 million.Still, we saw growth of 34.1% from last year. That is stellar, and we anticipate revenue growth to continue. We continue to believe that the overall risk is to the upside from here as the rebound in oil is a long overdue reversion toward the mean. What do we mean? Well prices are seeking equilibrium from the massive run-up in 2008, to the recent weakness in the Great Recession, and the sell-off in 2014-2016. If the company can continue its diligent expense management, we see earnings expanding.We want to remind you that as oil prices declined from 2014 forward, Halliburton worked meticulously to cut expenses to the bare bones. That said, to generate higher revenues, often time more spending is necessary to bring operations on line, to fund labor, pay for expansion etc. That said, with revenues rising so sharply we were not at all surprised to see that spending ticked up from last year as more operations were brought on line. Costs of revenues were up from last year:Source: SEC FilingsWe were expecting a rise in costs but were looking for $5.2 billion, so the company spent nearly $186 million more than we anticipated at $5.39 billion to generate its operating income of $354 million total.That said, Halliburton did see lower interest and nearly flat corporate related expenses. One item that weighed on GAAP results was the pre-tax impairment charge of $265 million related to a write-down of its remaining investment in Venezuela, consisting of receivables, fixed assets, inventory and other assets. That weighed on net income overall. Still, the higher than expected operating expenses led to earnings that met consensus, but were pretty lackluster overall.Revenues surpassed our expectations while expenses were also slightly higher as well. The net impact led to earnings that met our expectations and that of analysts, but most importantly show continued growth:Source: SEC FilingsAdjusted net income excluded the aforementioned impairments and other charges related to the write-down of all of the company's remaining investment in Venezuela. It came in at $358 million, or $0.41 per diluted share.This is strong growth from the $0.04 taken in during last year's Q1, but do keep in mind this was due to the company paying off massive amounts of debt last year. On the whole, earnings were right about what we expected. Nothing to get too excited about, but nothing to be concerned about.Considering the stock has pulled back, we interpret the results as mostly good news, because oil prices have improved in the last two months, and we see the strength coming into Q2. Moreover, there is room for international growth. Of all the commentary in the released from Jeff Miller, President and CEO, one line stood out. He stated in the earnings release (linked in the introduction):This statement is highly bullish when we couple it with the fact that the North American business is remaining solid.We continue to expect a strong 2018 from the company. With oil prices rising, we will be closely watching expenses. With rising oil prices we are expecting margin expansion on the back of higher revenues. With our outlook and our expectations for the year we remain bullish on the stock for 2018. On the top line, we are still anticipating revenues of $23.0 billion to $24.75 billion under the assumption of oil remaining at present levels or higher. Assuming this growth and managed expenses that expand margins, we are targeting earnings per share of $2.25 to $2.55 (a slight revision down from $2.25-$2.60).We remain bullish and rate Halliburton a buy under $50. While oil prices drive the momentum in this stock and the sector for the most part, with oil prices moving higher, the company and the stock will continue to do well, so long as expenses are managed. We urge investors to keep an eye on operating margins as we believe they should expand in Q2.

The company is massively exploiting the current upswing and well positioned to deliver more shareholder value in 2018 by optimizing efficiency and growing sales. Source: Halliburton One of the many reasons to read earnings transcripts or to listen to earnings calls from mega corporations like Halliburton is to get a better view as to how managers are seeing the current environment and future of their industry. Most of my readers know that I am mainly focusing on leading indicators to build a top-down model to predict certain industries and commodities. By doing so you get a view of how industries are performing and expected to perform going into the future. That said, I try to find evidence of my own findings in the earnings calls from companies that are big enough to feel trends in their fields of business compared to small companies that are mainly focused on niche markets or to stay solvent until they get a foot in the market. Before I go any further and discuss the company's comments, and with the things I just said in mind, let me quickly give my own comments.I have been bullish on oil for quite some time now. My bullish view is that a weakening dollar, strong economic growth and dwindling inventories will push crude oil much higher. The Dallas energy survey from the fourth quarter of 2017 showed a few very interesting comments. Oil companies saw prices above $60 as a reason to hike production further while many companies expected further cost inflation and equipment shortage to be a big topic going into 2018. Halliburton's CEO Jeff Miller commented that oil and gas were on the road of recovery in 2017 while 2018 is shaping up to be a good year thanks to rising commodities, North American unconventional activities and international markets that are coming to life. On top of that, the company is working on three levers to achieve normalized margins. The first one is pricing. Halliburton has mentioned massive cost inflation due to higher commodity prices and expensive fracking sand. That's why the company is going to use the current environment of growth acceleration to hike prices. Lever two builds on the first point. Halliburton is eager to improve utilization by lending to customers that work as efficiently as possible. By doing so, Halliburton will achieve an overall higher utilization rate. The third point is something that can be witnessed throughout the entire industry. Halliburton is implementing new technologies to reduce costs and streamline efficiency. In their earnings call, they mentioned Snapshot, which allows the company to assess every piece of equipment at every moment of the day. Halliburton increased its sales by 30% in the full year of 2017 to almost $21 billion. Operating income comes in at $2 billion. Completion and production outperformed with 47% revenue growth in the full year and 67.7% in the fourth quarter. Drilling & evaluation grew 7.7% in the full year with 21.8% in the fourth quarter. Total revenue grew 47.7% in the fourth quarter. Halliburton gave the company's ability to recognize a changing market before everyone else and its pricing model as factors that provided these strong results. HAL data by YChartsThe company also mentioned its advanced portfolio of top tier drilling service solutions like completion tools, drilling fluids, drill bits and software. Cash wise, we learned that Halliburton generated more than $2.5 billion in operating cash flow which was used to retire $1.4 billion in debt. Total capital expenditures in 2017 came in at $1.4 billion which was $100 million below total amortization and depreciation. In 2018, we should see capex to be fairly equal to amortization and depreciation according to CFO Chris Weber. On top of that the company mentioned to focus on further debt retirement, new acquisitions and organic growth projects to spend its cash flow on. Moreover, the new tax plan under President Trump will lower Halliburton's effective tax rate from the high-20s to the 21-23% range. Halliburton is currently trading at 232 times the earnings of the last 12 months. Does this mean the stock is expensive? Absolutely not. If you look at next year's expected earnings you get the price down to 17.5 times earnings. Add to that the amazing position Halliburton is in to fully exploit the current oil bull market. The company will further enhance margins through higher utilization, higher prices and advanced technology while also adding new supply to the market to cover an even bigger marketshare. That being said, I expect the stock to reach $70 over the next few months. There are so many reasons to buy this stock, while I would say that the only reason to sell is an economic slow down which is way too early to call at this point. Stay tuned!Thank you for reading my article. Please let me know what you think of my thesis. Your input is highly appreciated!"

Sell HAL.","Source: Getty ImagesI have been a Halliburton (HAL) bear for over two years now. After oil prices began to crack from their peak in the second half of 2014, I followed the company closely as management reduced headcount and capex to protect margins. While 2014 may have been the peak for oil prices, today's environment could represent a peak for the stock.Halliburton reported solid earnings for Q4 2017. Total revenue was up 9% sequentially. North America represents the company's largest segment at over 55% of revenue. Revenue from the region was up 7%, and this followed a 14% rise in Q3.For the week ended January 12, 2018, the U.S. rig count was up by over 30% during the quarter. Experts had originally assumed it had plateaued. Of note is that Latin America revenue was up 16%. Halliburton has hundreds of millions of credit risk to Venezuela's state-owned oil company (PDVSA). The company is expected to tamp down its exposure to Venezuela, which could cut growth in Latin America next quarter.The question remains, ""How long can North America hold up?"" In Q2 2017, Halliburton's management team intimated shale oil producers could tap the brakes on additional E&P:The rise in the rig count since Q2 2017 likely surprised even management. At some point soon the rig count could plateau and drilling activity in the oil patch could slow. That could put a lid on Halliburton's largest operating segment.Halliburton's failed acquisition of Baker Hughes (BHI) triggered a $3.5 payment to BHI, which punished the company's liquidity. In Q1 2017, Halliburton's debt/run-rate EBITDA approached 6x, and the company was at risk of a Moody's downgrade. The company since cut operating costs and reduced capex. The rise in drilling activity has also increased revenue and improved margins. The company's Q4 2017 EBITDA more than doubled Y/Y and now its debt/EBITDA is a little over 3x. The risk of a downgrade to junk status has now been removed.That said, I see no compelling reason to own HAL at this time. The stock is down about 4% Y/Y. Rate hikes from the Fed could create more headwinds for stocks. If the rig count plateaus in North America or if OPEC pulls back on its supply cuts, it could be very bad for HAL. The dividend yield of 1.6% is not very compelling, and I see more downside risk than upside.I see more downside risk than upside for Halliburton. HAL is a sell."

        If Latin America folds and North America peaks then that could be foreboding. HAL is a hold into earnings.","Venezuela President Nicolas MaduroHalliburton (HAL) reports Q1 earnings Monday. Analysts expect revenue of $5.75 billion and eps of $0.41. The revenue estimate implies a 3% decline sequentially. Investors should focus on the following key items:Halliburton, Schlumberger (SLB) and Baker Hughes, A GE Company (BHGE) are the big three oil servicing firms pursuant to North America land drilling. These companies have feasted on the white hot oil drilling activity in the region. Halliburton receives over 55% of its total revenue from North America. Last quarter Halliburton's total revenue was up 10% sequentially. North America led the way with a 14% increase, while other regions grew in the low to mid-single digits. The U.S. rig count for the week ended April 20th was up 5 to 1013; this represented an 18% increase Y/Y. However, nothing lasts forever. Halliburton's North America exposure could become a negative if activity turns down in the region. If its revenue falls sequentially then my guess is that some of that decline could come from North America.In Q2 2017 Halliburton's management intimated North American shale plays could tap the brakes on additional E&P. Even if drilling activity does not decline then pricing power among North America land drillers could erode. If another price war in North America ensues then those firms with the best balance sheets and strong liquidity could be best-positioned to survive. That could mean weaker firms like Weatherford (WFT) could finally get weeded out.In Q4 2017 the company's revenue from Latin America was up 4% Q/Q. Schlumberger has curtailed its operations in Latin America due to state-owned PDVSA's inability to pay its bills on time; Halliburton and Weatherford have followed suit. In Q1 2018 Schlumberger's Latin America revenue declined 16% sequentially:Halliburton receives 10% of its revenue in Latin America and could also experience sharp headwinds. The company still has over $400 million of credit risk to PDVSA. Investors should brace themselves for a potential write down of some of these assets. The company has nearly $2 billion of cash on hand and generates $1 billion of quarterly EBITDA. It should be able to sustain a partial write down of some of its Venezuela assets.If Latin America turns down then Halliburton could become more dependent upon North America for growth. If North America has peaked then that does not bode well for the company's forward earnings.A sequential decline in revenue could be a signal of things to come for HAL. I rate the stock a hold into earnings."

Halliburton, much like it competitors in the sector, had been battered up until 2017, when the oil market started turning. We had previously stood behind the name as a hold and upgraded the name to a strong buy in August. That said, the company just reported earnings and we are surprised at how sharply the market has turned back toward moving positive following the pain in the oil sector the last few years. Halliburton stock has rebounded nicely as oil prices have bounced off of the decade lows. Combine this with the fiscal discipline that was borne out of necessity the last three years and the company is better than ever. But can you buy here after this leg up? Let us discuss performance and our expectations for 2018.As we had alluded to in past pieces in 2017 looking at the oil sector, we expected a rebound in oil but not this quickly. We were eyeing 2020 as the target year when we would see a regression to the mean in oil prices. We are pleased to have been wrong on this front as the rebound is well ahead of our expectations. While we expected a future bounce to give rise to a turn in revenues the growth returned much sooner than anticipated. That said, revenues grew to $5.94 billion:Source: SEC FilingsAs you can see this represents an immense return to top line growth. It is a major testament to how vulnerable sales are to the price of oil. Now, as we watched oil prices climb in Q4, we of course were expecting some growth thanks to the move in oil prices. Our estimates were for $5.4 billion, and the company brought in an additional $540 million over our projections. We should note that consensus estimates were surpassed by $310 million. We firmly believe that the overall risk continues to be to the upside from here as this bounce in oil is a long overdue reversion toward the mean. Prices ran up high, crashed, and are now finding equilibrium, in our opinion. With the rise in oil, we have to now turn to expenses.As oil prices declined from 2014 forward, Halliburton worked diligently to cut expenses. However, spending ticked up from last year as more operations were brought on line. Costs of revenues were up from last year:Source: SEC FilingsWe were expecting a rise in costs but were looking for $4.8 billion, so the company spent nearly $300 million more than we anticipated at $5.09 billion to generate revenues in both completion/production and drilling/evaluation segments. The company did see lower interest and corporate related expenses. Overall, we were pleased with the metric, and we believe the reasons that costs were higher versus our expectations were completely a result of much higher than expected revenues being brought in as a result of growth across the company's portfolio.As we have done for other companies this earnings season, we find it prudent to assess and report on the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Acts for Halliburton. Halliburton took a net $882 million of non-cash tax charges in the quarter. This was primarily due to the new provisions in the tax law, and the charges take into account the net impact of the tax law on the company. Future charges may be possible, along with other restructurings. Management has indicated that the company is ""continuing its analysis of tax reform impact on the company, and this provisional amount is subject to change"".Revenues greatly surpassed our expectations while expenses were slightly higher as well. Still, the net impact led to earnings exceeding our expectations, and returning to growth:Source: SEC FilingsAdjusting for items such as the U.S. tax bill and ongoing issues in Venezuela, the company saw earnings per share of $0.53. This is strong growth from the $0.04 taken in during last year's Q4. Moreover, it surpassed our expectations for earnings by $0.10 per share. This is exceptional growth, but can you buy here? To answer this question, we have to assess 2018 expectations.We expect a strong 2018 from the company. When Schlumberger reported its results last week, Chairman and CEO Paal Kibsgaard stated "" the oil market is now in balance."" That was bullish. Halliburton President and CEO Jeff Miller added the following bullish outlook:What this means is that we can expect margin expansion, because a normalization (or a mean reversion) means margins need to improve. This suggests expenses will continue to be well managed, while revenues grow, thereby expanding margins.With this outlook and our expectations for the year we are bullish on the stock for 2018. On the top line, we are anticipating revenues of $23.0 billion to $24.75 billion under the assumption of oil remaining at present levels or higher. Assuming this growth and managed expenses that expand margins, we are targeting earnings per share of $2.25 to $2.60.We remain bullish at rate Halliburton a buy at $50. While oil prices drive the momentum in this stock and the sector for the most part, with oil prices moving higher, the company and the stock will continue to do well. Despite past cost cutting to the bone and the pressure that we saw on revenues and margins, the company continued to pay its dividend and work to improve its operations. While the initial gains have been made since our buy call in July, we still see upside here.Quad 7 Capital has been a leading contributor with Seeking Alpha since early 2012.

This is why Halliburton (HAL) is included in The Value Portfolio, a group of 20 to 30 stocks optimized for late-stage economic expansion.In Buy Halliburton, published in September of 2017, I concluded:Since then, oil prices have surged, Halliburton's valuation has increased, the company's fundamentals have improved, and the stock has outperformed the major indices and the primary competitor:This is only the second inning of the ballgame.The company earlier this week beat both top- and bottom-line expectations for the fourth quarter of 2017, and the stock surged by more than 6 percent in response:This was a justified reaction, but the stock had already risen by nearly 30 percent in the eight weeks leading up to the earnings release, and the stock price has since come down a few percent. This is normal.I keep a close eye on global oil market dynamics, as oil prices impact many of my investments. You may reference my more than four dozen oil-related articles on my author page. Please feel free to leave comments below my previous articles, and I will do my best to respond.Based on what I see both on demand and supply sides of the oil equation, I expect oil prices to continue to push higher throughout 2018, further improving Halliburton's fundamental outlook.The company, however, has a challenge to meet.I recommend that all investors read through the latest earnings transcript in order to better understand the drivers of the company, and the following I thought was the key exchange for this quarter:That is what a non-answer looks like.In Labor Slack: How Much Room? I pointed to the low U.S. unemployment, shirking underemployment, and also discussed the labor participation rate.Unfortunately for Halliburton and nearly all companies, skilled labor remains hard to find in the United States. This will be a primary bottleneck that limits how much companies can grow in 2018, but Halliburton is one company that has options.Management noted on the call:The U.S. shale will drive global oil supply growth in 2018, and Halliburton's services will be on high demand. This future allows the company to consistently push its prices higher, which will greatly improve margins:As a result, I expect Halliburton's trailing 12-month profit margin to rise above 10% by the end of 2018, even if the company's top-line growth is limited by the availability of completion crews, which will manifest itself as an industry wide problem. I will monitor the company's profit margins in order to accept or reject my investment thesis, and adjust accordingly.The world is accelerating into an energy crisis, and Halliburton is one company that is well positioned to benefit long-term shareholders. Because the stock price has already caught up to the company's fundamentals, which I expect will continue to improve, I rate the company a hold."

Being such an obviously anti-competitive move, this really came as no surprise to anyone but Hally, itself. Who can blame Baker for going along with this one? $3.5 billion bucks is usually hard to come by. All Baker had to do was play nice for this pay day.This dug a hole Halliburton's balance sheet for that year but time heals all wounds, as they say. Dramatically increased revenue YoY, driven by the North American fracking revival that began in late 2016 has pumped up the coffers and the stock price.SourceAlong with increased revenue and profits, Halliburton's stock has rebounded nicely from the lows of last summer, topping out in Jan. 2018 at nearly $58.00/share. See graphic below for the range over this time period.SourceAs Halliburton swings back to profit and the industry begins to flap its wings again, what are they doing to regain momentum?Bragging rights count for a lot in the oil industry. Along with sheer size comes scale, driving unit costs down and profitability up. Where should we expect them to deploy capital to move back up the ladder in 2018?More immediately, the price has been dragged down about 20% in the recent market sell-off. Is there more selling to come? Or does the current price represent a good entry level for new money? =Let's drill down on this idea.If you look at the comparison table I put together, you see a lot more red in Hally's column than Schlumberger's (NYSE:SLB). A closer look tells us if you exclude the big capital equipment stuff associated with laying pipeline, building drilling rigs, and putting up LNG and Petrochemical plants, the differences aren't too stark.In fact, HAL may have some comparative advantage in today's market by not having the drag that all of the above would require in the way of (currently way underutilized) infrastructure, personnel, and support costs. In case you're wondering, there's just not that much rig building going on these days.Nonetheless Halliburton managed to flesh out its portfolio in 2017 with the acquisition of Summit ESP. Down-hole pumps are an integral part of the total completion picture, and this was a nice gap-filler in their product/service offering. SourceWhat the table above reveals is a finely tuned, drilling and completion machine focused on one thing primarily, shale drilling and fracking. Have a look at their Q-4 financial summary below. It doesn't require a lot of interpretation really.1. Let's say Booyah! to Completions. Stuffing those multi-laterals with hardware, and fracking them into the next dimension is where the money is these days. Remember all those DUC's that were hanging around (and some still are)? There are two primary reasons for leaving those drilled wells, uncompleted. There are other ancillary reasons, like pipeline hookups, etc., we will ignore in this exercise.a. Frack equipment can't get built fast enough to keep up with demand.b. Here's the biggie- Completions are the big cost item in an oil or gas well these days. Probably 60-70% of the well's AFE is for completions.2. The ""science"" in bringing oil wells on line lies in what you do to the reservoir, and Halliburton takes a back seat to no one in that category.3. Look where the bulk of their global revenue is coming from. I'll save you the trouble of looking at the table- North America! And, what's in America? Shale fracking and Halliburton is killing it.Let's start with Jeff Miller's, Halliburton's president, comments during their recent CC.This means currently there is one frac spread for every two drilling rigs. Below is a pic of a frac spread for those with no oilfield background.SourceSource Graphic from Halliburton's website showing the precise sand placement from microseismic modeling.Source Outtake from Pioneer Exploration's NYSE: (PXD) Q-4 Slide deck showing an increase in lateral length and frac treatment volumes.Source- author's personal files.You can see the effects that even inhibited aqueous fluids, similar to those used in this test, can have some on shales with the Time-Lapse Photography-TLP, above. So being able to keep the shale in the interval from absorbing water and the drilling operation being thereby impacted, can save time and costs.""Live by the sword, die by the sword,"" as the saying goes. Hally is clearly leveraged to sustained growth in the North American shale plays. If anything derails that train, Halliburton's profits will be affected in direct proportion.It is a crowded market. I recently wrote an article detailing the risks associated with dedicated frack pumpers. I picked on one in particular, Liberty Oilfield Services, NYSE: (LBRT), as it went public to a lot of fanfare last month. My concern and comments apply to them all, however. Here is a link to it if you have PRO access. ""Beware Of Small Shale Frackers...""It should also be noted that, although it's a late-comer, Schlumberger is matching Hally in the frack patch HHP for HHP, with the purchase of Weatherford's NYSE: (WFT) pumping assets. Both Big Red, and Big Blue are fielding some 3-mm HHP in the various shale plays. When the two big colors duke it out, profits can be impacted.I am watching Halliburton now for an entry point ~$42.00. If softness in oil persists over the next few days, I expect a gradual stair-stepping down for this company.

The similarities don't end with revenues and EPS that largely met expectations. Most importantly, the key trends at play in the early months of the year, which I briefly discussed on Friday, seem to have been reflected in Halliburton's solid 1Q18 performance.Source: Folha de S.PauloMore specifically, North America land continues to fire on all cylinders. This happened despite the warnings of a slowdown in activity in the continent disclosed in 2Q17 that proved short-lived and, in my view, helped to set the tone for choppy and sideways trading in the second half of the year. This quarter, North America was up a solid 58% YOY and 3% sequentially over an already impressive 4Q17, with ""homeland"" revenues surpassing 60% of total company's sales.The resilience in North America seems to have mirrored the pickup in U.S. rig count since November 2017, in turn aided by another leg up in crude oil prices. The graphs below illustrate the trend since the beginning of the oil and gas downcylce (first chart) and since mid-year 2017 (second chart), shortly after management's announced prediction of a slump in the continent.With supply cuts taking place around the globe, active rigs are back on the rise domestically, and so seem to be drilling, completion and production. Reinforced by management's remarks this morning that the ""North America business exited the quarter in a strong position"" with March setting ""a new record for stages per spread,"" I continue to be cautiously optimistic that the domestic recovery is intact and still has enough fuel to burn, despite the concerns raised earlier last year.Source: DM Martins Research, using data from Baker HughesInternationally, the results were a bit less encouraging on the surface, with revenues rising only 9% YOY and dipping 12% sequentially following a strong 4Q17. This is, however, a significant improvement over the much softer expectations this time last year, which included a sideways-moving foreign market coupled with observed pricing pressures.At one point in the not-so-distant past, the performance of Halliburton's international division (and those of most energy service companies, to be fair) was a source of uncertainty and fear that prevented me from pounding on the table regarding an investment in the company's stock. Today, those concerns are much less relevant, in my opinion, as the fundamentals seem to have improved without signs of deterioration in the horizon.The table below summarizes Halliburton's P&L results in 1Q18.Source: DM Martins Research, using data from company reportsOnce again, I feel mildly upbeat about the oil and gas sector - understanding that the ever-present risks associated with swinging commodity prices could change sentiment on a dime. My positive stance appears to be reinforced by a rare combination of rising crude oil prices, resilience in North America activity, the early stages of a recovery abroad, and stock prices that have yet to jump much higher over the past 24 months.HAL PE Ratio (Forward) data by YChartsI believe HAL could be a good option for those looking to play the potential energy recovery by still investing in quality, but at a lower valuation than my favorite OFS (oilfield services) name, SLB. As the chart above suggests, HAL's forward P/E multiple is about as low as it gets within the peer group (possibly justifying the geographic concentration and more erratic margins), with earnings growth expectations still looking quite healthy and pointing at a rock-bottom forward PEG of 0.3x.Because HAL sprinted by a whopping 11% between April 9th and the end of last week, shares could trade down in the very near term as profit taking runs its course. But I doubt that any weakness observed in the next couple of trading sessions will morph into heavier selloff.For the long-term investor seeking exposure to the oil and gas sector, who is fully aware of the risks associated with crude price fluctuations, HAL might be a name worth further consideration, in my view."

        I always support a balanced and cautious approach to playing the oil and gas game.
        Within the context of a balanced portfolio, HAL seems to me like one of the ideal names in the sector.","This Monday morning, Halliburton (HAL) opened the week of earnings reports by delivering a solid top- and bottom-line beat that, to me, was not a shocker. Revenues of $5.94 billion topped consensus and produced a bear-period record YOY increase of 48%. Adjusted EPS of $0.53 landed seven cents above estimates.Credit: Oil OnlineI wrote about peer Schlumberger (SLB) a couple of times over the weekend, and indicated that the oil and gas services industry seemed to be taking large steps towards exiting the long downcycle in the space. As the North America geography showed resilience despite last quarter's expectations for ""moderation"" in the segment, Halliburton (whose revenues come mostly from its home continent) was bound to release robust 4Q17 results this week.Nothing short of encouraging came out of the company's press release regarding the outlook for 2018. Helping to support shares that were trading up nearly 5% intraday were CEO comments like ""I am excited by the increase in tender activity and the positive discussions we are having with our international customers"" and ""I am optimistic about what I see in 2018"". Also bullish were the management team's remarks about margins: "" I continue to believe we are on the path to normalized margins in North America in 2018"".On the results of the most recent quarter, I calculate that about half of the sequential EPS improvement came from improved revenue-generating activity that was supported by U.S. land completion and production and drilling in the Middle East. The other half of the earnings boost came in the form of better operating margins, on the back of better pricing in North America production and likely some scale gains. The table below illustrates the results of the quarter and compares them to 3Q17's non-GAAP results. I have also included my estimated impact to EPS of the sequential change in each major P&L line.Source: DM Martins Research using data from company reportsInvesting in the energy space is a very tricky proposition, in my view. The success of the strategy is highly dependent on crude oil price behavior, which is usually beyond the control of individual industry participants. For that reason, I always support a balanced and cautious approach to playing the oil and gas game.Within the context of a balanced portfolio, HAL seems to me like one of the ideal names in the sector to play the crude oil rebound, alongside SLB, blending quality of the business and stock price appreciation potential on the back of reasonable valuation multiples."
4137806,40351,2018-01-16T14:00:00-05:00,The exploration and production companies will increase capital expenditure in 2018 as they target production growth following improvement in oil prices.Halliburton will push its price levels higher which will give a boost to its earnings and profit margins.The drilling activity outside of North America will likely improve which may fuel the turnaround of Halliburton’s international operations.,"Halliburton (HAL), which has been one of the major beneficiaries of the improvement in oil price environment, will further grow its earnings in 2018, even as the rig count growth slows down in the crucial North America market.In 2017, oil prices somewhat stabilized in the $45 to $55 a barrel window which gave confidence to oil producers who increased drilling activity, particularly in the second half of the year when the shale oil drillers operated more than 900 rigs in each month, as per data from Baker Hughes (BHGE). That’s up from an average of 510 rigs for the entire 2016. The increase was driven entirely by North America’s onshore market. The demand for Halliburton’s services in North America, particularly pressure pumping, completion tools and cementing products, soared.Consequently, revenues from Halliburton’s Completion and Production division, its largest segment, for the first nine months of 2017 climbed by 40% from last year to $9.27 billion. Halliburton was also able to improve pricing. This played an important role in pushing its operating income for the completion and production division from just $22 million in the first nine months of 2016 to more than $1 billion in 2017. Total revenues from North America region, which fueled the company’s growth, rose 64% to $8.16 billion in 9M-2017. Overall, Halliburton posted 23.7% increase in revenues to $14.68 billion and its adjusted operating income rose 57% to $1.25 billion in the first nine months of 2017.Since then, the oil price environment has gotten even better. The prices of the US benchmark WTI crude and the international benchmark Brent crude have risen almost 25% each in the last three months to $63.44 and $69.68 a barrel respectively. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, including Russia, have agreed to keep a lid on production through 2018 which has given support to oil prices. In addition to this, the declining level of crude oil stocks in the OECD nations, particularly in the US where crude inventories dropped by nearly five million barrels to 419.5 million barrels in the week to 5 January to below the five-year average of just over 420 million barrels, has also lifted oil prices.In an environment of strong oil prices, the oil and gas producers will likely further increase drilling activity by growing capital expenditure. A number of major independent oil and gas producers, such as EOG Resources (EOG), Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD), and Continental Resources (CLR), are preparing to deliver double-digit production growth in 2018. Analysts at Credit Suisse believe that exploration and production spending will increase by 12% this year, which I think seems like a fair assessment considering that most of the oil producers likely won’t target growth just for the sake of it. Rather, they will likely keep their spending levels within cash flows. Still, the increase in E&P expenditure will work out well for Halliburton.Image: Author, Data Source: Baker HughesThe drilling activity, measured in terms of rig count, may not grow in 2018 in the same way as it did in 2017. Last year, the drilling activity in the US and Canada increased by almost 70%, as shown in the image above. In fact, the rig count may not grow at all. Note that since the start of 2H-2017, we haven’t seen a meaningful uptake in rig count, even though the oil prices improved substantially in this period. At the end of last week, there were 924 rigs operating in the US and 174 in Canada which is actually lower than what we saw in December. That’s because the oil producers have become more efficient at pumping more hydrocarbons using fewer rigs. US production is already at 9.5 million barrels per day, substantially higher than less than 9 million barrels per day seen throughout most of 2014 when US oil and gas producers operated an average of 1,862 rigs (almost twice as high as the latest level). Moving forward, we may not witness a meaningful uptick in rig count in the US, even as production climbs to all-time highs of more than 10 million barrels per day.Although the rig count may not grow significantly in 2018, Halliburton earnings will move higher. The strong oil price environment will boost profits of oil and gas producers while the demand for Halliburton’s completions equipment and services will remain strong. This will give the company an opportunity to push prices of its services higher and lift its margins to normalized levels. Prior to the downturn, in 2013, the company’s adjusted operating margin used to come in at above 15%, but they fell to single digits (8.5% in 9M-2017 following earnings growth) in the downturn as the company gave deep discounts to customers. Moving forward, however, Halliburton will increase prices which will lift its earnings while margins will move to double-digits.In addition to this, Halliburton’s technological prowess will help it in attracting more customers who are focused on efficiencies and optimization. The company is also using technology to further reduce its costs and improve equipment utilization. For instance, by using its ExpressKinect unit the company can increase utilization during zipper-frac operations. That should also have a positive impact on margins and earnings.Image: Author, Data Source: Baker HughesOn top of this, the improvement in oil prices may also fuel a turnaround of the company’s international business. Although Halliburton is a North America focused company, it typically gets around 40% if its revenues and 30% of its earnings from international markets. Unlike North America, the drilling activity didn’t come back strongly in the international markets. For instance, in December, there were 954 rigs operating outside of North America which depicts an increase of just 2.7%, or 25 units, on a year-over-year basis. In the same period, the US rig count was 930 units, which shows a strong gain of 46.7%, or 296 units. Still, the international rig count isn’t falling anymore, which is a major positive that shows that the market outside of North America may have bottomed. Following improvement in oil prices to almost $70 a barrel (Brent), the international drilling activity may also finally start recovering.So far, Halliburton’s recovery has been led by its core North American business while its international operations have lagged behind. In 9M-2017, the company posted 4.8% increase in revenues from North America which was completely offset by the 13.5% decline in revenues from the Europe/Africa/CIS region and a 4.7% drop from Middle East/Asia region. As a result, its overall international revenues fell 5.5% to $6.5 billion. But this could change in 2018. In its third-quarter results, the company said that it saw an uptake in completions activity in the Middle East, which, I believe, is a big positive since this is a key international market for Halliburton where it is one of the top players. Meanwhile, other oilfield services companies, including Schlumberger (SLB), have also said that some key international markets – such as Russia, Europe including the North Sea, and parts of Asia – are turning around. The recovery in these markets will fuel the recovery of Halliburton’s international operations, likely from 2018.In short, the improvement in price levels in North America and uptake in drilling activity in international markets will allow Halliburton to continue growing its earnings and margins in 2018. This should have a positive impact on the company’s shares. Halliburton stock is currently trading 11.2-times in terms of EV/EBITDA (2018e.) ratio which makes it the cheapest oilfield services stock among its closest peers such as Schlumberger, Halliburton, Baker Hughes and Weatherford International (WFT). I think this could be a good time to buy Halliburton stock as it continues its recovery in 2018.Note from author: Thank you for reading. Please share your comments below.

I rate HAL a hold.","Venezuela President Nicolas MaduroHalliburton (NYSE:HAL) reports Q4 earnings Monday. Analysts expect revenue of $5.63 billion and EPS of $0.46. The revenue estimate implies a 3% increase sequentially. Investors should focus on the following key items:Halliburton, along with Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) and Baker Hughes, a GE Company (BHGE), make up the big three oil services firms. Halliburton gets a whopping 58% of its revenue from North America; that is convenient given that the region is the hottest area of the oil services market.Its Q3 revenue was up 10% Y/Y, while revenue from North America was up a gaudy 14%. North America's performance followed a 24% rise in Q2. The question remains: How long can North America hold up? In Q2, Halliburton's management thought the rig count in North America could flatten, causing North American shale plays to tap the brakes on additional E&P:At Q2 2017, the U.S. rig count was at 940. For the week ended January 12, 2018, it was at 939, up over 40% Y/Y and up by 15 versus the previous week. With oil prices hovering around $70, E&P for U.S. land drilling is still looking strong. As long as OPEC holds the line on supply cuts, it could remain that way for the near term.Halliburton's revenue from Latin America was up 4% Y/Y. That bested Schlumberger whose Q3 revenue from the region was actually down 8%. Schlumberger has curtailed some its operations in Venezuela due to its state-owned oil company's inability to pay its bills. Both Halliburton and Schlumberger had previously used their balance sheets to finance equipment and services for PDVSA. Halliburton still has over $400 million of credit risk to PDVSA.The company has $1.9 billion in cash on hand, and quarterly EBITDA of over $1 billion. It could absorb a few hundred million in asset write-offs. However, it receives about 10% of its revenue from Latin America. I expect a pullback in Latin America revenue this quarter due to PDVSA's decline in drilling activity alone. Halliburton could become highly dependent on North America to help offset headwinds in Latin America, which I believe could be intractable.Halliburton has been one of the largest beneficiaries of the spike in oil prices over the past year. Its Q3 EBITDA of $1 billion was double that of the year earlier period. Its credit metrics had deteriorated to the point where it was at risk of a Moody's downgrade. The company's $10.9 billion debt load is now at a respectable 2.7x run-rate EBITDA. That could change if North America and Latin America turn down simultaneously. This is the biggest risk I see for the company.HAL will likely meet or exceed expectations on the strength of North America. However, Latin America could be a headwind. At 13x run-rate EBITDA, HAL is a hold into earnings."

HAL’s price action is breaking down on both short- and long-term charts, signaling investor sentiment is weakening. Moreover, the company’s fundamental operations are under pressure. A way to gain short exposure to the company is by using a bear put spread, which can limit potential losses.The chart below is of HAL over the last three years. There are a number of negative signals presented by the chart. HAL’s stock looks to have topped out in early 2014, just prior to the oil price crash of 2014-2015. HAL subsequently saw its share price get cut in half during the downturn.While its stock did recover higher throughout 2016, HAL is now rolling back over to the downside. This selling pressure is bearish, and the company’s inability to capture new highs signals that investors may be looking to reprice the stock lower.On a longer-term chart, HAL looks to have a lot more potential downside. The $40 range has acted as major support over the last 20 years, and a break below it could lead to selling pressure all the way down into the mid- $20s.A major observation of HAL’s long dated chart is that the stock is volatile, moving gradually higher from 2003, all the way up until 2014. Now however, with the stock make lower highs, and rolling back lower, sellers could pick up momentum, driving its share price back to 2014 lows.HAL’s issues are largely a product of its own success. The company greatly benefited from U.S. shale over the last two decades, with revenue peaking in 2014. Almost half of HAL’s peak 2014 revenue came from U.S. shale, with the company being dominant in key service lines like pressure pumping and completion equipment. Between 2011 and 2014 though, a number of competitive pressures reduced profitability in HAL’s North American operations.Many of HAL’s efficiency gains in pressure pumping, such as with 24-hour operations, have gradually been replicated by peers, while HAL has also faced pressures in more technologically sophisticated areas like completion equipment, according to a Morningstar Report.An oversupply of pressure pumping equipment is coinciding with a period of relatively strong U.S. shale activity, which is currently threatening HAL’s pressure pumping profitability. In its most recent quarter, management provided negative margin guidance, driving its share price lower. Management stated that North American revenue from HAL’s drilling and evaluation business is likely to fall in step with the average U.S. rig count in the fourth quarter. Although 2017 started off well, the average rig count in the United States has fallen in 10 of the past 12 weeks.Moreover, HAL is also a vulnerable market behemoth in the fracking industry, reporting lower-than-expected margins for the third quarter in its large completion and production (C&P) business. Margins in the business rose 15%, but missed expectations of a 16% rise, leading to selling pressure on its share price.Investors looking to gain short exposure to HAL need to realize that the company’s share price is volatile. Therefore, a bear put spread makes a lot of sense in the current situation. The spread I am looking at is the January 2019 40/35 bear put spread. The strategy buys the $40 strike put, while selling the $35 strike put. In total, the strategy costs roughly $1.75, to make a max gain of $3.25, or a 185% return on investment if the share price is below $35 on expiration.It is important to note that while using this strategy limits losses to the premium paid up front, it is possible for premium to be lost entirely. This means that you should weight the position appropriately in your portfolio.HAL’s stock looks to be breaking down on both intermediate and long-term charts. With competitive pressures mounting, HAL’s margins are declining, leading to selling pressure on the stock. Investors interested in taking a short position on the stock may want to consider using a bear put spread, which can limit losses, but also offers leveraged return potential."

The impact of shipping delays should be minimal for both Halliburton and Hi-Crush during the quarter and should help to continue to push sand prices higher and higher, which is great for Hi-Crush's earnings. Oil's continued stabilization around $60 a barrel means robust earnings for both Halliburton and companies like Hi-Crush as additional sand supply isn't expected to truly hit the market until the back half of the year.Halliburton's warning of a $0.10 EPS hit to its Q1 earnings has caused some ripple effects, including sending shares of Hi-Crush and Halliburton moderately lower after starting out the day at a neutral to bullish position.HCLP Price data by YChartsThis warning is due to Halliburton experiencing delays for a week in sand shipments from Canadian railroads due to weather-driven disruptions. Halliburton only receives about a third of its sand from Canadian rails, and one week of delays won't make a material impact on the company's 2018 earnings, which is why the company only is experiencing a moderate decline on a day when the Dow is up (so far) and oil is hovering around $60.50 a day.This delay should not materially impact Hi-Crush either, in my opinion, even though it has reversed course from positive to negative territory based on this new information. There are several reasons for this, including its most recent addition of a Kermit plant in the Permian Basin supplies sand to in-basin oil and gas companies mainly utilizing trucking companies or by selling sand at the mine doors at spot prices. In Q3 of 2017, 63% of the company's sand volume was delivered in-basin, which helps mitigate railcar issues like the one Halliburton is now dealing with. Hi-Crush's other plants are located in Wisconsin and benefit tremendously from the ability to ship sand across the U.S. to multiple locations depending on demand and railcar and terminal availability.Slide from Hi-Crush Investor PresentationHi-Crush also benefits from owning many of its operated terminals, which ensures that it will experience less delays than competitors and have faster turnaround times in deliveries. It's nice to have priority classification at terminals in situations like the one now affecting Halliburton.With sand delays and issues popping up for oil companies like Halliburton, this will be a great environment for sand producers like Hi-Crush to continue to aggressively raise sand prices, as production across the U.S. continues to grow. Here is how sand prices have been doing the past couple of quarters with continued increases expected the next couple quarters at least until the threat of additional supply enters the marketplace in the back half of the year.Table by Trent WelshRising sand prices along with Hi-Crush's rising sand volumes means much better contribution margins. This should lead to higher revenues and greater distributable cash flows for unit holders as it has no big current CapEx commitments as its latest Kermit project is complete. I would expect the gains from sand prices and short supplies to equal out or outweigh any material impacts from any concerns of minor sand delays from some Canadian railroads.I see the continued stabilization of oil over the past 3 months in and around $60-65 as a huge bonus for both Halliburton as well as Hi-Crush, as both look to profit greatly from the oil boom the U.S. is currently experiencing.WTI Crude Oil Spot Price data by YChartsUse non-material events like this as buying opportunities for entrance into stocks such as Hi-Crush as well as Halliburton, as earnings should continue to grow dramatically across the U.S. as long as oil prices continue to hold around $60 and above. Best of luck to all."

Since 2011, Halliburton has been a valuable, profitable part of my overall portfolio.Simply put, it's the balance sheet.Through the recent energy commodity collapse, Schlumberger maintained a solid balance sheet while Halliburton did not.Both HAL and SLB work within the international energy services industry. The two compete on many fronts; these companies are the energy service heavyweights. I believe both run well-managed businesses, own strong franchises, earn profits mostly in cash, and are shareholder friendly.The difference is Schlumberger has a far stronger balance sheet. As an adjunct, SLB offers a significantly better dividend yield, too.While the companies' strategies are not identical, I believe the degree of separation between each's individual business models and recent financial results is limited. I contend Schlumberger's senior management is no less capable, and perhaps more capable, than Halliburton's.When analyzing a balance sheet, I stress:Let's run through these benchmarks.Note to readers: Financial data was sourced via SEC filings and/or company web sites.SchlumbergerSchlumberger holds about $5 billion in balance sheet cash and equivalents, totaling $3.56 per share, or ~6% market cap. The company has separate bank lending commitments totaling $6.6 billion in debt. Approximately $4.2 billion is undrawn.Therefore, the company has access to $9.2 billion in ready cash.However, behind the numbers is a significant liquidity event. From the 3Q 2017 10-Q:Venezuela is a bad actor. Ongoing political and economic turmoil pose a threat to all multi-nationals operating there. Immediately after accepting a financing agreement with Venezuela, Schlumberger wrote it down by $460 million. Additional write-downs are possible.Furthermore, in October 2017, the company reached a past-due agreement with Ecuador. The $1.1 billion owed is not in dispute, but listed as a receivable less allowance for doubtful accounts.Historically, Schlumberger hasn't taken a permanent hit from either country. Nonetheless, the company has recognized the balance sheet risk and took appropriately conservative steps to reflect the situation.As of September 30, 2017, the current ratio was 1.53x. A figure above 1.0x may be considered sound.HalliburtonMeanwhile, Halliburton holds about $1.9 billion in cash and equivalents on the balance sheet. That's $2.18 per share or ~5% market cap. Bank loan commitments for another $3.0 billion are available.Therefore, liquidity is about $4.9 billion.The company has similar Venezuelan debt collection problems. In 2017, Halliburton obtained a $200 million note from the government; it's been written down to $116 million. Venezuela failed to make its first payment on its debt.Halliburton carries a 2.21x current ratio.ObservationsBoth entities have adequate liquidity. There is cash on the balance sheet, access to bank credit, and positive cash flow. Both companies struggle with no-pay, slow-pay scenarios with the Venezuelan government.SchlumbergerSchlumberger has $17.16 billion in total debt.Total debt-to-equity is 43%. Debt-to-capital is 28%. Within the energy services industry, these figures are acceptable. These ratios provide a glimpse into the core capital structure of a company.Through 3Q 2017, the interest coverage ratio is tight: only 1.4x. This means EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) covered debt service, but sans much cushion. Twice the coverage would be considered adequate.Leverage, as measured by net debt-to-EBITDA, is 2.1x. This is sound.Of course, investors must be mindful the interest coverage and ND2E ratios are a function of EARNINGS, as well as balance sheet debt.The rating agencies understand this. Schlumberger carries a AA- credit rating.HalliburtonRival Halliburton has $10.94 billion in total debt. Through September 30, 2017, total D2E is 118%. Debt-to-capital registers 54%. The results put HAL at the bottom third of the industry.Halliburton's interest coverage ratio is 2.0x. While better than SLB, it's still low. Leverage, as measured by net debt-to-EBITDA is 3.2x. This isn't bad, but it's considerably higher than Schlumberger.Halliburton's credit rating is BBB-. Therefore, it's investment grade (barely).ObservationsWhen comparing debt and leverage, the separation between companies widens. Schlumberger enjoys significantly better debt and leverage ratios.Halliburton has a modestly higher interest coverage ratio, though neither company exhibits good coverage. The results stem from continued weak earnings experienced by each company. EBIT is improving; it started from highly depressed levels.Unquestionably, Halliburton's once pristine balance sheet has taken a tumble. Weak operating results, a $3.5 billion breakup fee paid to Baker Hughes in 2016, ongoing asset impairments, and resultant additional borrowing took a toll.Schlumberger's stronger balance sheet is underscored by its AA- credit rating. Halliburton's BBB- rating is the lowest rung on the investment grade ladder.Management is responsible for creating shareholder value. While it cannot directly force share prices to go up, senior leadership has considerable latitude to manage the balance sheet.A clear objective is to build shareholder equity.In recent years, this has been a challenging objective for all energy services companies. Negative cash flow, asset impairments, and escalating debt all contributed to equity destruction, not creation.For reference, the recent energy commodity crash began mid-year 2015.How's each company fared?SchlumbergerEquity build is best viewed on a continuum. Here's Schlumberger management's record:We find that despite the severe energy commodity downturn, management did a reasonably good job preserving shareholder equity. Results are a bit lumpy, but generally flattish.Notably, in 2016, Schlumberger completed the Cameron International acquisition. This move helped bolster total shareholder equity.On the other hand, astute investors recognize the company carries a lot of balance sheet goodwill and intangibles. Currently, 51% of Schlumberger's total assets are listed as GW+I. Back in 2014, goodwill and intangibles were just 31%. This is certainly worth recognition; with the understanding the company is generally acquisitive in nature. Acquisitions tend to increase goodwill and intangibles. However, total shareholder equity has not diminished through the period. Despite serious industry travails, management has not needed to record major asset impairment charges.HalliburtonNow let's turn to Halliburton.Halliburton experienced continuous shareholder equity declines. Primarily, the losses were due to increased debt and the ill-fated Baker Hughes bid. In 2015, the company responded to a severe cash crunch and the anticipated Baker hookup by increasing long-term debt by $6.9 billion. In 2016, HAL had to cough up a $3.5 billion BH breakup fee, then eat another $560 million in merger integration costs. In the same year, a total of $3.2 billion in asset impairment charges riddled the ledger.The net result was a hefty drop in shareholder equity.Goodwill and intangibles are not an issue. These items account for only ~10% total assets.ObservationsThrough the cycle, Schlumberger's management preserved shareholder equity and completed a major acquisition. Goodwill and intangibles reached 50% of total assets. Mitigating this fact, goodwill and intangibles are historically high; Schlumberger is an acquisitive company.On the other hand, Halliburton's management struggled mightily. Recent shareholders experienced significant equity destruction due to poor cash flow, asset impairment/write-downs, the failed Baker Hughes acquisition, and related higher debt.The great value investor Benjamin Graham advocated a simple, effective way to screen companies for strong balance sheets. Simply, it requires reviewing the Equity/Asset (E/A) ratio. A result above 0.50 represents a well-capitalized business.We find SLB and HAL record 54% and 36% markers, respectively.Schlumberger and Halliburton are well-respected industry peers. Generally, many observers suggest Schlumberger to be more technically adept and focus up a greater international presence. Halliburton has taken a no-holds-barred approach to defend and even grow its North American business. Despite some differences, these companies compete with each other on a worldwide basis across a variety of energy services.For years, I maintained a position in Halliburton due to its good business performance, accountable management, and sound balance sheet. Unfortunately, recent years saw the balance sheet deteriorate. The 2015-2017 energy commodity collapse and failed Baker Hughes deal really stung Halliburton.Conversely, Schlumberger's management maintained a solid balance sheet through the downturn. Superior metrics, as demonstrated by the foregoing data in this article, and a AA- credit rating evidence the divide.The better balance sheet helped permit SLB offer current investors a 3.2% dividend yield. HAL yields but only 1.7%. I do not envision either payout to be in jeopardy. In addition, over the past year, Schlumberger reduced diluted shares outstanding slightly, while the Halliburton share count drifted up.Indeed, Schlumberger currently owns the better balance sheet and some of its associated benefits. Debt management, leverage, and equity build all tilt to its favor. The dividend yield is higher, and modest buybacks are holding the diluted share count down.Presuming other performance results and business prospects about on par with Halliburton, I find Schlumberger's stronger balance sheet a compelling reason to switch horses.Please do your own careful due diligence before making any investment decision. This article is not a recommendation to buy or sell any stock. Good luck with all your 2017 investments."
4136053,31441,2018-01-08T17:03:33-05:00,China's Sinopec is suing Venezuela's PDVSA for conspiracy to commit fraud.PDVSA and Venezuela are having trouble paying their debts.Halliburton has over $400 million of exposure to Venezuela. Weatherford receives 16% of its revenue from Latin America overall.I rate Halliburton a Hold and Weatherford a Sell.,"Venezuelan President Nicolas MaduroVenezuela is beset by recession, crime and stagflation. President Nicolas Maduro has cracked down on state-run oil company PDVSA. He has arrested the former head of PDVSA and over 60 executives with ties to the company. The purge has threatened PDVSA's operations, and its decline in oil production has wreaked havoc on a country whose main export item its oil.Now, PDVSA is have a difficult time paying its bills. A few months ago, China's oil & gas company Sinopec (NYSE:SHI) sued PDVSA for conspiracy to commit fraud:Venezuela and PDSVA owe tens of billions in bonds to investors. If PDSVA has trouble paying China - an important strategic partner - where does that leave U.S. oil services firms like Halliburton (NYSE:HAL), Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB), Weatherford (WFT) and Baker Hughes, a GE Company (BHGE)?Dealing with PDVSA can be a ""Catch-22"" - if you do not help them finance equipment, you might lose business. If you offer financing, you might lose part or all of your investment. Halliburton currently has more than $400 million of exposure to PDVSA. In Q2 2016, it exchanged $200 million of accounts receivable for an interest-bearing promissory note and recognized a pre-tax loss of $148 million. Halliburton did this for its ""primary customer in Venezuela,"" which I assume was PDVSA. The carrying value of the note was $116 million as of Q3 2017. PDVSA missed a scheduled principal payment on the note in Q3 as well. Total outstanding trade receivables in Venezuela is currently $429 million.In my opinion, Halliburton could sustain a $429 million write-off of receivables. In many ways, it has recovered from its failed merger with Baker Hughes that resulted in the company having to pay a break-up fee of several billion dollars. Halliburton now has $1.8 billion in cash and over $5.5 billion in working capital. The biggest risk to Halliburton could be a potential pullback in drilling activity and/or oilfield services in Venezuela. In Q3, it generated $530 million in revenue from Latin America, up 4% sequentially. The region represents 9% of total revenue. If Venezuela's problems metastasize to the rest of the region, then Halliburton could experience a sharp decline. Revenue from Latin America was as low as $415 million in the year-earlier period. Who is to say it will retest those lows?In Q3 2017, Schlumberger had a promissory note with a fair value of $184 million with its ""primary customer"" in Venezuela. The note was as much as $700 million previously. Schlumberger experienced an impairment charge of $460 million in Q3. I also understand that Weatherford and Baker Hughes have exposures to Venezuela of $158 million and $100 million, respectively.Schlumberger received 12% of its Q3 revenue from Latin America. Its revenue from the region fell 8% sequentially. It gave me the impression Schlumberger's management has decided to cut exposure to the region, particularly given its sizeable write-off in Venezuela. Weatherford received 16% of its revenue from Latin America. Of the major oil services firms, Weatherford has the worst balance sheet. Its $7.9 billion debt load currently exceeds 12x run-rate EBITDA. A pullback in Latin America could hurt Weatherford's operating income when it can least afford it.Of the major oil services firms, Halliburton appears to have the most exposure to Venezuela from a capital standpoint. It has been growing revenue in the Latin America, so a pullback could hurt growth prospects going forward. I believe Halliburton and Weatherford have the most to lose from a pullback in Venezuela and/or Latin America. I rate HAL a Hold and WFT a Sell."
4136161,101571,2018-01-09T08:19:29-05:00,Oil tailwind will lift growth in services.U.S. focus will give it an edge with Baker Hughes in turmoil.Political tailwinds could grow earnings for years.Previous earnings growth quick look.,"Halliburton Company (HAL) will have a nice oil tailwind helping to lift its results over the last quarter before its upcoming January 22 earnings call. Halliburton should be a primary beneficiary of the upcoming potential U.S. oil boom, especially with one of its main competitors Baker Hughes (BHGE) having key issues like General Electric's (GE) potential disgorging of the entity. Political movements look to have a meaningful impact on potential future earnings, sooner rather than later, as offshore drilling in the U.S. looks to drive additional spending for years if oil can hold its gains or appreciate.Earnings growth for Halliburton looks better and better the more oil stabilizes and appreciates as it has over the back half of 2017 and heading into 2018.HAL data by YChartsThe oilfield services sector experienced a dramatic decline during oil's dramatic price decline in the back half of 2014, and is looking to experience an outsized gain now as WTI crude oil has eclipsed $60 a barrel. With OPEC, Russia, and other non-OPEC producers extending their oil output-cutting deal until the end of 2018, the supply glut should continue to diminish, especially if global demand can grow over the next few years, as $60 oil seems to be the floor OPEC is looking for.Oil production in the United States should continue to grow because fracking companies have agreed to no supply constraints. This is a prime opportunity for companies working in the major shale areas of the U.S. to ramp up production following all the cost cutting and technological advances that were needed to survive the 2014 oil plunge.Source: Image from EIAWith fracking companies like EOG Resources (EOG) and Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) producing a couple of hundred thousand barrels of oil a day and a lot of the main fracking areas producing anywhere from 1-3 million barrels of oil a day, additional supplies from the U.S. are enough to make a big difference to U.S. oil companies without throwing the global supply and demand equation out of balance.According to Kuwait's oil minister in a recent Reuters report, the oil overhang is down 200 million barrels compared to the 5-year average with OPEC saying October OECD stood at $137 million barrels. OPEC is predicting oil levels will come into balance by late 2018 regardless of what U.S. shale producers can accomplish.Getting the oil out of the ground means using sand companies like Hi-Crush (HCLP), which was a first mover in the Permian, as well as oil services companies like Halliburton, Baker Hughes, and Schlumberger (SLB) and their technological advances. Schlumberger is a global powerhouse, so its focus is across the globe, and not as focused as a more North American-centered Halliburton. Baker Hughes is primarily a North American play, but since its merger with General Electric's oil and gas business in 2016, it has a lot on its plate in dealing with GE's collapse and what its fate will be as GE considers divestitures and other means to right its ship.GE data by YChartsThe drop in value for Baker Hughes last summer shows how much of a concern GE is for the company as other oil companies have rallied over the back half of the year instead of the dramatic decline that Baker Hughes sustained. Halliburton's technological advantages over smaller market cap U.S. services companies should give it an edge over most of the competition in the U.S., putting it in prime position to benefit from the upcoming upswing in potential oil production.Finally, political tailwinds continue to spring up including the latest plan by the Trump administration to expand offshore drilling in the U.S., including the Pacific Ocean, over the next 5 years. Combine this with the potential for a bi-partisan infrastructure bill, and there is additional possible upside for companies like Halliburton.Halliburton's latest earnings call was a beat with its CEO Jeff Miller saying ""Our North American business is hitting on all cylinders, and our international business proved resilient in a challenging environment."" Here is a quick look at some of the positives for the company after its last earnings call, which it hopes to build upon in 2018.Table by Trent WelshHalliburton is experiencing a nice recovery in the North American oil services industry, with continued growth over 2018 and potentially the next several years, as oil seems to have stabilized at around $60 a barrel. With a big focus in North America, and a technological advantage over many of its smaller competitors, Halliburton should be one of the biggest winners in the region, especially if political tailwinds continue to drive spending and opportunities.In the past, Halliburton experienced rapid declines with the price of oil and its businesses, so I would expect potential outsized price appreciation gains as oil prices stabilize, or even continue to rise, as U.S. shale production takes full advantage of OPEC and other countries' supply cuts. Best of luck to all."
4116779,31441,2017-10-26T10:39:25-04:00,HAL reported Q/Q revenue growth of 10% and EBITDA growth of 29%.Debt/run rate EBITDA is a respectable 2.7x.The rig count appears to have plateaued so the party could be over.Sell HAL.,"Halliburton (HAL) reported strong Q3 results as expected. The North America land drilling market has been white hot, and Halliburton is one of the biggest players in the segment. The rig count appears to have plateaued, so the party could be soon over.In Q2, Halliburton's North America revenue was up 24% sequentially, which powered the company's total revenue higher by 16%. This quarter North America revenue grew 14% Q/Q, while total revenue was up 10%.Revenue from the region outpaced the 6% rise in the rig count during the quarter. Drillers increased completions due to improved utilization and pricing. The company experienced higher activity across the majority of its product lines, primarily pressure pumping. Over 58% of Halliburton's total revenue is from North America so the company is in the right place at the right time.Outside of North America, Halliburton also reported solid results. Total international revenue of $2.3 billion was up 4% sequentially. Europe/Africa/CIS revenue was up 6% on improved utilization in the North Sea. Latin America revenue was rose 4% on higher activity in Argentina and Brazil, offset by reduced production in Venezuela.OPEC's supply cut has helped Halliburton in more ways than one. Everybody focuses on North America land drilling, but robust top-line growth has also spurred its operating income. While revenue was up 10%, Halliburton improved its EBITDA margin to 19% from 16% in Q2. The combination of margin expansion and top line growth drove EBITDA up 29% sequentially.On a run rate basis (Q3 EBITDA annualized), Halliburton's $10.9 billion debt load is now at 2.7x EBITDA; Moody's has a threshold of around 4.0x. Unless oil prices remain above $50, I do not believe the company can maintain this type of performance. However, Halliburton likely bought itself several more quarters before its debt load could potentially become an issue.Last quarter, management suggested shale oil plays were tapping the brakes on additional E&P. The premise was that as long as oil prices struggled to remain above $50, land drillers would be reticent to employ more capital. That premonition might now be coming to fruition. Through October 13, the U.S. rig count was 913, up 65% Y/Y. However, it fell by 15 versus the previous week. A declining rig count connotes less drilling in the oil patch.A decline in the rig count could negatively impact the company's revenue growth, particularly for North America:The other major key for the quarter was Halliburton's margin expansion. If its top line stalls next quarter or in the first half of 2018, its margins could flatten or even decline. This would remove another potential catalyst for the stock.North America land drilling carried HAL again this quarter. The rig count appears to have plateaued so the party could be over. HAL is down 9% Y/Y and I do not envision much upside from here. HAL is a sell."
4115927,69675,2017-10-24T14:29:36-04:00,"In this piece, I tackled both good and bad news for Halliburton and the stock's downward momentum in response to it all.That said, ONEOK made an announcement that should improve its future operations.Hess's decision to focus on core assets is also an encouraging sign that should leave investors pleased.","October 23rd was quite an eventful day for investors in the energy space. Despite some concerns by market participants, we seem to be sitting in a pretty narrow range that’s higher than what we’ve seen for most of this year. Beyond just the oil-specific data, though, there were a few companies that made newsworthy announcements during the day that investors would be wise to keep a tab on. In what follows, I will cover some of these firms and give my thoughts on what it should all mean for investors in them moving forward.For investors who don’t like the E&P side of the energy space, a valid alternative that offers, usually, impressive stability is the midstream space. Well, on October 23rd, the management team at ONEOK (OKE) announced an interesting arrangement that should have its investors happy. According to its press release, the firm has decided that it will expand on its West Texas LPG Pipeline.Today, the pipeline in question spans around 2,600 miles and the partnership covering it is 80% owned by ONEOK while Martin Midstream Partners L.P. owns the remaining 20%. In order to grow the pipeline, the partnership intends to invest $200 million that will allow it to stretch into the Delaware Basin, a particularly important section of the Permian Basin. Management expects this pipeline to be completed in the third quarter of 2018.At full capacity, the 120 miles of pipe will be capable of handling up to 110,000 barrels per day, but that’s not all that the firm’s cash is going toward. Based on management’s statement, some of the cash (though it has not been disclosed how much) will go toward two pump stations and “pipeline loopings” for existing sections of the larger pipeline. As of the time of this writing, management said that they had already reached an agreement with producers in the area to supply around 40,000 barrels worth of product per day. This number should only grow between now and completion, leaving investors with little in the way or risk.During the energy boom that led to these tough (but improving) energy times, companies had a habit of trying to grab a piece of every pie they saw. This led to a lot of trouble down the road, but it appears as though more players in the energy space are making the decision to focus, instead, on key operating assets. One such player that needs to be mentioned here is Hess Corp. (HES).In a press release issued on October 23rd, the management team at Hess announced that they have decided to sell their existing interests in offshore Equatorial Guinea to two firms. One of these is a fellow publically-traded energy company called Kosmos Energy (KOS), and the other is Trident Energy. This mature field produced an impressive 28,000 boe (barrels of oil equivalent) per day in the first half of this year, so this is a rather sizable asset. They have been an 85% paying interest holder and have been the operator of this asset up until this sale.Without factoring in any closing adjustments that may arise, Hess expects to collect $650 million from the sale, but they don’t intend to waste it on something like a dividend or share buyback. Rather, the firm said that they will allocate these proceeds toward their offshore areas in Guyana.Management positioned the move as one where the business wants to move away from more mature, developed assets, and will instead focus on core development assets that have the potential for high initial returns in order to maximize shareholder value. Personally, I love this kind of strategy because it’s capital optimization that leads to the greatest value generation for firms in the long run.Finally, we arrive at Halliburton (HAL), a massive energy services firm with a large stake in the North American energy market. On October 23rd, the management team at the company announced strong financial results that, initially at least, sent shares moving a bit higher. However, the day ended up far worse than it had started, with shares closing down around 2.5%.At first glance, this may seem like an odd turn of events. After all, management reported sales of $5.44 billion for the quarter. Not only is this 42.1% above the $3.83 billion seen the same quarter last year, it is also $90 million greater than analysts anticipated. What’s more, the company’s earnings per share for the quarter came out to $0.42, which beat forecasts by $0.05 per share. To see a firm’s share price drop after a beat on both the top line and the bottom line is rare but certainly not unheard of.The reason for this move lower is, quite simply, that there’s now the expectation for Halliburton’s performance moving forward to correspond quite heavily with the US land rig count. While a material year-over-year increase in this does exist right now, we have seen rigs come offline in recent weeks as energy firms have pledged to scale back capital expenditures and as an unwarranted amount of pessimism has kept prices from rising higher.That said, I think there might be a more significant reason behind concerns related to Halliburton’s future. You see, even though we have seen a general downturn in drilling productivity in major US energy basins (driven by companies picking second-rate locations for new wells as the low-hanging inventory of top-notch wells has been taken), rig productivity rates are still quite high. This means that companies can extract more oil and gas with fewer rigs in operation.In the month of September, for instance, Baker Hughes, a GE Company (BHGE) stated that the total US rig count came out to 940 units. Although this is well above the 509 units seen the same time last year, we’re below the 1,930 units in operation seen in September of 2014. Despite this difference, oil production, for instance, in the lower 48 states in the third quarter of 2014 averaged 6.98 million barrels per day. Today, that number is 7.10 million barrels per day.It is true that the deeper, more intensive wells being drilled should be a net positive for a company like Halliburton, but in all likelihood, the cap that should come about for Halliburton, absent a continued rise in the rig count, could limit its growth potential and since 93.4% of its increase in revenue came from North America, it’s precisely here that investors were looking for continued upside.Based on the data provided, I must say I like what I’m seeing here with ONEOK and Hess. The management teams at both companies seem to be making wise decisions that should help position these firms for a more prosperous future. In the case of Halliburton, the picture is less convincing. It seems as though upside for the firm for the foreseeable future might be limited.That said, this doesn’t mean investors should consider investing in it. After all, the growth seen in the quarter was impressive compared to last year and operating cash flow of $1.46 billion in the year-to-date results far outpaced the net outflow of $2.76 billion seen during the same period of 2016. It’s just that you probably shouldn’t anticipate getting rich off the firm."
4090016,22148,2017-07-24T19:29:21-04:00,Halliburton easily surpassed Q2 analyst estimates.The company is correctly positioned for the marginal spending in the US shale market.The stock has already priced in years of growth that isn't going to occur with oil below $50/bbl.,"Before the open, Halliburton (HAL) reported generally strong quarterly results despite the challenging commodity environment. The results show the promise of the domestic focused oilfield services company, but the sector issues could outweigh those benefits. The stock has now slipped back into the low $40s following the big quarterly beat. With Halliburton trading at the recent yearly lows, is the stock worthy of a long-term investment?Halliburton beat Q2 analyst estimates by $0.05, but in a lot of ways the results further highlight the disappointment in not closing the Baker Hughes merger. The ability to consolidate the domestic oilfield services sector and avoid the $3.5 billion termination fee would've make this a killer stock to own in the future. The company though is no dog being positioned for growth in North American shale drilling. For Q2, Norther American revenue surged over the 2016 levels while other regions like Europe and the Middle East saw declines. Source: Halliburton Q2'17 earnings releaseHalliburton is now positioned with 56% of revenues from the key North American market that will provide the growth engine for future spending on drilling and completion services. This fact though doesn't necessarily make the stock a buy due to valuation concerns. The company was clear on the earnings call that shale drillers are pulling back from spending as oil prices stay below $50/bbl. Q2 started with oil prices jumping above $50/bbl. The CEO made the following comments on the earnings call (via Reuters):One needs to keep in mind that Halliburton only earned $0.23 per share in the crucial Q2. For the company to earn over $2 per share in 2018, the oilfield services giant would need to double these earnings levels next year.The market though isn't set up for a further ramp in spending. If anything, the current spending levels were the peak until the demand equation improves. The key investor takeaway is that Halliburton is best positioned in the sector for a rebound in demand for drilling and completion services. The North American market will attract the marginal dollars, but the stock is already priced for a big rebound in demand that isn't going to happen at this point. Paying $42 for a stock that isn't even going to earn $2 in 2018 doesn't add up. Wait for a better deal here despite Halliburton showing the promises of being domestically focused.

Tap the brakes on HAL.,"Halliburton (HAL) delivered stellar Q2 results. It practically had to. The company is a stalwart in the shale fracturing space which is white hot right now. However, it could be time to tap the brakes on the stock.Results From North America Were GaudyThe North America rig count doubled Y/Y and shale plays were more than willing to feast on higher oil prices driven by the OPEC supply cut. Halliburton practically pioneered shale fracturing. The renewed drilling activity in the oil patch was in the company's wheel house.Results from North America were gaudy, up 24% sequentially. Halliburton receives 56% of total revenue from the region; outsize performance in North America drove total revenue growth into the double-digits. Halliburton sold out of its pressure pumping equipment and benefited from pricing power in its well construction product lines. International revenue rose 7%. The seasonal rebound in drilling activity in the North Sea and Russia was expected; however, I was surprised by the growth in Latin America which I expected to be dragged down by the weak economies of Brazil and Venezuela.Are Shale Customers Tapping The Brakes?Management expects North America to outperform next quarter and for international markets to be flat. Given the company's heavy reliance on North America management's outlook could still equate to double-digit revenue growth. However, management indicated there were signs that spending in the oil patch could be waning. First of all, Halliburton experienced a decline in average sand pump per well. This could portend that rising sand prices have prompted operators to optimize science in the completion of wells at the expense of sand; it could also mean operators are cutting back on sand usage to avoid an inventory build up in case drilling activity declines.Secondly, management intimated the rig count could flatten and North American shale plays could tap the brakes on additional E&P:With the Dow (DIA) over 22,000 stocks appear to trade based on sentiment. By cutting oil output OPEC has spurred oil prices and the share prices of energy-related names. However, increased oil output from shale oil plays has complicated OPEC's efforts to support prices. OPEC supply cuts and shale output to fill excess supply cannot go on in perpetuity. If the rig count has plateaued then it could behoove investors to exit energy names before their earnings are impacted early next year.HAL reached a 52-week low earlier this week and the stock is off 6% since Q2 earnings were released. If investors fear North America E&P or oil prices have peaked then HAL could fall further.EBITDA Growth Not EnoughHalliburton's EBITDA rose 35% sequentially, outstripping revenue growth. Its debt/EBITDA is now at 4.7x, higher than the 4.0x Moody's wants the company to achieve this year. The company needs to maintain EBITDA while continuing to cut its debt load. However, cash of $2.1 billion is down from the $10.1 billion it had on hand at Q4 2015. A strong Q2 might be enough to keep Moody's at bay for now. If its revenue and earnings decline due to slowing E&P then investors could question whether HAL has enough cash to survive another industry downturn.ConclusionHalliburton reported strong Q2 results, but North America E&P might have plateaued. Tap the brakes on HAL before the stock falls further."
4114950,24018,2017-10-20T03:15:06-04:00,"Energy services company Halliburton reports earnings on Monday, October 23.Energy prices stabilized through the quarter.  Halliburton's shares meandered.This article outlines several pre-earnings data points and what to watch for in the earnings release.","Halliburton (HAL) reports 3Q 2017 earnings before the market opens on Monday, October 23.Here're a few of the signals I suspect may portend what I expect to be a good report:Shortly after the end of the previous quarter, Reuters consensus analysts raised Halliburton 3Q estimates from $0.33 EPS to $0.37 EPS. Since that time, consensus forecasts remained steady.Currently, S&P 500 analysts expect HAL to earn $0.35 per share.Meanwhile, Zacks.com's most recent consensus falls squarely in between: 3Q estimates call for $0.36 EPS. Zacks also notes more than half the estimates rose in the last 60 days, while just one analyst lowered expectations.When it comes to “making the numbers,” Halliburton's management has a fine track record. Over the past 14 quarters, the company hasn't missed an estimate, while beating the Street 8 times.Courtesy of ameritrade.comFor reference, during the 2Q 2017 earnings conference call, management set certain expectations by announcing several key items.Opinion: Generally rising earnings estimates, management's demonstrated ability to meet or beat the Street, and some positive 3Q developments are likely to provide an earnings tailwind.Heading into earnings, unusual options activity may signal a precursor.On October 18, Halliburton saw 9000 December 47.5 strike calls presumably purchased at $0.432. It's presumed a purchase since the option contract transaction occurred at the Ask price. Previous open interest was only 1511 contracts. At the time, HAL shares traded at $43.805. This buyer now controls 900,000 shares through the middle of December.Opinion: While this is a soft data point, at least one large investor expects Halliburton stock to rise into the end of the year. For this investor to simply break even on the trade, shares must rise by at least 9.4%. Indeed, a favorable earnings report is likely anticipated, since it's the only scheduled report before these options expire.The mid-October short interest report isn't scheduled to be released until after Halliburton reports. However, the previous report (end of September data) indicated short interest rose slightly versus mid-month. As a percentage of the float (3%) and days-to-cover (2.8 days), these figures are low.Opinion: Into earnings, HAL short sellers do not appear to be material.Newswires have been pretty quiet. Recently, there was market chatter about Halliburton acquiring the Fluor Corporation (FLR). I find the rumor to be unlikely, given Halliburton's debt situation.The company did an investor presentation in September.Since the end of the last quarter, WTI oil prices rose from the mid-$40s to the low $50s. While oil prices are not a proxy for the price of the stock/company performance, there is some correlation. I view this as net positive.I used to be strictly a fundamental investor. However, over the years I've come to appreciate technical analysis; perhaps even becoming a closet chartist. The technicals can offer a glimpse into investor sentiment, and how institutional investors may be behaving.Let's take a look at a couple HAL charts.First, a short-term 9-month daily:Courtesy of TD Ameritrade ToS platformWe find the stock fell throughout most of the year, though it rebounded in late August and September. However, going into earnings shares are rolling over again. The MACD and Chaikin Money Flow studies reinforce the point. Volume has been moderate. What's discouraging is the fact October oil prices firmed, but the stock didn't.Nonetheless, if shares stay above $43, I'll have no particular concerns. The benchmark is the 50-SMA.Opinion: An uninspiring chart, but lacking any clear catalysts I suspect traders are largely marking time. In October, shares began drifting lower. A good earnings report could perk things up.Next, here's a long-term, 3-year weekly:Courtesy of TD Ameritrade ToS platformA 3-year weekly chart offers greater perspective. As an investor (versus a trader), I prefer to helicopter up to the weekly charts. We can see how HAL reacted during the energy commodity crash, protracted downcycle, and recent price rebound. Currently, shares are nestled between the 8-week and 40-week SMAs. Recent weekly volumes are below average.The associated studies appear mostly neutral.Opinion: Given a good report on Monday, I expect HAL to continue to meander, though the stock should stay above the 8-week moving average. A breakdown below the shorter MA could signal a fall back to the $40 range. If I'm wrong and the company reports weak earnings, the report could trigger such a reaction.Historically, Halliburton's management offers positive earnings reports, meeting or beating Street estimates. I expect no difference on Monday. Several pre-earnings data points are aligned with this view. This is somewhat offset by neutral to negative charts.At a fundamental level, I want to see strengthening North American performance coupled with Halliburton's international operations holding the line. Total revenues should advance markedly to about $5.3 billion. Overall, operating margins are likely to beat last quarter's 8.2%. Management expects to grow N.A. business revenues faster than the rig count growth.In conjunction with the earnings release and call, I'll track several key metrics:Asset utilization (annualized revenue/total assets) – 2Q 2017 registered 78%, a boost from 69% and 59% in 1Q 2017 and 4Q 2016, respectively. Another utilization rate increase further confirms market rates and equipment supply/demand is stabilizing.Cash Flow – Through mid-year, operating cash flow was positive (a great improvement versus 2016), but the results are still anemic. Free cash flow remained underwater. The company needs to show much better figures in order to demonstrate it can operate in a $50/bbl environment. I believe we'll see that.Debt Management – The aborted Baker-Hughes (BHGE) deal shot holes in what was once a pristine balance sheet. An extended energy bust compounded problems. In 2017, long-term debt decreased modestly, but total net debt hasn't. Upon last check, the interest coverage ratio was below 2x. I'll be looking for better overall debt metrics. In addition, I plan to listen carefully to what management has to say about the situation.I'll also keep an eye on the diluted share count. It's been creeping up.Bigger picture, I don't expect any changes to management's basic strategies. The Halliburton ""winning"" prescription remains:Notably, major competitor Schlumberger (SLB) is running for margins/returns, not market share. Over time, we shall see how that plays out.Please do your own careful due diligence before making any investment decision. This article is not a recommendation to buy or sell any stock. Good luck with all your 2017 investments."
4089957,92586,2017-07-24T15:22:44-04:00,"The writing was on the wall, as Schlumberger's 2Q17 performance in U.S. land helped to preview Halliburton's second quarter results
        Schlumberger and Halliburton seem to disagree most on the industry outlook for the second half of 2017
        If I were to seek exposure to the energy services sector today, I would probably favor SLB","The writing was on the wall.After peer Schlumberger (SLB) reported notable strength in U.S. land last week, Halliburton (HAL), whose revenues are mostly generated in North America, delivered a top- and bottom-line beat this Monday morning. Revenues of $4.96 billion were up 15% sequentially to the highest level since 4Q15, while non-GAAP EPS of $0.23 beat consensus estimates by five cents.Credit: ReutersThe themes that came out this morning, at least in what pertains to the quarter results, did not diverge much from what Schlumberger had reported on Friday. Halliburton saw North America revenues rise +83% YOY and +24% sequentially, with completion and production (up +20% quarter-over-quarter) outperforming drilling and evaluation (up +9% sequentially). The performance suggests that pressure pumping and well construction in U.S. land remained strong in the quarter and helped to drive top-line momentum, more so than a +14% sequential increase in U.S.-based rig count in the quarter would have indicated.Where Schlumberger and Halliburton seem to disagree most is on the industry outlook for the second half of 2017. Whereas CEO Paal Kibsgaard and his team defended the idea that ""the activity outlook in North America for the second half of the year remains robust"" and that there are ""positive signs in the international markets with increases in activity and new project plans starting to emerge in several GeoMarkets"", Halliburton offered a much bleaker vision for the quarters ahead:The remark falls in line with SVP Mark Richard's earlier statement that ""the U.S. shale drilling boom is likely to ease [in 2018] as demand on the industry's service sector is unsustainable"". To enrich the bear case, Halliburton reported on today's press release that, internationally, ""the overall market continues to move sideways with continued pricing pressure"" helping to offset strength in the U.S. As presented during Halliburton's earnings call, ""the company does not expect a near-term rebound in the international markets for several reasons, including the lengthy contracting cycles that will mute any near-term pricing inflection, and a lack of confidence in commodity prices"".Amid the mixed signals sent by two of the three largest energy service providers in the world, the Street has gone into risk-off mode and punished HAL during today's trading session. The stock is down about -4% mid-day, after being up as much as +3% in off-hours trading this morning.Source: NasdaqIn my view, the stock's poor performance today is indicative of investor skepticism over a struggling and choppy oil price recovery (see WTI price history graph above). The reaction is not unlike SLB's -1% drop on Friday, even though the company delivered an all-around beat along with optimistic remarks about the near-term future.As a result of negative market sentiment and near-term uncertainty about the macro landscape, it becomes increasingly hard to make a call on HAL based on the company's fundamentals. And as the graphs above suggest, valuations have come down significantly over the past 18 months, but arguably not enough to qualify HAL as a bargain play.In the end, I would be cautious about an investment in HAL at current levels. If I were to seek exposure to the energy services sector today, I would probably favor SLB as a result of (1) greater geographic diversification that helps to spread out operational risk, (2) management's optimism over 2H17 that could be more company-specific than macro-related, and (3) valuation multiples that are comparable to HAL's and don't seem to price in a significant premium over its peer.Note from the author: if you have enjoyed this article and would like to receive real-time alerts on future ones, please follow DM Martins Research.

4115342,31441,2017-10-23T03:12:18-04:00,HAL should report solid results driven by another strong performance in North America E&P.I expect management to tamp down expectations about capex spending going forward.If Q3 is a high water mark for North America E&P then HAL is a Hold.,"Halliburton (HAL) reports Q3 earnings Monday. Analysts expect revenue of $5.35 billion and EPS of $0.37. The revenue estimate implies 8% growth sequentially. Investors should focus on the following key items:North America land drilling was characterized by cut-throat competition after oil prices diverged to the downside in the second half of 2014. Large players like Halliburton and Schlumberger (SLB) have ended their price war, which has allowed oil services firms to actually make money. The OPEC oil supply cut has raised prices above $50, more than high enough for shale oil plays to open the spigots. That portends more spending on oil services.Increased drilling inured to the benefit of Halliburton last quarter. Revenue from each region saw Y/Y increases, but revenue from North America was downright gaudy, improving by 24%. Since the company receives 56% of its revenue from the region, it remains in the catbird seat.I expect more of the same this quarter. Through mid-October, the North America rig count doubled versus the same period last year. That implies more land drilling activity from North America, which is in Halliburton's sweet spot.All good things must come to an end. Last quarter, management intimated shale oil plays might tap the brakes on additional E&P:Schlumberger's Q3 revenue from North America rose by double-digits, yet it intimated that [i] North America land drillers were moderating their appetite for investment in the region and [ii] focused more cash flow management than unbridled expansion.If the white-hot land drilling market cools, then what will be the next catalyst to Halliburton? Secondly, it would be naive to assume OPEC can carry the burden of cutting supply while other drillers enjoy the benefits of higher prices. The outlook for HAL could be dismal going forward.Halliburton's $3.5-billion gift to Baker Hughes (BHGE) after its failed merger ravaged the company's balance sheet. That's capital that could have been used to pare Halliburton's $11-billion debt load. Debt is now at 4.7x run-rate EBITDA, and exceeds the 4.0x Moody's expects from the oil services giant. Q2 EBITDA was up 35%. EBITDA margin was 16%, up 200 basis points versus Q1.The double impact of rising revenue and expanding margins should help Halliburton again this quarter. However, if Q3 is a high water mark for North America E&P, then Halliburton's credit metrics could become a point of emphasis in the first half of 2018.TakeawayHAL is down 10% Y/Y. If Q3 is a high water mark, then the stock is a Hold into earnings."
4115496,92586,2017-10-23T13:38:06-04:00,"Strength in North America, previewed by Schlumberger's solid results in the region, drove Halliburton's revenues and profits up in 3Q17.Because Halliburton was more conservative in its outlook for the second half of 2017, I believe the results will be well received by the Street.HAL looks inexpensive on the peer group and year-ago comparisons.","The beat did not really surprise.After Schlumberger (SLB) delivered another decent quarter that was driven by continued strength in North America land, Halliburton (HAL)- whose North America business represents 58% of total revenues - followed suit.Source: jobzdaily.comRevenues of $5.44 billion beat consensus by $90 million and represented YOY improvement of 42%, by far the strongest growth rate of the three-year long downcycle. On earnings, Halliburton delivered a five-cent beat on EPS of $0.42 driven not only by higher revenues, but by much better margins as well. A quarter-over-quarter drag to the bottom line came from a higher tax rate, without which the company could have produced another two cents in earnings per share.The table below compares the performance of the quarter to 2Q17's non-GAAP results, along with my estimated impact to EPS of the sequential change in each major P&L line:Source: DM Martins Research using data from company reportsHalliburton and its big brother Schlumberger shared more similarities than differences in their results for 3Q17, with a key difference in the international business. While Halliburton saw revenues outside North America grow 5% YOY, Schlumberger experienced minor YOY revenue contraction across all geographies outside its home continent.Another important point of differentiation, one that could result in HAL performing better than SLB immediately after the earnings release, was Halliburton's conservatism around the outlook for the back end of the year. The reader might remember that, in 2Q17, the company had started to warn the investing community that ""rig count growth (was) showing signs of plateauing,"" and that a ""tapping of the brakes (was) happening all over the place in North America."" Having set expectations lower ahead of 3Q17, Halliburton has proved that it can manage the challenges well, and will likely be better positioned to win investors over. Schlumberger, more confident last quarter that ""the activity outlook in North America for the second half of the year remained robust,"" had a harder time on Friday caveating its story and justifying why near-term results might not live up to heightened expectations.On the stock, HAL continues to look very attractive compared to its peers. Forward EV/EBITDA of 13.5x is lower than both SLB and National Oilwell Varco (NOV), with long-term EBITDA growth expectations a healthy 20%. Halliburton's trailing FCF yield of 4% is by far the best within the peer group, which is good news considering the importance of liquidity during times of cyclical weakness in the sector.Not unlike SLB, I believe HAL will likely come out of the oil and gas downcycle stronger than most energy service companies, and could benefit from a leaner, more consolidated landscape once oil prices recover. With the stock price and valuation multiples lower today than they were a year ago (despite the evident improvement in key macro factors), HAL could end up being a rewarding long-term investment.Note from the author: If you have appreciated this article and would like to receive real-time alerts on future ones, please follow D.M.

4109028,101863,2017-09-24T07:36:31-04:00,"Although the historical results have been less than stellar, Halliburton is well positioned for the upcoming oil price recovery.Sell-side analyst forward expectations for the company's top-line have improved in the year-to-date period, and I expect this newfound trend to continue at an accelerating rate.This article walks the reader through my reasoning for my BUY rating.","Halliburton (HAL) is well positioned for the oil price recovery that I expect in the remainder of the year and in 2018. Primarily due to its relatively inexpensive valuation, improving fundamentals, bright growth prospects, strategic positioning and advantages over its primary competitor, I rate Halliburton a BUY.The following tables show the rapid deterioration in Halliburton's annual revenue, operating income and net income in the last three fiscal years:I note that in fiscal year 2015, the company broke even, and in 2016, it showed billions of dollars in net loss primarily due to the significant drop in revenue driven by persistently low oil prices.In the most recent four quarters, however, the company has sequentially grown its top-line at an accelerating rate with each quarter:Sell-side analyst forward expectations for the company's top-line have also improved in the year-to-date period:HAL Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year data by YChartsI keep close tabs on both global oil demand growth factors and supply dynamics by country.

But Halliburton shareholders need not worry: as I discussed in my article, Don't Get Used To A Declining Rig Count, the quicker-than-expected decline in global oil inventories, will soon lead to higher oil prices, and drillers will likely want to hold on to the rigs and fracking crews that they have under contract in anticipation. This has significant favorable implications for oilfield service companies such as Halliburton and Schlumberger (SLB).Halliburton noted in its latest annual report that:This is extremely positive for long-term Halliburton shareholders as the company has emerged even stronger from the cyclical downturn, just as management predicted in the earnings calls throughout 2015.Halliburton's fundamentals have also improved more quickly than its primary competitor, Schlumberger. The following graph compares Halliburton's top-line recovery with that of its competitor, showing a stark contrast in the last quarter:HAL Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) data by YChartsManagement noted in the last quarterly earnings release that the results were primarily driven by continued strengthening of market conditions in North America, which were partially offset by pricing pressure internationally. Management added:As I discussed in, OPEC Breaks Down U.S. Shale Growth, the vast majority of global supply growth in 2017 and 2018 is expected in North America, which bodes very well for Halliburton. Furthermore, Rystead Energy also recently indicated that completion activity in U.S. shale plays is set to increase substantially in 4Q17 and in 2018, which also is very positive for Halliburton.Primarily due to its relatively inexpensive valuation, improving fundamentals, bright growth prospects, strategic positioning and advantages over its primary competitor, I rate Halliburton a BUY.As my followers know, I keep a close eye on oil market dynamics as energy prices affect many of my investments.

4089827,33291,2017-07-24T10:09:28-04:00,Following SLB's report our expectations for HAL grew higher.Q2 earnings are out and the company delivered superior returns on the back of North American strength.Continued pricing pressure.,"Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) has just reported earnings and they were a home run when taken as a whole. Recall this is an oil service stock that I have traded many times over the years despite having long preferred rival Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB). I recently discussed the latter which amazed me when it delivered a much stronger Q1 than I expected. It was a quarter that showed a slow return to better conditions thanks to operational efficiency, but it is still reeling from the pain of depressed oil. After the Schlumberger report my expectations were raised for Halliburton because they are so very similar in many respects, with their differences primarily in their positioning and global presence. Regardless, they tend to trade in tandem, and of course are in many regards a type of options play with dividends on the price of oil.There were very notable strengths and weaknesses this quarter. That said, with extreme cost savings initiatives having morphed Halliburton into a leaner, more efficient company, we need to get back to looking at the fundamentals to determine the keys to survival beyond just oil prices, and we must carefully consider the performance of the names on an individual basis, even though both are so heavily dependent on oil prices.With oil prices so low of late compared to years past, it had for many quarters led to year-over-year pain, with lower revenues and earnings pressure. That reversed here this quarter. It has been painful, no doubt. But let's be clear. The higher the price of oil, the better it is for Halliburton and Schlumberger, and the entire oil space. That's just a fact that is true for all of the oil service names. But there are of course specific operation related steps the company can take to maximize earnings potential, and it has been doing so, for several years. This quarter, Halliburton knocked it out of the park with a beat against analyst expectations on revenues and earningsThe revenue number was impressive year-over-year and the earnings beat was by a very wide margin. Both were well ahead of what I expected for the quarter. Well, despite an earnings beat, a comparison to last year clearly demonstrates the pain the company has been experiencing. There is little improvement. Of course, it should surprise no one, with oil having dropped to decade lows. Remember in the sequential Q1 this spring the company reported a loss from continuing operations of $32 million, or $0.04. Taking into accounts adjustments, earnings came in at $0.04 per share. Here in this quarter, the company swung to a nice gain. Income from continuing operations was $28 million, or $0.03 per share. Adjusted income from continuing operations (which accounted for a market value adjustment associated with an expected promissory note in Venezuela) came in at $201 million, or $0.23 per share.How did this happen? Strong revenues and controlled expenses. Revenue this quarter was $4.96 billion, representing a 16% increase versus the sequential Q1, and a 30% increase from the year ago quarter. This is indeed solid performance. Over the last two years, the company has slashed its expenditures in just about every category. At the same time revenues were up in every category this quarter. Commodity pricing and services rendered are driving revenues, so the bottom line can thus be impacted by watching spending. Let me be crystal clear. The bottom line has been maintained by executing on its efficiency plans. The company anticipates continued pressure ahead. Commenting on the overall performance, Jeff Miller, President and CEO stated:North America continues to be an incredibly strong highlight for the company. Further, capital expenditures are being controlled, as clearly demonstrated by strong operating income reflected in the bottom line earnings. I see these expenditures remaining low, but being bumped up a bit in 2017. Still, I think the big story here is that while Schlumberger management sees an emerging oil recovery, the above CEO commentary here suggests that there will be continued pricing pressure and sideways action. What is clear? Neither see further declines in oil ahead. While the market will dictate whether the bottom is truly in, I maintain a hold rating on the name.Quad 7 Capital has been a leading contributor with Seeking Alpha since early 2012.

The deals represent continued competition for any technology that can increase efficiencies and reduce costs in the intensely competitive oilfield services industry.Expect to see more consolidation in the industry, as private companies potentially lose out vs. publicly held firms that have bigger war chests to acquire scale and efficiencies.Target CompaniesTulsa, Okla.-based Summit (reportedly acquired by Halliburton) was founded in 2010 to engineer and manufacture electric submersible pump (ESP) systems.Management was founded by John Kenner, who was previously president of Baker Hughes Centrilift, where he held several positions from 1991 to 2009. In 2014, Summit claimed to be the ""number three supplier of ESP pumps and services in North America and projected to the number two supplier by December 2014.""Houston, Texas-based Multilift (acquired by Forum Energy) has developed improvements to ESP systems by developing its patented SandGuard and Cyclone completion products. As the company says, ""these innovative products extend the useful life of an electrical submersible pump by protecting it against falling sand and other solids after shutdown.""Sand fallback is the number one cause of ESP failure in unconventional wells, and the video below shows Multilift’s solution to the problem:Acquisition Terms and RationaleTerms of the two deals were not disclosed by any of the participants. It was reported that Halliburton wanted to complete the acquisition of Summit before the close of the merger of Baker Hughes (BHI) and GE's (NYSE:GE) oil and gas group, which was announced on Monday, July 3, 2017.Neither Halliburton or Forum Energy have filed an 8-K, which would be required if the transaction resulted in a change of financial condition, so it is likely the purchase price was not material to either company’s financial condition. Rather, the deals for ESP technologies are a sign of the intensifying competition for any conceivable efficiency advantage in the oilfield services market for fracking and other unconventional oil and gas recovery operations.I have written extensively about the oilfield services sector since several companies have filed to go public as oil prices have stabilized in the wake of the drop from above $100/bbl in 2014, to its current level of $45 to $50/bbl. Few oilfield services companies have succeeded in going public in the current environment, despite management's highlighting of their growing rig counts and high capacity usage. Their financials can be charitably described as ""challenged,"" since they are losing money and cash quickly in what must be due to a brutal pricing environment.Hence, companies like HAL and FET are acquiring firms and technologies that will enable them to compete more cost-effectively for well completion services. Severe competition is driving continued efficiency enhancements in the oilfield services market, so it is not surprising to see companies with the resources to acquire those technologies moving aggressively to secure them before less well-capitalized competitors can do so.

4076503,56142,2017-05-25T13:20:38-04:00,"Oil prices appear to have plenty of upside, barring a major recession in demand globally.Halliburton sells the leading fracking and refracturing technologies oil drillers will use in the next upcycle.The company is well positioned financially to fund organic growth.Momentum indicators are highlighting strong demand for the stock by investors the last two years.","I have mentioned Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) in several articles this year as a great momentum selection, risk-adjusted, to climb in price with the advent of an oil industry upcycle. It remains a solid choice based on my proprietary Victory Formation momentum models. The company is the second largest oil field services company globally by sales, next to Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB).Consolidation in the oil services sector has been a headline for several years after the biggest oil bust since the mid-1980s, during 2014-16. With crude oil falling from over $100 a barrel to under $30, investment in exploration and drilling worldwide has dried up significantly. Huge 30%-50% revenue declines at the largest companies have led to employee layoffs, restructurings, cost cutting and the merging of failing business structures with stronger industry leaders like Halliburton, Schlumberger, and Baker Hughes (BHI).Halliburton attempted to combine its business with Baker Hughes in 2015-16. However, U.S. anti-trust concerns eventually forced the proposal to be suspended. Halliburton had to pay $3.5 billion in break-up fees to Baker Hughes when the merger failed. Baker Hughes quickly switched gears and agreed to combine with the General Electric (NYSE:GE) oil & gas services unit. The BHI/GE deal is facing anti-trust scrutiny also, and will likely require some divestiture of overlapping businesses where a 40% to 50% market position would prove anti-competitive.For Halliburton, an overall sales decline from $33 billion in 2014 to $16 billion last year proved challenging, as the company aggressively reduced costs to fit market demand. HAL has written off some $7 billion in accounting equity and restructuring costs since 2014. At the same time, weak oil investment activity is forcing the company to refocus and rebrand its unique technologies and integrated solutions for the industry. Halliburton is today well capitalized and positioned in the marketplace to grow revenues and profits strongly as oil drilling activity increases over time.Oil price outlook is improvingInvestors with a long-term horizon are quite worried a meaningful oil price spike will be reality over the next 2-3 years, as slow exploration and drilling activity outside the U.S. could curtail global oil production dramatically. The IEA organization is warning ultra-low oil prices in 2015-17, well below the sustainable cost of production worldwide, may translate into a shortage of product a few years out. Specifically, the International Energy Agency is predicting slowly growing overall demand will outpace supply by 2020, using current estimates of production from planned well development and older field depletion rates. Even in the U.S. where light tight oil (LTO) shale production has risen during 2017, the IEA is anticipating subdued growth in production the next five years at sub-$55 oil prices.According to Dr. Fatih Birol, the IEA's executive director in March,OPEC announced Thursday, production restraints started in early 2017 will continue throughout the year. The OPEC effort is credited with keeping worldwide inventories from growing in 2017, and the feeling among market participants is OPEC cuts lasting a few more quarters will allow above ground stocks to begin a long-term cycle decline.In addition to overseas oil exporters desperately wanting higher prices to fund government spending and keep oil workers employed, the kingdom of Saudi Arabia is preparing the largest Initial Public Offering of a single stock in history during 2018. The nation is attempting to initially sell hundreds of billions of dollars in underlying oil company value to help raise money to diversify its economy away from energy. This ambitious effort roughly equates to putting half the country's assets in a publicly traded equity. The background idea is Saudi rulers can easily raise cash in the future, as they sell shares from their majority stake to fund investments in their economy. The formerly state owned monopoly, Aramco market capitalization is expected to be in the $2-3 trillion range at $50 to $60 crude oil. Of course, it will be worth considerably more if oil prices jump the next 12 months. You can see the incentive Saudi Arabia has to cut production today and juice the international oil price for the IPO next year.Overall, as long as global demand continues to expand, a price rise in crude oil back above the sustainable long-term cost of production in the $65 to $70 a barrel range is inevitable. The longer it takes for the current price to climb above $50 in 2017-18, the more likely a shortage spike above $100 becomes from a lack of investment in new oil fields.The biggest ""worry"" for inflation-rate watchers of all stripes, consumers, businesses and investors alike remains the negative economic effect from an oil supply shock. For example, any new Middle East war with an associated and currently unexpected supply shock could deplete bloated oil inventories quickly and generate a spike in oil to $80+ almost overnight.I strongly believe calls for sub-$50 oil epitomize wishful thinking and simple trend following at this stage of the oil price/production cycle. My view is only a sizable drop in demand from a global recession can keep the oil price below the cost of production much longer. In conclusion, either prices rise now or rise later in the decade. The point is prices long-term will climb from $50 a barrel, and new well exploration, drilling and development activity is bound to increase from the 2016-17 low point.Halliburton's leading position in oil servicesThe company is one of the best positioned to benefit from rising U.S. shale production specifically and a coming pick-up in oil services demand globally. It invented hydraulic well fracking in the 1940s. Halliburton is the leading expert in the refracturing technologies fueling American oil production growth of late. Perhaps the lowest cost avenue to pump more oil from underperforming wells and older shale varieties left for dead, refracturing expands extraction rates and extends the existing life of oil deposits, especially in America. It is estimated just 5% of U.S. wells have used refracturing techniques to date. So, there exists oversized potential for Halliburton sales growth if oil prices start rising.Below is information on the customer value proposition, Halliburton's Activate Refracturing Service provides:Business in 2017 is already accelerating at such a brisk pace, Halliburton's new CEO last week announced price hikes of 10%-20% are coming to pay for bringing older equipment back into service and hiring new employees at higher wage rates than a few years ago. Wall Street analyst consensus projects a jump in 2017 revenues to $20 billion from $16 billion last year, and $25 billion in 2018, or 25% annual growth each year. The significant bump higher in sales is also being formulated under the assumption of a low oil price environment. You can imagine the outcome will be even brighter for many years into the future, if oil prices climb meaningfully into 2018, and overseas producers increasingly adopt and demand Halliburton's refracturing technology solutions.Halliburton may also represent one of the bigger investment opportunities of a Trump presidency and Republican majority in Congress. With Halliburton's greater than typical political connections, including former Republican Vice-President Cheney as CEO, Trump's less strict EPA standards (deregulation) and jobs first focus could improve the company's business outlook tremendously without any uptick in oil & gas prices.Improving profitabilityPutting the fundamental pieces of the puzzle together, Halliburton could be on the cusp of a multi-year surge in operating business profitability. Wall Street consensus forecasts earnings per share rising smartly from breakeven in 2016, to $0.96 in 2017 and $2.70 next year. Plus, this forecast was made before last week's price increase notice to customers. The 2018 sales estimate of $25 billion is still 25% below the 2014 peak number. I fully expect a better drilling activity situation globally in a few years could support new records for sales and profits by 2019-2020. An optimistic forecast would place sales at $35 to $40 billion by 2020, with earnings per share in the $4.00 to $5.00 range, using past margins on sales as a predictor. However, it is entirely possible Halliburton products will entertain great demand in North America; profit margins will be higher than the last cycle; and, results for shareholders will be equally impressive.Strong financials and liquidity near a cycle bottomHalliburton appears to be well positioned financially to grow its business, after a successful restructuring period in 2015-16. The company intelligently prepared for a prolonged industry downturn a few years ago. It took advantage of ultra-low interest rates in the U.S. economy by issuing $7.5 billion of debt during 2015, with annual interest costs ranging between 2.7% and 5.0%, plus long-term maturity dates of 2020-45.For the March quarter reporting period, the company held $10 billion in current assets vs. $4 billion in current liabilities and $16 billion in total liabilities. Since the majority of Halliburton liabilities are low cost, long-term varieties not due for many years, the company can use its $6 billion working capital position and $3 billion in 2017 estimated operating cash generation to expand the business organically. Financial liquidity remains excellent if oil prices rebound, bringing new business orders for the firm.The equity market capitalization is $40 billion at a $47 stock price, against $4 billion in tangible book value. I would prefer a higher tangible book value number, but the whole oil and gas industry has undergone a decimation of balance sheet accounting worth in the latest oil bust. Holding $4 billion in tangible book value against $6 billion in net liabilities beyond current assets is only slightly leveraged from my perspective.Halliburton's common equity is priced at a premium 13x annual cash flow estimated for 2017 by Wall Street analysts, against a 10-year average around 10x. The premium may be deserved if business trends continue to improve and Wall Street investors discount future growth. Price to 2017 sales projections stand at 2.0x today vs. a 10-year trailing average around 2x sales.Momentum considerations for the stockYou can view Halliburton's progress vs. competitors and peers on charts drawn the past few years of trading. The relative strength in Halliburton is a testament to its strong balance sheet position and better than typical demand for its oil well products/services. I have pictured below comparisons of relative industry outperformance during periods from one month to two years. I am contrasting HAL vs. the overall U.S. market S&P 500 index [^GSPC], the VanEck Vectors Oil Services ETF (NYSEARCA:OIH) peer group, and competitors Schlumberger, Baker Hughes, National Oilwell Varco (NYSE:NOV) and Weatherford International (WFT).Final ThoughtsThe upside for Halliburton shareholders is the potential for high rates of renewed business growth from another U.S. oil boom. If refracturing activity explodes in the U.S. incentivized by improving oil profits at drillers and explorers, HAL could be a top name to own in the sector. With leading fracking and refracturing technologies and services, global Halliburton sales are primed to grow substantially the next 2-3 years from an ultra-depressed level in 2016.I mentioned Halliburton as a strong buy on weakness choice during January in this Seeking Alpha article. I outlined the mid-$40s price point as an area I would purchase Halliburton shares in another article from March. We have been bouncing around this buy zone for a few weeks. I expect it to hold, barring a large bear move in the U.S. stock market generally. Basically, the HAL stock price is projected by my momentum system to outperform the S&P 500 over the next year.Please continue to research Halliburton's prospects for investment on your own, if interested in purchasing shares for your portfolio. Carefully weigh the pros and cons of a rise or fall in crude oil prices on the business valuation, and don't be shy about consulting an experienced financial adviser before entering any security position."
4066047,32971,2017-04-27T10:05:11-04:00,"Leading-edge prices for well completions in U.S. Land (which account for two-thirds of the total well cost) are up as much as 20-25% from year-end 2016.While the price momentum is impressive, oilfield service providers' margins will lag in the near term.As activity accelerates, the industry has to absorb significant ramp-up costs.At the same time, growth in activity in North America creates a headwind for oil prices, putting in question the pace of recovery in International.","Halliburton's (NYSE:HAL) first-quarter report corroborates the bifurcated nature of the current cyclical recovery in oil: the upcycle in North America Land is in full swing, whereas international activity is still in the process of bottoming. Halliburton commented:Being the leading oilfield service provider in U.S. Land, Halliburton has strong leverage to the upcycle currently underway in North America Unconventionals. The company's worldwide revenue in the first quarter increased 6% sequentially, with the strong growth in North America Land more than offsetting a seasonal decline and pricing pressures in International. Halliburton's large market share in Brazil also helped, as Brazil was one of very few bright spots in International in first quarter, with activity in this major market showing momentum.In terms of exposure to the early upcycle in oil, Halliburton is, arguably, more favorably positioned relative to its primary competitor Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB). Schlumberger has benefited strongly from its heavier bias towards International, where activity levels and margins have remained relatively stable throughout the downturn. However, as the global oil cycle begins to turn, stronger exposure to International becomes a mixed blessing.U.S. Land Business Booming Again, Causing Growth PainsHalliburton's first-quarter U.S. Land revenue increased by nearly 30% sequentially. Total North America revenue was up 24% from the previous quarter. Completion and Production services led the recovery, driven primarily by improved pricing and utilization in pressure pumping as well as the strength in well construction product and service lines.The 30% revenue growth in U.S. Land is a clear indication that Halliburton has been aggressively reactivating idle capacity. Aggressive reactivations would also explain Halliburton's low incrementals, which were in the 20% range in North America in the first quarter and are expected to be in a ~25% range in the second quarter.By comparison, Schlumberger posted a 66% incremental margin in North America pressure pumping and directional drilling in the first quarter. Schlumberger appears to be just starting major capacity reactivations and is also likely to face ""growth pains"" as the year progresses.The ""growth pains"" mentioned by Halliburton include significant costs related to equipment reactivation, hiring and training personnel and funding working capital. Supply chain bottlenecks and inflation is also increasingly a factor. Halliburton commented that frac sand has been one of the items in short supply but expects shortages to abate as the second quarter progresses (which appears optimistic, given the pace of industry-wide activity ramp-up and the trend towards enhanced completions).Strong pricing gains and higher utilization have offset these expansion costs. However, the uplift in margins that one might expect in the context of the powerful upcycle in U.S. Land is yet to materialize.Once the costs of capacity reactivation are absorbed, Halliburton should see more impressive incrementals. The improvement should be amplified by the full portfolio continuously moving up on pricing, as older contracts roll over to higher market rates.Full capacity utilization is another factor creating a margin tailwind. Halliburton commented that it is beginning to enjoy greater operating efficiencies in the tight market:International Remains ChallengedThe cautious outlook for International that Halliburton expressed on its previous quarterly call has proved quite accurate. The company's results in International are yet to establish a bottom.In Europe-Africa-CIS, Halliburton's first-quarter revenue declined 11%, driven by reduced activity in West Africa and seasonal slowdown in the North Sea and Russia.In Middle East-Asia, revenue declined 12% as a result of reduced pricing and activity across the region.The following comments from Halliburton capture the trend:Halliburton believes that the first quarter represents the bottom in the Eastern Hemisphere rig count. However, the company is not expecting a strong rebound in activity in 2017. Therefore, due to the long-term contractual nature of international markets, the company expects to see continuing price pressure.In the near term, Halliburton expects discounts to offset activity gains, leading to lower cash flow.In Conclusion…The upcycle in North America Unconventionals is robust and should lead to meaningful production growth by year-end and going into 2018.This outlook in combination with resilient production trajectories from mature fields and continuing growth in the Middle East, Russia and legacy developments coming online in the next few years create a headwind for activity growth in International.For major oil service providers, the ""upcycle in margins"" may prove to be gradual.It is difficult to disagree with Halliburton's general assessment:However, the bottom in activity in the international market is not the same thing as the bottom in operating margins. An acceleration in activity levels is required for an upward momentum in margins.About OIL ANALYTICSOIL ANALYTICS remains one of the most active offerings on Seeking Alpha's Marketplace, with 200+ exclusive materials posted for its members since the beginning of this year alone (a total of 1,000 non-public materials available to members).Through our analyses, OIL ANALYTICS accurately anticipated the recent correction in natural gas and recent correction in crude oil, as well as subsequent recoveries.Our macro and company-specific views are continuously illustrated in our Model Portfolios and Best Stock Ideas modules.Disclaimer: Opinions expressed herein by the author are not an investment recommendation and are not meant to be relied upon in investment decisions.

4064609,33291,2017-04-24T11:43:26-04:00,"Schlumberger and Halliburton are so very similar in many respects but the latter has been outperforming.Q1 earnings are out and I discuss key results.North America is a highlight, but oil prices remain the key concern.","Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) is an oil service stock that I have traded many times over the years despite having long preferred rival Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB). I recently discussed the latter which delivered a decent Q1 that showed a slow return to better conditions thanks to operational efficiency, but it is still reeling from the pain of depressed oil. That said, both Schlumberger and Halliburton are so very similar in many respects, and the differences are primarily in their positioning and global presence. Regardless, they tend to trade in tandem. With extreme cost savings initiatives having morphed Halliburton into a leaner, more efficient company, we need to get back to looking at the fundamentals to determine the keys to survival beyond just oil prices, and we must carefully consider the performance of the names on an individual basis, even though both are so heavily dependent on oil prices.To determine where the stock may be heading here in 2017, aside from oil prices, we need to talk about recent performance. Again, with oil prices so low of late compared to years past, it has crushed the company's performance relative to past years. It has been painful, no doubt. When looking back two or three years ago, we have certainly dropped off in way of performance. It is a simple association really. The higher the price of oil, the better it is for Halliburton and Schlumberger, and the entire oil space. That's just a fact that is true for all of the oil service names. But there are of course specific operation related steps the company can take to maximize earnings potential, and it has been doing so, for several years. That said, Halliburton delivered this time around and beat analyst expectations on revenues and earningsThese beats were slight, but ahead of what was expected nonetheless. Well, despite an earnings beat, a comparison to last year clearly demonstrates the pain the company has been experiencing. There is little improvement. Of course, it should surprise no one, with oil having dropped to decade lows. The company once again saw a loss from continuing operations of $32 million, or $0.04. Taking into accounts adjustments, earnings came in at $0.04 per share. This beat analyst estimates by $0.01 per share. Adjusted operating income was $34 million in Q1 2017, down from the adjusted operating income of $276 million in Q4 2016, the sequential quarter. Halliburton's total revenue in Q1 was $4.28 billion a 6% increase quarter-over-quarter. This beat estimates by $20 million.It is key to realize that expectations were once again drastically low, thanks to oil prices. So these beats should be taken with a grain of salt. A big one at that. Still, Halliburton managed to control expenses, and really this is the key to survival for this sector right now. Over the last two years, the company has slashed its expenditures in just about every category. That's really all that matters in the short run and really what you need to keep an eye on. Commodity pricing and services rendered are driving revenues, so the bottom line can thus be impacted by watching spending. The company has maintained profitability to the best of its ability by controlling expenses. Commenting on the overall performance, CEO Dave Lesar stated:An expanding rig count in Q4 paid off here in Q1 2017 with North America being a strong highlight for the company. Further, capital expenditures are being controlled. I see these expenditures remaining low, but being bumped up a bit in 2017. First quarter revenue in North America increased 24% sequentially, and this was far better than SLB. This result was primarily driven by increased activity in pressure pumping and well construction product service lines. Overall, I had low expectations this quarter. There is concern outside of North America, but these will be quelled provided oil prices remain stable and/or rise. I maintain a hold rating on the name, but am optimistic for the coming quarters especially if oil moves higherNote from the author: Quad 7 Capital has been a leading contributor with Seeking Alpha since early 2012.

4076078,31441,2017-05-24T10:46:43-04:00,HAL CEO Dave Lesar recently decided to retire. The move should not come as a surprise.The collapse of HAL's merger with BHI triggered a $3.5B break-up fee to BHI.Now HAL's balance sheet is in disrepair. An equity raise could cause the stock to fall due to dilution or negative sentiment.Avoid HAL.,"Halliburton former CEO Dave LesarHalliburton's (NYSE:HAL) Chief Executive Officer Dave Lesar will retire on June 1 and will be replaced by fellow Halliburton board member Jim Miller:Miller has a reputation of leading successful projects within Halliburton and working well with customers and employees. The decision comes after Halliburton has been reeling from an oil industry downturn that began in the second half of 2014.In my opinion, Lesar's departure as CEO should not come as a surprise. He led the high-profile attempted takeover of Baker Hughes (BHI). The transaction was rejected by regulators over concerns that the acquisition would not have been good for customers, and the combined entity would have wielded outsized power in certain markets around the world. Not only did the deal take up management's attention, but Halliburton had to pay a $3.5 billion break-up fee to Baker Hughes. Such a high-profile failure might have signaled the beginning of the end of Lesar's tenure as CEO.Halliburton's Balance Sheet Is In DisrepairI was bearish on HAL after the failed merger and sizeable payout. However, oil prices rebounded from their Q1 2016 lows and shares of oil services companies surged with them. I expected HAL to crater on the news; however, HAL is up about 45% since the failed BHI merger in May 2016, masking the company's weak financials. My previous article described how Halliburton needed to raise nearly $3 billion to avoid a Moody's ratings downgrade:The company repaid $1.4 billion of long-term debt in February, which surprised the markets. It signaled that Halliburton wanted to prove to Moody's it could cut its debt load via free cash flow. That said, Q1 results were pretty good, yet debt/EBITDA still remains above 5x and Halliburton is still in need of equity. Otherwise, it risks having its debt downgraded and its cost of capital increase during a period when oil prices are shaky. An equity raise could spook HAL bulls due to the potential dilution and the appearance as if the company has been mismanaged. Such an event could be a source of embarrassment for a firm with a reputation for size and financial soundness.Pressure Pumping In FocusAccording to Reuters, the CEO's first task will be to renegotiate contracts with oil drillers and convince them to pay up for pressure pumping and other services. Since Q4 2016 Halliburton has become more selective in the business it takes on, which has aided pricing for oil services. Shale oil plays have been major beneficiaries of OPEC's supply cuts. In Q1 the land rig count rose by 35% and the increased drilling helped Halliburton grow its North America revenues 24% sequentially.There are still oil services firms like Weatherford (WFT) and National Oilwell (NYSE:NOV) with challenged balance sheets, so drillers could potentially play vendors against one another to keep prices down. Secondly, there is no guarantee the oil supply cuts can go on in perpetuity. When they end, oil prices could fall and drillers' earnings could fall with it. That's a long-winded way of saying shale oil plays must fill their coffers while they can before OPEC or China headwinds remove the punch bowl. That portends resisting any proposed price increases from Halliburton.TakeawayDave Lesar's retirement likely means Halliburton is close to raising equity. An equity raise could cause the shares to fall due to dilution or negative sentiment towards the stock. Avoid HAL."
4064902,101633,2017-04-25T09:06:44-04:00,"Halliburton's earnings suggest that North American output has rebounded while global outlook remains clouded.The company outlined a path to stabilized margins in the medium term, but remained wedded to protecting market share.Halliburton clearly deserves a premium over Schlumberger, but is pricey at current levels.","OverviewEarnings season is in full swing with Halliburton (NYSE: HAL) reporting quarterly results this morning. The company reported headline EPS of $0.04/share and revenues of $4.28B. The company beat FactSet consensus estimates by $0.01/share and ~$20MM, respectively. The shares advanced by 1.4% in early trade only to end the session lower by nearly 1%. Overall, the shares remain down ~14% YTD held down by weak oil prices. Our view continues to suggest a wait-and-see approach to the service sector with preference for SLB on valuation.Source: FactSetThe BeatHalliburton delivered a beat on the top line and bottom line, amid low expectations and continued weakness in oil prices. The company remains heavily leveraged to North American drilling, which has given it a strong premium to rival Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB). Shares currently trade at ~25.0x EV/EBITDA while rival Schlumberger trades at ~17.6xEV/EBITDA. Both metrics are well below 5-year highs seen before the oil price collapse.Source: FactSetHalliburton has a strong advantage in location, given the fact that it receives 41% of its revenues from the United States. This is important because US shale players have upped their spending plans and have begun drilling as prices have stabilized near the $50 level. The short-cycle advantages of shale have yet to emerge outside of the United States and, therefore, are continuing to plague global competitors as long-cycle plays are continuing to be avoided until the oil price outlook is more certain.Halliburton's advantage in the North American region is obvious when examining growth in US land revenues. For the quarter, the company posted a 30% sequential growth in US land revenues, outpacing rig count growth of 27%.Source: FactSetGrowth in the North America segment has been supported by escalating rig counts. This trend is expected to continue as rig additions will be needed to hit EIA forecasts for US lower 48 production of 9.2 mmb/d and 9.8 mmb/d in 2017 and 2018, respectively. We expect that this trend will support Halliburton earnings as the downturn in oil prices abates and a new upcycle emerges.The Bottom Line: Margin Pressures RemainHalliburton confirmed our initial beliefs on service sector margins developed after assessing Schlumberger's earnings on Friday. Overall, it appears that an inflection point for Operating and EBITDA margins was reached in late 2016 as new well demand improved with oil prices.Source: FactSetIt appears that margin acceleration has been driven by improving revenues from the North America segment, coupled with accretion from cost cutting programs put in place during the downturn. From the EBITDA margin chart, it is clear that further margin expansion must be accompanied by price increases that have yet to take full effect.On the company's call, President Jeff Miller concluded that pricing pressures will continue to persist and that the company is looking to retain market share to ensure a solid operating position in the coming upcycle. This appears to be fair logic, but is also a bet on improving oil prices in the medium term as incremental pricing increases on existing contracts are not economical in the current cycle.The OutlookHalliburton will heavily lean on its North American segment for growth. Below is the consensus estimates for annual geographic segment growth rates through 2019.Source: BlackVault InvestmentsRevenue growth in the North American segment has continued to receive attention from the analyst community as revisions have been bullish.Source: FactSetOptimism regarding the North American segment points to a continued rise in shale output accompanied with an increasing rig count.Perhaps more notable, however, is the operating margin dynamic.Source: BlackVault Investments ResearchIt is clear that North America will be a growth driver for Halliburton as short-cycle shale output expands at a faster pace than long-cycle, global projects. This will certainly give Halliburton a premium to globally diversified Schlumberger in the medium term. More importantly, an expected rise in North American margins indicates a positive outlook on service cost inflation. Service cost inflation has received little attention in markets and will be critical in pushing oil price breakevens higher in the medium term.ConclusionHalliburton's results confirm persisting weakness in service sector margins while pointing to a rebound in North American activity. Halliburton will indeed be able to leverage its location and command a premium to global competitor Schlumberger as short-cycle shale dominates new output. The company outlined a medium path to normalized margins while also clarifying its stance on market share protection.

4064425,31441,2017-04-23T21:17:40-04:00,"HAL reports Q1 earnings Monday.
        North America will likely sizzle, but international markets could stymie the company.
        HAL's balance sheet remains challenged.
        HAL remains a sell until it shows consistent growth in revenue and EBITDA.","Source: Getty ImagesHalliburton (NYSE:HAL) reports Q1 earnings Monday morning. Analysts expect revenue of $4.26 billion and eps of $0.03. The revenue estimate implies 6% growth sequentially. Investors should focus on the following key items:North America Should Be Stellar ...The rise in oil prices into the mid-$50 range was a spurred North American shale plays during the quarter. In Q1 U.S. well completions and the rig count rose Q/Q by 23% and 25%, respectively. That portends robust growth in the sale of equipment and services to drilling companies. Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) reported 6% sequential growth in total North America revenue, and 16% growth in fracturing revenue.Halliburton receives about 45% of its total revenue from North America. It helped pioneer shale fracking so its revenue from the segment should be stellar. Last quarter the company was choosier about which business it undertook; an improved pricing environment amid more drilling activity should be a boon to the company this quarter.... But International Could HurtInternational markets could stymie the Halliburton this quarter. Schlumberger's Q1 revenue from international markets was off 7% sequentially, causing total revenue to fall 3%. A severe seasonal decline in drilling activity plagued both Europe/CIS/Africa and Middle East/Asia. I would expect Halliburton to also see headwinds these markets. Latin America revenue for Schlumberger flat. However, Halliburton finances a certain portion of Venezuela's purchases of services and equipment. Credit problems at Venezuela's state-owned oil company -- PDVSA -- could hit Halliburton in this quarter or the next. Expect management to speak to its exposure to PDSVA on the earnings call.The Balance Sheet Remains ChallengedHalliburton had to pay a $3.5 billion break-up fee for its failed merger with Baker Hughes (BHI), damaging its balance sheet. Oil prices and energy-related stocks rebounded in the first half of 2016, masking Halliburton's balance problems. If the company does not reduce its debt/EBITDA to 4.0x in 2017, Moody's could downgrade the company below its current Baa1 rating.In a move that surprised the markets, Halliburton pared debt by $1.4 billion in February. I project it must cut debt by another $2.8 billion in order to meet Moody's expectations, yet its does not have enough cash on hand to do so. The other alternative is to raise equity or rapidly grow EBITDA; rapid EBITDA growth might not occur unless international markets cooperate.ConclusionInternational could stymie Halliburton this quarter. The stock remains a sell until HAL can generate consistent growth in revenue and EBITDA."
4064330,40351,2017-04-23T00:51:11-04:00,"Halliburton will release its quarterly results on Monday.
        The North American market continues to recover in terms of activity and pricing, which was confirmed by Schlumberger.
        Halliburton will likely post higher revenues, on a sequential basis, driven by ~26% increase in revenues from North America.
        The company’s profits, however, could fall.","Halliburton (NYSE:HAL), the world's second-largest oilfield services company, is gearing up to report its quarterly results before the opening bell on Monday, April 24. Halliburton has been slowly turning around on the back of the upturn in the US drilling activity. In the first quarter of 2017, however, Halliburton's profits might come under some pressure, but its turnaround story will continue.The US rig count has been climbing since last summer following stability in oil prices in the $45 to $55 a barrel window. As per data from Baker Hughes, the US rig count has climbed from an average of 421 rigs in 2Q2016 to 480 rigs in 3Q2016 to 586 rigs in 4Q2016. That's driven Halliburton's recovery. The company has seen its earnings (adjusted) climb from a loss of $0.14 per share in 2Q16 to a profit of $0.01 per share in 3Q2016 and $0.04 per share in 4Q2016. Since then, drilling activity has climbed further, mainly in the US land and Canadian markets, and this was confirmed recently by Halliburton's biggest competitor Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB).On Friday, Schlumberger released its quarterly results in which it reported an adjusted profit of $347 million, $0.25 per share, in-line with analysts' estimates. Its revenues, however, slid 3% from 4Q2016 to $6.89 billion, missing analysts' estimates by $100 million. In North America, the company's revenues actually climbed 6% sequentially as the rig count in the US and Canada increased by 27% and 56% respectively in the corresponding period.The uptake in activity occurred in the land market (SLB land revenues witnessed ""double-digit"" growth) which completely offset the negative impact of persistent weakness in the US offshore (mainly the US Gulf of Mexico) market. Schlumberger said that it has witnessed stronger hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, activity and greater uptake of directional drilling products and services. In addition to this, Schlumberger said that pricing has also improved aided by the increase in capacity utilization.Still, Schlumberger could not post a sequential increase in revenues, thanks to continued weakness in international markets. Schlumberger typically gets more than 70% of its revenues from international markets and 30% from North America. Halliburton, however, is in a better position to profit from the above-mentioned strength in the North American market since it has greater exposure to this region. In fact, Halliburton is the largest provider of fracking services in North America. In 4Q2016, Halliburton got 45% of its total revenues from North America.In 4Q2016, Halliburton posted 4.9% increase in total revenues on a sequential basis driven by 8.7% increase in North America revenues. That growth came at a time when the rig count in the US and Canada climbed by approximately 22% and 48%, data from Baker Hughes shows. In 1Q2017, the rig count growth accelerated and pricing has also improved, as per Schlumberger. In this environment, for 1Q2017, Halliburton could post double-digit growth in revenues from North America and high-single-digit growth in total revenues on a sequential basis.As a reminder, last month, Halliburton said that it is increasing its focus on maintaining market share by deploying more resources than it initially planned at a faster pace. If the company is successful in retaining market share, then its North America revenues should grow by around 27% (in-line with the US rig count growth) to more than $2.2 billion.Halliburton, however, has also warned that its costs will rise significantly as it adds new resources and increases its US land workforce by around 2,000 employees. This will have a negative impact on Halliburton's earnings in the first half of this year. For 1Q2017, Halliburton has said that its earnings will be in the low-single digits. This means that its EPS, unlike revenues, could fall from $0.04 per share in 4Q2016. But the pain will be temporary as the company will be in a better position to retain its market share and post a strong recovery from 3Q17.Note from author: Thank you for reading.

HAL remains a sell.","Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) reported Q1 revenue of $4.28 billion and EPS of $0.01. The company beat on revenue by $20 million. I had the following takeaways on the quarter.North America Was The Stalwart Again...Halliburton calls itself the ""execution company"" and Q1 results showed why. I expected North America revenue to be strong, but even I was not prepared for Halliburton's impressive performance in the region.Total revenue was up 6% sequentially, besting Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) whose revenue fell 3%. Results from North America were downright gaudy with revenue growing 24%. The U.S. land rig count was up 35% sequentially and 46% Y/Y, connoting outsized drilling activity in the oil patch. Halliburton practically pioneered shale fracking, and revenue growth in North America dwarfed Schlumberger's 6% growth during the quarter....But International Stymied The CompanyInternational (48% of total revenue) stymied the company; revenue from international actually fell 8% as the international rig count fell 8% Y/Y. Depressed oil prices caused some clients to reduce capex and delay new projects. Latin America was a pleasant surprise; revenue in the region increased 8% due to increased well completion in Brazil and pressure pumping activities in Mexico. Europe-Africa-CIS declined 11% due to reduced activity and a seasonal decline in drilling activity in Russia and the North Sea. Middle East-Asia was 12% due to reduced drilling activity and a loss of pricing power.Management believes North America land drilling activity can remain robust with oil prices at $50. The problems facing international markets - reduced budgets, deferral of existing projects and dismal economic growth - could be intractable. At some point, oil prices will have to be driven by demand, and economic growth outside the U.S. has been anemic. I expect international to stymie Halliburton for the rest of the year regardless of what North America does.EBITDA Margins ImprovedWhite hot drilling activity in North America combined with improved pricing equates to higher EBITDA margins. EBITDA of $586 million was up 14% sequentially and 3% Y/Y. EBITDA margin was 14%, up from 13% in Q4 2016 and flat versus the 14% margin achieved in the year earlier period. Halliburton's EBITDA margin still has not approached the 18% achieved in Q1 2015, and I do not expect it to.At current oil prices, I believe international will stymie Halliburton. If oil prices turn down, then Q1 could be as good as it gets for the company in 2017. The ramp-up in shale production has been good for oil services firms, yet it has pressured oil prices. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) thinks oil prices could be on the brink of capitulation:If oil prices diverge to the downside, then that could pressure Halliburton's revenue and EBITDA. Its $10.9 billion debt load is now at 5.3x trailing EBITDA - junk levels. For me to turn bullish on HAL, it must continue to grow revenue and EBITDA. That likely means it needs OPEC to extend its oil supply cut, and for international markets to rebound. I do not see both events happening.ConclusionAnimal spirits returned to the oil patch in Q1, yet animal spirits alone will not save HAL. The stock remains a sell."
4054910,33291,2017-03-14T10:25:35-04:00,Halliburton is reportedly still exploring acquisitions while the oil market is in a fear state.Aker solutions is a profitable oil and gas services company.What the deal means and when it would go through.,"Where have I seen this before? If you have not heard by now, Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) is reportedly close to reaching a deal to acquire Norwegian oil services company Aker Solutions or its key subsea unit. This would be a sizable purchase. Now I know what it reminds me of. It reminds me of the drama surrounding the company's attempt to purchase Baker Hughes (BHI) last year. Ok in fairness, these are two very different companies and the Baker Hughes transaction faced tremendous regulatory scrutiny. In the end, Halliburton ended up simply burning billions of dollars in the failed attempt. Of course, there is an approval process for this possible purchase with Aker, but won't be anywhere near what the company went through with BHI. It as in interesting time to pursues deals with a bearish oil market and fear spreading.The difference with this transaction is that Aker isn't a massive multi-billion dollar conglomerate that is a powerhouse in the industry. However, Aker is wholly state owned by Norway. The deal will go through. In fact the negotiations with Halliburton for the sale of all or part of Aker Solutions has been going on for a while time, and according to the report, ""a deal is ready to be signed."" Of course, Aker will not confirm anything, but indicated that the investment company regularly speaks to other companies about ""ideas and opportunities.""You may recall brief snippets about potential interest in Aker at the beginning of the year. I didn't cover it at the time given that it was pure speculation about a possible sale of Aker Solutions. Of course, like all things with investing, the speculation or idea of the sale drove up the share price of Aker 20%. That will likely mean either a lower premium paid by Halliburton, assuming they came to the table with a set price range. Or, it could mean Halliburton pays a little more for the deal.So what will the purchase of Aker mean for Halliburton? Let us assume they purchase the entire company. Well Aker, although state owned, isn't exactly local or small. The company has over 14,000 employees in 20 countries. The company is a provider to the oil and gas industry. It has products and services to help the industry at all stages of a product. This includes exploration, development, production and ultimate decommissioning of completed projects. Its services focus on field planning, feasibility and concept studies, floater design, deepwater design and delivery, engineering and procurement services as well as a range of work for wellheads. All things Halliburton is already deeply involved in.Financially the company is sizable as well. At last check one USD was equivalent to 8.6 Norwegian Krone. Last quarter, Aker saw $NOK 6.1 billion, or just over $700 million USD. On top of that EBITDA was $NOK 380 million, or $44 million USD. This is a profitable and large company. Further, the company also saw about $500 million USD in orders in the quarter and has a backlog of over $7 billion USD.Bottom line? Aker is a solid fit for Halliburton's business model. Why they specifically are interested in Aker isn't exactly clear at this time, but with Halliburton selling of underperforming assets, the chance to buy a profitable company with strong infrastructure is compelling. As we are just now hearing the leaked news, we could see a deal completed before the summer.'Note from the author: Quad 7 Capital has been a leading contributor with Seeking Alpha since early 2012.

4065114,40351,2017-04-25T16:31:28-04:00,"Halliburton has recently posted rare revenue growth.The company hasn’t reported a commensurate increase in earnings and margins, but investors shouldn’t fret over this.Halliburton’s financial health, however, hasn’t improved meaningfully.","Halliburton (NYSE:HAL), one of the world's largest oilfield services companies, is recovering quickly, thanks to the surge in US drilling activity. But there is one crucial area where the Houston, Texas-based company hasn't shown any improvement yet.On Monday, Halliburton released results for the first quarter of 2017 in which it posted the first increase in revenues since the start of the downturn, which was the first quarter of 2014. The company said that it is benefiting from the uptake in drilling activity in North America, particularly the increase in demand for pressure pumping and well construction services in the US. The company saw completion and production revenues climb to $2.60 billion from $2.32 billion in 1Q16 and $2.27 billion in 4Q16. Total revenues increased to $4.28 billion from $4.20 billion in 1Q16 and $4.02 billion in 4Q16. The result was also ahead of analysts' consensus estimate of revenues of $4.26 billion, as per data from Thomson Reuters.Halliburton said that drilling activity in North America increased rapidly in the first quarter from the fourth quarter, thanks to the improvement in oil price environment. The price of US benchmark WTI crude averaged more than $52 a barrel in 1Q17, up from ~$49 a barrel in 4Q16. That fueled 27% increase in US land rig count. In this backdrop, Halliburton said that it has managed to increase its US land revenues by 30%. The outperformance of revenue growth as compared to rig count indicates that Halliburton may have gained market share. Halliburton's total North America revenues climbed 23.8% sequentially to $2.23 billion, which is commendable.Remember, in 4Q16, the sequential revenue growth of 9% seen in North America lagged far behind rig count growth of 23% in the corresponding period. Back then, Halliburton may have lost some of its market share to its competitors. But since then, Halliburton changed its strategy by making the protection of its leadership position in North America's market a top priority. The company previously said that it would rapidly deploy additional resources in North America to meet the increased demand and regain market share. The fruits of that decision were apparent in 1Q17.On the flip side, Halliburton has also previously warned that it will incur additional costs as it quickly brings idle equipment and other resources online. The company said that this would hurt its bottom-line in the short term, but will generate dividends in the long term. Not surprisingly, despite reporting an increase in revenues, the company did not post a commensurate increase in profits.For 1Q17, Halliburton reported an adjusted profit of $0.04 per share, which was flat from $0.04 per share seen in 4Q16 and down from $0.07 per share in 1Q16. The company's operating margin, as adjusted, also fell to 4.7% from 6.9% in 4Q16 and 5.4% in 1Q16. Furthermore, Halliburton has warned that its earnings will remain under pressure in the current quarter (2Q17) as well. But I believe earnings and margins should begin to improve from the third quarter as costs associated with reactivating idled equipment begins to decline.In terms of revenues and earnings growth, Halliburton has pulled off a far better performance than its rival Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB). Unlike Halliburton, Schlumberger saw its revenues and adjusted earnings drop 3.1% and 7.4% on a sequential basis to $6.89 billion and $0.25 per share respectively. But the one crucial area where Halliburton lags behind its bigger competitor is financial health.Schlumberger has one of the lowest debt levels in the industry, Halliburton, on the other hand, has one of the highest. The latter's debt problem stems from its failed attempt to acquire Baker Hughes (BHI) for $28 billion. In the latest quarterly results, Halliburton's total debt clocked in at $10.9 billion, down 11.9% from 4Q16 and 29.1% from 1Q16. But the company's cash reserves have also fallen significantly which has offset the positive impact of debt reduction.At the end of March, the company had $2.1 billion of cash reserves, down from $4 billion at the end of 4Q16 and $9.6 billion a year earlier. Consequently, Halliburton's balance sheet is actually looking even more stretched. Its net debt ratio has climbed to 49.5% from 47% at the end of 4Q16 and 30.8% in 1Q16. By comparison, Schlumberger's net debt ratio was at just 22% at the end of 1Q17.On a positive note, Halliburton does not have any significant ($1bn or more) near-term maturities. In the first quarter of this year, the company redeemed $1 billion of senior notes due September 2019, which was its only large near term debt. Now, the earliest major debt maturity will likely be the $1.1 billion of 3.5% senior notes due August 2023.In short, Halliburton still has a lot of work to do to fix its financial health. But the good thing is that the company, despite the weak earnings and a drop in margins, is heading in the right direction. The revenues are finally growing and with growth in the US drilling activity, earnings and cash flow growth will follow. That should put the company in a better position to reduce its debt load.Note from author: Thank you for reading.

4054318,31441,2017-03-11T03:50:27-05:00,"WFT recently hired former HAL CFO Mark McCollum as its new CEO.A Gabelli analyst believes HAL could acquire WFT.WFT's $7.5B debt is untenable at 30x EBITDA. Sans new money, it could go belly-up.I estimate HAL needs to raise over $2.5B to pare debt and protect its credit rating.HAL cannot afford to buy WFT. Both stocks are a sell.","Halliburton CEO Dave LesarEarlier this week Weatherford (NYSE:WFT) hired Mark McCollum, former CFO of Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) as its new CEO. Euphoria over the hire of the 36 year veteran of the energy sector sent WFT shares up about 8%. Gabelli analyst Simon Wong even suggested the hire could lead to Halliburton acquiring Weatherford:WFT investors could be in for a rude awakening. Halliburton will not buy Weatherford for the following reasons:Weatherford Is OvervaluedRising oil prices have helped oil services firms like Weatherford who have a major presence in North America land drilling. Weatherford has lost money for two consecutive years. It raised over $4 billion in 2016 to fund cash burn and push back near term principal payments. Of the leading oil services firms - Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB), Weatherford, Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI), Halliburton and National Oilwell (NYSE:NOV) - Weatherford has the highest trading multiple at over 51x EBITDA:The average multiple for the top firms is 39.1x. If Weatherford traded at this multiple it would have an enterprise value of $9.7 billion and an equity value of $3.2 billion; its equity value would be half of where it now trades.I believe Weatherford's balance sheet remains in despair. Over half its assets are tied up in goodwill and PP&E, which is difficult to monetize. Prior to Q4 2016 results, I estimated it was insolvent by $4 billion. It will likely worsen as its quarterly interest expense of $136 million exceeds its quarterly EBITDA of $67 million. Its $7.5 billion debt load remains untenable at over 30x EBITDA. Before even entertaining an acquisition, Halliburton should wait for Weatherford to [i] raise a few billion in capital to cure its insolvency or [ii] go belly-up.Halliburton Cannot Afford An AcquisitionThe fact is that Halliburton is strapped for cash and cannot afford an acquisition. Its pursuit of Baker Hughes helped cause the company's demise. The $3.5 billion break-up fee and other merger-related costs caused its net debt to increase from $5.8 billion in Q1 2016 to $9.8 billion in Q2. Coincidentally, McCollum was tapped by Halliburton to lead the merger integration of Baker Hughes. Its year-end debt of $12.4 billion is over 6x trailing EBITDA. Moody's wants the metric to decline to 4.0x this year.I previously estimated the company needed to pare debt by $4.2 billion to protect its credit rating. Last month Halliburton surprised the market by repaying $1.4 billion in debt. That implies it has another $2.8 billion to go. I recommend that Halliburton raise equity while the equity markets remain benign. A ratings downgrade combined with a rising rate environment could cause the company's credit costs to spike. Every 100 bps increase in borrowing costs would create over $100 million in additional interest expense. With heightened competition in the oil patch, Halliburton can ill-afford additional expenses.TakeawayIn addition to the billions it would cost to repair Weatherford's balance sheet, a Weatherford acquisition would drive Halliburton's debt/EBITDA up to 8.7x. Again, it would behoove the company to wait for Weatherford to go belly-up and buy its assets on the cheap. For now, Halliburton's main goal should be to raise capital and pare debt. I have a sell rating on both stocks."
4058911,40351,2017-03-29T15:23:19-04:00,"Halliburton has experienced a surge in demand for fracking services as US oil producers ramp up drilling activity.The company is deploying additional resources at an accelerated pace, which will hurt its profits in the first half of 2017.But this will allow Halliburton to preserve its market share at a time when rivals Schlumberger and Weatherford International are ramping up competition.","Last week, Halliburton (NYSE:HAL), the world's second-largest oilfield services company, warned that it would likely miss analysts' earnings estimates for the first quarter due to higher costs. That had a negative impact on Halliburton's stock, but the weakness can be a buying opportunity as the company is shifting into high gear.On Friday, Halliburton gave a half-hour operations update through a conference call in which Dave Lesar, the company's CEO, said that the first-quarter profit, on a per share basis, will be in the low single digits range. Analysts, on the other hand, were expecting a sharp increase in profits (as adjusted) from $0.01 per share in 3Q16 and $0.02 per share in 4Q16 to $0.13 per share in 1Q17, as per consensus data from Thomson Reuters. Those high expectations were driven by the surge in US drilling activity seen in the first three months of this year and the fact that Halliburton itself previously said that it was increasing its focus on boosting profit margins.Following the profit warning, analysts have already started to lower their estimates. In a research report emailed to me, analysts at Credit Suisse, led by James Wicklund, slashed their first-quarter earnings estimate to just $0.02 per share from $0.09 per share. Other analysts will also likely follow suit. Consequently, the consensus earnings estimate will likely decline significantly, which may have a negative impact on Halliburton stock. But investors shouldn't panic because the increase in costs, which will drag profits, is a short-term pain which will likely pave the way for long-term dividends.During the latest conference call, Halliburton said that the drilling activity in the US is climbing at a much faster pace than anyone expected. But that's something which is well known by pretty much everyone in the energy industry. The US rig count has been gradually climbing since last summer, and even the latest drop in oil prices to less than $50 a barrel has failed to put brakes on the recovery.As per latest data from Baker Hughes (BHI), there were 809 oil and gas rigs operating in the US last week, significantly higher than December's average of 634 rigs. The number of oil rigs has increased in every week of 2017, except for one. The growth has been driven by onshore or land-based rigs in the US which climbed 25% in 1Q17 from 4Q16.Moreover, US shale drillers are showing no signs of slowing down. In fact, some producers, such as Apache Corp. (NASDAQ:APA), are even preparing to outspend cash flows in orders to ramp up drilling activity and increase production.Consequently, Halliburton has experienced a surge in demand for fracking services from US drillers. In this backdrop, if the company were to continue to focus on improving margins instead of maintaining its position in the industry, then it could end up losing a large chunk of its market share to its competitors, particularly Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) and Weatherford International (WFT). Remember, the two companies (SLB and WFT) have recently joined forces by combining their North American fracking and completion units into a new joint venture to ramp up competition against the market leader, Halliburton. In this environment, Halliburton has made the sensible decision that it will no longer focus on growing profit margins. Instead, the company will deploy additional resources at an accelerated pace and earlier than initially planned at the start of this year to handle the growing demand while maintaining market share.""We are deploying nearly double the pressure pumping equipment than we originally anticipated reactivating for the entire year, and we are bringing that reactivated equipment out in the first six months of the year instead of over the course of the year,"" Dave Lesar said during the latest conference call.The above-mentioned plan will significantly increase the cost associated with adding new resources. Moreover, unlike the previous plan when these costs were spread over the course of the year, this time, a majority of the costs will be booked in the first half of the year. This means that Halliburton's earnings will remain under pressure in the first quarter as well as the second quarter. In addition to this, the company has also decided to increase its US land workforce by 2,000 employees, which will also likely have a negative impact on earnings. Some of the other costs, e.g. fracking sand costs, are also climbing, which will also hurt profits.On the flip side, this will allow Halliburton to preserve its market share. The company should be able to grow its revenues significantly as the market expands. Ideally, the growth of Halliburton's North America land revenues on a sequential basis should match rig count growth for the corresponding period.In the final three months of 2016, when the company was trying to improve its margins, its North America revenues increased by 9% sequentially, which was lower than the 23% increase in rig count for the same period. But following the change in strategy, North America revenues should climb by 25% in 1Q17, which would be in line with rig count growth, and continue moving this way in the future.I believe earnings growth will follow revenue growth, particularly in the second half of the year when costs will begin to decline. Strong growth in earnings in the second half of the year could offset the negative impact of higher costs seen in the first half. As a result, for the full fiscal year, the company's revenues and earnings will likely climb significantly. That should fuel the stock's recovery.Note from author: Thank you for reading.

4047469,31441,2017-02-19T16:10:16-05:00,"I previously estimated HAL needed to pare debt by $4.2B to avoid a Moody's downgrade.
        Last week HAL announced it would pay down debt by $1.4B. The stock sold off on the news.
        HAL will likely raise equity to pare another $2.8B in debt.
        WFT raised $4B in 2016. I registered to raise another $2.5B to help cure its $4B insolvency.
        Mimicking capital-starved WFT could cause HAL to sell off further.","It is getting very interesting in the oil patch. On February 14th Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) announced it was redeeming $1.4 billion in notes outstanding:The redemption could save about $83 to $86 million in annual interest expense. That is a good thing, right? However, HAL finished down 5% last week after the news was announced. I explain why below.Halliburton Needs To Pare Debt By $4.2 BillionOil prices are up and so is Halliburton's stock; HAL is up over 70% versus a 20% return for the S&P 500 (NYSEARCA:SPY). Its earnings have stabilized as well. Q4 EBITDA of $514 million was up 2% sequentially. Total revenue was up 5% sequentially. North America led the way with a 9% rise. The North America rig count continues to rise, which implies more drilling activity and more revenue for Halliburton.However, EBITDA was still off 40% Y/Y. Halliburton's $3.5 billion merger break-up fee to Baker Hughes (BHI) has damaged its balance sheet. At Q4 2016 debt/EBITDA increased to 6.0x from 5.1x in Q3 as trailing EBITDA fell faster than its reduction in debt.Moody's downgraded Halliburton to Baa1 with a negative outlook; it also wants the company's debt/EBITDA to fall towards 4.0x this year. At Q4 2016 Halliburton needed to reduce debt by $4.2 billion.Will Halliburton Mimic Weatherford's Equity Raise?The pending $1.4 billion debt reduction would reduce debt/EBITDA to 5.4x. It would also cause Halliburton's cash balance to fall from $4.0 billion to $2.6 billion. The company would need to pare debt by another $2.8 billion to appease Moody's. HAL currently trades at over 26x EBITDA. In my opinion, it would behoove the company to take advantage of its expensive currency by issuing equity to pare additional debt.Other firms also have challenged balance sheets due to spending on share buybacks or acquisitions when oil prices were much higher. National Oilwell Varco (NYSE:NOV) and Weatherford International (WFT) are examples. National Oilwell's net debt/EBITDA is at 5.8x -- greater than the 3.0x threshold Moody's is looking for. Moody's recently changed National Oilwell's outlook to ""negative."" Weatherford raised $4 billion in capital in 2016 -- over $1 billion of it was in the form of equity. In my opinion, Weatherford remains insolvent by $4 billion. It even acts insolvent; Weatherford recently filed a shelf registration to raise $2.5 billion in securities to help cure its insolvency and service its $7.6 debt load at 30x EBITDA.Investors give Halliburton the benefit of the doubt due to its number two ranking among oil services firms. An equity raise could change sentiment for the company. Investors could potentially lump it in with National Oilwell and capital-starved Weatherford. If HAL sold off after announcing its intentions to pare debt, imagine what would happen to the stock if or when it issues equity. It could create a panic amongst investors; it could also cause the entire oil services space to sell off out of fears that other firms could have challenged balance sheets.ConclusionQuestions remain whether OPEC will stick with its supply cuts or whether increased shale drilling will keep oil prices range bound. The last thing Halliburton needs now is for its cost of capital to rise. I expect a sizeable equity raise -- and potential sell off of the stock -- in the first half of 2017."
4054236,40351,2017-03-10T15:36:32-05:00,"US shale drillers are planning to boost oil production by significantly growing E&P spending.
        This could put brakes on crude oil’s recovery, which previously seemed to be cruising to $60 a barrel.
        That may cloud the outlook for oil producers, but could accelerate Halliburton’s turnaround.","The future of oil prices continues to look uncertain which clouds the outlook for oil producers. But the oilfield services giant Halliburton(NYSE:HAL) is well positioned to turnaround this year.The US drillers only produce a fraction of the global oil supplies, but they can still influence prices, as we've seen several times in the downturn. In fact, earlier this week, data from the US Energy Information Administration showed that domestic crude oil stockpiles climbed by 8.2 million barrels, thanks to the surge in oil production. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters, on the other hand, were expecting a 2 million-barrel increase. That pushed WTI oil price down by more than 5% to $50.49 on Wednesday. The increasing levels of US oil stockpiles, which have been consistently growing for the last nine weeks, threaten to frustrate Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries' efforts. The cartel, by partnering with 11 other nations, is trying to prop oil prices by curbing output.Interestingly, some US shale drillers have recently acknowledged, on the backdrop of an energy conference in Houston, that they are running the risk of producing too much oil. In fact, Harold Hamm, the founder of CEO of Continental Resources (NYSE:CLR) said that the US oil producers can ""oversupply the market,"" but they also ""have a great responsibility not to do so."" However, a number of US oil producers have said that they will significantly grow their capital budgets for this year as they ramp up drilling activity in order to boost oil production.For instance, Continental Resources itself has planned to increase capital expenditure by 77% from last year $1.95 billion in 2017. EOG Resources (NYSE:EOG), another major shale oil producer, will grow CapEx by 23% to almost $3.18 billion. Anadarko Petroleum Corp. (NYSE:APC) has planned to increase spending by almost 40% to around $4.6 billion. Apache Corp. (NASDAQ:APA) has increased its budget by 59% to $3.1 billion.If the US shale drillers aggressively grow production, then they could create another glut which may halt crude's recovery. At the start of 2017, it seemed that crude oil could cruise to $60 a barrel, but now, this is becoming increasingly unlikely. However, on the flip side, the sharp increase in exploration and production spending could accelerate the recovery of North America focused oilfield services companies, and there is no bigger company in this space than Halliburton.Halliburton has struggled with losses in the downturn but last year, the company started to show signs of a turnaround as US oil producers began to ramp up drilling activity from the second half of 2016. The final three months were the strongest for oil prices last year as WTI averaged a little over $49 a barrel, which fueled 23% increase in average US rig count. That drove the rebound of the Halliburton's North America segment. The unit, which has historically been the single largest source of revenues and earnings for Halliburton, has been consistently reporting losses for the last several quarters but in the final three months of 2016, it swung to an operating profit of $28 million.The above-mentioned increase in drilling activity largely occurred in Texas's Permian Basin where oil producers added more than 60 rigs in the final three months of 2016, as per data from Baker Hughes. Permian Basin producers, such as Apache Corp., will likely deploy even more rigs this year. Furthermore, other oil plays, such as the Bakken formation, that have lagged behind Permian Basin, will also witness an uptake in rig count as companies such as Continental Resources will also significantly ramp up capital spending. That will accelerate the recovery of Halliburton's North America business. The unit's earnings will likely continue to grow and will drive Halliburton's turnaround.Remember, before the downturn, in 2014, North America alone was responsible for almost 70% of Halliburton's operating income. The segment's contribution to the company's bottom-line has shrunk since the region was hit the hardest in the downturn. In the fourth quarter of 2016, the North America unit represented just 8.4% of the company's total operating income. But the company's earnings in North America will likely climb at a faster pace than international markets where drilling activity remains weak. Consequently, the unit will come to dominate Halliburton's earnings again in 2017.The earnings growth will also allow Halliburton to repair its balance sheet, which should have a positive impact on the company's valuation. Halliburton has seen its net debt soar more than 50% from $5.5 billion at the end of 2014 to $8.4 billion at the end of last year, thanks in part to its failed attempt to acquire Baker Hughes (BHI). Due to the increase in debt and decrease in earnings, Halliburton has seen its leverage, measured in terms of net debt to EBITDA/operating income ratio climb from just 0.8x to 3.8x in the corresponding period. But as earnings improve, the company's leverage ratio will begin to decline. Halliburton is also actively working to repay some of its debt, which will also have a positive impact on the company's leverage metric.Note from author: Thank you for reading.

4058597,23998,2017-03-28T15:52:36-04:00,"In January, we posted a hedge for Halliburton longs, after noting Starmine had given the stock its worst rating.Since then Halliburton has slid 13%, after Monday's drop. Now, Wing Charts predicts a 66% chance it will fall further.We show how our hedge has reacted to the drop, and consider what comes next for hedged shareholders.","In January, we wrote about hedging Halliburton (NYSE:HAL), which had received Starmine's worst rating, ""very bearish"" (Haliburton: Starmine Says Sell). Since then, the stock is down 13%, after a 3.3% drop Monday following news that Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) and Weatherford (WFT) were forming a fracking joint venture that would ""rival Halliburton in size"".Let's update how that hedge has reacted to Halliburton's drop and then consider where we go from here.The January 17th Optimal Collar Hedge:As of January 17th's close, this was the optimal collar to hedge 200 shares of HAL against a greater than 15% drop by late April while not capping an investor's upside at less than 11% by the end of that time period (screen captures via the Portfolio Armor iOS app).As you can see at the bottom of the second screen capture above, the cost was negative, so an investor would have collected an amount equal to $385, or 1.4% of position value when opening this collar (calculated conservatively, using the ask price of the puts and the bid price of the calls).The idea behind this hedge was that the investor could tolerate a decline of 16% but no more than that. Let's see where you'd be had you hedged then and held since.How The January 17th Collar Responded To HAL's DropHere's an updated quote on the put leg as of Monday's close:And here is an updated quote on the call leg:How That Hedge Ameliorated HAL's DropHAL closed at $55.01 on Tuesday, January 17th. A shareholder who owned 500 shares of it and hedged with the collar above then had $27,505 in HAL shares plus $715 in puts, and if he wanted to buy-to-close his short call leg, he would have needed to pay $1,100 to do that. So, his net position value on January 17th was ($27,505 + $715) - $1,100 = $27,120.HAL closed at $47.78 on Monday, March 27th, down about 13% from its closing price on January 17th. The investor's shares were worth $23,890 as of 2/27, his put options were worth $1,082.50, and if he wanted to close out the short call leg of his collar, it would have cost him $82.50, using the midpoint of the spread, in both cases. So: ($23,890 + $1,082.50) - $82.50 = $24,890. $24,890 represents an 8.2% drop from $27,120.More Protection Than PromisedSo, although HAL had dropped by about 13% at the time of the calculations above, and the investor's hedge was designed to limit him to a loss of no more than 16%, he was actually down 8.2% on his combined net hedge plus underlying stock position by this point. This is an example of the impact of time value on a hedge designed to protect based on its intrinsic value alone.What Now?Interestingly, Starmine is slightly less bearish on Halliburton now than it was in January, rating it ""bearish"" instead of ""very bearish"".That data is as of the 25th though, so it doesn't take into account Monday's news or price action. The technical analysis in the tweet below by Wing Charts does take into account Monday's price action, including Halliburton's drop below its 200-day moving average, and predicts a two-thirds chance of further declines:For insight into near-term future price movements, we often look at data from Squeeze Metrics (we have an affiliate partnership with them, and are compensated if a reader joins the site), but their data regarding Halliburton currently paints a mixed picture. We'll present it here for your consideration.Recall that the DPI, or Dark Pool Indicator, is a measure of whether institutions are net buyers or sellers of the stock in private exchanges, away from the public markets. The 63% DPI on Monday for Halliburton is a bullish indicator in this context, meaning that dark pool traders were net buyers on the day. The GEX, or gamma exposure, of -221,045 shares is bullish too, as it means option market makers will have to buy back 221,045 shares of HAL if the stock rises 1%. On the other hand, though, looking out over the last 10 trading days, the DPI was in bearish territory half of those days.So those are three sets of tea leaves for Halliburton shareholders to consider. If you're hedged with the collar above, it doesn't expire until July, so you have time to feel this out, while your downside is strictly limited. If the stock drops further, you might consider buying-to-close the call leg of the collar to eliminate your upside cap."
4061774,24018,2017-04-11T14:56:04-04:00,"Over the past year, Halliburton shares have risen 34%. Year to date, the stock eased 7.6%.Are shares overvalued or undervalued? What process can help an investor determine a fair value estimate?Let's perform a valuation analysis on Halliburton stock. It's integral to a complete investment thesis.","Determining Fair Value Estimates is an integral part of a stock ownership thesis. In this article, we will walk through a FVE exercise for Halliburton (NYSE:HAL). Halliburton is an S&P Energy sector stock. Within the sector, the company resides in the Energy Services industry. Energy sector stocks are cyclical. As such, shares tend to ride energy commodity cycles up and down. Indeed, Energy stocks are not buy-and-forget investments. HAL shares are no exception.Mr. Market Looks Ahead, Not BackwardMr. Market is forward-looking. Generally, investors pay up for shares when earnings and cash are increasing; conversely, they discount stocks when the outlook declines. I cannot stress this point enough: good investors don't care where a stock has been, he/she cares where it's going. Using trailing financial data to determine fair value, especially for a cyclical company, is almost a sure bet to yield poor investment results.Marking a Forward PathDetermining a defensible Fair Value Estimate focuses upon 2 primary objectives:A challenge for a cyclical stock like HAL is to decide how far out to relevant input data. This is a judgment call. For a cyclical on the rebound: premising too short a time frame and the fair value estimate misses the mark low; too long a time horizon, input data becomes irrelevant.Examining Halliburton's Balance SheetThe objective here isn't to perform an exhaustive balance sheet analysis. It's simply to determine if the company is has the ability to pay its bills, manage debt, and holds appropriate cash.Halliburton's balance sheet experienced considerable dislocation after an ill-fated attempt to acquire Baker Hughes (BHI). In May 2016, the Company was required to pay a $3.5 billion termination payment to Baker. Of course, associated pre-merger costs were also lost.In summary:Near-term liquidity has been adequate. A 2.9x current ratio indicates Halliburton retains good liquidity despite the failed BHI deal and having to navigate a severe energy commodity collapse.Debt is a concern. Prior to Baker Hughes termination payment, Net Debt-to-Equity was 0.45x. As of the end of 2016, the ratio rose to 0.89x. Unfortunately, HAL experienced a ""double-whammy."" First, it paid out the $3.5 billion breakup fee to Baker. Second, the energy price collapse resulted in significant balance sheet impairments. In 2016, total shareholder equity fell from $13.0 billion to $9.4 billion.Management is well-aware of the issue; pledging to direct excess cash flow to pay down debt. Making good on this promise, in February the company announced it redeemed an aggregate $1.4 billion in senior notes. This will be reflected on the 2017 1Q financials.Halliburton has a BBB+ investment-grade credit rating with a ""Stable"" outlook. Certainly, debt has put pressure on the organization. 2016 adjusted net debt-to-EBITDA was 4.2x. Adjusted interest coverage was barely 1.0x. These figures are uncomfortable. Investors are wise to monitor go-forward results carefully.Cash on hand is adequate. At year-end 2016, Halliburton had $4 billion cash and equivalents on the balance sheet. This amounts to $4.63 per share, or ~9% of the recent share bid. The figure compares favorably with prior years' balances.Opinion: stressed but stable. Recent events compromised the balance sheet considerably. A failed takeover, a treacherous energy price collapse, and resultant impairment/restructuring charges pounded a previously strong ledger. However, given the rebound in energy prices and management's attention to fixing the balance sheet, I am of the opinion Halliburton will regain its financial footing. I judge the balance sheet as weakened but sound (only barely!), with an upside bias.Determining Halliburton's Fair Value EstimateNow to the heart of the matter: determining a reasonable fair value estimate. There are a number of price-and-XX ratios to consider. Which to utilize? Let's being with broad thinking:For energy sector stocks, I tend to favor cash flow valuation metrics, namely P/OCF (operating cash flow) and P/FCF (free cash flow). Of course, a traditional P/E analysis is warranted, too. Since Halliburton management emphasizes operating margins and operating income (EBIT), we will include a P/EBIT check, too.P/book and P/sales are less instructive for Halliburton. Price/book has been distorted due to borrowing cash for the BHI deal, paying out a $3.5 billion breakup fee, and writing down assets. Price/sales would be an odd duck: Halliburton's highly cyclical margins require greater bottom line versus top line focus. Therefore, for purposes of this exercise, we will review P/CF, P/FCF, P/E, and P/EBIT.The next decision (and a critical one) is to decide how long a view is appropriate when using forward estimates. HAL is particularly tricky. For a less-cyclical company, reasonable FVEs may be determined by looking out through the current year; maybe into 2018.Conversely, Halliburton is attempting to emerge from one of the worst energy troughs in decades. Looking out even a year out is unlikely to yield meaningful results. I suggest we must consider earnings and cash flow forecasts all the way out to 2019. But there's a caveat: historically, analysts have demonstrated a less-than-stellar probability of accurately forecasting EPS or cash flow out this far. The track record: about 50/50.As a testament to the difficulty of trying to estimate HAL earnings or cash flow, analysts tend to get caught flat-footed during down-cycles, and be overly cautious during up-cycles. For patient investors, the latter may be a silver lining.F.A.S.T. Graphs offers the following auxiliary chart to help illustrate the aforementioned:Despite the uncertainty, we will input 2019 Street analyst forward projections; premising a general energy complex up-cycle. If our view is correct, we know the Street tends to underestimate the power of such up-cycles; thereby underestimating potential share appreciation.So let's proceed to review 4 F.A.S.T. Graphs: in succession, price-and-operating cash flow, price-and-free cash flow, price-and-earnings, and price-and-EBIT.P/OCFEven using 2019 estimates, Halliburton shares today appear to be trading close to fair value. An historical 9.8x trimmed-average P/CF multiple (quite reasonable) and $5.28 OCF/share suggests the FVE is only ~$52. Currently, HAL shares sell for $50.But given the cyclical nature of the stock, might the 9.8x average multiple expand during high times? If so, perhaps we could apply a higher P/CF ratio.Unfortunately, this isn't the case. Another chart from the F.A.S.T. Graph suite demonstrates Halliburton P/CF multiples rarely rise above 10x -- period. It is unreasonable to expect significant P/CF multiple expansion.P/FCFTurning to Price-and-Free Cash Flow:A quick look at this chart indicates it's not meaningful. I included it to make a point: sometimes, despite good intentions, certain price-and-multiple analysis selections are not helpful. Indeed, understanding and evaluating Halliburton's free cash flow is a very good exercise. However, trying to use this metric for a price/multiple valuation exercise isn't.P/EThe most basic valuation ratio is the P/E (price-to-earnings) or EPS. When doing a P/E analysis, I prefer to use adjusted earnings, often referred to as operating earnings. operating earnings (not to be confused with operating income, discussed proceeding) is diluted EPS sans ""one off"" and extra-ordinary gains and losses. Operating EPS attempts to normalize EPS by isolating underlying core business unit performance, and exclude items that distort it.Here's a 13-year, Halliburton price-and-earnings FAST graph:Observers note a steady 15x long-term average multiple. Plugging in 2019 consensus EPS, we can derive a $60 fair value estimate.P/EBITIn investor presentations, Halliburton management frequently references operating income (EBIT) and operating margins. EBIT attempts to provide un-levered business performance; interest and taxes are carved out under the assumption these are non-core, corporate functions.The long-term P/EBIT ratio is 10x. Accepting significant margin and related 2019 operating income, the chart combines the 10x multiple and $6.20 EBIT to yield a $62 stock.Please note previous EBIT peaks in 2008, 2011 and 2014: Share prices tended to ""overshoot"" the mark. Therefore, one might conclude if Halliburton meets the 2019 earnings projections, there is a good probability the stock will once again overshoot to the upside.SummaryA failed acquisition and horrendous energy downturn, stressed Halliburton's balance sheet, but it hasn't broken it. Debt is a concern. However, liquidity and cash on hand is acceptable. The company retains an investment-grade credit rating. If oil stabilizes in the low $50s, trends are positive. Clearly, management is focused upon cash generation and debt reduction.Reviewing 4 price-and-multiple valuation methodologies, we obtained the following fair value results:Importantly, these results are premised upon accepting analyst consensus 2019 projections. On one hand, we know the Street accurately estimates HAL earnings or cash flow only half the time. On the other hand, history tells us the Street tends to underestimate the businesses' cyclical troughs and peaks. Consequently, if we believe the energy complex is on the upswing, it stands to reason analyst forward estimates may be too conservative; leading to potential incremental capital appreciation. Comparing HAL with its peers, ttm P/E and P/CF isn't meaningful; in 2016, the company posted negative earnings and operating cash flow.On balance, my current fair value estimate for these shares is ~$55. In part, this is based upon my over-weighting HAL projected cash flow and under-weighting earnings. A $55 FVE suggests ~10% upside, plus dividends. My protocol is to re-run and update my analysis quarterly.Given the company's weakened balance sheet, competitive pressures, and HAL shares not appearing to be trading at a significant discount to fair value: Accumulating shares is unattractive. I plan to hold my stock. I may elect to generate additional income on my shares by selling limited OTM call options; seeking a delta less than 0.30, and a time frame not more than a month or so out.Near term, I am inclined to distribute shares at $55, and seek to repurchase these below $47.Disclaimer: Please do your own careful due diligence before making any investment.

The redemption, it's important to note, will take place at a slight premium to par (as is required by underlying covenants within the Indenture Agreements of the notes). This transaction, while easily overlooked, is quite transformational for Halliburton.Halliburton is deploying ~35% of its C&CE balance, which will reflect a reduction of ~$1.4 billion (pro forma as of the writing of this article), to reduce its long-term debt (including current maturities) by ~11.5%. While at first there might appear to be a significant imbalance in capital structure utility, this is not the case. Halliburton will take several non-apparent wins from this transaction -- both in the immediate term as well as in the long term.First, Halliburton will remove an expensive debt obligation. Halliburton's 6.15% 2019 notes comprised 8.2% of its long-term debt stack (inclusive of current maturities). On a non-weighted basis, this was Halliburton's fourth most expensive debt. On a weighted basis, this was Halliburton's fourth most expensive debt. Excluding these notes, Halliburton's cost of capital (limited to its long-term debt stack) will fall considerably, both on a weighted and non-weighted basis. Put simply, removing just these notes is meaningful.However, Halliburton also removed a $400 million tranche of expensive 5.9% debt as well. While not as important from a weighting standpoint, the 5.9% 2018 notes being redeemed will factor heavily into resetting and extending -- in conjunction with the 2019 notes redeemed -- Halliburton's weighted average duration (of its debt stack). That is extremely important from a derisking standpoint. Even as a secondary factor -- and some CFOs I chat with consider this a primary capital structure management factor -- managing duration risk is hugely important into capital structure management. Importantly, ratings agencies will likely take notice of this.Prior to this redemption announcement, Kamakura Corporation's KRIS risk management engine believed Halliburton to be downgrade weighted, assigning Halliburton a ~74% chance of being downgraded from BBB+ to BBB-. Now, however, I have to believe that Halliburton is in line for an upgrade, which is an absolute coup for the ServiceCo. With its credit ratios set to improve meaningfully as a result of this transaction and with its credit ratios set to improve organically as a result of improving market conditions (for its own verticals, specific to its own model), I believe Halliburton could be upgraded incrementally from BBB+ to A-. That would, along with all of the above, meaningfully reduce cost of capital.Halliburton, if intending to attack its EBITDA creation ""from the inside out"" via capital structure management, would have substantial ability to reset capital costs lower on a full cycle basis. Again, this is important from a derisking standpoint. For what it's worth, prior to this transaction I had Halliburton's net debt/EBITDA ratio set to fall from a FY2016 3.9X to a EFY2017 2.4X (using proprietary calculation methods of Atlas Consulting).In abbreviated summary, Halliburton will do extremely well to execute this announced redemption. Calling on deep due diligence performed, I know that it's Halliburton's intention to manage its enterprise at a 35% debt to capitalization ratio on a long-term, full-cycle basis. This transaction will do well into helping hit and sustain that target. Additionally, this transaction is being executed at the right time in the capital planning cycle for Halliburton, which certainly needed to reset its balance sheet and cash flow modeling after the Baker Hughes (BHI) M&A disaster. Again, this transaction will do well in executing both. While not certain, the capital allocation decision announced certainly hints at Halliburton calling to credit agencies for an upgrade, an upgrade that, if given, could have substantial long-term efficacy from a capital structure management standpoint."

Management does not expect international to rebound until late 2017.EBITDA margin was flat at 13%.In the context of HAL's 28x EBITDA multiple, Q4 earnings were pretty bad.","Halliburton CEO Dave LesarHalliburton (NYSE:HAL) reported Q4 revenue of $4.02 billion and EPS of $.04. The company missed on revenue by about $70 million. Oil services stocks have enjoyed a tremendous rebound over the past year. HAL is up 90% Y/Y, driven by rising oil prices; this might not be a convenient time to miss analysts expectations. I had the following takeaways on the quarter.North America Delivered ...Animal spirits returned to the oil patch in Q3 2016. Halliburton's revenue from the region grew 9% sequentially; it followed up that performance with a 9% uptick this quarter. The rig count rose 23% and North America delivered as expected.Halliburton receives nearly 45% of its revenue from the region, so North America is of heightened importance to the company. Halliburton succumbed to price concessions when drilling activity was much lower, allowing it to increase its market share. That share increase likely came at the expense of C&J Energy (CJES), (OTCPK:CJESQ) which recently exited bankruptcy, and Weatherford (WFT) which remains cash flow starved.Revenue did not grow in lockstep with the rig count because Halliburton was choosier on what business it took on. It decided to improve margins by raising prices, and worked with those customers who were on board with the new pricing strategy:With more business to go around in the region, Halliburton should continue to grow the top line at adequate margins. It likely connotes that there could be more business for Weatherford or Baker Hughes (BHI), and North America could deliver strong results for the first half of 2017.... But International Did NotHalliburton's international operations grew 2% sequentially. This is in line with the 1% growth Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) achieved during the quarter. I actually thought it would have been worse. Latin America was up 3%, which I was surprised by. Venezuela is cash-starved and has run-up over a $1 billion in unpaid bills. Halliburton has waffled between cutting exposure to the Venezuela's state oil company, PDVSA, or extending credit.Meanwhile, Britain's exit from the EU and Italy's ""No"" vote on the Renzi Referendum have created tremors throughout Europe. Neither bodes well for economic growth or oil demand in Europe. The EUR/USD is now at 1.07; over the past 12 months it peaked at about 1.15 in Q2 2016. Future earnings from Europe could equate to less in dollars with a sinking euro.Management does not anticipate an inflection point in international markets until later this year. Any rebound from international might not happen until Q4, if at all. That could keep a lid on Halliburton's total earnings in 2017.Q4 Really Was That BadBarron's asked the question, Were earnings really that bad? When you consider the run up in the stock and Halliburton's trading value, the answer is ""Yes."" EBITDA margins were flat at 13%, despite the 5% sequential increase in revenue. With an enterprise value of $57.3 billion, HAL now trades at 28.0x trailing 12 months EBITDA. Yes oil prices have rebounded, and North America is sizzling. However, HAL is grossly overvalued based on earnings fundamentals.TakeawayHAL remains a sell.Editor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks.

This compares to the company's 3Q 2016 income of $6 million or $0.01 per diluted share.While the company's income went up by a factor of 4, it is still incredibly small compared to the company's size.However, Halliburton's revenue continues to remain incredibly strong. The company earned $4.0 billion in 4Q 2016 up 5% from the 3Q 2016. The company's total annual revenue of $15.9 billion remains strong, however, is still a 33% drop from the company's 2015 revenue.Halliburton, like all major companies, has fixed expenses whether oil prices are at their all time highs or their all time lows. That means, as we have seen, as Halliburton's revenue falls, its profit has fallen even faster. That means, similarly, a recovery in revenue will also cause Halliburton's earnings to recover.With the consensus EPS forecast for Halliburton, according to Nasdaq, expected to recover to $4.75 for 2020, that means Halliburton's quarterly income is anticipated to recover by more than 25x from $0.04 / quarter to roughly $1.19 / quarter. This anticipated recovery in Halliburton's earnings helps to show how the company is a strong investment at the present time.Halliburton Revenue - Halliburton Investor PresentationTaking a snapshot of Halliburton's overall quarterly revenues compared to 2015, we can see that Halliburton continues to maintain revenue in the face of a difficult oil crash. The company has seen its corporate costs go up but no longer has to deal with the costs of acquiring Baker Hughes. This impressive revenue means that as the oil markets recover, the company should see its earnings begin to recover.As we can see here, Halliburton has seen its earnings take an incredibly large hit as a result of the oil market crash. However, the company's revenue has continued to remain strong and when the company's revenue does recover, its earnings should recover as well. As we saw above, Halliburton's earnings are forecast to grow by more than 25x over the next 3 years showing the company's strong recovery potential.This helps to show how Halliburton has the potential to see its stock price recover and become a significant oilfield services company.Halliburton Strategic FocusSo far, we have discussed Halliburton's impressive fourth quarter results, most importantly including how the company's revenue has remained strong while its earning have fallen. This continued strength in its revenue, in the face of declining earnings, means that when the markets recover the company's earnings should pick back up.Now let's continue by discussing Halliburton's strategic focus.Halliburton Strategy - Halliburton Investor PresentationHalliburton, as an oilfield service company, is focused on engineering solutions to maximize the value of its customers' assets. In a difficult oil environment, maximizing the extraction value of these assets is essential to customers. That means that Halliburton's services will be required during an oil crash to lower the cost basis of customers for oil extraction.In unconventionals, Halliburton has achieved the lowest cost per barrel using its technology. In mature fields, the company is working to maximize recovery at low prices. Given that starting up a new field is incredibly expensive, extracting oil from existing fields is more cost effective.That means companies will increasingly turn towards Halliburton's technology to lower their costs.Deepwater Drilling - Offshore TechnologyMost importantly, Halliburton has significant technology for expansion into the deepwater industry. Seventy percent of the world's surface is covered in oceans yet the vast majority of oil extraction comes from land. That means deepwater oil represents one of the next major regions of oil extraction.As a result, Halliburton should be helped by having the lowest cost per foot of reservoir delivery and this should help the company expand as the offshore market grows.Halliburton Shale Potential - Halliburton Investor PresentationAnother region of Halliburton's strategic focus and its expansion potential is unconventional oil, or shale oil. The world has significant shale oil reserves with more than two hundred billion barrels of shale oil and several trillion cubic feet of shale gas. Given that the world's entire annual oil consumption is roughly thirty billion barrels, that means that shale oil has the ability to support years of Halliburton's oil consumption.As we saw above, Halliburton has the lowest cost per barrel for extraction of unconventional oil. That means that major companies looking to cheaply extract oil will use Halliburton as their oilfield services company. That means that Halliburton will be able to make a major impact in this growing market. This helps to show how Halliburton is a strong investment despite low earnings with significant future growth potential.This should help to support the company's earnings and shows how the company is a strong investment at the present time.Oil EnvironmentNow that we have discussed Halliburton's impressive fourth quarter results and the company's strategy of using its technology to take advantage of the need for new sources of low cost production, a strategy that should enable it to grow rapidly, let's finish up by discussing the future oil environment. Our goal here is to come up for a timeline of when the oil markets will recover by, giving us a timeline for when Halliburton's stock price will recover.Oil Demand and Supply Balance - VOX CDNThe above image shows supply and demand in the oil markets from the start of the crash in mid-2014 until year-end 2016. As we can see here, the supply surplus first began in the 3Q 2013 and then prices began to fall in mid-2014. That means that it took 9 months for prices to begin falling. From that point, it took roughly 18 months for prices to hit what was widely viewed as their bottom in January 2016.This means it took a total of 27 months for oil prices to bottom out.From that point, oil prices have already begun to recovery. Present oil prices of more than $50 per barrel are almost twice what oil prices were in January 2016 at less than $30 per barrel. Assuming that prices take as long to recover as they did to crash (there is no way of knowing if this will be true, but it is a good place to start), we can anticipate that just as oil prices took 27 months to bottom out, they will take another 27 months to recover. This means that we can anticipate oil prices will recover by mid-2018. A recovery in oil prices will help capex recover and Halliburton's earnings to return to pre-crash levels.ConclusionAs we can see here, Halliburton has seen its earnings drop drastically since the start of the oil crash. Despite these difficulties, the company has managed to maintain fairly strong revenue. At the same time, the company has new technology and has been significantly reducing the costs for its customers. We saw above that Halliburton has the lowest cost per barrel for extraction of unconventional oil. Given the need of upstream companies to reduce costs, that makes Halliburton a company increasing numbers of oil companies will turn to.On top of all of this, new sources of oil production will need to be found. As conventional sources of crude oil run out, unconventional oil and deepwater oil will become a growing part of the world's oil mix. That makes Halliburton's technology increasingly essential. On top of all of this, we can expect oil prices to recover in the coming years. As we saw above, oil prices can be expected to recover by mid-2018.This combination of recovering oil prices and increasing demand for Halliburton's technology should help oil prices to recover in the coming years."
4044739,31441,2017-02-10T03:15:24-05:00,HAL's debt/EBITDA is at 6.0x.If debt/EBITDA does not approach 4.0x in 2017 Moody's could downgrade HAL's debt below Baa1.A $4.2B debt pare down could reduce debt/EBITDA to 4.0x today.At $4.2B equity raise could dilute the stock by 9% or more Avoid HAL.,"As oil prices have risen, investors have bid up the shares of oil services stocks. Halliburton's (NYSE:HAL) stock is up nearly 90% over the past year. It reported a solid Q4 with revenue and EBITDA up Q/Q by 5% and 2%, respectively. Investors are excited about the rebound in North America, but the company's balance sheet remains challenged.The $3.5 billion break-out fee to Baker Hughes has hurt liquidity. Its Q4 EBITDA was still of over 40% Y/Y and its $12.4 billion debt load is was 6x last 12 months (""LTM"") EBITDA -- junk levels.Halliburton's credit metrics have slowly eroded with the decline in EBITDA. At Q2 2016 and Q3 2016 its debt/EBITDA was 4.6x and 5.1, respectively. It slide to 6.0x in Q4 as trailing EBITDA fell faster than its reduction in debt.Will Moody's Finally Sack Halliburton?The company's number two position in the oil services sector might have put the rating agencies on pause. That could change, however. In June, Moody's downgraded Halliburton to Baa1 with a negative outlook; Baa1 is lower medium grade - not what you would expect from an industry leader like HAL. Moody's cited additional debt the company incurred to finance the Baker Hughes merger, an erosion of revenue and cash flow in the oil field services space, and an erosion of Halliburton's credit metrics as reasons for the downgrade.Moody's intimated it could downgrade Halliburton further if debt/EBITDA did not decline towards 4.0x in 2017. Instead of seeking additional market share, management has decided to be more selective on the new business it takes on. Its EBITDA might not grow fast enough to achieve debt/EBITDA of 4.0x. It also generated Q4 free cash flow of $871 million. I estimate it still will not be enough to appease Moody's/Halliburton Might Need A $4.2 Billion Equity RaiseWith EBITDA of just over $2 billion, Halliburton could support about $8.2 billion in debt at 4.0x EBITDA. It would have to reduce its current $12.2 billion debt load by $4.2 billion. I assumed the company needs to squirrel away as much capital as possible. Its current $4.0 billion in cash could be used to buffer any down turn in the oil industry. Who is to say the current bounce in the oil price will not be a head fake?OPEC is notorious for not sticking with stated production cuts and North American shale plays are increasing supply, which could keep oil prices range bound. Combined with rising rates, a debt downgrade could send Halliburton's debt costs higher by a few hundred basis points. HAL trades at 28x trailing EBITDA; it could behoove management to use its equity as a currency in order to protect its credit rating and possibly forego rising interest expense.ConclusionThe bullishness in energy names might have gotten ahead of earnings. In Halliburton's case, its balance sheet has been damaged by the failed Baker Hughes deal. I estimate a $4.2 billion equity raise at $51 (10% discount to current price) would 9% dilutive. Avoid HAL."
4038924,101450,2017-01-24T08:53:51-05:00,"KMI reported earnings in line with estimates but saw costs increase due to an aggressive plan to take market share coupled with expectations of a stronger market.SLB earnings were weighed down by acquisition costs which should allow them to capture market share as the market recovers.Posting the first beat in the industry, HAL's numbers looked slightly more bullish after falling the most over the past year and a half.","The earnings season started off with financial services posting some pretty impressive numbers. FactSet found that about 80% of the companies that have reported in that sector beat estimates. Amidst the banking chaos, the three largest oil and gas services companies saw their earnings dates arrive as well. Kinder Morgan (NYSE:KMI) and Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) both reported earnings that were in line with estimates despite oil prices getting a lift in the last quarter of the year. On Monday, Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) reported before the market bell. The company was the first to report growth in earnings for the industry and highlighted an upside to some mediocre earnings.In the third quarter of 2016, oil prices traded in the low $40's, a price that was higher than the first and second quarter averages but too low to get the industry out of trouble. Nevertheless, oil production still ran high, and OPEC saw the need to step in. After a cut of 1.2 million barrels a day was introduced by the cartel, oil prices shot above $50, and U.S. production rates recovered. The U.S. Energy Information Administration reported that domestic production had risen from 8.8 million barrels a day in the first week of December to almost 9.5 million barrels a day in the second week of January 2017. The sudden shift towards excess production should result in a more demand for oil and gas services as idle wells are brought online with new equipment and U.S. producers look to start exploring again. The EIA also reported higher than usual refinery utilization rates in the winter which will also drive demand for production on the downstream side.From FactSetWith the drop in oil prices, investment in new operations and capital programs tanked. Malcolm Dickson from Wood Mackenzie estimated in a Bloomberg article that U.S. oil investment saw a drop of about $125 billion. A lot of this money would have been directed at oil services companies like KMI, SLB, and HAL, for that reason, their revenues have contracted. As shown by the left side of the chart, these large oil services companies, which compose a majority of the market saw year-over-year sales and EBITDA fall by as much as -40 percent. HAL's 2016 Q3 financials fared the worst compared to 2015 Q3 financials and that doesn't bode well for this quarter. KMI's income statement looked to be the least volatile in Q3, but they still reported revenue and costs that were disappointing in Q4. SLB's results in Q4 appeared to have improved the most with year over year growth rates that were better than the quarter before.Kinder Morgan continues to see the best year over year trends in their quarterly reports, but cutting costs have been toughest for the company. Fourth quarter costs were reported in the positive for KMI even though sales were down by about 8 percent. These higher costs might be due to a misjudgment of its expectations for the year 2016. An article from the Motley Fool attributes these missed expectations to ""lower throughput on some of its liquids terminals than budgeted."" The jump in costs are most likely related to management's desire to increase market after tepid demand in the first and second quarters. In an answer responding to a BMO Capital Markets analyst, CEO Steven Kean reasserted this objective saying, ""so the declines still come, but I think the program that Tom and his team initiated was successful in taking our market share back up."" The plan was reasonably successful as KMI's numbers came in line with estimates from its analysts, but the company paid for its aggressive tactics through higher year over year costs. KMI needs the trend to swing quickly in their favor, as SLB and HAL also look to capitalize on a revival of demand.Schlumberger's fourth quarter story was dominated by a hefty restructuring charge and merger and acquisition costs that lead the company to report an earnings per share $0.38 lower than its value in 2015 Q4. The oil services giant saw a 1 percent growth in revenue sequentially despite the recovery in oil prices. While growth was tepid, management made sure to insist that SLB was moving, ""into the recovery part of the cycle,"" suggesting that, ""supply and demand continued to tighten in the fourth quarter."" Compared to last year, sales were only down about 8 percent in Q4 with costs falling slightly as well. Management continued to look forward bullishly citing their expectations to see, ""an acceleration of global stock gross towards the end of the first quarter."" SLB's bullish sentiment was outlined by their takeover of Cameron, a provider of flow equipment products, systems, and services. This acquisition should allow them even deeper access to the market for oil and gas pipelines when these systems start to become unclogged. Nevertheless, its mediocre fourth quarter results lead one to believe that bullish sentiment is not industrywide. If a stronger sentiment existed, more demand would have been visible at the end of 2016. SLB, in particular, only sees exploration and production investment adding 30 percent of its girth in the next year. The trimmed down market size should lead to a more competitive oil services industry, and, perhaps, more disappointing earnings to come.In the Q3 conference call, HAL management said that ""significant activity increases from our customers starts with sustainable commodity prices over $50 per barrel."" Their bullish outlook was supported by a 9 percent increase in North American revenue in that quarter. The reversal in the revenue trend was complemented by the completion of the $1 billion worth of cost savings HAL hoped to achieve by the end of the year. The fundamentals appear to be coming together for a company that has been ravaged by the downturn in oil prices. HAL showed some resiliency in Q4 with adjusted earnings beating estimates by $0.02 despite projections that the quarter would be softer. Coupled with higher margins, the company asserted its advance on the upswing and should see a much better 2017.The oil and gas services industry produced earnings that seemed to disappoint investors who hoped for a snap back to profitability after the steep climb in oil prices, but seasonality once again reigns. KMI and SLB's earnings matched estimates and, ultimately, fell short of the standards of bullish investors everywhere, but that doesn't mean they shouldn't be bought. In fact, this refractory period between the downturn in oil prices and the recovery provides a perfect period for investors to find a good entry point on a long position. All three of the stocks should see a nice rebound going into the year with higher oil prices and a business friendly President Trump, especially SLB and HAL who have played the M&A market to its advantage and cut costs efficiently. Instead of focusing on Q4 results, make sure to listen for 2017 guidance from management and plan an entry point from there."
4037623,23998,2017-01-18T11:01:21-05:00,"On Halliburton, we have a difference of opinion between Wall Street's sell-side analysts and Starmine's independent research firms.Wall Street is modestly bullish on Halliburton, while Starmine is ""very bearish.""For Halliburton longs, we present a way to position yourself to capture double Wall Street's potential return estimate for Halliburton while guarding against the chance Starmine ends up being right.","Starmine ""Very Bearish"" On HalliburtonLast month, we wrote about a stock with a ""bearish"" Equity Summary Score from Thomson Reuters' Starmine, Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE:APC). StarMine has one worse ranking than ""bearish"" though -""very bearish."" And that's the one it currently gives to Halliburton (NYSE:HAL), as you can see in the screen capture below from Fidelity, which uses StarMine research.As the text in that graphic explains, Starmine overweights the opinions of the research shops that have historically been the most accurate. So, HAL gets a ""very bearish"" rating even though only three of 11 analysis firms give it their most bearish rating. For those curious, the three firms giving HAL sell ratings were Ned Davis Research, MSCI's Governance Metrics International (no public website) and EVA Dimensions.The research firms polled by Starmine are all considered ""independent"" in that they're not attached to sell-side Wall Street firms. The sell-side analysts aren't bearish on Halliburtion, on average, as the image from Nasdaq below shows.That consensus 12-month price target implies a potential return of about 4.5% over the next six months.If you're long Halliburton and share the sell-side analysts' bullishness, but want to limit your downside risk in case the bearish independent analysts end up being right, we'll look at a cost-effective way of doing so below.Getting Paid To Hedge HalliburtonThis hedge is designed for an investor who can tolerate a drawdown of no more than 16%. The cap is set at 9%, which is double the potential return suggested by the sell-side analysts over the time period. We used the Portfolio Armor iOS app to find this optimal collar, but you can find optimal hedges without the app using the method explained here.As of Tuesday's close, this was the optimal collar to hedge 500 shares of HAL against a >16% drop between now and late July, while not capping your possible upside at less than 9% by then.We wrote ""getting paid to hedge Halliburton"" above, but, to be precise, you are paying for the protection part of this hedge, the put leg. The cost of it was $715, or 2.60% of position value. This was calculated conservatively using the ask price of the puts (you can often buy puts for less, at some price between the bid and ask). However, as you can see in the screen capture below, the income generated by selling the call leg of this collar was $1,100, or 4% of position value (calculated conservatively, using the bid price of the calls), more than the cost of the put leg.So the net cost of the collar was negative, meaning an investor opening this on Tuesday would have collected $385, an amount equal to 1.4% of position value. Since the cost was calculated conservatively here, it's likely the investor would have collected more than $385 when opening this hedge."

McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) may offer some insight as to how consumers are eating while on the run, and Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) is on tap to shed some light into the recovering-maybe-oilfield services business.McDonald's-Food and FranchiseesUnder the golden arches, executives have been scrambling to cook up new menu items and recast old-time favorites to fit changing consumer tastes toward healthier foods. It's been two years into a turnaround plan that was prompted by the deepest sales slump in a decade. That, the company conceded, was caused in part by competition from a growing number of fast-food competitors serving up healthy choices. Another issue has been an overall slowdown in customer traffic in the fast-food segment.MCD has taken steps to overhaul its menu to be, in its words, ""viewed by its customers as a modern and progressive burger company delivering a contemporary customer experience."" That hasn't been easy for a nearly 62-year-old giant that operates over 36,000 restaurants in 120 countries, some analysts note.Some analysts will be looking at the progress of a company initiative that plans to turn over some 4,000 corporate-owned stores to franchisees by the end of 2018. MCD says it wants to up its franchisee-held stores to 95% of the total from the current 83%.Also on some analysts' minds could be the future of the all-day breakfast menu, a successful initiative when launched in 2015. MCD also now sells a kids' version of the menu. Other possible analyst questions might include whether any new menu nuggets are in the offing, and the status of MCD's plan to cut $500 million from operating expenses by the end of 2017.MCD has had five straight quarters of same-store sales gains, an important industry measure of sales at restaurants open longer than a year, and some analysts have indicated they expect to see another bump in Q4. Also of interest, other analysts say, is what might be the impact of a stronger dollar for a multinational like MCD that is operating in some 120 countries?Consensus estimates, according to Earningswhispers.com, are for MCD earnings to come in at $1.41 a share, up from $1.28 a year ago. Revenue is expected to slip slightly to $5.99 billion from $6.34 billion a year ago.The options market has priced in a potential share price move of just under 2.5% in either direction around the earnings release, according to the Market Maker Move™ indicator on the thinkorswim platform from TD Ameritrade.Call activity has been higher at the in-the-money 121 strike, with puts active at the 120 strike.

""I certainly am.""At the time, the No. 2 player in the oil patch was still reeling from the $0.14 per share loss in the previous quarter, as the steep descent in oil prices continued to pressure the sector. But after making fresh lows below $30 a barrel in early 2016, oil has trended higher, cracking through the $50 level in October and holding above that mark since.Earlier this month, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) touched a 52-week high at $54.01 a barrel, helped in part by the agreement by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and 11 non-OPEC producers, including Russia, to cut oil production.Higher commodity prices may give HAL an opportunity to get back to the business of stimulating rig count growth, the company said in Q3, but the company still cushioned its Q4 outlook. ""We remain cautious around fourth-quarter customer activity (because of) holiday and seasonal weather-related downtimes,"" Lesar said in the Q3 earnings release. ""However, it does not change our view that things are getting better for us and our customers.""Not surprisingly, some analysts say they are anxious to hear HAL's forecast on oil prices, and the outlook for OPEC's production cuts, on the quarterly conference call.For the quarter, the EarningsWhispers consensus earnings forecast is $0.02 a share, double that of prior quarter but still well below the $0.31 per share from a year ago.

4038775,92586,2017-01-23T15:26:45-05:00,"Halliburton beat EPS expectations, but disappointed slightly on the top line.
        North America was the bright spot once again, while growth in International turned positive this quarter.
        After shares ran 95% in the past 12 months, this ship appears to have already sailed.","Before the opening bell on January 22nd, Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) reported 4Q16 earnings. The company beat EPS expectations, but disappointed slightly on the top line.Revenues of $4.02 billion in the quarter represented a welcome increase of +5% sequentially, missing consensus expectations of $4.09 billion. Adjusted EPS came in at $0.04, a small sequential improvement that beat consensus' $0.02.Credit: Offshore Energy TodayHow results impact the investment thesisNot surprisingly, North America was determinant in the delivery of relatively strong results. I, and many on the Street, already expected this to be the case. Schlumberger's (NYSE:SLB) solid earnings report late last week raised expectations about oil activity domestically in 4Q16. HAL rose ahead of the print, and the stock ended Friday's trading session up over +2%. Today, Halliburton followed through and did not disappoint.Revenues in the region grew by 9%, just like it had in 3Q16. Not only that, but a combination of stronger pricing, higher utilization and more efficiencies pushed profits in the region into positive territory. The results from this geographic segment is likely to keep bulls happy about the direction of the oil business recovery close to home.Back in 3Q16, management warned about being ""cautious around fourth quarter customer activity due to holiday and seasonal weather-related downtimes"". Harsh and unusually cold weather in the more frigid oil-rich states in the U.S. raised a flag, which may have held back the more prudent investors. But concerns over softness in the U.S. through the early weeks of winter were put to rest in the end.The international segment has yet to turn the corner, but I found non-U.S. results to be mildly encouraging. Having delivered a 2% sequential improvement (vs. 6% contraction last quarter), international operations managed to grow op profits 27%. Despite growth finally turning positive and profits remaining resilient, it seems like much of the weakness in the stock today might be associated with uncertainties about Halliburton's business abroad, especially in Europe and Latin America.Investor takeawayThe question remains: might HAL be a good bet on the further strengthening of oil production and drilling activity, especially in North America? The business, after all, is showing slow but clear signs of improvement.At current price levels, however, I am inclined to say no. And my concerns have much more to do with valuation than with business fundamentals.Historically, and excluding the obvious outliers, Halliburton shares have traded at an average trailing P/E of about 18-20x. The company produced a maximum of about $4.00 in EPS during the bull periods that preceded the great recession (2007) and the recent crude oil bear (2014); and an inter-cycle average of about $3.00. See graph below for the 10-year period between June 2005 and June 2015.Source: YChartsGiven the early recovery stage, I believe HAL is priced fairly at $57/share, if I consider a non-peak EPS of $3.00 times the 19x historical average P/E. In a full-recovery state, however, one might be tempted to price HAL at about $75/share, which would represent 33% upside from current levels. And of course, the most bullish investor might even argue that, as a result of efficiencies achieved during the downcycle, peak EPS could reach new levels due to improved profitability, pushing share price beyond $75.I doubt that the stock could reach those highs any time before the 2019-to-2020 timeframe. But if it does, the potential return on the investment could be attractive.Not unlike SLB, however, I am discouraged from owning HAL after the 2016 rally. Shares have gained 95% over the past 12 months. I believe the current valuation is not allowing much room for hiccups in this recovery phase. And the current oil upcycle is far from being a smooth ride.Because the ship appears to have sailed already, I choose to stay away from HAL at this moment.Note from the author: I would like to invite you to follow me as I build a risk-diversified portfolio designed and back-tested to generate market-like returns with lower risk.

Not only that, the world's second largest oilfield services company appears to be in a solid position to outperform its bigger rival Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB).Houston, Texas based Halliburton reported fourth quarter revenues of $4.02 billion, down 20.9% from a year earlier but up 4.9% from Q3-2016. The company's earnings, however, narrowed on a year-over-year and sequential basis.The company reported a net loss of $149 million, or $0.17 per share which compares against a loss of $0.03 per share in Q4-2015 and a profit of $0.01 per share in Q3-2016. This was, however, driven by one-time charges. Excluding those, Halliburton reported an adjusted profit of $0.04 per share, down 87.1% from a year earlier but four times as large as the Q3-2016 adjusted profit of $0.01 per share. The profit was also significantly higher than the analysts' consensus estimate of $0.02 per share, as per data compiled by FactSet. It was, however, disappointing to see that the company failed to meet revenue consensus of $4.10 billion.Perhaps the most important aspect of Halliburton's fourth quarter results was that the company's core North America business roared back to profitability after reporting losses in the prior quarters. The unit, which has historically made the largest contribution to the company's top and bottom-line, swung to an operating profit of $28 million after reporting three consecutive losses of $66 million in Q3, $124 million in Q2 and $39 million in Q1. The improvement came on the back of an uptake in drilling activity in onshore United States and Canada as well as increase in service pricing. The company also posted an impressive 27% sequential increase in operating income from the international markets.In North America, Halliburton's revenues climbed by 9% sequentially, which compares against the 23% increase in average US rig count in the same period. The significantly smaller growth in revenues as compared to drilling activity might indicate that Halliburton has failed to gain market share, but this is the result of the company's business strategy rather than any operational problems. Halliburton has previously said that as the market turns, the company would increase its focus on improving its profit margins, and is even prepared to sacrifice its market share if it has to. The decline in revenues is likely the result of that decision. But this should also have been accompanied by improvement in margins. And Halliburton has delivered on this front as well.Halliburton managed to expand its profit margins on a sequential basis. The company reported adjusted operating income of $276 million, which translated into operating margin of 6.86%, more than twice as large as the Q3-2016 margin of 3.3%.Mr. Market has initially reacted negatively to Halliburton's results, which I believe is too harsh. The stock was down almost 2% on Monday morning, at the time of this writing. The company did miss revenue estimates, but I believe the results were largely positive. The company's bottom-line is growing faster than Wall Street's estimates, the North America business is profitable again and margins have also expanded. On top of this, Halliburton has also outperformed Schlumberger.On Friday, Schlumberger reported its fourth quarter results. The company did not beat earnings estimates, though its profits were in-line and revenues came in ahead of estimates. However, its revenue and adjusted earnings growth of almost 1% and 8% respectively on a sequential basis seems modest when compared against Halliburton's strong results. Moreover, Schlumberger, unlike Halliburton, actually posted a drop in operating margins in the fourth quarter as compared to the third quarter.Moving forward, I believe Halliburton will likely continue to report better growth numbers, in terms of revenues, earnings and profit margin, than Schlumberger. That's because Halliburton is a North America focused company. Before the start of the downturn, in 2014, Halliburton got more than half of its revenues and almost 70% of its operating income from North America. Schlumberger, on the other hand, is an international-markets-focused company which generated around a third of its revenues and less than 30% of operating income from North America in the same year.The great thing for Halliburton is that it's the North American market which is quickly turning around as shale drillers put rigs back to work. The international markets have just started to show some signs of life, as discussed by Schlumberger's management during the earnings call, which is in stark contrast to North America where rig count has been largely climbing since summer. The exploration and production spending in North America is expected to climb by 30% in 2017, which should support further uptake in drilling activity as well as improvement in pricing levels. That will continue to fuel Halliburton's turnaround.Note from author: Thank you for reading. If you like this article, then please follow me by clicking the ""Follow"" link at the top of this page."
4038637,33291,2017-01-23T10:13:16-05:00,The pain in the oil sector has begun to subside as oil has started to climb back to finish 2016 and enter 2017.I had rather low expectations for HAL but its Q4 is out and I discuss the key results.Cost reductions have saved profitability but expect to see those costs rise slightly in 2017 should oil be positive.,"Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) is an oil service stock that I have traded many times over the years despite having long preferred rival Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB). The latter delivered a decent Q4 that showed a slow return to better conditions. That said, both are very similar in many respects. The pain in the oil sector has begun to subside as oil has started to climb back to finish 2016 and enter 2017. With conditions beginning to normalize and extreme cost savings initiatives having morphed Halliburton into a leaner, more efficient company, we need to get back to looking at the fundamentals to determine the keys to survival, and we must carefully consider the performance of the names on an individual basis, even though it is so heavily dependent on oil prices.To determine where the stock may be heading, here from 2017, aside from oil prices, we need to talk about recent performance. Again, with oil prices so low of late compared to years past, it has crushed the company's performance relative to the past. This is particularly true when we look back two or three years ago. It is a simple association. The higher the price of oil, the better it is for Halliburton. That's just a fact that is true for all of the oil service names. But there are of course specific operation related steps the company can take to maximize earnings potential, and it has been doing so, for several years. That said, Halliburton missed analyst expectations on revenues and beat expectations on the bottom line for its Q4.So what kind of numbers are we talking about? Well, despite an earnings beat, a comparison to last year clearly demonstrates the pain the company has been experiencing. Of course, it should surprise no one, with oil having dropped to decade lows coming into 2016. The company once again saw a loss from continuing operations of $149 million, or $0.17. Taking into accounts adjustments, earnings came in at $0.04 per share. This beat analyst estimates by $0.02 per share. Adjusted operating income was $276 million in Q4 2016, down from the adjusted operating income of $506 million in Q3 2015. Again this is no surprise and is a direct result of revenues that dropped markedly. Halliburton's total revenue in Q4 was $4.02 billion compared to $3.8 billion in Q4 2015. This was a 5% increase year-over-year, but missed estimates by $70 million.It is key to realize that expectations were once again drastically low, thanks to oil prices. Still, Halliburton managed to control expenses, and really this is the key to survival for this sector right now, as I discussed in the opening. Over the last year, the company has slashed its expenditures in just about every category. That's really all that matters in the short run and really what you need to keep an eye on. Commodity pricing is driving revenues, so the bottom line can thus be impacted by watching spending. With a cursory review of revenues and operating income/loss statements, it becomes clear that the company managed to decrease operating expenses in most categories, and this is how the company has maintained profitability to the best of its ability. One other key takeaway is that rig counts increased by 20% in Q4, rising off multi-year lows. This underscores results that show North America has turned the corner, with its revenues up 9%, and improvements in shale producers.It is no surprise that with revenues declining compared to years past that that operating income would be difficult to stay positive. Thanks to cost reductions. A prime example is capital expenditures, which was $798 million, versus $2.2 billion last year. That is a massive reduction. I see these expenditures remaining low, but being bumped up a bit in 2017. This is because, looking ahead, oil is prices have spiked off of the lows from early 2016. I had low expectations this quarter. I didn't expect a terrible quarter, though was surprised by the miss on revenues. Given those cost reductions, the company beat on the bottom line. I am positive looking ahead as the market for oil stocks seemed to have turned the corner. There is concern outside of North America, but these will be quelled provided oil prices remain stable and/or rise. I maintain a hold rating on the name, but am optimistic for the coming quarters given the move higher in oil.Note from the author: Christopher F.

4033611,56142,2017-01-01T04:34:24-05:00,"The 2014-16 oil & gas bust may soon turn into a new boom.Strong trading momentum in 3 mega-cap oil companies is catching my attention.North American oil & gas plays remain attractive, if oil well refracturing demand grows under President Trump.","Following past boom/bust cycles, the oil business appears to have bottomed in February 2016 at $27 a barrel. The bruising multi-year bust in crude oil prices was the biggest reason for the world stock market sell-off from late 2015 to early 2016 of roughly 15% overall. The cruel irony of ultra-low prices is its disruptive effect on regular exploration activity. A short-term oil market depression in expectations disproportionately slashes oil drilling activity. Oil exploration budgets for 2017 are down 65% from 2014 and the smallest in 12 years, DESPITE a record estimate for global demand next year. In the long-run, oil & gas development and production may fail to keep pace with the steady growth in total demand. Will the 2015-16 ""bust"" sow the seeds of the next ""boom"" phase in pricing?The 75% decline into early 2016 proved to be one of the biggest oil price busts EVER. It is not a leap of faith to believe the coming spike higher could be truly historic in 2017-19, especially if we see determined OPEC supply constraints or unexpected output shocks (new wars) from the Middle East. Real world estimates of total production costs for oil point to sharply higher prices in coming years if expanding demand for energy is to be met by supply. Below is one of my favorite visual charts from 2015, projecting total costs by 2020. A jump in the U.S. Dollar currency value since 2015 has likely lowered the cost structure on the chart by $5 to $10 a barrel (as oil is generally priced in dollars overseas), but the point remains clear - sustainable production levels require much higher oil prices than today's $54 quote.While the market has been marginally oversupplied the last several years, global demand for oil continues to climb. From 91 million barrels a day in 2013, IEA estimates call for 98 million in daily demand by the end of 2017.When looking at oil's importance in the cost curve for manufacturing and discretionary consumer spending patterns, the upward price direction in crude oil of late is adding significant pressure to inflation. Using my own estimates, the strong Year over Year trend in nearly every commodity including oil during December 2016 vs. 2015 will likely bring U.S. CPI numbers well above the Federal Reserve bank's target of 2% in coming months. The spike in commodities off their late 2015 and early 2016 lows is a major reason the FED just raised rates in December, and bond prices worldwide have turned down sharply since the summer.From a contrarian point of view, investors and Wall Street analysts may not be taking oil inflation upside seriously. Like every other commodity bottom I have traded the last 30 years, it is hard for rearview mirror thinkers to visualize a strong rebound in prices after years of losses.If oil is about to surprise to the upside in 2017, what should an investor do? Based on my Victory Formation momentum system three large capitalization oil businesses have witnessed large scale buying, greater than alternatives and competitors the last six months. ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP), Suncor Energy (NYSE:SU), and Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) today have the best combination of factors to consider for my investment dollars, especially on weakness into January. You can review some relative price performance charts below against the S&P 500 large cap index and Energy Sector SPDR ETF (NYSEARCA:XLE).ConocoPhillipsConocoPhillips is one of the largest oil & gas producers in the U.S. After spinning off its Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) refining unit as a separate company in 2012, the remaining organization is now a pure play on oil & gas prices/output with unique scale and assets mainly in America. The knock against Conoco is its large debt holdings and leverage, not unlike similar oil businesses in late 2016. The bruising energy price drop over several years has forced expensive restructurings and non-cash asset write-downs quarter after quarter.2016 Wall Street consensus estimates are for about $5.5 billion in cash flow, $25 billion in sales, and an operating loss of $3.5 billion. If you believe oil & gas prices will not recover in 2017, Conoco is probably fairly valued at an equity market capitalization of $62 billion. 2017 numbers should improve smartly, given crude oil stays around today's $54 a barrel and natural gas near $3.50 per MMBtu. Wall Street is projecting $10 billion in cash flow on $34 billion in sales, with break-even to slightly positive operating earnings for 2017.Using conservative 2017 Wall Street estimates, a stock price multiple on annual cash flow per share of 6x, revenues around 2x and accounting book value near 1.5x, roughly equals the 5-year average ratios since splitting from the refinery/downstream business. The upside for investors appears when oil prices rise back above $70 a barrel to meet growing demand. Conoco shareholders will reap all the gain as a ""profit"" for oil & gas price increases beyond today's $54 a barrel and $3.50 per MMBtu. For example, at $100 a barrel oil by 2018 and $5.00 per MMBtu natural gas, the present stock price is selling for just 3x ""forward"" cash flow and 1x sales yearly. An investor would expect a double in the share price if Wall Street continues to use historical pricing models.NOTE: Without a price rise in crude oil next year, the odds of a shortage situation start to snowball dramatically in 2018-19, as older oil fields are depleted and new ones fail to replace production volumes. Basically, oil prices jump a little now or considerably MORE LATER, all else being equal. This scenario assumes energy demand does not fall from a global recession any time soon, which has increased odds if President Trump insists on protectionist barriers to the U.S. economy.Suncor EnergySuncor is the largest integrated energy company in Canada. With oil & gas exploration and production assets spread widely, plus refineries, gas stations, wind farms and ethanol plants, this business entity has a lower than normal risk profile in the oil investment universe.Because of its diverse operations and more stable operating results, Suncor trades at higher valuation multiples than Conoco. The 10-year average of stock price to trailing annual cash flow per share is 9x, sales 2x, and book value 2x. Just like Conoco, Suncor is selling very near these ratios using consensus 2017 numbers, instead of trailing results at the oil bust low of 2016.Operating profits are substantially better than Conoco also with its diversification and lower debt/leverage at the oil price cycle low. Suncor's fiscal 2015 stockholder equity number was roughly the same size as its liability total, similar in design to the Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) or Chevron (NYSE:CVX) major integrated-oil balance sheet. Wall Street is projecting break-even profit numbers for 2016 and significant operating income in 2017. If your goal is to take on less downside risk, Suncor's lower than industry-norm debt level in 2016 and potential to restructure/sell non-core assets give this selection stronger investor capital protection.Warren Buffett was a large shareholder in both Suncor and Conoco during 2013-16, but his timing for owning stakes has proven well off the mark. He purchased both near peak pricing years ago, then unloaded most of his shares in 2016 at the oil cycle low. You cannot win all your battles, I guess.Suncor has invested heavily in higher-cost oil sands projects in Canada the last decade. If we get into a supply crisis situation years down the road with prices well above $100 a barrel again, Suncor should be able to bring to market new supply relatively quickly. If you believe abnormally high liquid fuel prices are in the offing, or want a buy and hold oil hedge investment with unlimited upside potential, Suncor makes a unique choice.HalliburtonHalliburton is the second largest oil services company in the world by sales, next to Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB). The high percentage surge from $28 a share in February to $54 today is in anticipation of demand growth for its leading refracturing technologies. A continuation of the oil price rise this year into 2017 will likely translate into an oversized climb in Halliburton's refrac demand/sales. Perhaps the lowest cost avenue to pump more oil from underperforming wells and older shale varieties left for dead, refracturing expands extraction rates and extends the existing life of oil deposits, especially in America. Current estimates are a small 5% of U.S. wells have used refracturing techniques to date.I would argue the oil industry, refracturing in general, and Halliburton in particular will be some of the biggest beneficiaries of a Trump presidency and Republican majority in Congress. With Halliburton's greater than typical political connections, including former Republican Vice-President Cheney as an employee, Trump's less strict EPA standards (deregulation) and jobs first focus should improve Halliburton's business outlook tremendously without any uptick in oil & gas prices.In 2015 the company attempted to purchase Baker Hughes (BHI), the third largest global oil services business. The failed bid, blocked by U.S. anti-trust powers, cost Halliburton a steep $3.5 billion in deal break-up fees. This amount and preparations for a prolonged industry downturn encouraged the company to issue $7.5 billion in low interest rate debt in 2015, between 2.7% and 5.0% for borrowing costs annually with maturity dates of 2020-45.As a result of this funding, Halliburton is well positioned financially to grow its business, after a successful restructuring period in 2015-16. At the September quarter reporting period, the company held $12 billion in current assets vs. $17 billion in total liabilities. While writing off some $7 billion in accounting equity since 2014, the majority of Halliburton's liabilities are lower cost, long-term ones not due for many years. Financial liquidity remains excellent if oil prices rebound and bring new business orders for the firm.Halliburton's common equity appears a little pricey at 14x annual cash flow estimated for 2017 by Wall Street analysts, against a 10-year average around 10x. Price to 2017 sales projections stand at 2.5x today vs. a 10-year average of 2x sales. The upside for Halliburton shareholders is the potential for high rates of renewed business growth (an oil boom), if refracturing activity explodes in the U.S. incentivized by improving oil profits at drillers and explorers. In all honesty, the stock price seems to be discounting much better times for Halliburton into 2018. Already in 2016, results for this year and next have been on a regular ""upgrade"" schedule. The company reported its first profitable quarter in a while during September, and is expected to be well into the black for operating income next year, assuming flat to slightly higher energy commodity pricing on the horizon.ConclusionWhile a list of oil and energy related investments may prove excellent long-term buys today, my focus is on blue-chip equities of the largest size, showing both strong underlying fundamental value and impressive trading momentum. The risk/reward idea is to buy into lower than average risk situations with better than average reward potential in coming quarters or even years. ConocoPhillips, Suncor and Halliburton fit this criteria the best. Please do your own due diligence and research before purchasing any investment. I believe these three are worth your time and effort digging deeper. Really big gainers in the stock market start out as small winners first. My system is a tool for identifying small winners that have a decent chance to become outperformance gems in the future."

The company was forced to pay a $3.5 billion breakup fee to Baker Hughes.The oil markets are becoming increasingly technological as companies have to turn towards unconventional sources of oil, while maximizing earnings from extraction.Halliburton's Frac of the Future systems offers companies an integrated solution that has been proven to maximize earnings. This makes the stock a strong investment.","Halliburton (NYSE: HAL) is the world's second largest oilfield services company that operates in numerous oil fields around the world. It provides technology and other critical services to companies to increase their ability to extract oil. Halliburton has recently had a difficult time as a result of the oil downturn along with a $3.5 billion breakup fee it had to pay when its merger with Baker Hughes (BHI) ended. However, given its technical strength and the increasing technological nature of oil extraction, I believe the company has strong potential going forward.IntroductionHalliburton is an American multinational corporation and one of the world's largest oilfield services with operations in more than 80 countries. It has hundreds of subsidiaries and divisions worldwide and employs an astounding 50 thousand people. The company has dual headquarters, with one in the west oilfield capital of Houston and another headquarter in Dubai, centered around serving eastern oil economies.(Source: Halliburton Pump - Net DNA CDN)Halliburton has had an incredibly difficult time since the start of the market crash as an oilfield service provider. Its stock price peaked in mid-2014 at just over $73 per share. From that point, the stock price dropped rapidly to a February 2016 low of less than $30 per share. Since then, Halliburton paid Baker Hughes a $3.5 billion breakup fee, and it has since recovered to present prices of just under $55 per share.Despite this recovery, Halliburton has enormous potential with the increasingly technical nature of the oil environment. As we will see, it is a strong investment at the present time as the world's second largest oilfield services company.Halliburton OverviewNow that we have an overview of Halliburton, including its recent stock price performance and how the company will benefit from the increasingly technical nature of the oil environment, it is now time to discuss Halliburton as a company.(Source: Halliburton Global Presence - Halliburton Investor Presentation)It was founded in 1919 and has since grown to a company with a market cap of just under $50 billion and approximately 50 thousand employees from 140 nationalities. The company has a total of 16 research centers and operates in 70 different countries. As we can see, Halliburton has a strong international presence with the assets to take advantage of the growing oilfield services markets.(Source: Halliburton Technological Overview - Halliburton Investor Presentation)Now that we have an overview of the company's portfolio, it is time to continue with its products and services portfolio. Halliburton has a well spread-out portfolio with technological assets in all steps of the oil markets. This will enable it to offer companies a step-by-step service option, an option that will enable Halliburton to earn revenue every step of the oilfields' development.Global Market OpportunityNow that we have discussed Halliburton overall, it is time to discuss the global market opportunity available to the company in the future.(Source: Halliburton Market Opportunity - Halliburton Investor Presentation)Halliburton sees its three largest markets for future growth as unconventionals, mature fields, and deepwater assets.Unconventional oil is defined as oil extracted through ""non-conventional"" means. Conventional oil fields such as the Ghawar Field in Saudi Arabia, which produces 5% of the world's oil production, are running out. This increased scarcity of conventional oil means companies and governments are turning increasingly to technologically intense unconventional oil. With its lowest cost per barrel, the use of technology here will increase earnings for oilfield service companies.Mature fields are those like the Ghawar Field in Saudi Arabia that we discussed above. Basically, they have been producing large amounts of oil for a long time. However, with the current lows in the oil markets, companies are interested in increasing extraction from mature fields rather than trying to discover new fields. Maximizing recovery from these fields requires intense technology.Lastly, there is deepwater oil exploration. These oil fields effectively include any oil that comes from the more than 50% of the world's area covered by oceans not near a landmass. Given that the majority of the world's easy oil onshore has run out, companies are increasingly turning to deepwater exploration to find the next major oil fields. However, deepwater drilling requires immense amounts of technology, and as the Deepwater Horizon spill showed, any mistake can result in disaster.This overview shows how the three major sources of future oil market growth all require massive amounts of technology. This will support Halliburton's future growth.(Source: Market Assets - Halliburton Investor Presentation)This image of the world shows the potential size of the market that Halliburton has to address. Currently, the world is consuming 33 billion barrels of oil annually - oil that will need to be found from somewhere. On top of this, the world is also consuming 122 trillion cubic feet of natural gas on an annual basis. All these reserves will need to be replaced on an annual basis.The above map shows the scale of the reserves from these major unconventional sources. Developing these kinds of shale reserves will require massive amounts of technology and shows the enormous future market potential for Halliburton.The Halliburton AdvantageNow that we have discussed the global market opportunity, it is time to discuss the Halliburton advantage and how this advantage, combined with the increasingly technical nature of future oil extraction we saw above, will provide the company with strong potential going forward.(Source: Halliburton Offering - Halliburton Investor Presentation)Halliburton provides companies with a centralized model for oilfield development. This comes through increased optimization and efficiency, along with technology to maximize extraction. Once this oil is found, Halliburton focuses on maximizing the efficiency of extracting this oil and getting it to market. These are all things that help in customers' costs per barrel declining and make them more likely to use Halliburton as their oilfield manager.(Source: Halliburton Frac of the Future - Halliburton Investor Presentation)Putting these components in numbers, the company offers the Frac of the Future, or a network of products and technological systems that will increase customers' earnings. Namely, Halliburton allows companies to undertake exploration with 20% less capital and 35% less personnel, while completing wells in 40% less time. These are all numbers that are crucial to shale operators.American E&P companies are, right now, starved for both cash and time. Maybe more so on the cash side, depending on the company, but still starved heavily on both fronts. Customers, and namely their investors, are looking to increase production and earnings quickly, while having to deploy minimal capital. These numbers are very real to investors. And they make Halliburton an amazing choice for customers.Thus, we can see how the company provides a significant advantage for its shareholders.Halliburton FinancialsNow that we have discussed Halliburton overall, along with the impressive global market opportunity and the advantage offered by the company to potential customers, it's now time to finish up by discussing its financials.(Source: Halliburton vs. Peers Total Revenue - Halliburton Investor Presentation)Halliburton, along with its peer group, has seen its total revenue take an impressive hit from the start of the crash. On a normalized basis, it has dropped to roughly 80% of its 1Q 2011 revenue, i.e., revenue that was still recovering from the 2008 crash. Compared to the company's 2014 revenue, Halliburton is at roughly 50% of where it was before the crash.Despite these difficulties, Halliburton has managed to achieve impressive returns on average capital employed. The company's 2016 return of 3%, while abysmal, is 50% above that of its peer group. Consistently over the past five years, Halliburton has consistently surpassed its peer group in average returns. This shows the strength of its market position.(Source: Halliburton North American and International Revenue vs. Peers - Halliburton Investor Presentation)In terms of North American and International revenue, the hit has been similarly difficult. However, there are two important things to be noted. North American revenue dropped rapidly; however, it bottomed in mid-2015 and has since stayed fairly average. International revenue is continuing to drop; however, it has been rising incredibly rapidly since 2011. This shows that it appears the worst damage is behind Halliburton.As a result, we can see that the company's financials have taken a hit, but it continues to remain strong and has outperformed its peer group.ConclusionHalliburton is the world's second largest oilfield services company, with dual headquarters and a market cap of approximately $50 billion. The company took a severe hit when it was forced to pay Baker Hughes a $3.5 billion breakup fee. Despite these difficulties, Halliburton has huge potential nestled in both the growing oilfield services environment and its offerings to customers.Traditional, conventional, easy-to-access oil is running out. And as a result, companies are turning increasingly to unconventional, deepwater, and other sources of oil that are harder to get at. Sources of oil that require technology. Halliburton, through its Frac of the Future system, offers an integrated solution to get at this oil, and this has allowed the company to stay financially ahead of its peer group.As a result of the recovering oil environment, along with Halliburton's impressive technology, I believe the stock is a strong investment at the present time."
4027562,99706,2016-12-01T10:37:39-05:00,"Halliburton is up 48% YTD despite revenues being a fraction of what they were pre-2014.After making a terrible mistake on the botched Baker-Hughes merger, management has been taking all the right steps to restore profitability.Leverage in HAL and other services companies has made for exaggerated gains.The stock has way overshot expectations and is vulnerable to a short-medium term decline.","Halliburton (NYSE: HAL) is the world's 2nd largest oilfield services company in the world and a sector leader, possessing much innovative technology that has assisted with unconventional oil production worldwide for many years. An S&P Energy Sector constituent, it has taken on a new identity during this two-year downturn in the industry. If you look at the two-year chart, the price action has taken to following the WTI price itself very closely, until recently, when enthusiasm for Halliburton jumped ahead of crude itself:HAL data by YChartsWhile this may seem logical, I believe the stock price has over time become completely divorced from the company's financials. Looking further back, there was a much healthier correlation between the two. What I am interested in doing is evaluating the case for investing in Halliburton right now, since I hold shares that I strongly suspect are overvalued.Several analysts on Seeking Alpha have recently weighed in on the latest quarterly earnings, in which Halliburton shocked the Street by posting a one cent per share profit instead of the expected third straight quarterly loss. Relentless cost-cutting and rebounding US shale drilling activity off annual lows did the trick, as North America revenue grew 9% and other regions declined or stayed flat.The consensus in the articles was that this is a reason to be near-term optimist/long-term bullish. But to put it in perspective, if this performance continues for 3 more quarters in a row, Halliburton will have a P/E of 1400 at current prices - more than the 4 FANGS combined.Of course, any positive P/E in the oil and gas sector these days is positive, as a rash of bankruptcies has already taken place and fingers remain crossed for that recovery ""just around the corner"" two years after the mess started. Investors are looking for a rebound in the sector. This morning's blow-the-doors-off rally over OPEC deciding to finally do what it said it was going to do in September confirms it.I remember the 2014 crash very well because I bought some overpriced shares in Halliburton at that time thinking it was going to be over in a few weeks. Times sure have changed. This February, I averaged down to my current cost base of about $39.I have also read several analyses making bullish calls for oil in general in 2017 but after today's news, Halliburton and several other bellwether energy securities such as the E&P SPDR (NYSEARCA: XOP), Transocean Ltd. (NYSE: RIG) and the United States Oil Fund (NYSEARCA: USO) are already up between 70 and 100% from their early 2016 lows.Are we really popping champagne for $50 oil? Can these securities rally further in hopes of adding even more to these already spectacular gains while the commodity remains at a price that was unthinkable only 2 years ago? Seems like oil was the trade of 2016 and expecting more of the same for 2017 might be too obvious or, I don't know, greedy?If you have only been following Halliburton for a year or two, you might think that it has always had this strong correlation with the price of crude oil. But when you look at its historical price action and longer-term financials, its current valuation no longer makes sense.When we look at the long-term chart of Halliburton, we see that it was only able to sustain levels above $50 for brief periods of time: in 2008, 2011, and 2014. However, this was when the company was banking billions in net income. People will point to today's OPEC cut, recovering oil prices, and increased shale activity in the US as reasons to be bullish, but even with today's surprise event, there is no indication that the global oversupply problem has been addressed in any meaningful way:HAL data by YChartsThe chasm between Halliburton's gross revenue vs. the value the market assigns the business has also never been so wide. This company's revenue has fallen by 50% in 2 years, yet the stock has stormed up nearly 100% from its lows on the back of higher crude prices. Granted, crude has made a move of about the same magnitude from peak to trough, but calling this leading market sentiment would be an understatement.Overvaluation has nothing to do with what's going on at the company itself. The company, apart from deciding to blow an amount equal to 10% of its equity paying its 2nd biggest competitor, Baker Hughes (NYSE: BHI) to not be acquired by it earlier this year, is exceptionally well managed. 2016 has been a lesson in management prowess. And CEO Dave Lesar struck a prudent tone when he spoke of how revenue might begin to recover:Source: Q3 earnings call transcriptNot his fault that the market is already pricing in a 100% increase in revenue that has yet to occur based on oil managing to stay over $50 (which, remember, it hasn't). It is also true that although revenue is down 50% from 2014's record, this coincided with the stock's all-time high. Looking at the financial snapshot below, the company will impress even if it manages to come within striking distance of 2015 revenue in 2017. This amount is only 21% below the 2012-2013 period, when the company was operating in a much better oil price environment:(Source: company website)The company will likely be fine long term, but how long can it stay ahead of the current valuation? I believe the real explanation that Halliburton, and energy services companies in general, have performed so strongly is because of leverage. When the downturn arrived, E&P companies kept their reserves and were guaranteed at least a certain amount of revenue from production. But services fell off a cliff because demand for services collapsed. When the world didn't end for the industry, which it arguably would have at $27 WTI, the snap-back for services was that much more violent. And the irony is that it was more so for the more leveraged players.Here is an example: Three much smaller Canadian oilfield service companies, Calfrac Well Services (OTC: OTCPK:CFWFF), Trican Well Service (OTC: TOLWF) and PHX Energy Services (OTC: OTC:PHXHF), which I have included in the comparison below, are among the best performers in all North American markets this year. Why? Because at the start of the year, they were basically written off. Down 90-95% from their highs, there was just no expectation that they would survive the low-price environment.Between the debt on their balance sheets and losses per share that equaled or were higher than their share prices, they were (and are) considered extremely high risk investments. With high risk comes high reward. PHX and Trican may not look like they have high debt levels but they have been seriously hemorrhaging cash since the downturn hit.Halliburton obviously has a much stronger and diverse client base and capital position than these companies, but remember that it also carries a significant amount of debt. At the time of its lows, it was dealing with the uncertainty around the merger with Baker Hughes and the hefty breakup fee it was on the hook for. This made its risk/reward significantly higher than its peers:(Source: my excel table using data from ycharts.com)This explains why the companies on this spreadsheet with poorest returns on equity ended up generating the highest returns for investors this year, even surpassing the Direxion 3x Energy Bull ETF (NYSEARCA:ERX). Halliburton, having a higher debt to equity and poorer returns on equity than its two rivals, Baker Hughes and Schlumberger (NYSE: SLB), delivered a higher return due to leverage.Meanwhile, its rivals' returns YTD are more in line with unleveraged products like USO or XLE. The most indebted American company on the list, Pioneer Energy Services (NYSE: PES), achieved the highest return among the US firms on the list, with the worst return on equity and highest debt of the bunch.Another telling indicator of Halliburton's price action is its book value. Three times in the last ten years it sat between 1.5 and 2.2, and each time the stock moved much higher. On the other hand, when the book value rose above four, it usually preceded a significant drawdown:HAL data by YChartsWhat is the takeaway? In the near term, sentiment will continue to drive the stock. But after these gains, some smart money will likely be headed for the exits. The valuation has clearly overshot the fundamentals and if it makes it to $60, it will be stretched like it has never been stretched before. It already is. The other thing to remember is that leverage cuts both ways. If you have ridden this company up, you may find yourself much more complacent than someone looking at the company as an investment right now.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

But it showed early indications of a rebound in the third quarter. The Houston, Texas based company will release its quarterly results before markets open on Monday, January 23 in which we will likely see a major sign of a turnaround.Halliburton, like other oilfield services companies such as Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) and Baker Hughes (BHI), has seen its revenues and earnings slump in the downturn. In the first nine months of this year, Halliburton witnessed a 36% drop in revenues to $11.87 billion while its operating income (ex. one off charges) plunged 72% to just $568 million. The decline in earnings was driven by a poor performance in North America, Halliburton's largest market, where it swung from an operating profit of $417 million to a loss of $229 million.The impairment charges of $3.2 billion also dragged Halliburton's profit. On top of this, the company also had to deal with the aftermath of its failed attempt to acquire Baker Hughes. In 2016, Halliburton booked a little over $4 billion as merger related costs and termination fees. With impairment and merger related charges, the company's total operating loss ballooned to $6.83 billion from $251 million last year.In the third quarter, however, Halliburton posted 9.4% increase in revenues, on a sequential basis, for the first time in the downturn while operating losses in the region also dropped by almost 47% to $66 million. That's a big deal considering that Halliburton traditionally gets almost half of its revenues and earnings from this market. That improvement was driven by an uptake in drilling activity in North America's onshore market, but the earnings were still in the red since pricing pressure persisted while the total rig count was still low on a year-over-year basis. However, since then, the US rig count has climbed even higher.At the start of the fourth quarter, there were 500 rigs operating in onshore US, as per data from Baker Hughes. That rig count increased to 634 units by the end of December. The uptake in drilling activity has been fueled by the strength in oil prices, which averaged more than $49 a barrel in the fourth quarter, up from $44.85 in the third quarter. The roughly 27% increase in rig count seen during the fourth quarter will have a positive impact on Halliburton's North America revenues which could climb by double-digits, on a sequential basis.More importantly though, during the third quarter conference call, Halliburton's CEO Dave Lesar said that the company, which was previously focusing on increasing its market share in the downturn, is now concentrating on improving its margins. The company gave temporary pricing concessions to oil producers during the downturn, but following the increase in oil prices, the company has been renegotiating contracts. Halliburton's management even said that they are prepared to lose some of their market share as they work toward improving their profit margins, particularly in North America. The impact of this shift in business strategy will be likely become apparent in the fourth quarter results.As mentioned earlier, Halliburton will likely report double-digit growth in North America revenues, but the gain is not going to be as large as the increase in rig count. This would imply a decrease in the company's market share. On the other hand, the change in strategy will likely have a positive impact on the company's margins. Halliburton will likely post improvement in earnings in North America, on a sequential basis. I believe the region, which has struggled with large losses in the downturn, can even return to profitability in the fourth quarter. This could be the first major sign of a turnaround.The positive results will be likely followed by upbeat commentary from Halliburton's management. Remember, the US rig count is still climbing. As per the latest report from Baker Hughes, there were 640 land rigs operating in the US at the end of last week, showing significant gains from the trough of 374 rigs seen at the end of May. More importantly, this time, the rig count was up on a year-over-year basis as well. In the same period a year earlier, there were 635 rigs operating in the onshore US.On top of this, the incoming Donald Trump administration has promised to bring an ""energy revolution"" in the US by tapping into the country's shale reserves and opening leasing on federal lands. This could translate into more work for Halliburton. The company could turn out to be a major beneficiary of Trump's pro-energy policies.Analysts are expecting a fourth quarter profit of $0.02 per share, as per consensus data from FactSet. This compares against Q3-2016 earnings of $0.01 per share and Q4-2015 earnings of $0.31 per share.Note from author: Thank you for reading.

It has cut head count and capex. It might be forced to cut dividends next.A dividend cut could create negative sentiment for HAL. Avoid the stock.,"Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) is known as one of the best-managed oilfield services companies. Despite the rout in oil prices the company maintained double-digit EBITDA margins through cost containment efforts. However, the failed Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI) merger and the company's $3.5 billion break-up fee has punished its cash flows. Halliburton's debt/EBITDA is at 5.8x - junk levels. If debt/EBITDA does not decline to 4.0x in 2017 then Moody's might downgrade Halliburton.I estimate it might need to raise about $3.8 billion to avoid a downgrade. The company has cut headcount and capital expenditures to stem cash burn and protect its credit rating. The dividend could be next to go.Halliburton's Free Cash Flow Is AbysmalI have long been a HAL bear. Its 13% rise in the month of December has left me chafing, and bulls have been loud about too:Despite the rise in the stock the company's free cash has been abysmal through the first nine months of the year (""YTD0916"").Is The Dividend Next To Go?Free cash flow for 0916 was -$3.3 billion versus $297 million last year. The company's cash balance has fallen from $10.1 billion at year-end 2015 to $3.3 billion at Q3 2016. Meanwhile, the company has paid out $465 million in dividends so far this year; this equates to about $155 million per quarter or over $600 million annually.Halliburton's reduction of capex by $1.2 billion from the year earlier period is evidence that it needs to tighten its belt. The company has squandered billions via the merger break-up fee and share repurchases. It would behoove management to signal to the rating agencies that it is doing all it can to maintain liquidity and demonstrate fiscal restraint. One such signal could be a cut to its dividend. Otherwise, a ratings downgrade amid already rising interest rates could cause the cost of capital on its $12 billion debt load to rise prohibitively.ConclusionA cut to Halliburton's dividend could cause the staunchest HAL bulls to turn negative on the stock. Facing a potential ratings downgrade, the company might not have much choice. I currently value HAL at less than $15, yet it trades at over $50. Avoid the stock."

I estimate it needs to raise $3.8B in equity to avoid a debt downgrade.Getting involved with WFT would be a $12B mistake. I rate HAL and WFT a sell.,"Halliburton CEO Dave LesarIt has been an interesting month for Weatherford (WFT). Market chatter suggested the company could breach its debt covenants, driving WFT to a 52-week low of $3.73. Its CEO resigned and the company later raised $540 million in debt and $450 in equity. A Forbes contributor suggested Weatherford's sell off was unwarranted and Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) might be interested in acquiring the company:In my opinion, Halliburton could not afford to take on Weatherford's $7.5 billion debt load and impaired balance sheet.The SituationHalliburton is still suffering from the $3.5 billion break-up fee for its failed Baker Hughes merger. I personally never thought regulators would approve a deal between the number two and three oil services participants. The notion that Halliburton would pursue another multi-billion deal so soon seems far-fetched. The notion that it - or any other oil services firm - could afford Weatherford seems even more far-fetched.WFT Would Be A $12 Billion MistakeA deal for Weatherford would result in Halliburton wasting another $12 million.WFT Is Overvalued By $8.2 billionWeatherford is overvalued by several metrics. The company trades at 26.7x last 12 months (""LTM"") EBITDA. Selected oil services companies like Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB), Halliburton and National Oilwell Varco (NYSE:NOV) trade at an average of 22.7x EBITDA.Based On Liquidation Value WFT Is Insolvent By $3.5 billionWeatherford's unbridled expansion has gotten the company into dire straits. Its assets - particularly goodwill and PP&E - are in disrepair. Prior to its recent equity raise of about $500 million, I estimated that [i] the company's $12.6 billion in assets were overvalued by $6.4 billion and [ii] it was insolvent by $4 billion.The company has burned through $547 million in cash through year-to-date September 2016. It has raised nearly $5 billion in capital to push back near-term principal payments, cure potential covenant breaches and fund cash burn. Its EBITDA does not cover its $129 million quarterly interest expense, so its cash burn will likely continue unabated.Including Weatherford's equity raise, I estimate it is now insolvent by about $3.5 billion. If Halliburton acquired Weatherford without a takeover premium, it would overpay by $8.2 billion. Halliburton would then have to cure Weatherford's $3.5 billion insolvency. Combined, such a deal would result in a $12 billion waste of moneyHalliburton Needs $3.8 Billion To Avoid Debt DowngradeWeatherford is in dire need of capital, but Halliburton has problems of its own. Its balance sheet has been punished by its $3.5 billion gift to Baker Hughes. Secondly, though drilling activity has rebounded, the oil patch is still oversupplied. Halliburton's Q3 EBITDA was down 44% Y/Y. An oversupplied market and drillers' reticence to spend on services could tamp down future earnings.Halliburton's debt/EBITDA is at 5.1x and I project it could reach 5.8x at the end of Q4. If Halliburton does not reduce debt/EBITDA to 4.0x in 2017, Moody's could issue another downgrade. Such an event, in concert with rising rates, could increase Halliburton's borrowing costs by a few hundred basis points. I project that a $3.8 billion debt pare down could reduce debt/EBITDA to 4.0x by year-end. It would behoove Halliburton to consider an equity raise to shore up its balance sheet and improve its credit metrics. The last thing it needs is exposure to capital-starved Weatherford.ConclusionA Forbes contributor suggests that Halliburton throw away another $12 billion by investing in Weatherford. I believe Halliburton needs to batten down the hatches, cut costs and raise additional capital. I rate both stocks a sell."

        Avoid HAL into earnings.","Source: Getty ImagesHalliburton (NYSE:HAL) reports Q4 earnings on January 23rd. Analysts expect revenue of $4.08 billion and eps of $0.01. The revenue estimate implies 6% growth sequentially. Investors should focus on the following key items:North America Should SizzleQ3 2016 revenue showed promise. Total revenue growth was flat sequentially, versus a 9% decline in Q2. Revenue from North America was up 9% as animal spirits returned to the oil patch.Agreed upon production cuts by OPEC have sent oil prices into the mid-$50 range. At December 30, 2016, the North American rig count was 815, up 4.4% Y/Y. Higher drilling activity could spur North America to double-digit growth this quarter. Halliburton receives 43% of its revenue from the region, and has used its hefty balance sheet to win business in the past. I expect North America to sizzle again this quarter.Latin America (11% of total revenue), on the other hand, could be a disappointment. Venezuela's state-owned PDVSA amassed $1 billion in unpaid bills which caused Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) and Halliburton to reduce exposure until it could pare its payables. The company signed a financing agreement with PDVSA, but if the crisis stricken country continues to pay late, then Halliburton might have to pull back again. Latin America revenue fell 13% last quarter and I expect the region to decline again in Q4.The Balance Sheet Is A ConcernHalliburton has an image of having a pristine balance sheet. The downturn in the oil & gas industry, and the company's $3.5 billion break-up fee to Baker Hughes (BHI) have ravaged the company. Moody's downgraded Halliburton to Baa1 in June due to deteriorating credit metrics. If Halliburton does not reduce debt/EBITDA to 4.0x in 2017, Moody's could downgrade its debt again.Another negative action could hurt given already rising rates. I estimate Halliburton's debt/EBITDA could approach 5.8x by the end of 2016, and the company might need to raise equity of over $3 billion in equity in order to bring its debt/EBITDA down to 4.0x. It would behoove the company to raise equity now; additional Fed rate hikes could drive the market, and HAL lower.ConclusionSequential revenue growth would be welcomed by bulls. However, a ratings downgrade could be in the cards. Investors should avoid HAL."

It has been a decade since the oilfields service company has had that high of a valuation.The obvious question is whether or not the company will continue to generate significant revenue and earnings growth in 2017, or it's going to experience a pull back from shareholders taking money off the table, or oil market growth not approaching levels expected after the production cut deal by OPEC and some non-OPEC producers.I don't think the output cuts will have much impact on the price of oil because of how quickly supply has been coming to the market, but in the case of Halliburton, I don't see that as a problem because it has a lot of exposure to U.S. shale production, which because of the removal of a lot of costs from the production process, they are going to boost output no matter where the price of oil is at.Not only will Halliburton get the benefit of completing wells, but from the growing trend of getting more out of mature fields, which it said in its third-quarter earnings report will lead the recovery it expects is coming.The good news for Halliburton to me is it will be able to get a lot of this business whether or not the production cuts support the price of oil as most have assumed.Looking ahead, completing wells and working mature fields is what will drive Halliburton's performance going forward, and with that in mind, it appears it should be able to continue its momentum through 2017 and probably 2018. The caveat there is how much rising oil supply levels will impact the price of oil.At this time I think it's not going to go as high as the market in general thinks, and in the case of WTI oil, could drop on average into the high $40s during the year. As I mentioned, this shouldn't have much impact on the performance of Halliburton. And if the price of oil is higher than that, it'll only be more reason to expect strong results.source: StockCharts.comHalliburton's resilienceOne thing that has impressed me recently about Halliburton was its ability to boost its share price at such high levels after what appeared to be a disastrous outcome from its failed attempt to acquire Baker Hughes (BHI). Not only that, but it had to pay a huge breakup fee of $3.5 billion.Under most circumstances, including the low-price environment of oil in the early part of the year, a company would have been written off by most investors, who would have waited for the presumed weakening of the share price of the company afterwards. That not only didn't happen, but as mentioned above, the company achieved extraordinary success during that time.This suggests to me investors believe the company has a lot of growth left in it, and the real issue to me is the 20 percent jump in share price it enjoyed over the last three months will result in taking some profits. Since Halliburton isn't usually a company that big money moves in and out of quickly, it would be surprising to me to see that happen.Not only has Halliburton been very resilient, it looks to be that it still has a lot of near-term growth left in it. I think it would be difficult to reproduce the results from last year, but it depends on how the market interprets the price of oil and what I believe will be a failed attempt by the participants in the oil production deal to support oil at any meaningful level.If the market considers the output cuts as a major catalyst for Halliburton, then it could experience some pullback. On the other hand, if the market sees the growth potential in U.S. shale completions and mature fields, the company could overcome whatever disappointment the general market will experience if supply exceeds expectations.Halliburton's exposure to U.S. shaleWhen considering its major peers, Halliburton has the most exposure to the U.S. shale industry, and as a result will benefit the most from increases in completed wells and improving mature well performance in the oilfield segment. This is where its primary growth potential lies for 2017.Another thing I like about Halliburton as it relates to U.S. shale production is at this time over 95 percent of premium wells remain to be completed, which to me speaks of long-term consistency, while at the same time mature wells are ready right now to be worked and improved upon.In regard to mature fields, the U.S. isn't all Halliburton has going for it. It also will serve projects in various capacities in Igapo in Ecuador, Bayan gas and oil reserves in East Malaysia and Humapa in Mexico.With its 2014 mature fields deal with Ecuador , it receives an additional but undisclosed amount for each barrel produced in the those blocks.CEO David J. Lesar says he sees mature fields leading the way in international recovery.He said this during the third-quarter conference call:Possible headwinds to considerWhile it looks good for Halliburton in 2017, there are a couple of things to consider that could offset some of its upside performance.Oilfield managers have stated in the recent past that they are going to only pursue working with those projects that generate positive returns. When the price of oil plummeted, the contract rates for service dropped with it, which put downward pressure on margins and earnings for oilfield businesses.If some producers refuse to give up too much, and Halliburton holds its ground, it could result in the loss of some business. That is not likely to happen at a significant level, depending on how competitors respond to opportunities of winning more business, albeit at a lower profit.Historically, companies have gravitated more toward acquiring the services of the top oilfield providers, which plays well to Halliburton's strength, being the second-largest oilfield service provider in the world.In reality, I don't see market conditions improving enough for Halliburton to get top contract rates. There is simply too much excess equipment on the market to be utilized to support top prices. They'll probably be able to improve prices over last year, but not to the level they were getting before oil prices dropped.Interestingly, that potentially negative catalyst could be turned into a positive if more business is generated as a result of lower prices. Under that scenario revenue would increase, but margins and earnings would be more subdued than in the past couple of years.This is another reason I think Lesar sees mature fields leading the global recovery.One last thing with the mature fields and improvements in premium fields. Since producers are generating more oil from wells, it could result in them holding off on completing new wells or investing more revenue in mature fields until market conditions improve. In that case it result in Halliburton not getting as much business as it's pricing in.ConclusionAlong with many other companies exposed to oil, Halliburton took the low-price environment to tackle some of its costs, and has reached its goal of removing about $1 billion in annual costs from operations. It was able to do that in the third quarter, beating its goal of completing the cuts by the end of 2016.In turn, that has allowed Halliburton to offer lower cost solutions to upstream companies looking to invest less and generate better returns. That of course means Halliburton has been passing on some of the lower costs to its customers, while at the same improving its own bottom line.I do see Halliburton having another good year, primarily from its expected growth in the mature fields business. What degree of business it'll get from completing wells remains to be seen, but that is expected to be fairly robust in the shale locations in the U.S., which will be partially determined by how much support oil prices get during the year.The low-cost shale producers are going to continue to complete wells under almost any price environment, but if oil prices to find support at around $50 and above, it would mean more producers would be willing to complete more wells and sell more oil under those conditions. They don't want to use up too much of their inventory if they can get better returns by waiting a little longer.What is changing and is beneficial to Halliburton, is U.S. shale producers are now looking to compete on the global market, which suggests they could ramp up production to grow market share there, providing a secondary source of revenue for its crude. This could bring more demand for oilfield services. This will roll out slowly in the first half, but once the methodology and logistics are fine tuned, this could quickly boost activity in shale locations around the U.S., specifically those located closer to the Gulf.I think the pros outweigh the cons for Halliburton over the next year. It appears new investors and existing shareholders will enjoy some solid profits going forward. The price of oil will determine the level of growth, but it won't stop growth unless support for oil evaporates"

        Investors holding opinions about the rig count will be informed by projections of Halliburton's fair value in several scenarios.","Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) operates in a highly cyclical industry. One obvious factor, impacting its business is the oil price. Higher prices would stimulate increased supply via oil producers raising their demand for the company's services. However, the firm does not directly benefit from rising oil prices. Among factors directly affecting the company's earnings, one is particularly visible. The Baker-Hughes (BHI) rig count is illustrative of the volume of drilling, and is a leading indicator of subsequent well completion and production activities. Among different places where rigs might be deployed, onshore unconventional is the style of oil production believed to be the first to experience recovery. In this article, I will discover the implications of taking the US land rig count to be the single quantity, explaining all recent and near-term future variability in Halliburton's earnings. As a result, it will be possible to infer the market expectations about the oilfield services industry's overall activity level priced into the stock. With some more analysis, it will be determined if the stock is rich or cheap at this time.The major driver of Halliburton's earnings is highly volatileThe boom-and-bust nature of oilfield services is demonstrated by the following exhibit.(Source: Baker Hughes North America Rig Count)Averaging 1305 (the level indicated by the horizontal blue line) since 2000, the US land rig count bounced off the all-time low of 380 in the second half of May. It has been on a nearly straight-line march up since then, reaching 548 early this month.Halliburton's recent earnings were depressed due to lower activity levelsThe firm's business segments participate in all stages of taking a well to production, from the initial ""drilling and evaluation"" that is perhaps most directly related to the contemporaneous rig count, to ""completion and production"" that occur after a well has been drilled. The latter is relatively more important to Halliburton than it is to its large competitor Schlumberger Limited (NYSE:SLB). In this article, the rig count is taken to be the observable variable that is perhaps most directly related to the company's EBITDA.Along this line of thought, the current quarter's earnings are potentially better viewed as affected by the preceding quarter's rig count rather than the current quarter's. I took the adjusted operating income disclosed in the company's quarterly and annual filings to compute the adjusted EBITDA figures. The following chart contrasts adjusted quarterly EBITDA and US land rig count observed on dates three months prior to those shown.(Source: Halliburton's earnings releases, Baker Hughes North America Rig Count and author's analysis)There is a strong relationship between the two. As the following exhibit shows, we would do well to model it with a straight line.(Source: Halliburton's earnings releases, Baker Hughes North America Rig Count and author's analysis)For clarification, focusing solely on rig count in the US does not mean that the firm's sizable international operations are disregarded, or that its ""completion and production"" business segment is left stale even as activity in ""drilling and evaluation"" is forecasted to pick up. These all are included, with the operative assumption being that these other factors vary over time the same way as the US land rig count.The market looks ahead in valuing the firmLet's think about the process of pricing the stock using the ratio of enterprise value (NYSE:EV) to annual EBITDA. The market is always looking ahead. If, for example, EBITDA over the next 12 months is expected to be high enough that the ratio of today's EV to one year-forward trailing twelve months (NYSE:TTM) EBITDA equals historical average, then at today's price the stock would be valued fairly a year from now. As a result, on average the stock would not be expected to either appreciate or decline.The firm's adjusted EBITDA figures in recent quarters are likely some of the lowest it has ever seen. As the rig count recovers, they are expected to increase according to the forecast just built. We can tie this with an estimate of the stock's fair price via EV/EBITDA. Here is where the ratio has been over the past sixteen years:(Source: data from gurufocus.com)The analysis below will show that Halliburton shares are likely worth far more than $15, contrary to a recent Seeking Alpha article's bearish call on Halliburton. That article's argument rested on two crucial assumptions:Using a higher multiple would, ceteris paribus, raise the estimated fair value of the stock price. Incorporating a higher-than-recent forecast of EBITDA based on the expectation of recovery towards the long term average level of exploration, drilling, completion and production activity will have the same effect.The minimum multiple seen in the past twenty years was 9.1. The multiple averaged 11.5 since 2000 and also in the past 20 years. The mean observed during the preceding decade stands at 12.4. I will use EV/EBITDA of 11.5 consistently with long-term historical average. The closing share price of $48.01 on November 11 along with Q3 2016 quarter-end balance sheet data imply the quarterly adjusted EBITDA of $1.31 billion.Referring to the forecast of earnings as a function of the rig count, the implied long-term average US land rig count would have to be around 1,280 to yield the requisite quarterly EBITDA. This rig count figure is indeed very close to the average of 1,304 seen since 2000. Given the uncertainties and the error margins inherent in the estimation process, Halliburton stock appears to be valued perfectly in line with the historical activity level.How useful is history?Looking back, the rig count stayed above 1300 from mid-2005 to the very rapid crash in early 2015, with a brief gap from early 2009 to a year later. Looking further back to before 2005, the count has never exceeded 1300 for as long as an eye can see (Baker Hughes data start in 1987). Is the return to boom years likely?Looking ahead, the rig count implicit in Halliburton's price is 240% of the latest count. Intuitively, it seems too high from the perspective of oil supply and demand. The market would likely be oversupplied if the rig count reached that high a level, meaning the rig count would not be sustainable.Halliburton's fair share price versus the long-term drilling activityInvestors can differ in their views on where the drilling activity will ultimately stabilize. A decision maker can anticipate a recovery to a level other than what the market pricing implies, estimated here to be about 1300 rigs drilling in the US onshore. To this effect, the following table presents the estimated fair values of the stock price at several values of the future long-term average of US land rig count.(Source: author's analysis)In the above, two estimates are presented for every rig count. The difference between them stems from how adjusted earnings are projected to rise with rig count. An argument could be made that due to efficiency improvements, as well as wells becoming more productive than before at the cost of drilling longer laterals and using greater quantities of proppant (all of these leading to wells becoming more expensive), the company in the future might be more profitable than in the past, at the same level of drilling activity. This possibility might be a subject of a future article. For how, however, a shortcut is taken by estimating the regression of EBITDA on rig count using just the most recent four quarters, leading to share price estimates shown in the second column, as opposed to estimating the same regression using data since 2014, resulting in prices in the third column. Using the recent trend means the rig count does not need to rise by as much, for shares to be viewed as fairly valued.Other thoughtsHalliburton's $3.5 billion break-up fee paid to Baker Hughes is water under the bridge. It has no future relevance unless it reduces the company's ability to conduct its business or bears negatively on the management's judgment. I suggest that as long as the company does not attempt M&A again any time soon, the failure to conclude the merger can be left in the past.ConclusionHalliburton's recent price of $48.01 per share is consistent with US land rig count recovering to about 1,300 in the long term, which incidentally is the average rig count seen since 2000. Looking another way, a fair stock price estimate rises about $4.25 per every 100 rigs being deployed. While the current price is about right, there is probably more downside than upside risk at this time.Note from author: Thank you for reading.

The number two oil services firm seemed desperate in offering Baker Hughes a $3.5 billion merger break-up fee even if regulators nixed the deal. Since the failed merger, Baker Hughes has agreed to merge with GE's (NYSE:GE) oil & gas operations, and Halliburton's stock is up 23% to $49.Since Q4 2015, Halliburton's net debt increased from $4.6 billion to $8.9 billion - a $3.5 billion break-up fee and declining cash flows tend to have that sort of effect. The company's debt metrics also deteriorated. Debt/EBITDA increased from 4.6x at Q2 to 5.1x last quarter. I project it could rise to 5.8x at the end of the year.The above table illustrates Halliburton's debt/EBITDA for Q3 2016 and for Q4 2016E. Q4 2016E revenue of $4.06 billion was derived from Yahoo.Debt/EBITDA of 5.8x could trigger a ratings downgrade by Moody's.Is A Ratings Downgrade In The Cards?In June, Moody's downgraded Halliburton to Baa1 with a negative outlook; Baa1 is lower medium grade - not what you would expect from an industry leader like HAL. Moody's cited additional debt the company incurred to finance the Baker Hughes merger, an erosion of revenue and cash flow in the oil field services space, and an erosion of Halliburton's credit metrics as reasons for the downgrade. Moody's intimated it could downgrade Halliburton further if debt/EBITDA did not decline towards 4.0x in 2017,Again, my high-level assumptions show Halliburton's credit metrics deteriorating further.A $3.8 Billion Equity Raise Could HelpThere is no guarantee Halliburton's EBITDA margins will improve going forward. Animal spirits returned to the oil patch in Q3, but the North American land drilling sector (where Halliburton generates over 30% of its revenue) is oversupplied, and drillers have held back on services. With an enterprise value of $52 billion, HAL trades at 21x trailing EBITDA. In my opinion, it could use its expensive currency to raise equity and pare debt.Debt at 4.0x trailing EBITDA through Q4 2016 would equate to $8.4 billion. It would need to raise approximately $3.8 billion to bring its $12.2 billion debt down to these levels. An equity raise could help protect its credit metrics and protect the company's debt rating going forward. HAL closed around $49 on Friday. Hypothetically, the company could issue 86 million new shares at $44 (10% discount to current price) to raise capital. It would create 10% dilution with current shares outstanding of 864 million.Time is of the essence. If the Fed raises interest rates in mid-December, it could drive the entire market lower, including Halliburton's stock. Secondly, interest rates have spiked since Donald Trump got elected. The market anticipates nearly $1 trillion in infrastructure spending could spur inflation. Bonds have since sold off and 10-year treasury yields are now at 2.22%, over 60 basis points higher than at the beginning of October.Halliburton's weighted average cost of capital is around 4.5-5.0%. A potential ratings downgrade combined with rising interest rates could cause its cost of capital to rise amid a gloomy outlook for the global economy.ConclusionHalliburton should consider using its inflated stock price to raise equity and pare debt. It would shore up its balance sheet and protect its credit rating. The window of opportunity could close if the Fed raises rates next month. At 21x trailing EBITDA - outside my 7x range - HAL remains a sell."
4014253,33291,2016-10-24T11:28:58-04:00,Q3 earnings are out and I discuss results.We must get back to the fundamentals.I am watching one key data point.,"Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) is an oil service stock that I have traded many times over the years despite having long preferred rival Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB). That said, both are very similar in many respects. The pain in the oil sector has begun to subside as oil has started to climb back. For the last year and a half, the pain has been real for investors in the sector, but I have been behind the names, encouraging you to buy this dip for months. Those calls are paying off. Now that the drama of the Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI) ordeal is behind us, save the $3.5 billion Halliburton dumped, we need to get back to looking at the fundamentals to determine the keys to survival, and we must carefully consider the performance of these names on an individual basis.To determine where the stock may be heading, aside from oil prices, we need to talk about performance. Again, with oil prices so low of late, though rebounding somewhat in 2016, it has crushed the company. This is particularly true when we look back two or three years ago. The higher the price, the better. That's just a fact that is true for all of the oil service names. That said, Halliburton missed analyst expectations on revenues and beat expectations on the bottom line.So what kind of numbers are we talking about? Well, despite an earnings beat, a comparison to last year clearly demonstrates the pain the company has been experiencing. Of course, it should surprise no one, with oil having dropped to decade lows coming into 2016. The company did swing from a loss from continuing operations in its second quarter of $121 million to a gain of $128 million or $0.01. This beat analyst estimates by $0.08 per share. Adjusted operating income was $62 million in Q3 2016, down from the adjusted operating income of $506 million in Q3 2015. Again this is no surprise and is a direct result of revenues that dropped markedly. Halliburton's total revenue in Q3 was $3.83 billion compared to $5.58 billion in Q3 2015. Ouch. This also missed estimates by $70 million.Let us not forget that expectations were drastically low, thanks to oil prices. Still, Halliburton managed to control expenses, and really this is the key to survival for this sector right now. Over the last year, the company has slashed its expenditures in just about every category. That's really all that matters in the short run and really what you need to keep an eye on. Commodity pricing is driving revenues, so the bottom line can thus be impacted by watching spending. With a cursory review of revenues and operating income/loss statements, it becomes clear that the company managed to decrease operating expenses in most categories, and this is the key to its survival.It is no surprise that with revenues declining so rashly that operating income would be hit year over year. Looking ahead, oil is rebounding in the near term. I expected a terrible quarter, and once again I was not disappointed, although the company beat my expectations. However, the market may be turning a corner. With the merger and acquisition debacle in the past, we can get back to watching expenses, production and debt. I maintain a hold rating on the name, but am optimistic for the coming quarters given the move higher in oil.Note from the author: Christopher F.

        HAL's North America rebound were offset by a 6% decline in international markets.
        North America remains oversupplied and poor pricing could crimp HAL's paltry 13% EBITDA margins.
        At nearly 24x EBITDA HAL is grossly overvalued. Avoid the stock.","Halliburton CEO Dave LesarAfter Q2 results Halliburton's (NYSE:HAL) CEO, Dave Lesar, intimated that animal spirits had returned to the oil patch. The rise in oil prices to $50 has buoyed shale oil plays. They have started drilling again, which has helped the prospects of major oil services firms like Halliburton, Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) and Baker Hughes (BHI). Total revenue of $3.8 billion was flat sequentially but down 31% Y/Y.That said, Mr. Lesar delivered on his prognostications as revenue from North America rose 9% Q/Q. The average rig count rose 14% during the quarter, which connotes higher drilling activity. However, the return of animal spirits to North America might not lift Halliburton long-term for the following reasons:There Might Be A Delay In Services RevenueThe general consensus is that while equipment spending in North America might rebound, services revenue could lag. First of all, shale plays are still highly-indebted and strapped for cash. For now it might be prudent to drill while oil hovers near $50, yet cut back on services until oil prices find a firm footing. Halliburton intimated that there could be slim pickings for services revenue going forward:And the business that remains will likely be hard-fought. Schlumberger recently admitted that at the hydraulic fracturing segment remains oversupplied:A bevy of oil services firms fighting over a shrinking pie is good for drillers, but not so good oil services firms. And while Halliburton is loathe to chase business, financially strapped oil services companies like Weatherford International (WFT) might not have that luxury. Weatherford's $7.5 billion debt load represents 30x EBITDA, and its has burned through $540 million in cash this year. Weatherford's Q3 EBITDA in North America was -$40 million, which could portend it is underpricing business in order to stay afloat. Such cut throat competition could dampen Halliburton's prospects in the region.International Is A HeadwindNow that North America seems to be gaining traction, Halliburton's international operations are providing headwinds. The company experienced revenue and pricing headwinds in all three international markets. Total international revenue fell 6% Q/Q and the international rig count fell 17% compared to the year earlier period.The worst performer was Latin America where revenue was off 13%. Crisis-stricken Venezuela has seen its revenue dampened with the rout in oil prices. The country gets about half its revenue from oil, and has amassed billions in unpaid bills to oil services firms as it has faced trouble feeding its citizens and providing basis services. Halliburton has curtailed operations in Venezuela due to slow payments from state oil company PDVSA. It currently has $564 million in trade receivables (13% of total receivables) in Venezuela and expects the country to be a major headwind going forward.ConclusionThe decline in Halliburton's international operations offset the euphoria from the rebound in North America. The company's top line growth could remain dismal until international bottoms out, which might not occur until the first half of 2017. Meanwhile, certain segments in North America remain oversupplied which could cap the company's paltry 13% EBITDA margins. At nearly 24x run-rate EBITDA (last three quarters annualized) HAL is grossly overvalued. Avoid the stock."

Get out.","Source: Getty ImagesHalliburton's (NYSE:HAL) failed merger with Baker Hughes (BHI) was the talk of the financial markets during the first half of the year. Regulators sent a message to big business and hedge fund managers that they would not be a rubber stamp on corporate marriages. The decision was an expensive one, requiring Halliburton to cough up a $3.5 billion break-up fee. At the time, HAL traded around $40; seven months and $3.5 billion later, it is about 20% to $48.Oil prices have risen, but that has not resulted in a commensurate rebound in E&P. Q3 revenue from North America rose 9% sequentially, but was offset by a 6% decline in international operations. The international rig count fell 17% Y/Y and might not bottom out until the first half of 2017. Halliburton has curtailed operations in Venezuela - one of the world's largest oil producers - due to slow payments.Despite the initial euphoria in North America, the region remains oversupplied, which could hurt pricing long term. HAL is worth a lot less now than before the failed merger.Halliburton Is Worth Less Than $15Based on a bottoms-up analysis, HAL is worth less than $15, which is alarming given its $46 share price. Once the Fed-induced asset bubble pops, the stock could crater.RevenueLast 12-month revenue through September 2016 (""LTM0916"") of $16.9 billion is the starting point for the valuation. Revenue has practically fallen off a cliff during the review period. It could fall further if oil prices decline in lockstep with the global economy.EBITDAEBITDA is for the last 12 months and equates to a 14% EBITDA margin. Halliburton's margins are paltry vis-a-vis Schlumberger's (NYSE:SLB) margins which are in the low 20% range. 43% of its revenue comes from North America which remains oversupplied. Poor pricing in the region could hamper EBITDA margins for the foreseeable future.Enterprise ValueThe company's enterprise value (equity and debt) is $16.8 billion at a 7x EBITDA multiple, which is appropriate for cyclical names.Equity ValueAfter subtracting net debt (debt less cash and equivalents) of $8.9 billion, I derived an equity value of $8.0 billion. Net debt was only $5.8 billion as recently as Q1 2016. Its increase has hurt HAL's intrinsic value.Per Share PriceI assumed 861 million shares outstanding, which was sourced from Yahoo.ConclusionHAL is worth less than $15 per share. It currently trades at $48, which is grossly overvalued. Sentiment over rising oil prices has been overdone, in my opinion. Until rising E&P leads to rising revenue and earnings, HAL will remain a sell."
4014136,93466,2016-10-24T03:39:07-04:00,"Halliburton posted a surprise profit last quarter due to its aggressive cost management moves, but the company can do better going forward as the end-market improves.The rig count in North America is picking up pace, providing a tailwind to Halliburton which has been increasing its utilization rate to take advantage of the recovery.Since oil companies are looking for solutions to reduce expenses and enhance production, Halliburton has been deploying technologies that enable the same.In fact, due to its productivity enhancing techniques, Halliburton has been able to improve its completion and production revenues, indicating that it is moving in the right direction.","Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) has done impressively on the market so far this year, rising more than 41%. This rise in Halliburton shares can be attributed to the company's impressive cost management efforts, which have allowed it to keep its earnings in decent shape despite the downturn in the oilfield services industry.What's working for HalliburtonIn fact, as a result of its focus on aggressive cost management, Halliburton surprised analysts on Wednesday last week by posting a profit of $0.01 per share. More specifically, the company overwhelmed Wall Street's expectation of a loss of $0.07 per share. What's more, Halliburton's earnings were significantly up as compared to a loss of $0.14 per share in the second quarter of 2016. This growth in its earnings was despite the company reporting a 0.3% decline in revenue on a sequential basis.Thus, it is evident that Halliburton's focus on reducing costs has worked well for it. As a result of its structural cost reduction efforts, Halliburton has achieved more than $1 billion of cost savings so far this year. In fact, these cost containment actions are expected to generate $1 billion of cost savings on an annual basis going forward.In my opinion, given the sluggishness in the activity levels in the oilfield services industry, Halliburton's focus on keeping costs low is a good move. However, investors should not ignore the fact that apart from its focus on cost reductions, there are two more factors that could lead to an improvement in Halliburton's performance going forward. Let's take a look.Looking past the cost reductionsThough cost reductions have worked well for Halliburton so far, the company can't expect to reduce costs forever. As such, Halliburton needs to witness an improvement in the end-market if it is to keep improving its financial performance. The good news is that there seems to be a turnaround taking place in the end-market of late, and this could prove to be a tailwind for Halliburton going forward.I'm saying this because the rig count is steadily improving in the U.S. In a span of two months, the North American rig count has increased nearly 20% to 704 rigs. Moreover, the improvement in the rig count has accelerated in the last couple of weeks. For instance, the rig count in North America for the week ending October 14 was 704 rigs, representing an increase of 15 rigs in from the previous week. This is shown in the table below.Source: Baker HughesAs a result of this increase in the rig count, activity levels are gradually getting better in North America. This has resulted in an improvement in the utilization rates of oilfield services companies such as Halliburton as the company is looking to make the most of the emerging end-market activity.For instance, Halliburton has sped up equipment utilization to take advantage of this improvement in the rig count in North America. As such, its revenue in North America increased by 9% to $1.7 billion on a sequential basis, while operating profit improved by over $58 million. In fact, improved activity levels enabled Halliburton to deliver operating cash flow of more than $1 billion for the third quarter of 2016.Thus, it is apparent that Halliburton is benefiting from an improvement in the end-market scenario in North America. More importantly, since the company will focus on enhancing its equipment utilization levels at the current oil price of $50 a barrel, it should witness further growth in its financials. More importantly, Halliburton's focus on delivering new technology in order to lower the cost profile of its clients will allow it to gain more traction as the oil price improves. Let's see why.Smart technologies will help the business gain more tractionHalliburton is deploying new technologies that will allow its clients to reduce costs. For instance, its CALIBR Engineered Flowback service has helped one of the operators in the Permian region to minimize the completion damage during well flowback substantially, which has led to an improvement in overall recovery.More specifically, the use of this technology assisted the well operator to prevent damage and achieve a 15% improvement in cumulative production when compared to a nearby well that was deployed without the technology. In my opinion, such technology deployments from Halliburton will favor the company's growth since oil and gas companies are looking to enhance their production and keep costs low at the same time.For instance, the productivity of oil wells in the U.S. has improved impressively of late, with cost per well declining in the range of 25%-30% in the past four years. This is the reason why the demand for Halliburton's production enhancing techniques will grow as it will be able to improve production and lower costs at the same time.Additionally, Halliburton's surgi-squeeze techniques are allowing its clients to stimulate wells quickly, and that too in a cost effective manner. In fact, this solution has enabled Halliburton's clients to reduce the pumping time by over 40%, which has led to a reduction in lifting costs.Driven by these new technologies, Halliburton saw its completion and production revenue increase by 3%, or $62 million, to $2.2 billion on a sequential basis. Also, the operating income of this segment improved by $56 million on a sequential basis due to increased pumping activity in the North America.ConclusionHence, apart from cost savings, there is more to Halliburton that investors should not ignore. The company is making smart moves to tap markets where a recovery is being witnessed, while focusing on cost savings at the same time. So, in my opinion, it will be a good idea to stay long Halliburton since the company is moving in the right direction and should be able to sustain its momentum going forward."
4012556,24018,2016-10-17T11:56:39-04:00,"In 2016, Halliburton stock has rebounded strongly. The stock is up 38% YTD heading into this week's 3Q earnings report.For cyclical stocks like Halliburton, backward-looking analysis doesn't work well; the business is now attempting to regain its footing after the worst energy downturn in 30 years.The raw numbers don't tell the story. There's an underlying narrative that trumps the figures.Here's what to watch for on the earnings release and conference call.","I haven't written about Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) in a while. Over the past 18 months, collapsing energy prices cratered the shares, along with many Energy Service industry peers. In February 2016, the stock closed ~$29. However, YTD the shares rebounded strongly, recently settling about $47 a piece.In this article, I offer readers a long investment thesis. However, I will outline why raw numbers cannot close the sale. Low-ebb cyclical stocks create a particular challenge: determining investment viability without the benefit of ""the numbers"" to support it.In many such cases, retail investors simply elect to stay away.For Halliburton, I'll offer why I decided keep the ticker as a core position. Indeed, I actually added to it earlier in the year.An Investment Thesis For Owning Halliburton StockAt current prices, Halliburton represents a reasonable, though no longer spectacular, long-term investment opportunity. The failed Baker Hughes (BHI) merger pressured the balance sheet. 2016 earnings and cash flow have been negative; however, I premise 2Q 2016 was most likely the cycle bottom.Management retained a focused set of strategies. Throughout the downturn, the Company maintained a well-defined strategy: Focus upon the deepwater, mature fields, and unconventional plays. Management made good on its stand to defend North American business interests. These decisions will enable the Company to rebound faster than peers.In addition, senior leaders reacted to circumstances by swiftly and aggressively slashing expenses and capital expenditures. While tough choices, it allowed the business to retain necessary cash and capital.The Balance SheetA 1-2 punch consisting of energy prices collapsing and the failed Baker Hughes merger took the starch out of a previously outstanding balance sheet. The balance sheet is my single biggest go-forward concern. I plan to monitor it very closely.Liquidity, as measured by the 2.8x current ratio, remains good. Mid-year cash and equivalents totaled $3.1 billion, or $3.61 per share. This is far below the $10.1 billion pre-BHI acquisition war chest, partly depleted by a $3.5 billion breakup fee. However, current balance sheet cash is actually higher than previous year-end 2011-2014 cash on hand totals.In conjunction with the ill-fated Baker Hughes deal, total debt blew out. Year-end 2013 and 2014 total debt was ~$7.8 billion. At the end of 2015, it ballooned to $14.7 billion. Through June 30 this year, the Company paid down some of it. 2Q 2016 total debt marked $12.9 billion.That still left Halliburton with an elevated 132% debt-to-equity ratio, versus just 48% at the end of 2014. Indeed, management noted continued debt paydown is a priority.1H 2016 as-reported operating earnings or cash flow did not cover associated interest expense. Sans asset impairment charges (non-cash), corporate restructuring, and the Baker Hughes termination fee, adjusted EBIT did cover interest on the debt.I expect management to discuss debt management front-and-center on the upcoming earnings conference call.Meanwhile, total shareholder equity fell to $11.37 a share.Investors should watch for a trend reversal.Earnings and Cash FlowThrough the first 6 months of the year, Company earnings and cash flow remained negative. Looking behind the numbers, core operating earnings were positive. This was a green shoot.Meanwhile, first-half 2016 total operating cash flow was negative $3.8 billion. Management slashed capital expenditures to $447 million, and forecast ~$850 million for the full year. This contrasts sharply versus an average $3 billion per annum capex spent between 2011 and 2015.Despite all the current red ink, management reined in expenses quickly and aggressively. In 2015 and 2016, Halliburton laid off about a third of its total workforce. Capital was cut to less than a third of the prior run rate. Those are remarkable figures.Not to be underestimated, Halliburton management earned another chit via its demonstrated ability to ""beat the Street."" Since 2013, the Company has not missed a quarterly Wall Street earnings estimate, exceeding expectations 9 times out of the last 14 quarters.Even if Street estimates are negative, management obtains the benefit of the doubt, and a measure of Street credibility.Everything Red! So Why Has The Stock Gone Up?Over the past 2 months, some S.A. contributors here and here have written very bearish article about Halliburton. Instead, the stock has rallied. Year-to-date, the stock is up 38%, plus dividends. HAL outpaced the S&P 500 over the last 2 months, rising over 7% excluding a dividend payment.Why?First, the Market is a forward-looking mechanism. Backward-looking investors tend to miss big moves in cyclical companies like Halliburton.That said, in the case of Halliburton stock, these words don't necessarily make the situation easier to diagnose.Currently, shares are priced at $47. Long-term trimmed average P/E and P/CF multiples are solid, 15x and 10x, respectively. Two 10-year F.A.S.T. graphs below illustrate this. Please note I used 2006-2015 results in order to highlight the stock through at least one full cycle. In addition, I elected to exclude 2016 part-year figures in an attempt to avoid skewing the historical results.I contend the second reason shares have levitated is sentiment. Investors believe an energy recovery is on the horizon, Energy stocks will recover, and Halliburton will be a significant beneficiary.Supporting a more optimistic view, CEO David Lesar offered 2Q conference call remarks that caught my eye. Below are several key excerpts. Boldface is mine:Buttressed by Mr. Lesar's remarks, the technical charts appear to reflect constructive, optimistic sentiment. source: ameritrade.comIn April, HAL stock transcended the 200-day simple moving average. This was an important set-up.In September, the RSI, MACD, and Money Flow Indicator all turned up (positive).Just this month, the shares broke above the ~$46 resistance level; the stock had tried and failed 3 times previously. This price level may now become a floor.Volume has remained solid throughout. Good volume tends to confirm trends.ConclusionsThroughout 2016, Halliburton stock defied calls for swoon despite a weakened balance sheet, negative earnings/cash flow, and no immediate turnaround in sight.Indeed, shares have risen 38% YTD.Why?Mr. Market is forward-looking. Investor sentiment has been positive, and on the upswing. Management remarks have contributed to the optimism. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize the fundamentals must ultimately support the momentum. The upcoming earnings release and conference call will be the next chance to fact-check the narrative.I believe important items to watch on this week's earnings release and conference call include:Year-to-date, Halliburton investors have enjoyed an excellent run. It's not a time to get greedy: Frankly, I suspect the easy money has been made already.Nonetheless, long-term investors may still find the shares attractive under these premises: 1) HAL will be one of the energy service industry leaders to enjoy a robust recovery, 2) emphasis on North American unconventionals and mature fields will carry the business farther and faster than peers, and 3) management has the drive and moxie to focus upon and repair the balance sheet.Please do your own careful due diligence before making any investment decision. This article is not a recommendation to buy or sell any stock. Good luck with all your 2016 investments."

Halliburton's rating downgrade is based, in part, on the expectation that it will see a significant increase in its debt leverage to 5x more debt/EBITDA in 2016.

The company said that this decrease resulted from activity and pricing reductions in all of their product services lines, most notably stimulation activity in the United States land market. The company posted a net loss of $3.2 billion. The larger portion of operating costs and expenses are the Baker Hughes merger breakup fee: $3.5 billion.2015's revenue declined by about 28% from its 2014 revenue. The company expects to post a net loss per share of $0.01 on revenues of $3.78 billion.

Based on the numbers, the company expects to post a net profit in the last quarter of 2016, which means that the company is ready to bounce back. Limiting oil production to the range of 32.5-33.0 million barrels per day by OPEC is positive news for the company. Moody's expects to see a significant increase in Halliburton's debt leverage to 5x more debt/EBITDA in 2016.As a result of fixed asset impairments, write-offs, impairments of intangible assets, inventory write-downs, country and facility closures, and other items, the total assets have decreased by about $10 billion, but the total liabilities somewhat remain the same. Because of this, shareholders' equity has decreased by about 40 percent. Since shareholders' equity has decreased, the stock is currently trading at a price-to-book ratio of about 4, which is higher than the oil and gas drilling sector's average price to book ratio of 2.2; so the stock is currently overvalued by $20 at least."
4012668,40351,2016-10-18T00:01:06-04:00,"Halliburton will report its third quarter results before the markets open on Wednesday, Oct 19.The company could continue to struggle with losses.But the third quarter results could mark the start of Halliburton's turnaround.","Halliburton (NYSE:HAL), one of the world's largest oilfield services companies, is gearing up to report its third quarter results before the markets open on Wednesday, Oct 19. Analysts are expecting a loss of $0.07 per share, as per consensus data from FactSet. But considering Halliburton's track record, the company will likely end up beating earnings estimates.The Houston, Texas based - company is known for consistently reporting better than expected, or at least in-line, profits. In fact, as per data from Seeking Alpha, Halliburton hasn't missed analysts' consensus earnings estimates since at least Q4-2013. During this period, the company reported 10 earnings beats and one in-line results.Halliburton, like other oilfield services companies such as Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB), Baker Hughes (BHI) and Weatherford International (WFT), has been struggling with declining revenues, earnings, and shrinking margins in the downturn. The company managed to remain profitable until the first quarter of this year. But in the second quarter, as drilling activity in the US and international markets continued to decline, Halliburton swung to a large loss of $0.14 per share. That loss was driven by a poor show in the North American market where the drop in drilling activity has been far more severe than the international market. In this region, Halliburton posted a large operating loss of $124 million, down from a profit of $130 million a year earlier. The reported or GAAP loss was significantly bigger at $3.73 per share since Halliburton also booked $3.5 billion of break-up fees paid to Baker Hughes for the failed merger.But I believe that the Q2 loss could turn out to be Halliburton's bottom. We could begin to see the first signs of a rebound in the third quarter results.In the previous quarter, Halliburton's CEO Dave Lesar said that North America rig count likely hit its lowest level in the second quarter and we could witness a ""modest uptick"" in drilling activity the second half of 2016. At that time, a some major shale drillers, such as Pioneer Natural Resources (NYSE:PXD) and Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN), were talking about increasing drilling activity in response to strength in oil prices which were up almost 70% from multi-year lows seen in February. As Lesar predicted, some oil producers operating in low-cost shale plays like Permian Basin and Eagle Ford deployed additional rigs in the third quarter. Consequently, the North American oil rig count has been largely increasing since Halliburton reported its second quarter results in July.According to most recent report from Baker Hughes for the week ending Oct 14, the total number of active oil rigs in the US has climbed by 4 units to 432 rigs, reaching its highest level since February. That has already made this one of the strangest recoveries in almost three decades. The oil rig count has not fallen for the last 16 consecutive weeks, which is the third longest streak of no decline in oil rig count since 1987. And if oil prices hold their ground near $50 a barrel, the drilling activity could continue to rise. Since Halliburton is the dominant player in North America (it is the leading provider of hydraulic fracturing services here) and gets more than half of its earnings from this market, it stands to become the biggest beneficiary of the uptake in US drilling activity.Note that although drilling activity has improved, it still has a long way to go before it reaches last year's levels, and is a far cry from the peak seen in 2014. Halliburton could still continue to struggle with losses, particularly in North America, in the latest results. Its revenues and earnings will likely come in significantly lower as compared to last year.The most recent oil rig count is still considerably below year ago level of 595 units and record high of 1,609 units seen in Oct 2014. In addition to this, Halliburton, like all of its peers, has also given deep discounts to oil producers. The company has to slowly increase its pricing in order to improve its negative margins.However, due to the above-mentioned increase in drilling activity in the third quarter as compared to the second quarter which would also be accompanied by at least some increase in prices for fracking services, Halliburton is well positioned to post meaningful improvement on a sequential basis in the third quarter. This means that although the company's earnings might remain in the red, its losses will likely shrink when compared against the second quarter.A sequential improvement in earnings could mark the start of Halliburton's turnaround.Note from author: Thank you for reading.

4013540,47521,2016-10-20T13:26:56-04:00,Halliburton’s latest results confirm value of response to low oil prices.The oil sector will eventually roar back as loose spending days are over.Halliburton’s North American revenue growth reveals shale production ramping up.Shrinking costs has made the oil industry far more attractive once demand supports oil.,"Source: money.cnnOne of the main benefits of the prolonged period of low oil prices has been and is the response of many in the industry to remove as much costs out of operations as they can. It has been obviously true of upstream companies, but as Halliburton's (NYSE:HAL) has shown with its latest earnings results, it also applies to them.Halliburton surprised with $0.01 earnings per diluted share. Analysts had been expecting a loss of $0.07 per share.This is a good sign as to the growing health of the oil sector. Since it'll take time for demand to catch up with supply, it suggests cost cutting has become the primary focus of the industry, and once oil climbs sustainably higher, the industry will experience some extraordinary profits, even if the price of oil doesn't come close to prior 3-digit levels. What lower oil and gas prices will take away, lower costs is going to give back at some level. This will include upstream, midstream and downstream companies.Where the challenge will be will be in regard to companies with weak management that haven't been able to make the needed cuts to drive profitability under most price levels, and those that have a lot of debt maturing in 2017, where the price of oil will unlikely be high enough to offset the payments, or allow for other options.Source: StockCharts.comHalliburton's latest earningsHalliburton ability to generate a profit is important to the industry, as it points to the strong probability the sector will surprise to the upside this earnings season. More importantly, it means the cost-cutting measures and overall advancement in technology and methodology is starting to pay off, even under an oil price that will remain subdued until organic demand growth gives it long-term support.As mentioned, Halliburton announced $0.01 earnings per diluted share, beating the loss of $0.07 per share analysts were looking for. Revenue failed to meet expectations, primarily on weaker international sales. It came in at 3.8 million, down from $3.9 billion the market anticipated. Operating income in the quarter was $128 million, and cash flow reaching about $1 billion.According to CEO David J. Lesar, the beat was primarily from the increase in business from the North American market, along with the cost-cutting measures implemented across all its global markets.Revenue from North America was up 9 percent in the latest reporting period, ending the quarter at $1.7 billion. International revenue on the other hand went in the opposite direction, dropping 6 percent to $2.2 billion.The increase in rig counts in North America by 14 percent in the quarter, along with numerous completed wells, helped push up Halliburton's numbers.Implications of North American revenueWhat's most valuable to me concerning Halliburton's results, beyond the company itself, is how it underscores the fact shale production is starting to climb significantly, and that not only has specific implications for Halliburton, but for the oil market as a whole.Not only did revenue jump 9 percent in North America, which represents the business being done with shale producers, but it was while oil was still under $50 per barrel. That implies that segment of the market is going to continue to grow, which would mean Halliburton should increase its earnings going forward, and the amount of oil coming from shale producers will continue to grow.It's my thesis that U.S. shale production isn't being priced in as it should be, and it will become more important in the scheme of things in the short term than is being projected at this time. We'll get more visibility as the earnings season moves on, but I'm waiting for next earnings season when the shale production results from this quarter come in, which should easily surpass the prior quarter.Halliburton is a bellwether for shale because it's the major player in that segment. It does reflect the direction shale production is going, and by its increase in revenue, it's obvious it's increasing output significantly, and will continue to do so for a long time to come.What remains to be seen with U.S. shale is how much the improvements will have on supply levels as more wells are completed and operating simultaneously. Shale producers don't need the same rigs or wells numbers in the past to boost supply. It's there where the uncertainty lies, and where I believe the market will be caught off guard. We should see some of that in the earnings reports about to be released, but as mentioned, more clarity will come in the next earnings season when the growing number of completed wells have a longer period of time to be monitored concerning how much more supply will come from them than in the past.The low cost factorAs for the low price of oil forcing the industry to remove a lot of the costs out of operations, it confirms to be it could have been done long ago. For that reason alone the emergence of the U.S. shale industry as a major player in the market has made it a much stronger sector for many years.That's not only true in the shale industry, but in offshore and other more costly ways of producing oil. That means if discipline remains in place, we could see some of the strongest performances in history by the most efficient companies than we've ever seen. This can be done while strategically allocating capital to the most profitable locations. Companies have already positioned themselves for this by divesting of weaker assets in order to generate revenue.So not only has the low price of oil forced many companies to cut costs, it has also forced them to get rid of less desirable assets that would have held them back if they kept them in their portfolios. Again, all of this is going to reward shareholders in the years ahead once demand finally catches up with supply. This will be true across all segments of the market.This is good news for downstream companies like Halliburton which are going to enjoy strong growth for a long time into the future, as upstream shale producers continue to add rigs and complete wells.ConclusionIn my view there is no doubt the low price of oil from the emergence of the U.S. shale industry has saves the industry, in the sense it will be able to generate significant revenue and earnings with oil and gas at lower price levels. And when energy prices climb, they may enjoy profits that are unprecedented. Those that took the time and energy to become more efficient and productive during the low-price environment over the last couple of years, will be the big winners, as will be those investors having a position in them. Halliburton will be one of those companies that will reward investors for a long time.The timing of all of this is in question because of the fact the global economy is slowing down and a recession is coming in the not too distant future. That will cut into the demand for oil, and in turn will put downward pressure on the price of oil as supply floods the market. There is no question this will happen, it's only a matter of how difficult and long the recession will be and to what level that will cut into demand.That said, over the long term I'm very bullish on oil, and I see it generating some hefty returns for those investing in healthy companies. The first place I look is how strongly a company can compete at various price levels. If there is a requirement for high oil prices to generate a profit, or at least significant profits, that company is going to suffer for a long time, as will shareholders.Smaller companies under that scenario won't survive, and the larger companies will have to endure prolonged seasons of weak results, or probably cut further into dividends as they wait for demand to rise to the point of pushing up the price of oil to a place even they can make a profit.Many think that season is already upon us, and a rising oil tide will raise all ships. I'm not among them. Most of the proposed oil cut from OPEC, if it happens in a meaningful way that can be monitored, has already been priced in. And as Halliburton's revenue results have confirmed, they're boosting production at a fast pace, and that is going to accelerate in this quarter. Over the next several months that will frustrate the actions by OPEC, although we won't know to what level until the next earnings season.Bottom line is the U.S. shale industry and its added supply has forced the sector to become far more efficient, increase technological expertise, improve its methodology, and divest of low-performing assets. This is setting it up for a big future run once the global economy reverses direction after the upcoming recession.There will be opportunities for short-term gains, but taking a position in oil should still be considered a long-term play."
4013507,40351,2016-10-20T12:49:00-04:00,Halliburton has recently surprised the market by reporting a quarterly profit for the third quarter.The company benefited from cost cutting efforts and improvement in drilling activity seen in the last few months.This could be the first sign of a turnaround.,"Halliburton (NYSE:HAL), the world's second largest oilfield services company, has recently reported its quarterly results in which it surprised the markets by reporting a profit, thanks to the company's cost reduction efforts and uptake in drilling activity.Halliburton comes with a solid track record of beating earrings estimates. Excluding the latest results, the company has reported 10 earnings beats and one in-line results in the last 11 quarters. But despite its history, most analysts and financial writers, including myself, thought that while Halliburton could beat estimates, its earrings will likely remain in the red. The company was expected to continue to battle with pricing pressure and low drilling activity as compared to last year. Remember, despite the uptake in activity, there are still 163 fewer oil rigs operating in the North America as compared to last year. In this backdrop, a profit, even as small as Halliburton's, was a pleasant surprise.The company's bottom-line was aided by the cost cutting efforts, including the structural cost reductions in which the company is on track to achieve $1 billion of annual savings. Moreover, the sequential improvement in revenues and profits in North America business, which is Halliburton's key market that has been historically responsible for half of the company's revenues and earnings, was driven by the improvement in business environment.Oil prices have gained substantially to $50 a barrel range after dropping to multi-year lows of $26.05 in February. In fact, over the last five months, the WTI spot price has averaged north of $44 a barrel. This improvement and stability in oil price environment has given confidence to oil producers who have increased drilling activity. The weekly US oil rig count, released by Baker Hughes, has not fallen for the last 16 weeks. And it is clear that Halliburton has turned out to be a big beneficiary of this positive trend, which was evident in the performance in North America.As mentioned earlier, Halliburton posted a small increase in revenues in North America, but that's a big deal considering that the company has significant leverage to this market and the company's revenues from the region have fallen in the prior six quarters. But the growth could have been better, considering that the growth (up 9.4%) was outpaced by the 14% increase in US rig count in the same period. This could raise concerns that the company might be losing market share, but it could also be due to a deliberate change in business strategy.During the conference call, Halliburton's CEO Dave Lesar said that the company is now switching its primary focus to improving margins from gaining market share. In the US, the company now believes that it has the highest market share it has ever had. At this point, Halliburton is willing to give up some of its share in order to improve its profit margins. That's probably why the revenues did not climb as fast as the increase in rig count, and this trend could continue in the future. But this approach will likely give a boost to Halliburton's margins and could accelerate the turnaround of North American business in terms of profitability.ConclusionHalliburton still has a long way to go before it reaches its pre-downturn levels of revenues and earnings. The oil rig count in its core market is still just about a quarter of what it was at its peak two years ago. The international rig count has still not stabilized. The company continues to lose money in North America. But it is showing what could be the first signs of a turnaround.In the latest quarter, earnings were up from a year earlier and sequentially. Its revenues and earnings in North America improved sequentially on the back of increase in drilling activity and the company's focus on improving returns. That's crucial since Halliburton has significant leverage to this market. If oil prices hold their ground, then Halliburton could also begin to witness a rise in activity in international markets, which should lead to higher earnings from outside of North America and return to profitability at home.Note from author: Thank you for reading.

Analysts expect revenue of $3.89 billion and EPS of -$0.07. Estimates imply flat growth sequentially and a 34% decline Y/Y. Investors should focus on the following items heading into the quarter.Have Animal Spirits Returned To North America?Q2 2016 was another dismal quarter for Halliburton. Total revenue fell by 9% while revenue from North America, the company's largest region, was off 15%.Talks of an oil freeze by major oil producers have sent oil prices near $50. Whether production cuts will actually occur remains to be seen. Nonetheless, shale oil plays have started stilling again and that is good of Halliburton. During the Q2 earnings call, management suggested animal spirits had returned to the region:Management will likely continue to talk up a rebound in North America. However, Latin America (13% of total revenue) could be dismal again. The company signed a financing agreement with Venezuela's state-owned oil company PDVSA. This came after cutting exposure to the region. If the crisis stricken country continues to pay late, then Halliburton could follow Schlumberger's (NYSE:SLB) lead and cut projects and lay off workers dedicated to Venezuela.The Balance SheetIt might sound blasphemous to question the strength of Halliburton's balance sheet. Nearly two years of declines in oil industry capex as taken a toll on the company. Its failed merger with Baker Hughes (BHI) resulted in Halliburton having to cough up a $3.5 billion break-up, which was particularly painful. Cash fell from $9.6 billion in Q1 2016 to $3.1 billion last quarter due to the break-up fee and debt pare downs.Debt of $12.9 billion is at $4.6x trailing 12-month EBITDA, but EBITDA is in decline. The company is buoyed by the fact that it is the number two player in a large industry. However, if debt-to-EBITDA reaches 5x then rating agencies could downgrade Halliburton's debt to junk status or close to it. The company might have to tap the capital markets some time next year to shore up its balance sheet. That might not sit well with bulls who have supported HAL in spite of the sizeable break-up fee it incurred.ConclusionInvestors could turn bullish on HAL due to a rebound in North America. The rebound could be head fake, though. Investors should continue to avoid HAL."
4009885,40351,2016-10-03T19:36:06-04:00,Halliburton stock has risen following OPEC's latest decision.An actual production cut from OPEC members can accelerate the company's recovery.But what happens if OPEC fails to deliver on expectations?,"Halliburton (NYSE:HAL), one of the world's leading oilfield services companies, was a major beneficiary of OPEC's latest decision. The shares of the Houston, Texas-based company were at $44.88 when the markets closed on Friday, depicting a weekly gain of 7.3%.Last week, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries caught the market by surprise by announcing that they have agreed, in principle, to cap output to the range of 32.5-33.3 million barrels per day, a drop from the most recent level of 33.24 million bpd. Iranian oil minister Bijan Zanganeh even said that the group's production could drop by 700,000 bpd. The organization will further discuss future production and quotas for each member country during a formal meeting in November.An actual production cut could go a long way in rebalancing the oil market. So far this year, oil prices have gained more than 20%, driven in part by decline in production from non-OPEC members, particularly the US, where crude production has fallen by more than 600,000 bpd since last year. On the other hand, a number of key OPEC members, such as Saudi Arabia, Iran and Iraq, have continued to grow output. But now it appears that OPEC members also are ready to play their role in rebalancing the market.Halliburton, like other oilfield services companies such as Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB), Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI) and Weatherford International (NYSE:WFT), has been struggling in the downturn. In a recent presentation, the company highlighted the industry's woes. Following the slump in oil prices, producers have made wholesale cuts to their capital spending budgets and curtailed drilling activity. In the US, which is home to a large part of the world's shale oil output, the rig count has fallen by 79% since 2014. In the international markets, where conventional oil plays a bigger role, rig count has fallen by 33%.That has hit Halliburton hard, particularly since it has significant exposure to the US market, where the decline in rig count has been more severe compared to international markets. The company has seen its revenues and earnings decline significantly over the last two years. In fact, Halliburton has been losing money for the last four quarters. Its unsuccessful attempt to acquire Baker Hughes (BHI) also didn't help. The merger related costs and the $3.5 billion breakup fee paid to Baker Hughes also dragged Halliburton's performance.HAL's quarterly performanceBut a drop in supply from OPEC will have a positive impact on the crude oil market's fundamentals, which may bring much-needed stability in this space. Exploration and production companies have been reluctant to increase their capital budget, due in large part to oil price volatility. A stable oil price environment, however, will give more confidence to operators, who might ramp up capital spending and drilling activity. That could accelerate Halliburton's turnaround.But what happens if OPEC fails to deliver on expectations? Remember, it has a history of regularly exceeding the production limit. This raises doubts over the cartel's ability to implement any new production freeze agreement.Besides, Iran, OPEC's third-largest producer, is still committed to growing its production by roughly 400,000 bpd in the near future to almost 4 million bpd. Iraq, OPEC's second leading oil producer, pumped more oil than before in September, according to Reuters, as production increased from the Kirkuk oilfield. And Iraq's oil minister Jabar Ali al-Luaibi reportedly did not like the latest OPEC move to reinstate a production ceiling. It seems unlikely that the country will agree to curb, let alone freeze, output.Meanwhile, production from Libya, which experienced disruption in oil supplies due to a dispute over exports, partially recovered last month after the country reopened some of its primary oil terminals. The business environment could also normalize in Nigeria in the near future, where armed militants have attacked oilfields. This could lead to an uptake in supplies from these two nations.OPEC's failure will likely hurt market sentiment. But remember, the global oil market fundamentals were already improving, even without any support from the cartel. A few weeks ago, Schlumberger pointed out that the combined production from a number of non-OPEC producers, including the US, has fallen by more than a million barrels a day. The International Energy Agency has confirmed this by saying that in August global crude supplies dropped by 0.3 million bpd on a year-over-year basis as production fell in non-OPEC countries.The decline in production has improved the crude market's fundamentals and justified the more than 20% rise in oil prices we've witnessed this year. Oil producers, particularly in the US, are already growing more confident about the commodity's recovery (again, even without any support from OPEC) and have begun to increase drilling activity. This is evident from the fact that the US oil rig count has been largely climbing since summer. In fact, the latest rig count data from Baker Hughes showed an increase in the number of active oil rigs by seven units to 425 rigs. So far, the oil rig count has climbed in 13 out of the last 14 weeks.The increase in rig count in North America puts Halliburton in a great position. It is the largest provider for hydraulic fracturing services in North America and gets more than half of its revenues and operating earnings from this market. The company's North America earnings have fallen significantly.In the first six months of this year, Halliburton's North America revenues declined 46.7% from a year earlier to $3.31 billion, and the unit swung to an operating loss of $163 million from a profit of $409 million. But the business will begin to rebound as operators deploy new rigs and drilling activity picks up.In short, if OPEC actually ends up curtailing output, that might accelerate Halliburton's rebound. But even if the organization doesn't, Halliburton will still continue to benefit from the uptake in drilling activity in North America.Note from author: Thank you for reading.

4010393,38631,2016-10-05T15:39:11-04:00,There are no bottoming signs in the business of HAL.Its balance sheet keeps getting weaker while it waits for an improvement in the oil market.The company is also experiencing negative operating cash flows.,"Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) has markedly outperformed S&P (NYSEARCA:SPY) this year, with a 31% advance vs. only 5% of S&P. It has also enjoyed double returns compared to the Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSEARCA:XLE), which has rallied 16% so far this year. Therefore, its recent performance may render it attractive to the eyes of some investors, particularly those that follow stocks with strong momentum. However, in this article, I will analyze why Halliburton is not attractive right now.First of all, while the oil sector has been in a bear market for more than two years, there are no bottoming signs in the business of onshore service providers. To be sure, the revenue of Halliburton decreased 9% in Q2 compared to Q1. While a 9% decrease may seem minor, it is actually pronounced, as it reflects the comparison between two consecutive quarters, i.e., the business deterioration in just 3 months. Moreover, the operating income plunged 72% in Q2 to just $62M while the adjusted loss was a heavy $3.2B. These figures do not indicate that the business conditions are anywhere close to a bottom.The main reason is that most oil producers, particularly the shale oil players, have very weak balance sheets and hence they keep reducing their capital expenses. This results in reduced activity and thus less business for Halliburton. At the moment, the company generates almost half of its revenue from North America and hence it is largely affected by the activity of shale oil producers. Moreover, in order for Halliburton to see a meaningful increase in onshore drilling activity, oil should recover decisively above $60 so that it renders most shale oil fields profitable. So far, oil has proven unable to approach that level, as it faces huge selling pressure whenever it approaches $50.It is also worth noting that the offshore drillers may soon realize great improvement in their business conditions as Seadrill (SDRL) may not manage to get the approval of banks for restructuring its excessive amount of debt, which is due in 11 months. If Seadrill goes out of business, the supply-demand relationship of the offshore drilling market will greatly improve. On the other hand, in the onshore market of Halliburton, there is no large competitor on the verge of bankruptcy. Therefore, Halliburton cannot count on this sort of tailwind any time soon.From the above, it is evident that Halliburton will have to wait for a long time, no-one knows how long, until the external factors of its business, which are out of its control, improve. Unfortunately for the company, it has a remarkably weak balance sheet, which keeps weakening and thus renders the downturn of the oil sector tougher for the company. More specifically, due to the heavy losses of the last two quarters and the $3.5B break-up fee for the cancellation of the deal with Baker Hughes (BHI), the cash of the company has plunged 70%, from $10.1B to $3.1B in the last 6 months! In addition, the book value has almost halved, from $16.3B in 2014 to $9.7B now while the net debt (as per Buffett, net debt = total liabilities - cash - receivables) has climbed from $6.1B in 2014 to $10.2B.Even worse, the interest expense has essentially doubled in the last 12 months, from $106M to $206M per quarter. Therefore, as the operating income has plunged, the interest expense has been higher than the operating income in each of the last 4 quarters. Therefore, the high leverage of the company has reached a point that it strongly affects its bottom line. Unless oil rebounds far above $60, the interest expense will continue to ""eat"" a significant portion of the operating income of the company. It is also remarkable that the company has been experiencing negative operating cash flow in the last two quarters. And when the operating cash flow is negative, the free cash flow is even more negative.To sum up, as long as oil remains below $60, Halliburton continues to lose money and its balance sheet keeps getting weaker. As no-one knows how long the downturn of the oil market will last, I do not recommend purchasing shares of Halliburton right now. I always recommend purchasing securities that gain value over time, not those whose value is eroded over time."
4013623,22148,2016-10-20T16:24:56-04:00,"Halliburton turned in an impressive Q3 due to cost controls. .
        The business environment isn't expected to improve over the next few months due to the holidays in North America. .
        The stock trades at a very rich multiple for a turnaround that hasn't even started yet. .","By most measures, Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) turned in a better than expected quarter considering the tough operating environment in the oilfield services market. Revenues were still challenged, but the company turned a small surprise profit.What the market probably hasn't noticed is that the stock is at multi-year highs. In fact, Halliburton hasn't traded much above $50 outside of the spike in 2014 as oil surged above $100/bbl.Stock gains from this level would suggest an unprecedented rebound in commodity prices that doesn't appear in the offering. Maybe more puzzling to the equation is that the oilfield services giant underwent a failed buyout of Baker Hughes (BHI) since that peak price.The most damaging part of the equation is that Halliburton had to pay Baker Hughes a $3.5 billion break up fee. In the end, the impact was to weaken the balance sheet of Halliburton and enrich a prime competitor.Combine those facts with the scenario where Halliburton hasn't even seen a rebound in the business and one has to question the stock trading at one of the highest levels in history. The enterprise value is one of the best ways to view the impact of the $3.5 billion hit. Along with a multiple of revenues, one can quickly see how the stock is worth far more now than the peak multiple at the top of the last cycle.HAL EV to Revenues (TTM) data by YChartsMaybe even worse, the company isn't expecting a rapid improvement in business over the next couple of quarters. The roughly breakeven results are still facing a declining international market and the holidays in North America.The CEO was clear that despite an improving demand equation as oil tops $50/bbl customers aren't going to rush in to rent rigs towards year end of the year with the holidays. Per CEO Dave Lesar on the earnings call:The key investor takeaway is that investors are already paying peak prices for this stock while the business environment only expects to scrap off the bottom in the next few months."
4013801,101542,2016-10-21T09:55:44-04:00,"Schlumberger, Halliburton and Baker Hughes are compared by geographic spread and segment mix.Current trends in oilfield services allow identification of the geographic area and the functional segment to be overweight to benefit from future recovery.Winning market share should not become a Pyrrhic victory.","Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) has surprised the market with strong Q3 performance and offered a multifaceted discussion of the state of oilfield services. The main themes are the difference in speed of recovery depending on geography and the variation in anticipated rates of investment in different oil production styles.Being overweight North American business expected to be beneficialWhile exploration and production (E&P) in North America is already experiencing a recovery, a decline is still ongoing internationally. In the US, pressure pumping fleet utilization at 70% in Q3 was a major step-up from Q2, even as the equipment market remains oversupplied. Contributing to both Q3 results and to continuing optimism, small pricing increases were seen ""not in the Permian but maybe some of the basins where equipment has migrated out of"".In contrast, the international market continues to experience both pricing pressure and declining activity outside of the Middle East. This is why the Q3 earnings release showed an improvement domestically and a continued deterioration internationally. The historical tendency has been for the international market to lag six to nine months behind the domestic market. Looking ahead, still lower margins are expected internationally in the next two to three quarters, with the international rig count anticipated to bottom in H1 2017.A focus on domestic onshore unconventional E&P likely to pay offHalliburton's business covers all production styles: conventional and unconventional, onshore and offshore, shallow water and deepwater. Based on the discussion during the conference call, much attention is now devoted to the domestic onshore unconventional market. It is the first to see recovery, judging by the increased rig count. In contrast, ""deepwater remains structurally challenged with higher costs and long duration project characteristics"", leading to worse economics via the time value of money. The firm claims to ""now have the highest market share we've ever had"" in the US. (Source: Halliburton's presentation at Barclays CEO Energy-Power Conference September 2016)""Drilling and Evaluation"" versus ""Completion and Production"": remember the DUCsBesides the difference in the geographic spread of business, oilfield services firms also differ in proportions of revenue they derive from the two stages of building a well: the first including reservoir characterization [to use Schlumberger Limited (NYSE:SLB) terminology] and drilling, and the second including completion (including hydraulic fracturing) and production.Pertaining to the second stage, there is a massive overhang of drilled but uncompleted (DUC) wells in every major basin in North America.(Source: EIA)It is cheaper to frack and complete a DUC as the expense of drilling a well, roughly a quarter of a completed well's price, is a sunk cost that has already been incurred. Depending on the pace of recovery and especially if oil remains range-bound, the DUC inventory will be worked through first. It is the completion and production segment that works with E&P companies as they go through their DUC inventory.In the Q3 earnings announcement, revenue-wise, completion and production performed better than drilling and evaluation, the revenue of the former increasing 3% and the latter declining 4%. The interpretation is that drilling is down, but more wells are being completed as oil and gas producers are working through their DUC backlogs. This is illustrated by the following exhibit, showing the 2015 to early 2016 build-up of DUCs compared to the number of wells being completed turning recently into a decline.(Source: EIA)Halliburton, Baker Hughes or Schlumberger?The takeaways from the above are that to benefit first from recovering oil prices, an oilfield services company would be most heavily weighed towards North America. As to the functional segment, it would be best to over-weigh completion and production.Geographically, Halliburton's revenue is heavier-weighted towards North America (43%) than that of either Schlumberger or Baker Hughes Inc. (BHI) which derive domestically 25% and 28%, respectively, of their worldwide revenue. Halliburton's North American overweight was the stated reason for the bullish call made by Evercore ISI on August 31. However, there are more reasons to be bullish.Halliburton is heavier-weighted towards completion and production than Schlumberger, deriving 57% of revenue from this segment compared to 34%. This will incrementally benefit Halliburton in the initial stages of recovery, as companies work through DUC inventory in relative preference to drilling new wells. It also offers Halliburton relative safety compared to Schlumberger in the event of another slump in oil prices.At 56% of revenue, Baker Hughes is also more heavily weighted towards completion and production than Schlumberger. However, Baker Hughes does not project the image of company positioned optimally. According to its Q2 2016 Form 10-Q:A concern about badly squeezed marginsOne point of note is that buying Halliburton today probably means expressing a view on the reversion of profitability towards its historical norm. In this article, I highlighted North America versus other areas, and completion and production versus drilling and evaluation. It is exactly North America and the completion and production segment where margins and consequently, operating profits have suffered horribly so far this year.North America, while seen as being the first to recover, is nonetheless the only geographical segment that reported operating losses in the past three quarters, compared to a drastic reduction of profit in Latin America and a reduction in half (which looks very good in comparison) of operating profits in Europe/Africa/CIS and Middle East / Asia. The following exhibit shows operating income in recent quarters in North America and the rest of the world.(Source: data from Halliburton's Q3 2016 update of Quarterly Geographic Results)Between the functional segments, while profit from drilling and evaluation has shrunk in half compared to Q3 2015, the average profit of completion and production in the first three quarters this year has only been 5% and in Q3, one seventh, of profit earned in Q3 2015. The dismal performance of completion and production as compared to drilling and evaluation is illustrated by the following chart.(Source: data from Halliburton's Q3 2016 update of Quarterly Segment Results)Being bullish on the company and not just its share price does mean believing in the future reversal of badly squeezed margins in North America geographically and Completion and Production, functionally.ConclusionThe greater relative weight of North America in the geographic mix of business, and the larger proportion of revenue derived from the completion and production segment give Halliburton a better chance to be the first to benefit from recovering oil and gas markets, ahead of Schlumberger and Baker Hughes.Note from author: Thank you for reading.

4004224,40351,2016-09-06T02:10:06-04:00,"Halliburton stock has fallen recently.
        The short term future of crude oil remains uncertain, and that’s bad for Halliburton.
        The company is expected to continue reporting quarterly losses this year.
        But this doesn’t mean you should sell Halliburton stock.
        Rather, investors should look to buy on weakness as the company is positioned to turnaround in 2017.","Halliburton (NYSE:HAL), one of the world's leading oilfield services company, had a tough week. When the markets closed on Friday, the shares of the Houston, Texas - based company were down almost 3% as crude oil retreated and analysts at Guggenheim put a ""sell"" rating on the stock.The price of US benchmark WTI crude dropped from almost $47 a barrel on Monday to $44.30 on Friday while Brent, the global benchmark, fell from $49.24 to $46.67 in the same period, thanks to persistent worries related to excess supply. The losses came as the latest report the US Energy Information Administration for the week ended August 26 pointed to 2.3 million barrels per day increase in US stockpiles. That increase was almost 4-times as large as analysts' expectations, as per data polled by S&P Global Platts.Moreover, there is a real risk of crude dropping to low $40s in the coming weeks. The summer driving season will come to its end in less than four weeks while refiners are gearing up for the turnaround and maintenance season which runs in September and October. Both of these factors will weigh on crude demand and threaten to push stockpiles even higher. Meanwhile, the markets are weighing the possibility of an interest rate hike in the near future following latest remarks from Fed Chair Janet Yellen in which she said that the case for increase in fund rates has ""strengthened in recent months"". The speculation around interest rate hike can lift the value of US Dollars against other major currencies, which may drag crude oil prices.On the other hand, major OPEC and non-OPEC members are meeting in Algeria later this month. If the meeting results in a shift in OPEC strategy or if the major oil producing countries, such as Saudi Arabia and Russia, come to some sort of an agreement to support oil prices, then we could see oil climbing back to $50 a barrel.In short, crude can go either way in the short term. It's this lack of clarity around the future of oil prices that has prevented oil and gas producers, who are Halliburton's customers, from increasing capital budgets. As long as the exploration and production industry keeps a lid on spending, Halliburton will continue to struggle. As a reminder, Halliburton has now reported six consecutive drops in revenues, on a sequential basis, while its earnings have largely remained in the red since the start of last year. As per analysts' consensus estimate from Thomson Reuters, Halliburton could report a loss of $0.07 per share in the third quarter and a loss of $0.04 per share in the fourth quarter which will lead to a loss of $0.17 per share for the full year. Note that analysts' consensus estimate exclude the impact of one-off items.Image © HalliburtonBut this doesn't mean that you should sell Halliburton stock. That's because although we are seeing some negative indicators, slowly but surely, the global crude oil market is moving into balance. We have seen uptake in supplies from some major oil producing countries, most notably Iran, Saudi Arabia and Russia, but a number of key OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers are pumping less oil now than they did a year earlier.In a recent presentation, a key executive from Halliburton's biggest competitor Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) pointed out during a presentation that while Iran has significantly ramped up production following the end of Western sanctions and Saudi Arabia and Russia are pumping more oil now than they did last year, some major oil producers like Mexico, Canada, Venezuela and China have seen their volumes fall due to a lack of investment. Meanwhile, shale oil production in the US has dropped by more than 600,000 barrels per day on a year-over-year basis.Image: Schlumberger investor presentation.As a result, the supply side of the equation continues to tighten. Meanwhile, the demand for crude oil stays strong, largely driven by non-OECD countries. As per US EIA, global consumption of petroleum and other liquids is expected to climb by 1.4 million barrels per day in 2016, same as last year. With declining supply and strong demand, the oil market should move into balance over the long term, which will lift oil prices. As the commodity slowly moves to $60 a barrel, we'll likely witness an uptake in drilling activity. And we are already getting the first signs.In the US, drilling activity has been slowly increasing. The latest rig count report from Baker Hughes (BHI) showed that US oil drillers added one oil rig during the week ended September 2. That marked the ninth increase over last ten weeks. The gas rig count also rose by seven units, bringing the total tally of oil and gas rigs to 497. That's still significantly below from a year earlier when there were 864 rigs operating in the country, including 662 oil rigs, but at least the rig count is heading in the right direction.This also shows that despite the volatility in oil prices, some shale producers are getting more confident around the commodity's future. Some oil producers that benefit from having access to some of the lowest-cost oil producing regions, such as Pioneer Natural Resources (NYSE:PXD), have already started to ramp up drilling activity by deploying new rigs. Other producers will likely do the same as the oil market's supply-demand fundamentals improve. Consequently, the US rig count, the drilling activity, could continue climbing higher. That is going to fuel Halliburton's turnaround.Halliburton has significant leverage to the North American market where it is the leading provider of fracking services. In the first half of 2014, before the current downturn, Halliburton got more than half of its revenues and more than 60% of its operating income from North America. The company's North America revenues shrunk significantly in the downturn while the region's earnings slipped into the red in 2016. But as producers slowly increase drilling activity, Halliburton's performance should turn in the coming quarters.First, we'll likely witness I uptake in Halliburton's North America revenues on a sequential basis, followed by improvement in earnings as the company renegotiates contracts and gradually scales back the temporary discounts it has given to clients.ConclusionHalliburton will likely struggle this year with shrinking quarterly revenues and losses, but as oil's recovery takes hold and drilling activity in the US continues to improve, the company should turnaround, perhaps by as early as next year. Analysts' are already expecting a 20% increase in sales and a profit of $0.91 per share in 2017, as per consensus data from Thomson Reuters. I believe, therefore, that instead of selling this stock, investors should look to accumulate on weakness.Data source: Thomson ReutersNote from author: Thank you for reading.

3991009,31441,2016-07-25T01:57:01-04:00,"Halliburton reported Q2 earnings last week.Cash declined by $6.5 billion due to debt repayments and a $3.5 billion merger break-up fee.North America might have bottomed, but I don't foresee revenue growth in the region for several quarters.","In Q2, Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) reported revenue of $3.85 billion and EPS of -$3.73. The company beat analysts' revenue estimate of $3.76 billion, but overall, the results were disappointing. I had the following takeaways on the quarter.Cash Really Fell By $6.5 BillionHeading into the quarter, I suspected cash could fall from $9.6 billion in Q1 to less than $5 billion. When I saw the company's cash balance of $3.1 billion - a decline of $6.5 billion - I did a double-take. The $3.73 loss per share included a $3.5 billion break-up fee to Baker Hughes (BHI) and a $423 million impairment charge. Halliburton also repaid $2.6 billion in debt, which drove down the cash balance. Of note is that after monetizing its working capital, the company generated cash flow of $92 million in Q1 and suffered an outflow of $20 million in Q2. This implies that certain current assets - inventory, in particular - are stale or slow-moving.In my opinion, Halliburton needs to squirrel away as much cash as possible in order to survive the oil patch. The company has used its prodigious balance sheet to offer price concessions, and has contemplated financing clients' purchases of oilfield services and equipment. There is a thesis that clients' flight to quality has allowed Halliburton to take market share from lower-capitalized competitors. The company's rapid loss of capital could mean: (i) it has to be more selective in offering price concessions or financing packages, and (ii) its competitive advantage over smaller competitors could dissipate.Have Animal Spirits Returned To North America?Halliburton's total revenue fell 9% sequentially. The worst performers were North America (down 15%) and Latin America (down 12%).Management was assuaged that the decline in North America revenue was less than the rig count decline (down 23%). They also indicated that North America had bottomed and animal spirits had returned to the region:The days of double-digit revenue declines in North America could be over. However, I believe the region could muddle along. There is also a possibility that oil could re-test $40 and cause E&P to fall again. Since North America represents 40% of total revenue, I don't see Halliburton's razor-thin EBITDA margins improving until the region bounces back in a big way.That said, Latin America could be the next shoe to drop. The rig count in Mexico and Brazil has fallen to levels not seen in decades. Economic turmoil in Venezuela caused the country's oil production to fall to 13-year lows in June. Halliburton has offered to finance purchases of oilfield services and equipment for PDVSA, Venezuela's state oil company. This quarter, it reported a $148 million loss pursuant to a promissory note in exchange for unpaid invoices.ConclusionI expect Halliburton to experience flat-to-negative growth on its top line, while its liquidity could become further strained. Having to service nearly $13 billion in debt with no growth in cash flow could trigger a capital raise. Investors should continue to avoid HAL."
4001196,31441,2016-08-22T06:19:56-04:00,"Halliburton's Q2 revenue and EBITDA fell Y/Y by 9% and 59%, respectively.

        A bottoms up analysis suggest HAL is worth less than $15. Avoid the stock.","Halliburton CEO Dave LesarHalliburton (NYSE:HAL) has dominated the financial news over the past 18 months due to its public courting of Baker Hughes (BHI) and ultimate merger failure. Courting BHI, negotiating with regulators for merger approval and trying to manage the downturn in the oil patch has taken its toll. Its $3.5 billion merger break-up fee was particularly painful.The break-up fee and a $2.6 billion debt repayment caused cash to fall to $3.1 billion in Q2 from $9.6 billion in the previous quarter. Revenue and EBITDA fell Y/Y by 39% and 59%, respectively. However, HAL is up over nearly 20% over the past year, versus a 6% appreciation for the S&P 500 (NYSEARCA:SPY). Oil prices have vacillated from $40 to $50 over the past few months, creating positive sentiment for the stock.HAL Is Worth Less Than $15I assumed the failed merger and break-up fee would have crushed HAL. It did not. However, falling earnings and rising net debt has hurt its intrinsic value, which is now less than $15 per share.Last 12 Months RevenueLast 12 months revenue through June 2016 was $18.7 billion. This is optimistic given the fall off in revenue for the first half of 2016.EBITDACumulative EBITDA over the past four quarters of $2.8 billion equates to a 15% margin. Of note is that the margin fell to 12% in Q2. In spite of all the layoffs and cost cutting by Halliburton the decline in scale might have caused margins to break support.Enterprise ValueThe company's enterprise value (equity and debt) is $19.7 billion at 7x EBITDA.Equity ValueAfter subtracting net debt (debt less cash and equivalents) of $9.8 billion, I derived an equity value of $9.9 billion. Net debt was only $5.6 billion as recently as Q3 2015. Its increase has hurt HAL's intrinsic value.Per Share PriceI assumed 861 million shares outstanding which was sourced from Yahoo.ConclusionStandalone HAL is worth less than $15 per share. It currently trades at close to $47. In the near term the stock will likely continue to trade based on sentiment and the direction of oil prices. Too bad volatile oil prices have not led to rising E&P. Avoid HAL."

Within the Energy sector, positive performance stemmed mainly from the Oil & Gas Exploration and Production (E&P) sub-industry; within this sector, the Oil & Gas Refining and Marketing sub-industry detracted from performance, but only minimally. Only three other sub-industries detracted from performance during the second quarter, and, likewise minimally: Precious Metals & Minerals, Electrical Components & Equipment, and Fertilizers & Agricultural Chemicals.2Q Performance ContributorsThe top five contributing companies in 2Q came from the Gold and Energy sectors. The top two contributors were gold mining companies. The fact that gold miners continued to perform so well in 2Q provides, we believe, further confirmation that they came into 2016 considerably healthier than they had been for quite a while and truly deserved a valuation re-rating.Agnico Eagle Mines1 (NYSE:AEM) benefited from strong operational performance, a continued focus on cost reduction, and engineering-related restructuring. Barrick Gold2 (ABX) benefited from the restructuring it has been undertaking and its leverage to gold prices.Within the Energy sector, Oil & Gas Exploration & Production company Newfield Exploration3 (NYSE:NFX) benefited from successful drilling results in central Oklahoma's STACK play, Oil & Gas Equipment & Services company Halliburton4 (NYSE:HAL) rose on the back of firmer oil prices and an uptick in drilling, and Oil & Gas Exploration & Production company Cimarex Energy5 (NYSE:XEC) benefited from successful drilling in the Delaware Basin.2Q Performance DetractorsThe hard assets strategy's five biggest individual performance detractors came from the Fertilizers & Agricultural Chemicals and Diversified Metals & Mining sub-industries, and the Energy sector. CF Industries Holdings6 (NYSE:CF) was hit by concerns around both Chinese production (which continued unabated) and the value of the renminbi, in addition to concerns around nitrogen prices. Glencore7 (OTCPK:GLCNF) suffered from profit-taking after a successful first quarter and a moderation in key commodity prices. Valero Energy (NYSE:VLO) (sold by the strategy during the quarter) suffered from the rebound in crude oil prices. Oil & Gas Storage & Transportation companies Scorpio Tankers8 (NYSE:STNG) and Golar LNG9 (NASDAQ:GLNG) suffered, respectively, due to lower tanker rates and a softening in the global liquefied natural gas (LNG) market.Brexit Decision Seen as a Defining Moment of 2QDespite the market spending most of the three-month period under the twin shadows and uncertainties of Brexit and the U.S. presidential elections, sentiment remained positive. Overall, the environment was positive for commodities, particularly for gold. The most significant macroeconomic factor influencing commodities markets was the continued extraordinary accommodation extended by central banks around the world. In addition, supply and demand, particularly for oil and gas, continued to rebalance.For many, the Brexit referendum on June 23, the result of which was the U.K. voting to reject continued membership of the European Union (EU), was seen as a defining moment. Perhaps somewhat surprisingly, Brexit's immediate effect was somewhat less than cataclysmic, and commodities have remained surprisingly resilient. It remains to be seen, however, just what the long-term effects of the vote will be.Demand for Crude Oil Remains StrongDespite lackluster prospects for economic growth in both Europe and the U.S., the demand for crude oil and, in particular, gasoline remained remarkably strong. The U.S. is now consuming almost 10 million barrels a day. The country's gasoline demand exceeds the unrefined crude oil demand of every country in the world except China.Concerns that a flood of Iranian crude oil could swamp the market continued to prove unfounded. Albeit reasonably strong, supply from the country was in no way enough to offset supply disruptions in the market for exogenous reasons during the quarter. These included pipeline outages in Nigeria, wildfires in Canada that hit oil sands production particularly hard, reduced supply from Libya on the back of persistent political uncertainty, and supply from Venezuela reduced still further because of both the country's dire economic circumstances and continued drilling challenges.Industrial Metals Companies Continued to RestructureBase metal companies continued to restructure during the quarter, cleaning up balance sheets, streamlining operations, and focusing more on profitability. In addition, they continued to sell off assets and reduce debt levels. On the back of the finding by the U.S. Department of Commerce that government subsidies and dumping were occurring, tariffs were imposed on imports of steel into the U.S., particularly those from China. U.S. steel stocks benefited accordingly.Hard Assets Strategy Prudently Positioned for Brexit ImpactThe U.K.'s historic Brexit decision on June 23 was clearly one of the most important events during the quarter. Currently, our London-listed and GBP-denominated exposure represents around 4% of our strategy's exposure. We believe that we were prudently positioned going into the vote given a gold equities exposure of approximately 19%, one of the highest allocations since the inception of our hard assets strategy. Furthermore, the high-quality, companies (i.e., strong balance sheets and long-term structural growth stories) in our other sectors are likely to prove relatively resilient during the period of uncertainty that will follow the vote.While global economic growth trends were put at risk by the result of the vote, we continue to believe demand for commodities will likely remain solid in the face of moderate GDP progression. Further output constraint in crude, base metals, and some bulk materials could possibly be exacerbated by this murky outlook, but this may in turn tighten commodity markets and support prices. Given that the U.S. Federal Reserve is now not likely to raise interest rates, this should continue to put pressure on the U.S. dollar, which may be stimulating to emerging markets and commodity demand.Room for Tempered OptimismWhile we still believe there is room for optimism, we also believe this should still remain tempered when it comes to supply and demand rebalancing in the oil & gas sector. It remains, perhaps, too easy to fall into the trap of thinking that a 10%, or even a 50%, increase in a U.S. onshore oil rig count of fewer than 350 can restore the balance, and to forget that, to plumb its current depths, the rig count has actually dropped from its highs by a total of some 1,300 rigs. It is going to take an increase of considerably more than 150-200 rigs to bring back any growth in production. Maybe not all 1,300 rigs, but perhaps at least half of them. And for crude to be anywhere from $50-60 a barrel.One of the main pillars of our investment philosophy continues to be to look for long-term growth and the structural enhancement in intrinsic value in the companies in which we invest. Even in today's market conditions, this continues to be one of our guiding tenets. Since we remain convinced that positioning our strategy for the future, and not just reacting to current circumstance, is of paramount importance, our focus across the sectors in which we invest remains on companies that can navigate commodity price volatility and help grow sustainable net asset value.POST DISCLOSUREFor a complete listing of the holdings in VanEck Global Hard Assets Fund (the ""Fund"") as of 6/30/16, please click on this PDF.

That could hurt sentiment.Latin America (13% of total revenue) could be the next shoe to drop given falling oil production and credit problems in Venezuela.,"Source: Getty ImagesHalliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) reports Q2 earnings on Wednesday. Analysts expect revenue of $3.76 billion and loss per share of $0.19. The revenue estimate is off 10% versus the $4.2 billion revenue the company reported in Q1. Below are two key items investors should focus on:Waning LiquidityOil prices are 50% higher compared to their January lows of nearly $30. This has emboldened buyers of HAL and other oilfield services stocks. However, higher oil prices may not equate to higher E&P. Oil companies have focused on cutting costs and repairing their balance sheets. To stave off the contraction in equipment spending, oil services companies need to squirrel away as much capital as possible.With $9.6 billion in cash at the end of Q1 (down from $10.1 billion in Q4 2015), Halliburton was well-positioned to continue to survive the oil patch in spite of price concessions in certain markets. After its failed merger with Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI), which included a $3.5 billion break-up fee, the company's liquidity now poses a cause for concern. The after-tax amount of the break-up fee (about $2.6 billion) and an expected redemption of $2.5 billion in senior notes could cause Halliburton's cash to fall below $5 billion this quarter. Such a sharp decline in liquidity with no near-term increase in E&P could create negative sentiment for HAL.Diminution Of Latin American OperationsOver the past 18 months, North America (42% of total revenue) has been a thorn in Halliburton's side. The company has been required to offer price concessions to shale oil plays punished by low oil prices.This quarter and beyond, Latin America (13% of total revenue) may be a source of worry. Revenue from the region fell 22% sequentially in Q1. Venezuela, one of world's largest oil producers, is in dire straits. Its economy experienced one of the world's deepest contractions in 2015, and it's negatively impacting oil production. Oil production fell to a 13-year low in June; meanwhile, Venezuela's state oil company, PDVSA, is having problems paying its debts.Halliburton is one of PDVSA's biggest vendors and has agreed to finance some of its equipment purchases. This could put more strain on the company's balance sheet. Secondly, if the fall in Venezuela's oil production leads to lower equipment purchases, it could negatively impact Halliburton's Latin American operations in this quarter or the next."
3990556,32971,2016-07-22T05:31:01-04:00,"Halliburton posted negative cash flow from operations in the first half of 2016.While the modest improvement in North America is positive news, the company's operating margins in the region will likely remain negative for at least another two quarters.In international regions, operating momentum remains negative and the cyclical trough appears to be a 2017 event.Leverage spiked. An equity offering to shore up the credit cannot be ruled out.While Halliburton is strongly positioned for a recovery in oil, the timing of such recovery remains a risk to the stock price.","Important note: This article is not an investment recommendation and should not to be relied upon when making investment decisions - investors should conduct their own comprehensive research. Please read the disclaimer at the end of this article.Halliburton's (NYSE:HAL) second-quarter conference call was rich with proposed catchy headlines. Just to quote a few:These upbeat themes captured the lion's share of air time during the conference call. Only few analysts questioned the strength of the proclaimed cyclical upturn and underlying fundamentals. However, the stock has continued to slide in the aftermath of the earnings release versus an overall upward move in oil & gas stocks, which seems to suggest at least some investors are disappointed with the weak financial results for the quarter, and could indicate that the market's view on the shape of the cyclical recovery may not be universal.Negative Cash Flow In Q2 2016Notwithstanding Halliburton's upbeat messages, it is difficult to overlook the heavy toll that the current downcycle in oil and gas is taking on the company's financial results. For the first six months, it posted negative cash flow from operations of $0.3 billion, excluding the $3.5 billion termination fee paid to Baker Hughes (BHI) during the second quarter of 2016. While the company would probably argue that restructuring charges are non-recurring items, I view them to be the cost of managing business through the cycle.(Source: Halliburton, 8-K filing)Halliburton commented on the call that it is not unusual for the company's cash flow to be back-end loaded in the year, and suggested that 2016 will be no exception in this regard. Still, the negative cash flow result in the first half is a measure of the severity of the trough and an indication that even the largest service providers such as Halliburton, which enjoy privileged competitive positions in certain markets and product lines, are not immune to price pressures and suffer from sharply reduced capacity utilization.As a reminder, Halliburton expects capital expenditures for the year to be approximately $850 million, which makes the company's goal of living within its operating cash flow quite a challenge this year. It should be noted that, similar to its peers in the oil service sector, Halliburton should continue to harvest its working capital as activity levels across several regions drift lower. By the same token, it will face the challenge of funding its working capital requirement, should the industry cycle turn.Negative Margin Momentum Continued In Q2During the second quarter, operating results continued to deteriorate:The larger-than-expected decline in Middle East/Asia operating margin is perhaps the greatest disappointment in Halliburton's second-quarter report.Overall, the Middle East and CIS appear to be the primary drivers of the company's margin resilience, whereas most of the other regions continue to languish.(Source: Halliburton, 8-K filing)Q3 Margins Outlook Remains ChallengedIn view of the cyclical trough North America is in, Halliburton anticipates its revenue in the region to increase sequentially in the third quarter and margins to improve by 100-200 basis points as a result of cost control and better utilization. Given that the company's operating margin in North America in Q2 was negative 8%, it is clear from the guidance that the next quarter will still be a negative-margin quarter, and at this rate of improvement, it may take some time to reach a breakeven.In other areas, the near-term momentum remains negative:To summarize, the company's near-term guidance appears to suggest that financial results will remain quite weak in the second half of this year, with the recovery in North America being only modest and other regions experiencing continued pressures in volumes and pricing. A breakeven in North American operating margins appears to be a 2017 target, whereas an inflection point in international regions has not even been reached yet.Leverage SpikesAs expected, Halliburton's financial leverage spiked sharply at the end of the second quarter. Net debt/capitalization ratio increased to 48%, as compared to 23% at year-end 2015.While credit considerations are not a concern yet for Halliburton, the company's liquidity and credit have deteriorated to a point that some balance sheet repair may be required, particularly if the downturn proves to be extended. The company's cash balance declined from $10.1 billion at the end of 2015 to just $3.1 billion at the end of Q2 2016. On the other hand, its debt, which stood at $12.2 billion at the end of Q2, looks quite uncomfortable given the company's negative free cash flow in the first half.A year ago, a suggestion that Halliburton may need to issue equity to shore up its balance sheet would sound ridiculous. Currently, an equity raise appears to be a wise move and, arguably, a necessity.In ConclusionIt is difficult not to notice remarkable resilience of Halliburton's stock price throughout the current downcycle in oil, in spite of the Baker Hughes takeover fiasco and a longer-than-expected downcycle in oil. The company's enterprise value currently stands at ~$46 billion. This resilience is understandable to some degree, given Halliburton's extraordinary business franchise and enviable position, alongside Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB), in some of the most important international markets where business activity tends to be stable and the competitive landscape often looks like a duopoly.That said, the current stock price appears to reflect a presumption that the cyclical recovery in oil will be strong. While directionally such presumption is logical, the tricky part is to determine the timing of the recovery and its exact trajectory. For example, to expect that 900 high-performance rigs will be employed in the U.S., one would need to assume oil prices recovering above $70-80 per barrel, in my opinion. So far, a convincing recovery in oil has been elusive, with the improvement in the North American operating activity being driven predominantly by capital raising in equity markets. The ""animal spirits"" that Halliburton referred to in it is prepared remarks are, unfortunately, mostly a reflection of easy capital, not healthy industry fundamentals - at least not yet.In the event the much-needed improvement in oil prices turns out slow and gradual, oil service companies may experience an extended period of low-margin recovery, given that capacity utilization remains very low and the ramp-up in activity will impose additional significant costs (such as re-hiring and training personnel, paying up for supply chain re-inflation and bottlenecks, re-opening offices and facilities, funding working capital, etc.). While Halliburton is strongly positioned for the upcycle, investors may have to stock a good supply of patience (and a conviction that the cycle's trough is indeed in, or will be relatively soon).Halliburton's results have a negative read-across for other oil service companies, including Weatherford (WFT) and Baker Hughes. Weatherford's position is particularly vulnerable given its financial leverage and lack of competitive differentiation.For in-depth data and analysis of commodity fundamentals, please consider subscribing to Zeits OIL ANALYTICS that provides analysis of the crude oil and natural markets.Disclaimer: Opinions expressed herein by the author are not an investment recommendation and are not meant to be relied upon in investment decisions.

3989850,33291,2016-07-20T13:04:32-04:00,"The pain in the oil sector has begun to subside as oil has started to climb back, and I think HAL's performance (earnings and revenues) just bottomed.I discuss Q2 results, which I believe will be the lowest results the company will post this year.What to look for going forward.","Halliburton (NYSE:HAL), as many of you know, is an oil service stock that I have traded many times over the years despite having long preferred rival Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB). That said, both are very similar in many respects. The pain in the oil sector has begun to subside as oil has started to climb back. For the last year and a half, the pain has been real for investors in the sector, but I have been behind the names, encouraging you to buy this dip for months. Those calls are paying off. Now that the drama of the Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI) ordeal is behind us, save the $3.5 billion Halliburton is on the hook for, now is the time to get back to looking at the fundamentals and the performance of these names on an individual basis.To determine where the stock may be heading, aside from oil prices, we need to talk about the company's recent performance. With oil prices so low of late, though rebounding somewhat in Q2, it has crushed the company. This is particularly true when we look to say two or three years ago. Simply put, the higher the price, the better. That's just a fact that is true for all of the oil names. That said, Halliburton beat analyst expectations on revenues and beat expectations on the bottom line.So what kind of numbers are we talking about? Well, despite an earnings beat, a comparison to last year clearly demonstrates the pain the company has been experiencing. Of course, it should surprise no one, with oil having dropped to decade lows coming into 2016. Quarter over quarter, I was not surprised to see the company drop heavily on the bottom line versus Q1, but the results surprised analysts. The company saw a loss from continuing operations in its second quarter of $121 million. This translated to $0.14 per share. Still, this beat analyst estimates by $0.05 per share. Adjusted operating income was $62 million in Q2 2016, down from the adjusted operating income of $225 million in Q1 2016. Again this is no surprise and is a direct result of revenues that dropped markedly. Halliburton's total revenue in Q2 was $3.84 billion compared to $4.2 billion in the first quarter of 2016. Ouch. That said, this beat estimates slightly, by $90 million.So just how did Halliburton get here and beat earnings by this much? First, expectations were drastically low, thanks to oil prices. Still, it managed to control expenses as best it could, and really this is the key to survival for this sector right now. Over the last year, the company has slashed its expenditures in just about every category. That's really all that matters in the short run and really what you need to keep an eye on. Commodity pricing is driving revenues, so the bottom line can thus be impacted by watching spending. Of course, the Baker Hughes termination fee hit the company for $3.52 billion, and it took impairment charges of $423 million. Still, looking at the revenues and operating income/loss statements, it becomes clear that the company managed to decrease operating expenses in most categories, and this is the key to its survival.It is no surprise that with revenues declining so precipitously that operating income would be hit year over year, but the company really did get crushed quarter over quarter, relatively speaking. Loss from continuing operations was up to $3.2 billion, or $3.73 per share, rising from a loss of $2.4 billion, or $2.81 per share. Looking ahead, oil is rebounding in the near term. I expected a terrible quarter, and once again I was not disappointed. However, the market may be turning a corner. Now that the Baker Hughes deal is off the table and the charge has been paid, we can get back to watching expenses, production and debt. I maintain a hold rating on the name, but am optimistic for the coming quarters given the move higher in oil.Note from the author: Christopher F.

3990688,40351,2016-07-22T13:26:15-04:00,Halliburton has recently released its quarterly results.The company will likely continue to struggle in the short term.But there's light at the end of tunnel.,"Halliburton (NYSE:HAL), the world's second largest oilfield services company that dominates North America, has recently released its quarterly results, in which it swung to a large loss, even after excluding the hefty charges related to its failed attempt to acquire Baker Hughes (BHI). But there's light at the end of this tunnel.Earnings - Quick RecapDecent Performance In A Brutal EnvironmentHalliburton's bottom line was expected to decline significantly as it booked charges related to its failed merger with Baker Hughes. And it did as the company posted its biggest loss in the downturn.This is Halliburton's second significant loss in a row which has been driven by one-time charges. In the first quarter of this year, the company said that it lost $2.81 per share, thanks in large part to $2.1 billion in charges related to job cuts and asset write-downs.HAL quarterly results, 1Q2014-2Q2016Meanwhile, Halliburton continued to struggle with low levels of activity as rig count declined to, what could turn out to be, the bottom of this cycle. The company also continued to face pricing pressure from its clients, the exploration and production companies, and is finding it difficult to recover payments from Venezuela's state-owned oil producer as the country goes through one of its worst political and economic turmoil.Considering this brutal environment, Halliburton delivered a decent performance. The decline in revenues and adjusted earnings wasn't as bad as everyone feared. In fact, the company managed to outperform the rig count declines in major markets, which indicates that it could be gaining market share.In North America, revenues fell 15% in the second quarter as compared to the first quarter, but it was better than the 23% decline witnessed in the US rig count in the same period. Similarly, revenue drops in Latin America and the eastern hemisphere were better than the corresponding decline in drilling activity.Short-Term WeaknessThe good news is that Halliburton seems to have taken into account all the major one-time charges. Consequently, moving forward, we'll likely witness a substantial improvement in earnings on a sequential basis. However, we are still not through with the downturn yet and the company's earnings may remain in the red.That's because, firstly, while the drilling activity has picked up recently as oil climbed to around $47 a barrel, the gains have been modest. According to the latest report from Baker Hughes, there are currently 542 rigs operating in the US and Canada; this shows a drop of 507 rigs from a year earlier. This means that even if shale drillers continue to add rigs, it will still take a lot of time before the rig count climbs back to last year's levels.Secondly, Halliburton, like all other oilfield service providers, has given deep discounts to oil producers. It needs to scale back pricing in order to improve its bottom line and post a turnaround. But the recent rise in rig count hasn't come with a corresponding increase in capital expenditure from oil and gas producers. Although some shale drillers, such as Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN), have increased drilling expenditure, a large majority of oil producers continue to keep a lid on their spending levels and are reluctant to offer better prices.This means that for now, Halliburton will continue to struggle with weak revenues and earnings.Light At The End Of TunnelHowever, we are now seeing the first signs of a turnaround.As mentioned earlier, drilling activity has picked up in recent weeks, with 21 rig additions seen in the US and Canada in the week ending July 15. The gains have come as oil producers show confidence in the ~70% increase in oil prices seen since February. Companies like Devon Energy and Pioneer Natural Resources (NYSE:PXD) have talked about adding additional rigs in the coming months. Overall, Halliburton believes that we'll see a ""modest uptick"" in rig count in the second half of this year, though an uptick nonetheless which will be a big positive.Buoyed by this development, Halliburton is now actively pushing for better prices. The company is now willing to walk away from those jobs that it believes are uneconomic and is evaluating every contract that it has signed in the downturn. In the coming quarters, the pricing environment should improve, which will lift Halliburton's profit margins and earnings.Meanwhile, oil producers are focusing on more efficient, high-intensity drilling methods by covering larger areas, using more proppants and greater horsepower on a single well than ever before. In fact, Halliburton's president, Jeff Miller, believes that 900 rigs working today will consume as much horsepower as 2,000 rigs did prior to the downturn. That has boosted the demand of fracking equipment, even though the rig count is down on a year-over-year basis. Halliburton could turn out to be the biggest beneficiary here given it is the global leader in the fracking equipment space and has a ton of idle equipment available just waiting to get more work.Note from author: Thank you for reading.

3990367,24491,2016-07-21T16:16:53-04:00,"Halliburton has called off its merger with Baker Hughes and now owes a $3.5 billion break-up fee as a result of the failed deal.
        As of the end of the first quarter of 2016, US land rig count declined almost 80% from its peak in 2014.
        We don’t like Halliburton's total debt of ~$15.4 billion at the end of the first quarter of 2016, but nearly $10 billion in cash and cash equivalents does help matters.
        Let's take a look at the firm's investment highlights as we walk through the valuation process and derive a fair value estimate for shares.","By The Valuentum TeamIn May, Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) called off its merger with Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI), and the firm will now owes Baker Hughes a $3.5 billion breakup fee. While this will inevitably impact its balance sheet, the company was left with few alternative options due to heightened regulatory pressure in the US and Europe. Meanwhile, Halliburton's resilient free cash flow generation in the midst of a significant downturn in the energy markets has been encouraging. Free cash flow has averaged just over $1 billion in the past 3 years (2013-2015), as it is focusing on slashing costs (its goal being to cut $1 billion in annual costs by the end of 2016) while still retaining operating profit.But working capital benefits and capital spending cuts can't last forever, and like any energy equipment company, Halliburton's success is tied to the highly cyclical capital spending levels of the oil and gas markets. The ongoing pressure on demand for oilfield equipment and services as a result of suppressed energy resource prices will continue to pressure the company's financial strength (revenue dropped ~28% in 2015 to $23.6 billion from 2014). For example, at the end of the first quarter of 2016, US land rig count (key consumers of Halliburton's equipment) declined almost 80% from its peak in 2014. While we don't like its total debt balance of ~$15.4 billion as of the end of the first quarter of 2016, nearly $10 billion in cash and cash equivalents helps to offset this to a degree, and the firm maintains a solid investment grade credit rating.While continued pressure as a result of suppressed energy resource pricing will continue threaten Halliburton's financial health, North American energy markets are improving slightly and stability in commodity prices is expected by some in the second half of 2016. Ultimately, when and if the oil and gas markets recover, independent, higher-cost North American producers have the potential to benefit the most, putting Halliburton in a solid position to benefit almost simultaneously (more than half its sales have been generated in North America historically). If Halliburton is able to maintain market share and ""live within its cash flows"" until a prolonged stability of commodity prices occurs, we see little cause for serious concern.Halliburton's Investment ConsiderationsInvestment Highlights• Halliburton is a provider of services and products to the energy industry related to the exploration, development, and production of oil and natural gas. The company has two operating segments: Completion & Production and Drilling & Evaluation. It was established in 1919.• Halliburton has scrapped its plans to acquire Baker Hughes as a result of scrutiny from US and European regulators. Halliburton owes Baker Hughes a $3.5 billion breakup fee, which it plans to pay for with cash on hand.• Following the breakup of the merger agreement with Baker Hughes, Halliburton will seek other ways to expand its global reach. The firm plans to invest in areas where it has been weaker and will look at selective acquisitions to augment its offerings. Also, the company expects to cut structural costs by ~25% or $1 billion on an annualized basis by the end of 2016.• Halliburton looks to three areas for growth: 1) unconventional (shale gas, tight gas), deepwater, and mature fields (those past peak production). Halliburton has invested to capitalize on each of these areas of expansion. Roughly half of its business comes from the United States.• Profits have been under pressure the past few years, and this coupled with the recent top-line pressure as a result of cratering crude oil prices has caused the firm to look elsewhere (consolidation) for growth. Smaller, strategic acquisitions can be expected.Business QualityEconomic Profit AnalysisIn our opinion, the best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital with its weighted average cost of capital. The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. Halliburton's 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 19.3%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 9.1%. As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT. In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate.Cash Flow AnalysisFirms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. Halliburton's free cash flow margin has averaged about 3.5% during the past 3 years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generation is relatively MEDIUM.The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. At Halliburton, cash flow from operations decreased about 35% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures fell about 26% over the same time period.Valuation AnalysisWe think Halliburton is worth $36 per share with a fair value range of $29-$43.The margin of safety around our fair value estimate is derived from an evaluation of the historical volatility of key valuation drivers and a future assessment of them. Our near-term operating forecasts, including revenue and earnings, do not differ much from consensus estimates or management guidance. Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 0.4% during the next five years, a pace that is higher than the firm's 3-year historical compound annual growth rate of -6.1%.Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 8.9%, which is below Halliburton's trailing 3-year average. Beyond year 5, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 4.4% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For Halliburton, we use a 9.1% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows.Margin of Safety AnalysisOur discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $36 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future were known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values.Our ValueRisk™ rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock. In the graph above, we show this probable range of fair values for Halliburton. We think the firm is attractive below $29 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $43 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion.Future Path of Fair ValueWe estimate Halliburton's fair value at this point in time to be about $36 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart above compares the firm's current share price with the path to the right of Halliburton's expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate.The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year 3 represents our best estimate of the value of the firm's shares three years hence. This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the firm's future cash flow potential change.The expected fair value of $47 per share in Year 3 represents our existing fair value per share of $36 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.This article or report and any links within are for information purposes only and should not be considered a solicitation to buy or sell any security.

3989953,22148,2016-07-20T16:50:20-04:00,"Halliburton beat Q2 estimates, though the company reported a loss for the quarter.The valuation metrics are now stretched, especially in a market that is only scrapping off the bottom despite the proclamations of a market turn.The recommendation is now neutral on the stock based on valuation and a weaker balance sheet.","The investment theme for Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) had centered around the synergies from a purchase of Baker Hughes (BHI). The failed merger changes the equation as Halliburton will now struggle to close the margin gap with Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB).The bigger issue now is that Halliburton has rallied to around multi-year highs and the oilfield services market is only bouncing off the bottom. Not to mention, the $3.5 billion termination fee Halliburton paid to Baker Hughes during the quarter dramatically alters the balance sheets of both companies.The CEO proclaimed that the North America market has turned. The statement is backed by the recent increases in the U.S. rig count, but the slight uptick in drilling has capped oil prices below $50/bbl.For Q2, Halliburton's loss was an adjusted $0.14 excluding the termination fee and impairment charges. With a trough in the cycle, one should expect improving numbers and a return to profits possibly even in the current quarter.The question, though, is there upside potential considering that even earning $1 per share next year leaves the stock with 44 forward P/E multiple.Possibly the best way to compare the sector stocks is based on the balance sheet in comparison to revenue expectations. The below chart highlights the enterprise value to forward revenue multiples prior to the $3.5 billion payment from Halliburton to Baker Hughes during Q2.Schlumberger still leads the pack, but the sector now trades at multi-year highs. At these stock prices, Halliburton is now closing the gap with Schlumberger despite not getting any benefits from the lengthy and time consuming work on the merger.After factoring in the updated Q2 balance sheet for Halliburton that includes the termination fee, the company trades over a 3x multiple. After the quarter, the oilfield services giant has a EV of roughly $47 billion with net debt now sitting at $9 billion.The Baker Hughes EV/revenue multiple drops closer to 1.8x as the smaller market cap sees a bigger benefit to the enterprise value. Of course, this multiple excludes the stock buyback and debt moves the company made with the termination fee that placed the company in a positive cash balance position.The key investor takeaway is that the market has built a big rebound in oilfield services demand into the current stock price of Halliburton. The stock no longer offers the comparative value suggesting the upside is capped.The stock remains in my portfolio solely for momentum reasons and will likely be sold in the near term."
3979646,101716,2016-06-03T09:07:02-04:00,Clean 1Q’16 operating EPS of $0.02 versus the consensus of $0.04. The reported loss includes further asset impairments.Sales levels dropped significantly across all regions.However I see HAL as among the best-positioned companies to participate in a market recovery.,"Halliburton (NYSE: HAL) is a leading multi-service provider to the oil and gas industry, and is approximately one-third the size by market cap versus the industry leading peer Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB). Halliburton has a top market position in pressure pumping and strong market positions in most other upstream areas. Major activity categories include remote sensing (locating hydrocarbons), drilling and evaluation, well construction and completion, data management and reservoir optimization.The company stands out somewhat from its major peers in that it manufactures its own pressure pumping equipment, as opposed to purchasing from frac equipment suppliers. HAL operates in approximately 80 countries with its business organized around four primary geographic regions: North America, Latin America, Europe/Africa/CIS, and the Middle East/Asia. Roughly 50% of HAL revenue is derived from North America. The company had more than 77,000 employees at year-end 2014.Earnings.Halliburton reported clean 1Q'16 operating EPS of $0.02 versus the consensus of $0.04. The reported loss of -$2.81 per share included over $2.0 billion of further asset impairments and rightsizing charges resulting from the severe industry downturn, as well as $538 million of other costs related to HAL's failed attempt to acquire peer Baker Hughes. HAL announced clean EPS of $0.07, but this excludes $77 million, or $0.05 per share, of added interest expense due to financing for the BHI deal. I do not feel that it is fair to exclude this expense in clean income given that a material amount of the debt will continue to be carried going forward. HAL intends to only pay down $2.5 billion of the approximately $7.5 billion issued to finance the deal.A significant portion of HAL's remaining proceeds will be allocated to the $3.5 billion breakup fee the company is paying to  Baker Hughes (BHI).HAL will begin removing retained overhead that was in place to absorb BHI once the acquisition is closed. HAL previously reported that it was carrying 300 basis points of added cost in North America.D&A associated with assets held for divestiture that was previously excluded from the P&L will be reflected in 2Q'16 reporting.Sales levels dropped significantly in the fourth quarter of 2015 versus the previous year's fourth quarter. During the fourth quarter of 2015, sales at Halliburton Company totaled $5.08 billion. This is a drop of42.1% from the $8.77 billion in sales at the company during the fourth quarter in 2014. This was the biggest quarterly decline in sales at Halliburton Company in the previous 33 quarters. Halliburton Company reported sales of $23.63 billion for the year ending December of 2015. This represents a sharp decrease of 28.1% versus 2014, when the company's sales were $32.87 billion.Source: Graph created by author using MorningStar data.North America (NAM) revenue was 11% above $1.6 billion revenue market estimations, with the EBIT loss of -$39 million. The topline results substantially outperformed peers and the 27% drop in US rig count, even in the absence of year end product sales that boosted Q4'15 results.International revenue of $2.4 billion was 4% shy of market $2.6 billion estimate. The revenue miss was spread across all regions, while the EBIT shortfall was driven by the MidEast/Asia geo market and, to a lesser extent, Europe/Africa/CIS.This weakness was due in part to the sharp reduction of activity in the North Sea and lower completion tools sales that are typical in 1Q'16.However, I anticipate that pricing pressures are taking greater hold, and this appears consistent with peer Schlumberger's comments that it will become increasingly difficult to maintain the impressive decrementals that have been posted by many large providers in this downturn HAL is anticipating further weakness in 2Q'16. While Eastern Hemisphere revenues are projected to be similar to 1Q'16 levels, margins are expected to decline by 300-400 basis points due to continued pricing pressures as well as the cycling back of depreciation related to assets previously held for sale.Latin America topline results are expected to fall by high single digits, with margins declining by approximately 200-300 basis points. I note that HAL's significantly worse 1Q'16 Latin America results versus peers is likely driven in part by its 1Q'16 curtailment of activity in Venezuela.HAL noted in its operational update that the completions activity was only down by single digits sequentially in 1Q'16. This is a very impressive feat, and I believe the substantial outperformance is a testament to the logistical competency that HAL has in the NAM stimulation business. While some might suggest a material pricing effort to gain market share, I believe this was unlikely to any great extent given the decremental margin performance that was comparable to other major providers.According to Societe Generale Cross Asset Research activity has contracted materially thus far in 2Q'16. HAL anticipates further contraction in 2Q'16, although again outperforming rig count declines as a result. NAM pricing pressures remain severe, and margin pressures are projected to persist in 2Q'16, with HAL targeting decrementals in the -25% range.My outlook continues to expect stabilization to set in during 2H'16, and I do not anticipate any improvement in rig activity. Rather, I believe that E&Ps would be more inclined to engage in completions of drilled but uncompleted (DUCs) wells to stem production declines and increase cash flow.HAL noted that it does not view the DUC inventory as a meaningful driver for a tightening in the US pressure pumping market. The company plans to maintain its strategy of providing a comprehensive offering around frac, unlike peer BHI, which announced on 3 May that it will significantly scale back its US frac operations.Thus relative LAM performance may be reversed in the current quarter. HAL/BHI acquisition dead - HAL announced on 2 May that it had agreed to terminate its pending merger agreement with BHI, and would pay the company the agreed upon $3.5 billion breakup fee in due course. HAL added on the call that the severity of the market downturn had significantly undermined the benefits of the merger. This was particularly true with potential transaction synergies, as well as pricing that could be fetched for the significant assets to be sold from the deal. As such, the companies decided that sufficient economic incentive was no longer in place to take the hard route of fighting the DOJ's lawsuit to block the then pending acquisition.HAL will likely find it necessary to grow into certain non overlapping businesses like artificial lift and specialty chemicals that were key targets in the BHI deal.I believe these areas would be necessary to compete more effectively with larger peer SLB on certain fronts. It will likely take a number of years to grow out these businesses, however, and thus I anticipate that it will largely be business as usual for HAL in the upcoming recovery, with the company continuing to focus on key strategies like Battle Red and the build out of its Q10 stimulation fleet, while undertaking operational restructuring to better align for the very different oil and gas market that is likely to emerge out of this downturn.Key revisions - NAM activity is poised to contract sharply in 2Q'16, most likely in line with my current expectation, but HAL's strong 1Q'16 topline performance stands to support a higher base from which to decline. In addition, peer BHI's decision to significantly scale back its NAM pressure pumping operations could prove a significant opportunity for HAL going forward.International will weigh on 2016, and somewhat less so in 2017. I ultimately expect NAM to recover more sharply than we had in late 2015, and this stands to largely offset weaker international assumptions for 2018.I expect very limited pricing recovery in NAM driven mini cycle. I believe at this point E&Ps will have flushed the system with production again, causing a minor contraction, and never allowing for full absorption of the material excess capacity in NAM.Stocks.In recent years, this stock has performed terribly. In 2014, the stock traded as high as $74.33, versus $35.09 on 4/1/2016. (In 2014, the stock retreated significantly from its high, and by the end of the year was at $39.33). For the 52 weeks ending 4/1/2016, the stock of this company was down 20.2% to $35.09. During the past 13 weeks, the stock has increased 3.1%. During the 12 months ending 12/31/2015, the company has experienced losses totaling $0.79 per share.HAL data by YChartsThis company is currently trading at 1.27 times sales. The three companies vary greatly in terms of price to sales ratio: trading from 0.21 times all the way up to 4.13 times their annual sales.Halliburton Company is trading at 1.94 times book value.Halliburton Company operates in the Oil and gas field services sector. I compare Halliburton Company with three other companies:Schlumberger Limited - 2015 sales of $35.53 billion,Chesapeake Energy (NYSE: CHK) - 2015 sales of $12.14 billion,Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY) - 2015 sales of $12.60 billion.Source: Table created by author using Yahoo Finance data.During the last 12 months Halliburton Company paid dividends totaling $0.72 per share. Since the stock is currently trading at $42.64, this implies a dividend yield of 1.7%. This company's dividend yield is lower than the three comparable companies (which are currently paying dividends between 2.3% and 4.4% of the stock price).HAL has paid a dividend for 6 straight years, and has increased its dividend during each of the past 3 calendar years (in 2012, the dividends were $0.36 per share).During the same 12 month period the Company reported losses of 0.79 per share. This implies that the management likely believesthat the company will return to profitability soon: a company simply cannot pay out dividends forever if it is losing money.As of December 2015, the company's long term debt was $14.69 billion and total liabilities were $21.45 billion. The long term debt to equity ratio of the company is 0.95.Risks for Halliburton.HAL derives the largest revenue portion of its peers well stimulation services in North America. This segment in particular is going through a highly depressed period, and is severely impacting profitability. If the NAM market fails to recover in 2017/18 as I anticipate, it could have a significant impact on company EPS and price target. HAL has paid a $3.5 billion break-up fee to BHI for the unsuccessful merger attempt with the company.HAL is expected to carry an elevated level of debt for several years as a result. This could curtail the company's ability to do accretive acquisitions and possibly cause EPS to fall.International markets tend to turn slower than the US, and if they fail to reverse course in 2017, it could cause HAL EPS and shares to fall short of forecasts.Stock sentiment and earnings prospects can also be heavily impacted by global economic trends, commodity prices, geopolitics, government regulation, capacity additions, project execution, safety and competitive factors, including market positioning and technological capabilities.I see HAL as among the best-positioned OFS companies to participate in a NAM onshore recovery, given its NAM onshore leverage and in particular its leverage to the pressure pumping market.I believe oil prices have bottomed and the US rig count will bottom this quarter. While there is the recovery through 2016 as anemic due to the strained balance sheets of the E&P industry, HAL works for the strongest companies, if even on a relative basis. Onshore US activity will clearly recover first and HAL is significantly exposed to that market, with the ""frack of the future"" equipment deployment having continued. I expect HAL to perform better than its peers. I believe there could be further upside for Halliburton, I recommend buying HAL."
3981261,92136,2016-06-10T11:22:02-04:00,"Halliburton shares have shot up 33% this year as the oil price has recovered, sparking a wave of optimism about the rig count recovery.
        With oil now trading around $50/barrel, the likes of Pioneer and Whiting are expected to bring online more rigs and frack more wells, which is a positive for Halliburton.
        Halliburton’s Frac of the Future program allows E&P companies save nearly 20% capital, use 35% less workforce, and bring down the completion time by 40%, which is an advantage.
        Due to its focus on Frac of the Future, Halliburton’s revenue decline has not been as severe as its peers, indicating that it will make a swift recovery.","Oilfield equipment and services provider Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) has put up a surprisingly strong performance on the stock market this year despite the budget cuts implemented by exploration and production companies. In fact, so far in 2016, Halliburton shares are up over 33%, and this can be attributed to the recent rally in oil prices as the Brent now once again trades at more than $50 per barrel.Why things are looking up for HalliburtonThis seems to have brought optimism in the oil and gas industry that the rally in prices will once again encourage E&P companies to start drilling, a move that will improve Halliburton's addressable market. In fact, last month, the Halliburton CEO commented that ""We do think that potentially we'll see an upswing in the rig count in the back half of the year... When this thing snaps back, it's going to snap back hard.""The optimism about a recovery in the rig count in the latter part of the year on the back of an oil price recovery has helped Halliburton gain impressive momentum. According to data released by Baker Hughes, the U.S. rig count for the week ending May 27, 2016 remained unchanged at 404 rigs. But, the rig count is approximately 53.8%, or 471 rigs, lower than last year.The good part is that after a period of sustained decline, natural gas rigs increased 2.4% to 87 rigs for the week of May 27 as compared to the prior week. At the same time, inland water rigs moved up approximately 20% over the same period. Going forward, it is likely that the rig count might continue to get better as certain oil producers are likely to bring online more infrastructure in the current oil price environment.For instance, Pioneer Natural Resources (NYSE:PXD) plans to add around 5 to 10 new rigs in case of a sustained $50 oil price scenario. Similarly, Whiting Petroleum (NYSE:WLL) is also expected to frac 44 wells after it entered into a deal with an unnamed investor.This is good news for Halliburton investors, and I believe that the company will be able to continue improving in the long run as it has focused aggressively on product development moves that allow E&P companies to reduce drilling costs. Let's take a look.Low cost offerings to E&P companies will be a tailwindIn a weak oil and gas pricing environment, oil and gas companies have focused on assets where they can generate robust production at low costs. Halliburton has been aware of this trend and this is why the company has aggressively focused on converting its pressure pumping fleet to the Frac of the Future configuration.According to Halliburton, the new Q10 pump developed under the new configuration can perform longer and reduce idle time. This is because Halliburton's Q10 pump carries the lowest cost per BOE and increases production efficiency as it uses optimized frac sand volumes.In comparison, pressure pumps tend to incur higher costs per BOE as frac sand volumes increase. For instance, last quarter, Halliburton witnessed an increase of 17% in the sand volume on a per well basis. Halliburton believes that this might have an adverse impact on the equipment, hurting the cost per BOE and the production efficiency.Additionally, Halliburton's modular pumping equipment is also gaining traction. Last quarter, Halliburton delivered ""production maximizing gravel pack chemistry for a major deepwater customer."" Usually, this particular pack is delivered through a high-cost stimulation vessel, but Halliburton was able to do the same using a lower cost vessel due to the benefits of its modular pumping equipment.So, Halliburton is doing the right thing by investing in the Frac of the Future as it will allow it to tap the recovery in the end-market more effectively. In fact, as shown in the graphic below, Frac of the Future will help E&P companies save nearly 20% capital, use 35% less workforce, and bring down the completion time by 40%.Source: HalliburtonAs a result of such product development moves, Halliburton has been able to keep its top line in better shape as compared to industry peers. As the chart given below will show us, the company's revenue has declined at a slower pace in both North America and internationally:Source: HalliburtonThus, it is quite evident that Halliburton's moves to get ahead of its peers are working since the company's top line has outperformed the industry.ConclusionHalliburton has put up a strong performance on the stock market this year and given the points discussed above, I think that the company will be able to sustain its performance going forward. It is making the right operational moves and will also be assisted by an improvement in the oil price environment. So, according to me, it will be a good idea to remain invested in Halliburton for more upside."
3985021,40351,2016-06-28T16:07:45-04:00,"Halliburton stock has recently come under pressure.
        Drilling activity in the US has fallen in the latest week while Brexit has exacerbated an already uncertain macroeconomic environment.
        Despite the negative headline numbers, it is important to remember that fundamentally, the business environment for Halliburton is improving.","Shares of Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) have recently come under pressure, with the stock dropping by more than 6% since Thursday on the back of the weak US oil rigs report and the shocking Brexit vote. The stock could continue to struggle this week, but investors shouldn't panic.Image courtesy Pixabay.comHalliburton has been struggling with shrinking revenues and earnings due to the slump in crude oil prices, persistent weakness in natural gas prices, reduction in drilling activity and an excess supply in the pressure pumping market. Last year, the company posted a 28% decline in revenues to $23.6 billion while it swung to a loss of $0.78 per share from a profit of $4.05 per share in 2014. Unlike its bigger rival Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) which has significant exposure to international markets, Halliburton dominates North America which is responsible for more than 42% of its revenues. The drilling activity in North America, which is home to the world's shale oil and oil sands production, has declined more severely as compared to international market, dragging Halliburton's bottom-line.Halliburton's failed attempt to acquire Baker Hughes (BHI) has also not helped. The proposed $28 billion merger, which was torpedoed by regulators on anti-trust concerns, has cost Halliburton billions. In the first three months of this year, Halliburton said that it spent $378 million as merger related costs, up from $79 million spent in the final quarter of 2015. It also has to pay $3.5 billion to Baker Hughes as the break-up fees. Halliburton also took additional debt to finance the ill-fated merger, which is going to damage the company's financial health. Its leverage, measured in terms of debt/EBITDA, could climb to more than 5-times in 2016, significantly higher than the around 2-times level seen before 2015, according to Moody's.Meanwhile, in its recently released rig count report, Baker Hughes said that the total number of US rigs for the week ended June 24 dropped by three to 421 units. The total number of oil rigs declined by seven to 330 units while natural gas drillers added four new rigs, bringing the total gas count to 90 rigs. There were 438 fewer oil and gas rigs operating in the US at the end of last week as compared to the same week last year.On top of this, the UK's decision to break with Europe has exacerbated an already uncertain macroeconomic environment, which is bad for oil and energy stocks. The sterling and UK's stock markets have borne the brunt, with the pound dropping to three decade lows against the US dollar while more than $180 billion have been wiped off from the value of FTSE-350. The US stock markets also have significant exposure to Britain, with the country accounting for more than 10% of sales for 30 S&P-500 companies, according to FactSet. As a result, one of the leading US index has witnessed the worst two-day drop in almost 10 months, with the S&P-500 falling by 5.3%. Overall, the global markets have lost more than $2 trillion in the aftermath of the EU referendum.But despite the negative headline numbers that have dragged Halliburton stock, it is important to remember that fundamentally, the business environment for oilfield services company is improving.The world has become more uncertain following the Brexit vote, but it is unlikely that this is going to have a major impact on oil market's fundamentals. The demand for oil is fairly inelastic and is not going to fall off the cliff, even if the British economy comes under pressure. According to Goldman Sachs's estimates, if UK's economy were to drop by 2% due to the Brexit vote, then its oil demand will drop by just 1%, which is just 0.016% of the world's demand. That's far too small to make any impact on a global scale.Image: HalliburtonMore importantly, the latest US rig count report appear to have dimmed the outlook around US drilling activity, and by that extension, Halliburton, particularly since the rig count release came after prior reports which showed consistent gains in drilling activity. The US oil drillers added nine rigs for the week ending June 17 which was the third consecutive weekly increase. However, I believe that a closer look at the latest report reveals that the US drilling activity could resume its upward trend soon.That's because although the total number of rigs in the US has declined, producers are ramping up drilling activity in low-cost oil producing regions. The Permian Basin, which is the most prolific and lowest cost onshore oil play in the US, is widely expected to lead the recovery in US drilling activity. And it may already be playing this role. Last week, the total number of rigs in the Permian Basin rose by 4 units to 150 rigs. Meanwhile, at Eagle Ford, another low-cost oil play in Texas, the total number of drilling rigs remained steady at 34 units until Friday after climbing by four rigs in the prior week. This shows that rigs are returning to work in the low-cost regions, and, barring any sharp decline in oil prices, this trend will continue in the future.Some major Permian Basin producers, such as Pioneer Natural Resources (NYSE:PXD), plan to ramp up drilling activity in the coming months as oil holds its ground near $50 a barrel. Others, such as Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) and Energen (NYSE:EGN), have filed more than a 100 applications seeking drilling permits for Permian Basin. Moving forward, I believe the rig additions at Permian Basin and Eagle Ford will offset any negative impact of decline in drilling activity in other regions. The US rig count, therefore, will likely increase in the coming weeks.The continued improvement in US drilling activity, which will be followed by decline in pricing pressure, will fuel Halliburton's turnaround. In North America, the company swung from an operating profit of $279 million in the first quarter of 2015 to a loss of $39 million in the first three months of this year. But with improvement in rig count, the business should return to profitability. That's unlikely to happen in the second quarter, given the rig count has just begun to climb. Remember, a couple of months ago, Halliburton said that the second quarter is going to be a challenging one, and Mark McCollum, Halliburton's CFO, has recently reiterated that warning. But Halliburton could begin to show first signs of a turnaround from the third quarter.Note from author: Thank you for reading.

        Despite the failure of BHI acquisition, Halliburton is well positioned to achieve healthy growth when oil prices recover, and its shares are poised to make high capital gains.
        Oil prices have shown a significant rebound in the last four months. As such, we can expect much better results for Halliburton's in the forward quarters.

That said, both are very similar in many respects. The bloodbath in the oil sector has been washing away as oil has started to climb back. Surely you have seen this at the pumps with gas well over $2, and in my neck of the woods approaching $2.50 (thanks NYS and Albany County taxes). The pain has been real in the sector but I have been behind the names encouraging you to buy this dip all fall and winter. Those calls are paying off. Now that the drama of the Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI) ordeal is behind us, save the $3.5 billion Halliburton is on the hook for, now is the time. What time? It's time to get back to basics. Namely, we can get back to looking at the fundamentals and the performance of these names.Now it may sound simplistic, but truer words have never been spoken when it comes to investing. It just doesn't matter where a stock has been, it matters where it is going. And to determine where a stock may be heading, aside from oil prices, we need to talk about the company's recent performance. With oil prices so low of late, particularly in the early part of Q1, it has crushed the company. Simply put, the higher the price the better. That's just a fact that is true for all of the oil names. That said, like Halliburton beat analyst expectations on revenues and beat expectations on the bottom line.So what kind of numbers are we talking about? Well, despite an earnings beat, a comparison to last year clearly demonstrates the pain the company has been experiencing. Of course, it should surprise no one, with oil having dropped to decade lows coming into 2016. Quarter-over-quarter I was not surprised to see the company drop heavily on the bottom-line versus Q4, but results surprised analysts. The company saw income from continuing operations in its third quarter of $64 million. This translated to $0.07 per share. Still, this beat analyst estimates by $0.03 per share. Adjusted operating income was $225 million in Q1 2016, down from the adjusted operating income of $473 million in the Q4 2015. Again this is no surprise and is a direct result of revenues that dropped markedly. Halliburton's total revenue in the fourth quarter of 2015 was $4.2 billion, compared to $5.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2015. It is also down from $7.0 billion a year ago. Ouch. That said, this missed estimates slightly, by $20 million.So just how did Halliburton get here and beat earnings by this much? Well, it managed to control expenses as best it could and really this the key to survival for this sector right now. Over the last year the company has slashed its expenditures in just about every category. That's really all that matters in the short-run and really what you need to keep an eye on. Commodity pricing is driving revenues, so the bottom line can thus be impacted by watching spending. I want to add that Halliburton recorded company-wide charges related to asset write-offs and severance costs of approximately $378 million, or $0.44 per share, in Q1 2016. It also saw $45 million, or $0.05 per share, of interest expense associated with the $7.5 billion debt issuance in late 2015. Of course that debt issuance will help keep the company funded if this oil downturn lasts for years. The cost of revenuesIt is no surprise that with revenues declining so precipitously that operating income would be hit year-over-year, but the company really did get crushed quarter-over-quarter, relatively speaking. Loss from continuing operations was $2.4 billion or $2.81 per share. This compares to a loss of $28 million, or $0.03 per share. Looking ahead oil is rebounding in the near-term. I expected a terrible quarter. I was not disappointed. Of course it did better than many thought it would. Now that the Baker Hughes deal is off the table we have to get back to basics. We need to watch expenses, production and debt. I maintain a hold rating.Note from the author: Christopher F. Davis has been a leading contributor with Seeking Alpha since early 2012.

3964998,101450,2016-04-13T10:53:15-04:00,"A $34.6 billion deal between HAL and BHI finally ended as antitrust pressures broke the bond.The merger looked to increase the competitiveness of the two firms against the leader in the oil services, SLB.The aggressive M&A behavior shown by HAL and potential $3.5 billion break-up fee to be given to BHI could be an issue.","The mergers and acquisitions line is finally bustling with the news of two large oil services looking to give birth to a larger, more efficient firm that can thrive in a low price environment. Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) and Baker Hughes (BHI) have been in talks regarding a merger for a while now, a deal that could have significant implications for that particular industry.The deal included an offer by Halliburton to buy out its rival for about $34.6 billion, as reported by DealBook. The collision course mapped out will help cut costs by almost $2 billion by meshing together the second- and third-rated operations in the country. By the terms of the deal, Halliburton would ""pay 1.12 of its shares and $19 in cash for each Baker Hughes share ... valued at about $78.62 a share."" In the end, Halliburton would own 64%, with Baker Hughes' leadership left with a 34% minority.The proposal came as no surprise to investors who had begun to feel tension in the oil services industry, as low crude prices significantly reduced demand for new machinery and both firms' ability to compete with Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB), their largest competitor. A year and a half later, the merger looks to be in peril with antitrust officials flashing the red lights.The reasons behind the deal are clear. Halliburton and Baker Hughes have failed to keep up with the impressive performance of their gargantuan rival. Schlumberger is almost twice their size, meaning that a merger would still leave the newly formed corporation in second place in the oil services industry. As far as revenue streams go, the comparison looks a lot favorable for the underdogs. Investors are actually paying less per dollar of revenue in choosing either HAL or BHI vs. SLB ($1.36 or $1.20, vs. $2.62, respectively).The major advantage that SLB has over its two competitors is its margins, which are more than twice as big ($0.20 vs. $0.11 and $0.08). Because of its ability to keep costs low and operate efficiently, SLB has managed to maintain an earnings per share (EPS) well over $1. HAL and BHI, on the other hand, are operating at losses with the latter recording net income losses of almost $2 billion. For that reason, investors are noticing the potential of incredible earnings growth for SLB along with better oil prices. Their ability to run over $2 billion worth of profit bodes well for dividends, making them a safe bet for traders amid uncertainty.Even though all three companies have seen their shares sold off since the beginning of the oil glut, SLB has seen the least loss out of the bunch. The chart above shows the securities' performances against the S&P 500 and their respective losses. Both HAL and BHI saw their shares sold off more than 45% of their girth, while the top oil services company did better by more than 10%.Investors just preferred the large-cap stock, even though its price is twice as high. Its two competitors saw an opportunity to compete when their market and books prices dropped significantly. Halliburton, in particular, has been aggressively pursuing the venture offering to divest billions of dollars' worth of assets in order to satisfy the antitrust force's desire for a third competitor.But despite the apparent rigor of the pursuit, its attempt to pass has been stymied by a lawsuit filed by the Department of Justice under antitrust laws. With the disappearance of a third competitor, the government argues that the oil services industry could experience problems with ""collusion,"" an increased likelihood of ""higher prices,"" and ""less overall economic efficiency."" With the firms already strapped for cash, fighting this judgment would prove to be an expensive path to take. So, yes, investors can look past the deal on to the repercussions. Upon the cancellation, Halliburton will be forced to pay a $3.5 billion break-up fee based on legal negotiations between the two companies, which will benefit Baker Hughes by adding to their cash reserves (as per the OilPrice.com article linked to above).So what does that mean for the oil services industry? It seems clear that most of the large-cap firms are currently shopping for cheap assets to add to their repertoire. With oil prices looking to rebound this year, firms like SLB, HAL, and BHI will be searching for ways to capitalize on the new demand for oil and gas machinery. BHI, with an incoming cash bonus of $3.5 billion, will be looking to bolster their financial position -- whether that's purchasing new assets, buying back stock, or increasing dividends.The rigorous behavior shown by HAL puts them next in line for the proverbial M&A cashier as well. SLB's desire to shop around might be significantly smaller as their focus should be on pushing costs down and driving revenue up to solidify their financial position. The OilPrice.com article linked to above suggested that Weatherford International (WFT) and Franks International (NYSE:FI) could be possible targets for acquisitions. The purchase of either of these two large competitors would be the beginning of a large-scale consolidation in the oil services industry. The longer an environment of depressed oil prices subsists, the more likely and more robust the change will be.Nevertheless, investors should look for some small- or mid-cap oil service firms with high book-to-market-value ratios. These stocks might get boosted by the prospect of purchase when the time comes. At the same time, look for low debt ratios. Companies that are in an ideal debt position will be able to negotiate a better market price for their assets than their debt-filled counterparts. For long-term security, though, SLB is an ideal choice in the oil services industry. HAL and BHI appear to be unable to steal away market share from this behemoth, and will struggle to do so unless they can find ways to maximize earnings potential by boosting their gross profit margins."

Their efforts could create more deal-related fees and take management's time away from managing operations.

A failed deal will result in Halliburton having to pay Baker Hughes a $3.5 billion break-up fee. HAL currently trades at $38.31 or 11x run-rate EBITDA. HAL is off about 15% over the past year, but where will it fall once the deal is officially dead?Including $3.5B Break-Up Fee HAL Is Worth $20Including the $3.5 billion break-up fee ($2.6 billion after-tax) HAL is worth $20 or 48% less than its current value of $38.31.RevenueRevenue of $21.3 billion was used for the valuation.

This builds in a level of optimism as revenue is likely to fall going forward.EBITDAEstimated EBITDA of $3.4 billion is Q3 and Q4 2015 results annualized. The estimated margin is 16%, consistent with the second half of 2016. Halliburton has been able to keep margins in the 16% range through cost cutting, despite the fall in revenue. This could be a challenge if revenue continues to fall going forward.EBITDA MultipleA multiple of 5.0x to 7.0x is appropriate for an industry leader in a cyclical industry in decline.Enterprise ValueThe company's enterprise value (equity and debt) is $23.8 billion.Equity ValueAt year-end 2015 Halliburton had net debt of $4.6 billion. The $3.5 billion break-up fee would be about $2.6 billion after-tax (assumes a 27% tax rate). The break-up fee would increase net debt from $4.6 billion to $7.2 billion.Per Share PriceI assumed 859 million outstanding and diluted shares to derive a share price of about $20.ConclusionHAL currently trades at $38.31. My valuation would be 48% below the current price. The fee is a one-time event and should impact the company's p/e ratio. It would reduce liquidity; net cash would fall from $10.1 billion to $7.5 billion. Once the deal is officially dead and the prospects of $2 billion merger synergies evaporate, HAL may trade closer to its intrinsic value. Avoid the stock."
3967796,33291,2016-04-25T15:32:11-04:00,The Baker Hughes merger is in serious jeopardy of falling through.Halliburton pre-announced Q1 performance on operations and revenues.I discuss the results and the dire unsustainable picture being painted by management.,"After the markets closed and everyone began their weekend Friday, Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) to my surprise hit us with a pre-announcement. This was in my opinion because of a scheduling conflict. Essentially, because the deadline for the Baker Hughes (BHI) merger approaching, which is April 30, 2016, the company pushed its Q1 results call originally scheduled for today April 25, 2016 until Tuesday, May 3, 2016. This is because every hour is critical as this deadline approaches. Remember that the companies both agreed to extend the time period under the merger agreement to obtain regulatory approvals to no later than April 30, 2016. Now, after this deadline, the parties may continue to seek relevant regulatory approvals or either of the parties may terminate the merger agreement. It is critical to note that failure of the merger could hurt Halliburton the most as it will have to burn $3.5 billion in a dealbreaker fee to Baker Hughes.Now, Halliburton could have simply just rescheduled the call on this basis alone and left it there. But I applaud the company for providing some data and I want to discuss the shared results. To no one's surprise, and following the same path that Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) reported, revenues fell heavily year over year thanks to oil prices hitting decade lows to start the quarter. Revenues came in at $4.2 billion, down not only year over year but was a drop of 17% on a sequential basis. Now this reflects a 21% decline in the worldwide rig count. In fact, U.S. rig counts were at record lows and the worldwide rig count is at the lowest level since 1999. That is simply astounding. I will add, however, that these revenues actually beat analyst estimates, but the moral of the story here is that it could get worse before it gets better, just like with what we saw with Schlumberger. Dave Lesar, Chairman and CEO, really put this in perspective. He stated:Look folks that is pretty dire for the short term. Things will get worse before they get better. The company continues to slash costs wherever it can as I predicted in earlier articles. In fact, the company axed another 6,000 jobs in the quarter. As Lesar pointed out, North America has been hit very hard. In fact, rig count was down 27% helping to contribute to a 17% decline quarter over quarter in revenues ($1.8 billion). North America saw an operating loss of $40 million. Internationally, Halliburton saw $310 million in operating income, but revenue was also down on 18% quarter over quarter. What is important to note is that margins have continued to be strong despite pricing declines in the last two years, with margins of 22% for the quarter.But you know, as dire as Lesar's comments were, President Jeff Miller did not mince words. This really caught my attention. He stated:Unsustainable.That is an incredibly strong word. But let me state that Halliburton is doing all it can to survive. The company has examined every single expense from manufacturing to delivery logistics to field operations. Some tough moves had to be made in terms of capital equipment needs, required number of employees and service delivery infrastructure. Over 6,000 more jobs have been lost. In two years, the company has cut its workforce by one-third. That is an astronomical cut. The company has closed over one hundred service points in its delivery infrastructure to save money. In terms of capital equipment, the company has moved to have the most reliable equipment in place to produce oil at the lowest cost per barrel it can. Bottom line, the company is operating as a shell of itself, waiting for the oil rebound. It continues to fight for its Baker Hughes deal, but now that is in serious question. It is a tough time to be in the name, and all eyes need to be on its cost controls and frankly the price of oil.Note from the author: Christopher F.

3967535,31441,2016-04-24T04:07:28-04:00,"Halliburton warned Q1 revenue would be down 17% Q/Q.

Avoid the stock.","Source: Offshore Energy TodayAfter Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) reported a 15% sequential decline in revenue on Thursday, investors were waiting with bated breath for reports from other oilfield services companies. Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) broke the ice Friday when it braced investors for an ugly quarter.Halliburton has reported some dismal earnings results over the past year. The pre-warning caught me off-guard and could portend that 2016 will be worse than expected. I had the following takeaways on the pre-release:North America Rears Its Ugly Head AgainHalliburton warned that total revenue would fall 17% Q/Q, slightly more than the decline experienced by Schlumberger. However, over 40% of the company's revenue is derived from North America versus 25% for Schlumberger. North America became a point of emphasis after Schlumberger's Q1 2015 revenue in the region fell 25% sequentially. According to management, North America reared its ugly head again this quarter:Halliburton has been working with cash flow challenged North American drillers for over a year now. Consistent double-digit declines in North American have taken a toll on the company.Q4 revenue fell 9% Q/Q, while revenue from North America was off 13%. Through mid-December 2015 41 oil & gas companies filed for chapter 11. Deloitte believes another 175 oil & gas companies could go belly up in 2016. At oil prices sub-$50 many shale plays are in financial straits. Many funded their operations with cheap debt after the Financial Crisis of 2008 when oil prices were above $100. They are not having trouble servicing that debt.To stay afloat North American drillers have cut capex and squeezed suppliers like Halliburton, Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI), Schlumberger and Weatherford (NYSE:WFT). Several vendors chasing fewer capex projects have experienced lower profits. If Halliburton is feeling pain in North America then lesser-capitalized vendors like Weatherford and Oil States International (NYSE:OIS) will likely report dismal Q1 results as well.Something has to give. Either shale plays or vendors must be rationalized, or both. However, banks don't want to eat the loss. JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Citigroup, (NYSE:C), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), et. al., are sitting on hundreds of billions of energy debt. In Q1 they helped raise $9 billion for energy names. While investors see the capital raises as a bullish sign, I believe banks are prolonging the inevitable - more bankruptcies in the oil patch.EBITDA MarginsHalliburton's cost-cutting efforts have paid off in spades. EBITDA margins were 19% in Q4 2014 and fell to only 16% in Q4 2015, despite a 40% decline in revenue over that period. How long Halliburton can continue to defy gravity remains to be seen. The company took a $2.1 billion restructuring charge primarily related to asset write-offs and severance costs; it will also cut more than 6,000 jobs.Management suggests that the second half of 2016 could be worse than the first half. At some point revenue and EBITDA margins could both fall -- amplifying the decline in EBITDA. HAL currently trades at over 12x run-rate EBITDA (includes merger break-up fee). If EBITDA falls dramatically the stock could also fall by double-digits.LiquidityIt's almost silly to contemplate that a company with $10 billion of cash on hand could experience liquidity problems. However, the DOJ recently sued to block Halliburton's merger with BHI. That puts the company at risk for a $3.5 billion break-up fee ($2.6 billion after-tax). Recent asset write-offs are likely non-cash, but some of those $2.1 billion restructuring costs could create a large cash outflow. The company also announced it was curtailing operations in Venezuela due to unpaid bills from the state oil company. This follows Schlumberger's decision to reduce exposure to the country. Halliburton has about $700 million in accounts receivable to PDVSA, which if written off, could have a substantial impact on its working capital.In isolation none of these events would be cause for concern. In totality they could create large outflows and cause rating agencies to look askance on the company's liquidity. These potential capital hits and the expected decline in cash flow in the second half of 2016 do not bode well for HAL."
3967533,40351,2016-04-24T03:04:12-04:00,"Halliburton has pre-announced some of its Q1 2016 results.The company managed to deliver a better performance than Schlumberger on most fronts.Interestingly, the heads of Halliburton and Schlumberger have given a similar outlook.The future of Halliburton-Baker Hughes deal continues to look uncertain, even as we approach the April 30 deadline.","Halliburton (NYSE:HAL), one of the world's leading oilfield services companies, pre-announced some of its quarterly results on Friday, delaying the full earnings release and conference call from April 25 to May 3 to make room for the April 30 deadline of closing the Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI) merger. But the partial earnings release still reveals that the Big Red delivered a solid performance in the tough environment, easily outperforming its bigger rival Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) on most fronts.Halliburton hasn't released the net profit or earnings per share figures yet, but the company did say that its first quarter revenues dropped from $7.05 billion a year earlier to $4.2 billion due to further weakness in drilling activity at home and abroad. The revenue was in line with the consensus estimate, according to data polled by FactSet.Halliburton also booked $2.1 billion in charges related to job cuts and asset write-downs. This means that the company's losses will likely expand from Q1-2015 when it took a $823 million one-time charge, related to asset write downs and other items, which led to a net loss of $641 million. Also, there is going to be a significant difference between the company's actual and adjusted earnings numbers.HAL Q1-2016, Revenues and Operating income by geographic regionHalliburton has also released its operating income figures which show that the company swung to a loss of $39 million in North America from a profit of $279 million reported a year earlier. Halliburton, as well as its peer Schlumberger, has been hit hard by weakness in the North American market. Schlumberger reported its quarterly results, which I covered previously, a day ahead of Halliburton in which the world's leading oilfield services company also swung to a pre-tax operating loss of $10 million in North America. That loss had already set a grim tone for Halliburton and other oilfield services companies.We knew that the North America segments of the major oilfield services companies will take a severe beating in the downturn. Here, the drop in drilling activity has been greater as compared to the rest of the world. In North America, the E&P space is dominated by a number of major shale oil producers whereas in international markets, particularly Middle East and Russia, most of the E&P companies pump the low-cost conventional oil. According to the latest data from Baker Hughes , the total number of oil and gas rigs in the US has fallen to just 431 for the week ending April 22, its lowest level on record. Meanwhile, there were just 40 oil and gas rigs operating in Canada. With slumping drilling activity, persistent weakness in E&P expenditure, severe pricing pressure from oil and gas producers, the North America earnings were bound to slip into the red eventually.In this brutal environment, it is more important for oilfield services companies to hold their ground, and one way of gauging this is to compare the revenue drop with the decline in drilling activity. If revenues aren't falling as quickly as the drilling activity, then this means that the oilfield services companies are doing a good job.In the first three months of this year, Halliburton said that the US rig count declined by 27% sequentially while Schlumberger pointed out that the land rig count was down 31%. But Halliburton's North America revenues fell 17% in this period to $1.79 billion, that was not only better than the drop in total US and land rig counts, but also ahead of Schlumberger which posted 25% sequential drop in revenues. On a year-over-year basis, Halliburton's North America revenues fell 49.4% - that was also better than almost 80% decline in rig count and 55% drop in Schlumberger's North America revenues in the corresponding period. In these terms, Halliburton managed to outperform Schlumberger.Outside of North America, where Schlumberger dominates, Halliburton posted 31.5% decline in revenues and 36.6% decline in operating income to $2.4 billion and $310 million respectively. The company's international operating margin clocked in at 12.9%. The decline was led by weakness in pressure pumping services, completion tools sales, drilling services and software sales. Still, the leading oilfield services companies have remained profitable in the international markets where activity hasn't fallen as sharply and pricing pressure has been less severe.In the international markets, Schlumberger pulled off a slightly better performance, with revenues and earnings drop of 28% and 36% respectively.With margins of around 13%, Halliburton (or any other major oilfield services company for that matter) hasn't been as profitable outside of North America as Schlumberger which has been reporting an operating margin of more than 20% from the international markets, even during the down cycle. However, in the first quarter, Schlumberger's international margins slipped by roughly 280 basis points while Halliburton's were down by just 104 basis points.Interestingly, Halliburton's CEO Dave Lesar and Schlumberger's Paal Kibsgaard have given an almost identical outlook.Lesar sees expenditure on drilling and completion services dropping by 50% this year in North America after a 40% decline seen last year. The global spending will decline by 30% this year. Kibsgaard called the current environment the toughest he has seen in the last three decades, and believes the downturn will likely ""get even tougher"" before the market turns. But Halliburton sees a turnaround in the near term, with rig count bottoming in the second quarter followed by a recovery in margins after at least a one-quarter lag. Kibsgaard also believes the market might rebound in 2017.In short, Lesar and Kibsgaard expect the market condition to get worse in the coming quarters before it starts getting any better by as early as the final quarter of this year or next year.Schlumberger, following the completion of Cameron International's acquisition, is positioned to emerge even bigger from the downturn, but Halliburton's fate remains uncertain. The future of the Halliburton - Baker Hughes merger remains doubtful, even though we are just a week away from the closing deadline. The pre-announcement of the first quarter results, however, is a good decision which shows that Halliburton's management wants to focus only on closing the deal within the stipulated date.The two companies could extend the deadline, or announce an even bigger asset sale plan in order to address the anti-trust concerns. Of course, there is always a possibility of the deal falling through, which will likely have a negative impact on Halliburton stock and the company will have to pay the $3.5 billion break-up fees.As a reminder, earlier this month, the US Justice Department moved to block the Halliburton-Baker Hughes merger. This has further heightened the risks surrounding the merger. The European regulators, who have also raised concerns, may give a warning to Halliburton next week on how the deal could hurt competition, according to Reuters. This could exacerbate Halliburton's problem."

When it comes to crude to HAL, the correlation is 95%!So, Q1 is not going to be a pretty one for HAL, say some analysts.

Analysts reporting to Thomson Reuters are pegging a per-share profit of just $0.05, a white-knuckled 90% dive from $0.49 a share a year ago, against a 41% revenue retrenchment to $4.2 billion from $7.1 billion last year.On the conference call, analysts will want to know what expectations are for crude ahead and what's up with the lawsuit filed by the Department of Justice to block its merger with Baker Hughes.Short-term options traders have priced in a potential 4% share price move in either direction around the earnings release, according to the Market Maker Move indicator on the thinkorswim®platform from TD Ameritrade.Options trading has been relatively sparse on HAL going into earnings.

3963838,32971,2016-04-07T13:25:06-04:00,"The Department of Justice used harsh language objecting to the proposed merger.Baker Hughes and Halliburton stocks moved sharply higher in response to DoJ’s press release.Despite Halliburton's likely-to-fail attempt to transform the industry's competitive landscape, the “big three” oilfield service providers retain differentiated position and should enjoy strong margins through the cycle.","Important Note: This article is not an investment recommendation and should not be relied upon when making investment decisions - investors should conduct their own comprehensive research. Please read the disclaimer at the end of this article.As The Merger Is About To Fail, Why Are Halliburton And Baker Hughes Trading Higher?The U.S. Department of Justice finally filed the antitrust lawsuit to block Halliburton's (NYSE:HAL) proposed acquisition of Baker Hughes (BHI). The market's reaction may appear counter-intuitive: on the day of the announcement, the stocks closed 5.9% and 8.8% higher, respectively. Shares of Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB), on the other hand, underperformed the Oil and Gas sector, moving higher by only 0.7%.What is driving investor enthusiasm with regard to Halliburton and Baker Hughes? At the end of the day, it might appear that both companies stand to suffer significant setbacks if the deal falls apart (which now appears to be a near certainty). Halliburton would be saddled with massive merger-related expenses that will amount to nearly $4 billion. Baker Hughes, on the other hand, would receive only a small consolation prize of $3.5 billion (with a dent of merger costs in it) instead of a much larger takeover premium. Most importantly, neither company would be able to benefit from the stronger margins that the consolidated competitive landscape would have awarded them in the event of the merger's success.The simple explanation may be that the downside was fully discounted in the stocks' prices. The DoJ's response is effectively a catalyst for the companies to terminate the merger agreement and pursue their independent business plans, taking additional steps to bring their cost structures in line with the current and expected market conditions. The strong move in oil prices during the trading session, which drove the entire Oil and Gas sector strongly higher Wednesday, also should not be overlooked. That said, there appears to be some downside risk to both stocks after Wednesday's strong upward move.Schlumberger's underperformance relative to the sector is understandable, on the other hand. The favorable competitive environment that Schlumberger has enjoyed thanks to the pending HAL/BHI combination will now end somewhat sooner than some investors might have hoped.The DoJ Harshly Condemns The Merger ConceptIn its complaint, the Department of Justice used strong language to characterize the proposed transaction as anticompetitive and harmful to the industry and consumers. The DoJ alleged that the transaction threatens to eliminate competition, raise prices and reduce innovation in the oilfield services industry. The DoJ argued that in the United States alone the transaction would eliminate important head-to-head competition in markets for 23 products or services used for on- and off-shore oil exploration and production.(Source: The U.S. Department of Justice)In response to DoJ's lawsuit, Halliburton and Baker Hughes issued a joint press release stating that they intend to vigorously contest the DoJ's effort to block their pending merger.Despite the belligerent tenor of the press release, Halliburton has a weak case, in my opinion. The claim that the proposed merger is ""pro-competitive"" raises eyebrows as well as questions with regard to Halliburton being serious in this matter. It should be noted that the U.S. regulatory review may be the least difficult of Halliburton's problems. If the transaction is failing to get regulatory approval in the U.S., one can only imagine the challenge of convincing the regulators in Brazil, Australia and E.U. that the combination is ""pro-competitive."" In contrast to the U.S., Deepwater is much more important in those markets and the ""big three"" oilfield service providers dominate the Deepwater market segment.The situation is strongly complicated for Halliburton by the final deadline in the merger agreement. As permitted under the agreement, Halliburton and Baker Hughes have agreed to extend the time period to obtain regulatory approvals to April 30, 2016. Beyond April 30, 2016, either of the parties may terminate the merger agreement. While the two companies may also elect to continue to seek regulatory approvals beyond April 30, the transaction will be at a high risk of termination by Baker Hughes.A Case Study For Students Of Corporate GovernanceIn the now very likely event that the deal falls apart, Halliburton's shareholders stand to pay a hefty price for a difficult-to-rationalize strategic initiative. In addition to the $3.5 billion anti-trust termination fee to be paid to Baker Hughes, Halliburton will have incurred massive merger-related expenses. Through December 31, 2015, merger-related costs had amounted to $325 million on a pre-tax basis. Significant additional costs are being accrued in 2016. The hidden costs of the disruption to Halliburton's organization and market opportunities lost due to management distraction are difficult to quantify but are certainly present.The initial decision by Halliburton's management and Board to pursue the Baker Hughes combination is truly puzzling, as the deal's non-viability from a regulatory perspective appeared almost obvious from the outset.It is worth noting that the Department of Justice characterized the proposed combination as ""unprecedented"" in term of its anti-competitive nature:The DoJ also commented on Halliburton's proposed remedy whereby the company offered to divest ""a mix of assets extracted from certain business lines of the two companies"" (DoJ's characterization):To anyone even remotely familiar with the competitive landscape of the global oil service industry the regulators' strong objection is probably not a big surprise. In this context, it is difficult to avoid some uncomfortable questions.Wasn't it obvious from the outset that the proposed merger would run against DoJ's guidelines regarding market share concentration in horizontal mergers, in multiple product and service lines? Wasn't it obvious that the transaction would face similar objections in other key jurisdictions, including Australia, E.U. and Brazil? Wasn't it obvious that selective divestitures would not be a cure to the problem?Apparently, the transaction's regulatory risks were obvious to Baker Hughes' Board. Baker Hughes initially resisted Halliburton's overtures and eventually demanded a massive antitrust termination fee as a condition to agreeing to the combination, essentially making the deal a ""tails you win, heads you win"" for its shareholders. In this context, was Halliburton's Board acting prudently when exposing its shareholders to a very large loss in the event of the deal's regulatory failure (which, one might argue, was a very high risk, if not a certainty, from the very beginning)? Furthermore, was it - and is it -appropriate for a major corporation to aggressively push the envelope as it relates to antitrust laws?What was the role and opinion of Halliburton's advisors and lawyers with regard to the proposed transaction's compliance with antitrust laws? How high were the fees paid for the expert advice?Finally, is there any confidence that Halliburton's shareholders will not be again exposed to miscalculated high-magnitude risks and potential massive losses in the future?The Competitive LandscapeAmong the ""big three"" integrated oilfield service providers - Schlumberger, Halliburton and Baker Hughes - Baker Hughes comes out as the biggest winner in the (highly probable) event that the deal falls apart. For Baker Hughes, the game has certainly been worth the candle. The large payoff - at the time when cash is a valuable commodity - would open multiple options for the company, which may include acquisitions at cycle-bottom prices, investments in research and development and more aggressive posture increasing footprint in the most sought-after markets. By the same token, Halliburton would see a large amount of opportunity-creating cash leave its balance sheet.With its windfall profit, Baker Hughes would have a fighting chance of narrowing the competitive gap to the two market leaders, Schlumberger and Halliburton. Baker Hughes' lag is particularly noticeable in North America where the company's business mix is heavier weighted towards commoditized segments (one might recall the acquisition of BJ Services several years ago that increased Baker Hughes' presence in the pressure pumping segment but also created a legacy of low-margin assets).(Source: Schlumberger, December 2015)Overall, the integrated oilfield services segment may become modestly more competitive in the aftermath of the deal coming through, as Baker Hughes would become a stronger #3. That said, the big three integrated oilfield service providers would still remain strongly positioned to generate healthy profits through the cycle, particularly in international markets and with regard to large-scale projects and high-technology products. In those areas, the ""big three"" face little competition from smaller providers, as validly pointed out by regulators in the course of the Baker Hughes-Halliburton merger review.Disclaimer: Opinions expressed herein by the author are not an investment recommendation and are not meant to be relied upon in investment decisions.

This makes the merger much less likely to be consummated- so much so that I think it's fair to operate using a base assumption that the deal is dead, even if that position is not yet official.A key tenet in industrial organization theory is that it takes three strong competitors to make an efficient market. Without three competitors, industries and companies fall prey to problems of tacit collusion, resulting in slowly higher prices and less overall economic efficiency.The HAL/BHI merger was done in by the lack of a third strong competitor. While Halliburton showed a willingness to do whatever it took to get the deal done by agreeing to divest billions of dollars of assets, in the end it was not enough. The problem with the deal was the same problem that drove the need for the merger in the first place; low oil prices.Halliburton and Baker Hughes agreed to the merger on the basis of the need to become more efficient to cope with the new lower oil price environment. That same constraint made very few firms willing to step up and invest the capital necessary to buy the assets Halliburton was selling at any kind of a reasonable price. For the vast majority of OFS firms out there right now, this is a time for caution, not aggressive behavior.That reality became abundantly clear when Weatherford, a prime candidate to become the third strong competitor after the Halliburton-Baker Hughes merger, was forced by its shareholders to drop out of bidding for new assets from Halliburton's divestiture pool. At the end of the day, only GE showed much of a willingness to bid on many of the assets. This in turn led to weak offer prices to Halliburton and led government regulators to question the feasibility of creating a new third competitor.So what comes next for Baker Hughes and Halliburton? In the short-term, both companies will face pressure, but that pressure will be particularly acute for Halliburton, which now owes Baker Hughes a hefty $3.5B break-up fee - certainly a very nice consolation prize for the Baker Hughes and its shareholders. One might suspect that Baker Hughes negotiated that rich breakup fee because it was somewhat skeptical of the deal coming to fruition in the first place. Such fears have been proven sage.Baker Hughes' newly refilled coffers should give the company ammo to buy back a significant portion of its own stock or pay out a special dividend, all without compromising its own balance sheet integrity. That's a big boon for the company's shareholders.All of this assumes that Bakers Hughes gets its break-up fee within a reasonable time frame. Given the financial pressures on Halliburton though, it would not be shocking if it tried to take some sort of legal measure to forestall the payment of that fee. Again $3.5 billion is a big number.Investors in Baker Hughes and Halliburton over the medium-term should do reasonably well. The firms are still part of the triumvirate of premier OFS firms (along with Schlumberger), and while the outlook for oil prices remains bleak now, history suggests these things can shift quickly. After all, in 2013, very few people were talking about oil prices being headed for collapse.None of that means that Halliburton and Baker Hughes shares won't come under pressure - they probably will. But it does mean that shareholders should not reflexively panic. With this deal off the table and both Halliburton and Baker Hughes having new capacity for smaller deals and perhaps an appetite for the same thing, mid-sized OFS firms may become interesting acquisition targets.For instance, Weatherford International and Franks International might both be attractive takeover targets for either Baker Hughes or Halliburton. Finally, it is possible that either Halliburton or Baker Hughes could find themselves the subject of interest from a larger non-competitor that seems to have an interest in entering the space; GE.

3963618,33291,2016-04-06T15:01:40-04:00,A few days ago I told you to beware because it looked like the deal for Halliburton to acquire Baker Hughes was in jeopardy.The US Department of Justice has moved to block the deal.I discuss what we know and what I expect to see.,"A few days ago I told you to beware because it looked like the deal for Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) to acquire Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI) was in jeopardy. Make no mistake it has been an absolute bloodbath in the oil sector, and the pain being real, I have felt the long-term investor could start to add to their positions strategically in the oil service sector, rather than dumping now. Prior to the last few weeks, I felt strongly that the acquisition would go through. Now not so much. Independent of the acquisition, I feel that Halliburton is prepared to battle poor oil prices for the next few years. Of course, with the recent developments I discussed, the outlook for the name could be changing. With the threat of the deal falling through, I urged owners of Halliburton and Baker Hughes to watch the lines closely. Just today, the axe fell and my suspicions were confirmed.We learned that the US Justice Department has indeed filed a civil antitrust suit to block the merger. This news reinforces the insinuations made earlier this week. But why is the Justice Department doing this? Well, they believe that combining the number 2 and 3 oil service companies will essentially crush the competition. Of course, the one powerhouse that comes to mind is Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB). However, the real potential 'victims' would be smaller competitors. It is done to prevent price hikes and maintain the quality of services. This is the point of preventing monopolies, at least, in the spirit of promoting free markets. In a sector like this with multi-billion dollar companies, I think you will not be seeing any 'newcomers', but I digress.So what does this mean? Well, let me first tell you that the companies are going to fight this tooth and nail as it is in both companies' interests to merge. It is quite likely that the merger would lead to reduced costs in the long run and benefit shareholders. The direct impact to competition is beyond the scope of this article and would require a significant analysis (as opposed to a back of the napkin calculation that I could muster but feel it is disingenuous to do so). The point here is that blocking the merger could hurt Halliburton the most as it will have to burn $3.5 billion in a dealbreaker fee to Baker Hughes.Now let us not forget that the antitrust concerns were trying to be avoided by having Halliburton sell off assets. Halliburton was ready to dump $7.5 billion in assets to help do this. But recall that regulators wanted the company to sell around $10 billion in assets, 30% more than Halliburton was prepared to do in order to consider blessing the deal. The filing is a setback. The markets are reacting positively because it generally doesn't like uncertainty, and frankly if the deal falls through, big investors know the individual companies and where they stand. Implementation of a merger creates unknowns. This is why I think the stocks are reacting positively.I want to reiterate that I do not see Halliburton finding buyers for enough of the assets it proposed to sell. Second, those it was proposed to sell did not meet the standards the Justice Department was looking for. What do I mean? Well, in the news announcement for the antitrust suit filing, we learned that:Thus, the Justice Department does not feel that leaving Halliburton and Schlumberger as the dominant players here benefits the sector or customers. It remains to be seen if the deal can be saved. Assuming it is not, Halliburton will have to cough up the $3.5 billion. Baker Hughes will go on to struggle as a company as it is barely treading water with oil prices so low. No doubt, the sector has been decimated. Both Halliburton and Schlumberger are holding their own. Does this mean that Baker Hughes could become a casualty should the deal fall through and oil stays this low for years? There is a possibility. I will argue, though, that optically Halliburton needs this acquisition after all of the energy put into it. A $3.5 billion breakup fee is not small item.

It can ill-afford a deterioration in short-term assets.Avoid Halliburton and Weatherford.","Venezuelan President Nicolas MaduroEarlier this week, Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) announced it was paring back its operations in Venezuela due to slow payments from Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA. Schlumberger receives 3% of its revenue from Venezuela and has over 10% of its receivables in the country. Instead of continuing to work for free, it decided to cease doing work. According to RBC analyst Kurt Hallead, Halliburton (NYSE:HAL), Baker Hughes (BHI) and Weatherford International (WFT) all have outsized exposure to Venezuela, as Bloomberg reports:Each of these firms are struggling to find new sources of revenue. A loss of revenue from Venezuela won't help their causes. Baker Hughes and Schlumberger have the heft to sustain a hit to their balance sheets if accounts receivable deteriorates or is written off. However, I believe Halliburton and Weatherford are the most vulnerable.The SituationVenezuela receives over half its revenues from the sale of oil. It missed the opportunity to diversify its economy when oil prices were above $100. Now the rout in oil prices has punished the country. It borrowed $60 billion from China in exchange for a steady flow of oil; however, China's consumption of oil and other commodities has declined as its own economy has slowed. Venezuela experienced an economic contraction in 2015. Its economy is expected to fall another 6% this year. Schlumberger's move to pare back exposure to the country could pressure competitors to make similar moves.HalliburtonIn addition to its $5.3 billion accounts receivable balance, Halliburton had $10.0 billion of cash on hand at year-end. On the surface, Halliburton has ample liquidity to survive the downturn in the oil & gas industry. However, the DOJ recently sued to block its merger with Baker Hughes; this puts Halliburton on the hook for a $3.5 billion break-up fee ($2.6 billion after-tax) if the deal fails.In isolation, a $700 million write-off of receivables would not be a cause for concern. However, in addition to the $3.5 billion break-up fee, it could have a meaningful impact. Including $14.7 billion of debt, Halliburton has net debt of $4.7 billion. The combined after-tax hit (assumes 27% tax-rate) for the merger fee and potential accounts receivable write-off would be about $3.5 billion, increasing net debt to $8.2 billion. Such a large hit to capital could reduce Halliburton's flexibility on capex and/or acquisitions, and change sentiment towards the stock.WeatherfordWeatherford is struggling under the weight of over $7 billion in debt, which is at junk status. It recently raised $630 million in equity, the lion's share of which is expected to be used to pay down $967 million outstanding on its revolver with JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM). In my opinion, Weatherford is insolvent and could need additional capital to make a $600 million principal payment due in Q2 2017. It had $467 million in cash at year-end. How much liquidity remains after the capital raise, revolver pay down and $400 million principal payment due last month remains to be seen.The next hurdle is for the company to negotiate a renewal of its revolver. This was expected to be completed at the end of Q1. Lenders usually look for short-term liquid assets to back short-term debt. Weatherford's accounts receivable of $1.8 billion are the only liquid assets it has to bargain with. I project receivables will fall to about $1.7 billion at year-end 2016 and the revolver limit will be at some discount to that amount. A potential hit to that receivables balance could reduce the new revolver limit even further.The current revolver limit is $2.25 billion. I project the new limit could be reduced to $415 million to $830 million. The company and bankers have talked up its access to liquidity as a catalyst for the stock. If JPMorgan reduces that liquidity substantially, it could portend a lack of faith in Weatherford's recovery prospects and send the stock lower. A deterioration in the value of receivables from Venezuela could amplify that pain."

A lack of customer support could be a major impediment.Sans the merger, HAL and BHI could fall by double digits. Maybe ValueAct really is providing mullet money.","Jeffrey Ubben of ValueAct. Source: ForbesThe proposed merger between Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) and Baker Hughes (BHI) has received a lot of scrutiny over the past several months. Now the DOJ has added ValueAct Capital to the soap opera, suing the hedge fund for an antitrust violation:This has to be the oddest antitrust lawsuits I have ever seen. I have been pessimistic on the merger, and predicted that both BHI and HAL would plummet once the deal was not approved. In October I questioned whether ValueAct was providing mullet money, or ""dumb money"" with its investment in BHI. Even I could not have foreseen that the hedge fund would have failed to disclose major stakes in both companies, as the DOJ has claimed.The SituationHalliburton and Baker Hughes have trumpeted additional customer efficiencies and cost savings from the deal. However, It would not be unheard of for an investor to attempt to reduce competition by merging the numbers two and three companies in a particular field. With ValueAct reportedly playing a major role behind the scenes, the picture is starting to become a little more clear.ValueAct says it will fight the lawsuit, but it does not appear to have a leg to stand on. This isn't subjective. Either it owned a 10% stake in both HAL and BHI or it did not; either it has taken an active role in the merger or it has not. In November ValueAct disclosed [i] it had discussions with both Halliburton and Baker Hughes pursuant to the merger and [ii] Halliburton would do whatever was necessary to achieve antitrust approval. I was stumped by the entire scenario. Why was ValueAct involved and how could it project itself into the deal? Secondly, why would the management teams of BHI and HAL allow ValueAct to have any role, especially a highly-publicized one. Lastly, was management leading the deal or ValueAct?Who Does The Merger Benefit?Several authors and bloggers have written about the proposed merger. Most of the narrative has been around the amount of money arbitrageurs and hedge fund managers stood to make if the transaction was consummated. The benefits to customers was hardly ever mentioned, if at all. Since the Financial Crisis of 2008 it has appeared that the financial markets only existed in order to cater to hedge funds. By creating record low interest rates and providing liquidity to financial markets, the Fed created a ""wealth effect"" by front-loading stock market gains. In turn, hedge funds have made a mint by ""betting with the Fed.""On my previous article I opined HAL's CEO, Dave Lesar, was catering more to hedge fund managers than customers:My thesis was that if the deal was not in the best interest of customers or in the long-term interests of shareholders, it likely would not receive regulatory approval. Regulators from Australia to Brazil to the EU have questioned [i] whether the transaction would lead to less competition in the oilfield services space and/or [ii] whether higher prices would ensue. Even more damning is that Angola's state oil company, Chevron Brazil and Total (NYSE:TOT) SA's CEO have all complained about the merger. A lack of support from customers makes the transaction even more unlikely.Sans the merger, I believe HAL and BHI will both decline to the $25 range; that represents a 23% and 33% fall for HAL and BHI, respectively. Facing double-digit investment losses and a $19 million lawsuit, maybe ValueAct really is the mullet."
3961187,93176,2016-03-27T14:13:54-04:00,"Halliburton posted share price appreciation of 19% in less than two months.The principle of buying low and selling high clearly applies to HAL.The company’s business fundamentals are not improving, despite the boost in oil prices.Production talks and falling rig activity could negatively impact its future performance.","Halliburton Co (NYSE:HAL) has been strongly affected by its environment for the past 18 months, most notably by the historic drop of 70% in oil prices. The company's share price and financial performance have stumbled dramatically in front of a collapsing energy sector. Its share price plunged from $50 a share down to $27 on Feb 11, the lowest price for Halliburton since the days of the Great Depression.On the financial front, low oil prices slashed Halliburton's sales by more than 42% in the final quarter of last year. Low oil prices have significantly threatened U.S. producers because of their higher production costs. The majority of U.S. oil producers require $55 a barrel just to maintain equilibrium. Almost across the board, these companies posted historic losses for last year. This now has them scrambling to conserve cash for their own survival.American producers have slashed their planned investments by over 40% in the past year. They are expected to trim them beyond 40% for this year. While HAL has an extensive global footprint, nearly half of its sales come from its North American Operations. Halliburton's operations in North America plunged by 54%, down to $2.16B by the end of the most recent quarter. This represents its steepest fall in the past several years.After hitting bottom at $26 a barrel on Feb 11, oil prices have rebounded steadily thanks to production talks, falling rig activities and reduced investments in future projects by many producers. Oil has gained more than 50%, less than 2 months after reaching a thirteen-year low. The rally has provided significant support to fumbling oil companies, rescuing the stock performance of many. Accordingly, HAL's stock price has soared by nearly 19% since Feb 11.Is It A Sell?Here the question arises whether the company's stock - rallying by 19% from its 52-week low of $27 a share - is now offering a selling opportunity. In my view, yes. This is a big opportunity for short-term value investors who bought this stock on the recent lows. The principle of buying low and selling high perfectly applies in HAL's case. I'm not expecting Halliburton's share price to see another gain of 19% any time soon.There are several reasons for this negative expectation. Oil prices started to recover as soon as Russia and Saudi Arabia announced their intention to freeze their outputs at January levels. Thirteen additional major oil producers have since jumped on board, also proclaiming their intent to freeze production in order to support oil prices. They will likely all be in on an April 17th meeting in Doha, to further discuss production levels.I have additional reservations. Despite these initiatives to freeze output levels, oil traders are still showing concern over U.S. oil production. Based on EIA reports, U.S. crude stockpiles increased almost 9.4 million barrels in the past week, exceeding the American Petroleum Institute's expectation of 8.8 million-barrels.Experts now believe that U.S. producers may well enhance their production to take advantage of the recovery in crude prices. U.S. oil companies have the potential to drill at $40 per barrel and above. In Eagle Ford and the Permian Basin alone, more than 600 wells are awaiting completion, holding a production potential of 100,000 to 300,000 barrels a day. Therefore, traders are expecting oil prices to hover around $40 a barrel as higher prices could spur on increased production.This is not good news for Halliburton's financial performance. The output freeze means low drilling and rigging activities in the near future, at a time when HAL's revenue generation is entirely dependent on the activity level of oil producers. In addition, rig counts have been falling at a significant rate for the past three months, negative news for any oil field services company. Recently, Baker Hughes Inc (BHI) reported that oil rigs drills in the U.S. had dropped by 15 in one week, falling to a seven-year low of 372.In ConclusionI believe that HAL's share price has already gained considerable appreciation on bullish sentiments without showing any physical change in fundamentals. Oil prices are unlikely to move forward from existing levels, as this could provoke greater oil production. In addition, drilling and production activities could fall further amid production talks and falling rig counts. Consequently, the company's financial performance and its backlog may well decline at a higher rate this year than in 2015."
3963020,33291,2016-04-04T15:08:53-04:00,"I've been watching and covering Halliburton for some time and the Baker Hughes deal has been a long ongoing process.Today, we learned the deal may be in real jeopardy.Independent of the deal, which if it falls through will lead to management shakeups, we need to continue to watch expenses.","I have been watching and covering Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) for some time as well as its rival Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB). That said, both oil service stocks are very similar in many respects. I had most recently covered Halliburton and told you the one thing you needed to watch. Make no mistake it has been an absolute bloodbath in the oil sector, and the pain being real, I have felt the long-term investor could start to add to their positions strategically, rather than dumping now. This is because I saw strong merger and acquisition opportunities, and further, I saw too much upside potential relative to downside fears even if the oil glut was prolonged. I feel that Halliburton (and Schlumberger for that matter) is prepared to battle poor oil prices for the next few years. Of course, the one deal that I constantly cited was the pending Baker Hughes (BHI) acquisition. In my last article, I simply said:Well, today there was a terrible development on this front. We learned that Halliburton has made one last push to try and save the acquisition. Now, the big issue here is antitrust concerns. In order to avoid the antitrust concerns, Halliburton was ready to dump $7.5 billion in assets. But now, regulators want the company to sell around $10 billion in assets, 30% more than Halliburton was prepared to do. However, the Department of Justice, according to the Post article, has not made a decision, but is leaning against the deal.This is a major setback. If this deal falls through, and it may very well, then Halliburton will have to pay a massive $3.5 billion breakup fee to Baker Hughes. This is equal to 10% of Halliburton's $30 billion market cap. What is more, if the Feds don't act by the end of the month, then Baker Hughes can simply walk away, and still collect the $3.5 billion.The problem here is two-fold. At this point, with oil prices so low, it's tough to find buyers for these assets. Secondly, with time running short, Baker Hughes could take the quick $3.5 billion. If the deal falls through, expect extreme shareholder dissent. I would expect the CEO to be out of a job personally. If not fired - then a swift resignation and reshuffling of the leadership.No doubt, the sector has been decimated. All one has to do is look at any 6-, 12- or 18-month chart of the trading activity. Nothing but red will be found. In its most recent quarter, the company saw income from continuing operations in its third quarter of $270 million. This translated to $0.31 per share. For those paying attention, this income is flat from Q3 2015 which saw $265 million, or $0.31 per share. Adjusted operating income was $473 million in Q4 2015, down from the adjusted operating income of $506 million in Q3 2015. Halliburton's total revenue in the fourth quarter of 2015 was $5.1 billion, compared to $5.6 billion in the third quarter of 2015. Of course, this is down significantly year over year, but the company is surviving with our without Baker Hughes' assets.Halliburton needs this acquisition after all of the energy put into it. A $3.5 billion breakup fee is not small item. With or without the acquisition, looking ahead there is no sign that oil is going to rebound in the near term. However, considering what has happened in the sector, Halliburton is doing very well. I was impressed with the quarter-over-quarter results given oil has gone nowhere but down pricewise. The pain is real, especially if you are watching the value of your investment decline quarter after quarter. Right now, aside from watching the expenses, all eyes need to be on this deal with Baker Hughes.Note from the author: Christopher F.

3963189,32971,2016-04-05T07:39:39-04:00,"The BHI/HAL deal spread has spiked to the highest level since the merger announcement.The spread implies a low probability of the transaction coming to fruition.April 30, 2016 is a deadline in the merger agreement that may require corporate action or may become a catalyst for the merger termination.","Important Note: This article is not an investment recommendation and should not be relied upon when making investment decisions - investors should conduct their own comprehensive research. Please read the disclaimer at the end of this article.Eighteen months after the initial announcement of the merger between Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) and Baker Hughes (BHI), investors appear to have finally arrived at a realization that the transaction is unlikely to receive necessary approvals. The deal arbitrage spread, which reflects the market's assessment of the merger's success, today spiked to a level that implies an approximately one-fifth chance of the deal closing, based on my estimate.What Are The Scenarios? - Let's Ask Mr. Deal SpreadAs a reminder, a market-neutral merger arbitrage position would consist of buying 1 BHI share and simultaneously selling 1.12 HAL shares short.A long position in such a pair is a bet that the deal would eventually close and the investor would receive a payoff equal to the deal's cash component, or $19 per BHI share. The expected net profit on this trade is equal to the ""deal spread"" which is calculated as a difference between the current price of 1.12 HAL shares plus $19 on one hand and the price of one BHI share on the other.If the spread is trading close to zero, one could interpret such a situation as the market expecting that the deal will close with a high probability - the low closing risk results in a thin payoff. A wide positive spread, on the other hand, likely indicates a reduced probability of the deal reaching fruition. A negative spread likely indicates an expectation of competing bids for the target.For example, investors who initiated the BHI/HAL arbitrage position precisely one year ago, when the spread was trading at $4.60, were effectively expecting to make ~4.0% return on their initial capital commitment within less than eight months.Based on today's intraday prices, the spread widened to ~$16.40 per BHI share, effectively reflecting investors' pessimism with regard to the deal going through.To derive the probability of the merger's success implied in the two stocks' current prices, it might be helpful to look at the deal spread over a longer time frame. Tracking the same spread prior to the transaction's announcement in November 2014, one can see that BHI's stock underperformed HAL's stock during the first ten months of 2014 (the trend is depicted by the blue dashed trend line on the graph below). The underperformance reflected Baker Hughes's weaker operating margins, on one hand, and Halliburton's continued success in strengthening its position in international markets, on the other. The strong ""currency"" gave Halliburton additional leverage to make a bid for Baker Hughes.Let's assume, for illustration, that in the absence of the merger, the underperformance would have continued and the pre-announcement spread would have reached $30-$35 range by this point. Assuming the two companies terminate the merger at the end of April, one may expect that the stocks will return to that pre-announcement relationship between the two stock prices.However, it is important to take into consideration the effect of the regulatory termination fee of $3.5 billion that Halliburton would pay to Baker Hughes. The fee amounts to over $8 per share positive impact for Baker Hughes's stock and a ~$4 per share negative impact for Halliburton's stock. I also estimate that merger-related costs have had a net negative impact of ~$1 per share per HAL share. Based on this illustrative calculation, if the transaction were to fall apart, the spread would widen to ~$16.50-$26.50 per share.The payoffs on the arbitrage position would look as follows:Comparing these payoffs, the probability of success implied by the stocks' current prices appears to be in the 0%-38% range, or around 20% at the midpoint.The estimation is obviously illustrative, as it is difficult to make a good guess of each risk arbitrageur's view on the two stocks' trading levels if the merger is terminated. However, it is clear that investors' confidence in the deal's success has eroded.Disclaimer: Opinions expressed herein by the author are not an investment recommendation and are not meant to be relied upon in investment decisions.

3961136,31441,2016-03-27T05:30:49-04:00,Total S.A. CEO Pouyanne believes the Halliburton-Baker Hughes merger will result in less competition.The merger has faced a groundswell of opposition from regulators in Australia to Brazil and Europe.I HAL could prove the merger would benefit customers it could potentially help its cause.Total's opposition could be the unkindest cut of all.,"Total CEO Patrick Pouyanne. Source: ReutersThe merger between Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) and Baker Hughes (BHI) was announced with much fanfare. Over a year later oil prices are sub-$50, the global economy is in shambles and the deal is receiving a cool reception from regulators. Now oil giant Total S.A. (NYSE:TOT) CEO Patrick Pouyanne may have knifed the deal:HAL closed down over 2% to $35 while BHI was off over 3% to 45. BHI now trades at a 22% discount to its implied merger value of $58, indicative of how uncertain traders are that the deal will get done. For months after the deal was announced in November 2014 the discount was 10% or less.The SituationThe proposed merger between the numbers two and three oilfield services companies has faced a groundswell of opposition. In October the Australia Competition and Consumer Commission (""ACCC"") raised an issue that the merger could create coordinated behavior post-deal. In November Jefferies threw shade over potential concerns the deal might reduce competition at the upper end of the oil services market. I found it unusual in that investment banks are typically bullish on stocks and potential deals, and saw it as a clear sign the merger was in trouble.Regulators have a point. Halliburton is already offering price concessions in certain sectors of the North American land drilling market. Halliburton, Baker Hughes and Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) have the heft to provide concessions that lesser-capitalized companies like Weatherford International (WFT), C&J Energy Services (CJES) or Oil States International (NYSE:OIS) may not. Halliburton has intimated it is willing to engage in asset sales (beyond those required by the DOJ) in order to get the merger approved. The question remains, ""Can Halliburton ensure it will not disrupt the competitive balance in every product, in every market?""Total -- The Unkindest Cut Of All?The oil price rout has hurt oil drillers as well as oilfield services companies. Though price concessions could help drillers in some markets, rising prices due to outsized power by Halliburton or Schlumberger could potentially punish drillers in others. By convincing regulators that the deal is in the best interest of customers, Halliburton could potentially sway regulators. However, Halliburton would need the endorsement of customers to make that argument.Instead, big oil is complaining to regulators. Angola's state oil producer and Chevron Brazil have both complained that the tie-up could raise prices or in some cases, result in a reduction services. Having Total, one of the six supermajor oil companies, throw stones at the deal in such a public way caught my attention. It probably caught the attention of the regulators as well. In my opinion, Total's opposition is the ""unkindest cut of all.""Other ImpedimentsOther impediments also exist. The companies most likely to become a strong number three player to replace Baker Hughes are struggling. Both Weatherford and C&J Energy are facing liquidity strain and struggling to repay debt amassed when oil prices were much higher. The fact that a strong number three might not be able to help maintain demand/supply dynamics gives credence to Pouyanne's claims of ""less competition.""The European Commission recently stopped the clock on reviewing the merger. Apparently, Halliburton did not include key information in its review package requested by the EU. The EU delayed the merger in March and July of last year as well. The companies have given a self-imposed deadline of April 30th to close the transaction. When the EU review will be re-started and if it can be completed before April 30th remains to be seen. If the April 30th deadline is breached and the companies continue pursuing the merger it could make Halliburton and Baker Hughes look desperate. To throw out a deadline and not stick to it could embolden regulators to make even more demands.Ultimately, nobody thought the tie-up was a good idea except for HAL, BHI and a few hedge fund managers looking for a quick score. If the deal is deemed to potentially hurt competition, and more customers balk it likely won't get approved. I have a price target in the mid-$20s for both companies (sans the merger) which would make HAL and BHI overvalued by 29% and 44%, respectively. Investors should continue to avoid both stocks."
3961258,32971,2016-03-28T05:48:09-04:00,"The proposed divestitures do not seem to be a cure to the concerns expressed by antitrust regulators in several key jurisdictions.Merger-related expenses continue to accumulate at a rapid clip, while the limbo is a disruption for both companies.Given the high non-approval risk, it may be in the best interest of Halliburton’s shareholders to abandon the poorly conceived deal now.","Important Note: This article is not an investment recommendation and should not to be relied upon when making investment decisions - investors should conduct their own comprehensive research. Please read the disclaimer at the end of this article.Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) and Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI) announced the agreement to merge in November 2014. At the time of the announcement, the two companies expected that the transaction would close within approximately a year. Several months past the initial deadline in the merger agreement, the two companies are nowhere close to having received the most important regulatory approvals. Moreover, there are strong reasons to doubt that such approvals can be obtained. In the meantime, merger-related costs continue to accumulate at a rapid clip. In 2015 alone, Halliburton recorded $308 million of costs related to the proposed deal.A Questionable Merger ConceptTo date, the proposed merger has received regulatory clearances in Canada, Colombia, Ecuador, Kazakhstan, Russia, South Africa and Turkey. However, it does not take an antitrust lawyer to figure out that the deal is struggling in the most important jurisdictions and there is no guarantee that the necessary approvals will be granted.In December, Brazil's antitrust regulators found that Halliburton's planned tie-up with Baker Hughes is likely to fuel higher prices in Brazil. The review was turned over to the agency's tribunal to issue the final ruling on the merger. The standard timeframe for review is 240 days after notification, although that timeframe can be extended for another 90 days. This puts the deadline for the tribunal's ruling at the very earliest in August 2016, and possibly as late as November 2016.In January, after performing preliminary investigation, the EU Commission indicated ""serious potential competition concerns in more than 30 product and service lines, both offshore and onshore."" The Commission emphasized particular concerns with regard to the merger's impact on competition in tenders and in innovation. (The Commission's press release is provided in Appendix A at the end of this note.) The regulators are undertaking a full review. In March, the review process was suspended for the second time in two months due to incomplete information on file. While the suspension is technical in nature (and reflects the review's complexity and cost), it extends the Commission's response deadline by another 20 business days, pushing it at least into August 2016. Halliburton and Baker Hughes stated in their press release that they are ""working to provide the additional information as expeditiously as possible.""Source: The European CommissionIn Australia, the antitrust regulator expressed concerns that ""the proposed acquisition may create conditions that would facilitate coordinated behavior in the market."" The regulator was particularly concerned in relation to the supply of complex or high-risk projects, such as off-shore drilling projects. (The ACCC's Statement of Issues is provided in Appendix B.) The initial December 17, 2015 deadline for a regulatory ruling was postponed to give Halliburton time to provide additional information and give the regulators time to review new information. On March 10, the regulator stated that it is ""assessing a large amount of information. The timeline will be updated with a proposed decision date in due course.""Halliburton was equally unable to receive an antitrust clearance in the U.S. by the December 15 deadline. The review is still pending and the timeline is unclear at this point.The delays in receiving regulatory approvals is the least of the challenges the proposed transaction is facing. The fundamental issue is obviously the concern that the proposed combination would significantly reduce competition in the oil service market, particularly as it relates to large scale projects and high-technology products. While Halliburton has done everything possible to keep the process going, the anti-competitive nature of the proposed combination may simply be impossible to mitigate, regardless of the time spent in review.Indeed, let's take a look at the competitive landscape in the global oil service industry. It includes ""three-and-a-half"" major integrated global providers who dominate several important segments of the market. It is hard to imagine how an acquisition of the third largest player by the second largest player would not create a dominant duopoly of two mega-majors in those segments. Partial divestitures proposed by Halliburton do not appear to be an adequate remedy, even remotely.The decision by Halliburton's management and Board to pursue a questionable combination - which from the outset appeared to challenge basic antitrust principles and market share thresholds - is a major puzzle and a case study for students of corporate governance. Even more puzzling was Halliburton's decision to fully underwrite the risk of a failed transaction with a giant $3.5 billion antitrust termination fee, on top of the acquisition premium and massive merger-related costs.The Clear And Present DangerWhile regulatory reviews often stay out of the public eye, in some cases process can become intense and involve many interfering parties. The biggest threat can be customer objections. This seems to be the case with the proposed Halliburton-Baker Hughes merger.As part of their probe, regulators receive or solicit feedback from customers, competitors and other interested parties. If customers' interests are impacted by the merger, objections can be quite forceful, even if customers abstain from public comments for business relationship reasons. Moreover, a case can be made that managements of publicly traded companies have a duty to their own shareholders to interfere and object to a proposed merger by two key suppliers if there are reasons to believe that the combination would lead to increased supply chain costs due to less competition.So what customer category is the most likely to interfere? I would argue that the proposed HAL/BHI combination is likely to cause fierce objections from the most powerful customer groups - Oil Majors and National Oil Companies.I would argue that not all of Halliburton's and Baker Hughes' customers will be impacted by the merger to the same degree. In areas where most oilfield services and products are commoditized and highly competitive - such as U.S. onshore, for example - customers may not see much threat to their supply chain prices. However, in certain other areas, such as global mega projects and deepwater, competition may be substantially reduced by the proposed merger. Those areas are dominated by Oil Majors, such as Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), Chevron (NYSE:CVX), Total (NYSE:TOT) and BP plc (NYSE:BP) and National Oil Companies, such as Petrobras (NYSE:PBR) and Sonangol.During the current downcycle in oil, deepwater and long lead-time mega projects have been among the hardest hit, forcing some big companies to exit or scale back their investment. Examples would be ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) and Marathon Oil (NYSE:MRO) who have decided to exit deepwater exploration and Chevron who announced reduced capital allocation to deepwater in favor of shorter-cycle, lower-cost shale projects.Given that deepwater and mega projects remain central to many Oil Majors' and National Oil Companies' business, these companies have a strong vested interest in maintaining adequate competition in their supply chains. In contrast to smaller E&P independents, the Majors and NOCs tend to be very large companies who have legal resources, regulatory experience and government relations to be able to influence the outcome of the Halliburton-Baker Hughes antitrust reviews. It is hard to imagine that these companies would passively observe how the cost structure in some of the most critical parts of their business is being re-set to a higher level, putting them at an even greater disadvantage in the global competition.Customer objections sometimes become public. For example, last week's article by Bloomberg quotes Total SA CEO Patrick Pouyanne's view on the proposed combination between Halliburton and Baker Hughes as leading to ""less competition."" Specifically, the article quoted Mr. Pouyanne as saying:The last part of the comment appears to indicate that Total is an interfering party or commenter in antitrust reviews, possibly in multiple jurisdictions.Customer objections came very clear in the filings with Brazil's Administrative Council for Economic Defense, or CADE, the country's antitrust regulator. Chevron Brazil stated in its filing that the merger could reduce the number of large service providers for certain products for drilling and completing wells available to customers in Brazil, such as completion tools and cementing services, to two from three. Sonangol also stated in its filing with CADE that the merger would reduce services offered in Brazil and result in price increases. The file also includes statements from BP and Total which are confidential.Based on its initial review, CADE concluded that the deal would bring together two major local suppliers of products and services, pointing out that Petrobras is their largest client in Brazil. Given Brazil's massive state ownership in Petrobras and the company's importance to national interests, it is difficult to imagine that the merger can be approved if the tribunal sees a risk of increased costs for Petrobras.CADE stated that ""the transaction's approval in the way it was presented could result in price increasing in several markets and reduction of innovation incentives, which would directly impact Brazilian oil and gas sector.""The Deal Spread Continues To WidenWhile the antitrust concern appeared obvious from the outset, in my opinion, traders and the financial community were remarkably sanguine with regard to the deal's risks, as one can see from the BHI/HAL ""deal spread."" For an extended period of time in 2015, the spread traded below $5 per BHI share, as compared to the current $13-$14 level. While at $5, the spread was quite wide by risk arbitrage standards, it nonetheless reflected an expectation of the deal closing with a roughly 80% probability, based on my estimate.The market started to discount the dangers only half a year later, after it became clear that preliminary reviews did not deliver approvals.Despite all the apparent concerns, the deal spread still reflects a roughly one-third probability of the transaction eventually going through, based on my estimate. Please note that the $3.5 billion antitrust termination fee amounts to over $8 per share positive impact for Baker Hughes stock and a ~$4 per share negative impact for Halliburton stock.Is It Time To Cut Losses?Given the nature of the concerns publicly stated by the regulators in the European Union, Australia and Brazil, the limited divestitures proposed by Halliburton are unlikely to be the answer to the issues. Moreover, limited additional divestiture would not provide the answer either. Therefore, chances of the proposed combination receiving the necessary approvals are low, in my opinion.Even if approvals could be obtained, their cost - in the form of required major divestitures - would defeat the purpose of the merger and would be too high for Halliburton to accept.Another challenge is the ability to find buyers for the assets at reasonable prices which cannot be taken for granted in the current commodity price environment. Halliburton is effectively attempting to purchase a giant asset package at a premium but is forced to put on the auction block more and more assets at a time when the market environment for divestitures is unfavorable. At some point, these ""value scissors"" may make the transaction economically prohibitive.Halliburton may be facing a difficult choice between abandoning the poorly conceived deal concept now or continuing to fight the expensive uphill battle for another several months, with a very high likelihood of having to abandon the deal then. The latter alternative also has a less visible but still substantial cost of stress on Halliburton's organization due to the deal's uncertainty.A case can be made, therefore, that it is in the best interest of Halliburton's shareholders to avoid additional cash losses and move on with a standalone business plan.For in-depth data and analysis of commodity fundamentals, please consider subscribing to Zeits OIL ANALYTICS.APPENDIX A: European Commission Press ReleaseMergers: Commission opens in-depth investigation into acquisition of oilfield service provider Baker Hughes by HalliburtonBrussels, 12 January 2016The European Commission has opened an in-depth investigation to assess whether the proposed acquisition of oilfield service supplier Baker Hughes by rival Halliburton would impede effective competition in breach of the EU Merger Regulation.Both companies are US-based.Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, in charge of competition policy, said: ""The Commission has to look closely at this proposed takeover to make sure that it would not reduce choice or push up prices for oil and gas exploration and production services in the EU. Efficient exploration and production of oil and gas resources within the EU form an important element of our Energy Union strategy in terms of ensuring security of supply.""The takeover would bring together the world's second and third largest oilfield service suppliers, thus eliminating one of the three current main global competitors (i.e. Halliburton, Baker Hughes and market leader Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB)). The opening of an in-depth inquiry does not prejudge the final result of the investigation. The Commission now has 90 working days, until May 26, 2016, to take a final decision.Halliburton and Baker Hughes supply a broad range of tools and services for drilling and evaluation as well as completion and production of oil and gas wells. Both areas include a wide range of specific product and service lines, namely:Oilfield service markets are characterised by high technological and financial barriers to entry, leading to a market with only four globally active competitors with extensive portfolios: Halliburton, Baker Hughes, Schlumberger and to a lesser extent Weatherford (WFT).The Commission's preliminary investigation indicated serious potential competition concerns in more than 30 product and service lines, both offshore and onshore. In particular, the investigation revealed that Halliburton and Baker Hughes seem to be close competitors, both in terms of tenders and in innovation.Competition regarding tendersCompetition from smaller suppliers is limited in tendering proceedings, due to the importance of quality and reputation, especially for offshore projects. The Commission's preliminary view is that the conditions of competition differ in tenders for projects taking place offshore as compared to onshore due to greater complexity, more challenging conditions and higher running costs for offshore operations.The investigation also revealed that only three suppliers are currently able to provide integrated services that run across many product and service lines, namely Halliburton, Baker Hughes and Schlumberger. The ability to offer such integrated solutions represents a significant competitive advantage, for cost saving reasons in particular. Therefore, the transaction would reduce the number of integrated service providers from three to two, which may lead to less choice and potentially higher prices for customers. Barriers to entry are particularly high for integrated services as a new supplier would need to enter (or expand into) a large number of product and service lines to be able to compete in tenders.Competition regarding innovationThe Commission is concerned that a reduction of the number of competitors could reduce the incentive to innovate, especially given that Halliburton and Baker Hughes currently compete fiercely with each other in developing new products.The Commission will now investigate the proposed acquisition in-depth to determine whether these initial concerns are justified.Given the worldwide scope of the companies' activities, the Commission is cooperating closely with several competition authorities, including the US Department of Justice.The transaction was notified to the Commission on 27 November 2015.More information will be available on the competition website, in the Commission's public case register under the case number M.7477.APPENDIX B: The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission - Statement Of IssuesACCC releases SOI on proposed acquisition of Baker Hughes by Halliburton23 October 2015The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has released a Statement of Issues on the proposed acquisition by Halliburton Company (Halliburton) of Baker Hughes Incorporated (Baker Hughes).""The ACCC's preliminary view is that the proposed acquisition is likely to raise competition concerns in a number of markets for the supply of oilfield goods and services,"" ACCC Chairman Rod Sims said.Halliburton and Baker Hughes are close competitors across a broad range of oilfield goods and services in Australia, and in many countries around the world.""The ACCC is concerned that the acquisition would result in the merged entity being one of only a small number of suppliers that could service the relevant markets. The ACCC is particularly concerned in relation to the supply of complex or high-risk projects, such as off-shore drilling projects,"" Mr. Sims said.""The ACCC is concerned that the merger parties are two of the 'big 3' global oilfield services providers. These businesses have significant competitive advantages in providing services as they benefit from extensive product ranges, economies of scale and scope, large R&D budgets and significant industry experience.""The ACCC also considers that the proposed acquisition may create conditions that would facilitate coordinated behaviour in the market,"" Mr. Sims said.The merger parties are the second and third largest oilfield services providers, both globally and in Australia. The fourth largest service provider, Weatherford, has a smaller share of supply and offers a narrower range of goods and services than Halliburton or Baker Hughes.The ACCC is inviting further submissions from the market in response to the Statement of Issues by 12 November 2015. As a result, the ACCC's final decision will be deferred until 17 December 2015.The proposed acquisition is also being considered by competition authorities in a number of jurisdictions, including the US, the European Union, India and China.Disclaimer: Opinions expressed herein by the author are not an investment recommendation and are not meant to be relied upon in investment decisions.

3880656,93176,2016-02-09T18:04:58-05:00,"Halliburton's business fundamentals are not improving.The company could face more losses this year.It is a buy, but only for the long-term investors.","Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) has been experiencing significant headwinds over the past couple of quarters. The company's stock is falling at a high rate due to low oil prices and poor financials. HAL's share price lost nearly 27% of its value over the past 12 months. Since the start of this year, its stock price declined by an additional 7% and more. Its shares are trading near its 52-week low of $27.64 per share. Here the question arises, does the principle of buying on the dip apply to Halliburton?I believe it does, but only for the long-term patient investor. The company's business fundamentals are bleak for the short term. Halliburton has been posting poor results over the past three consecutive quarters. Recently, it announced results for the final quarter of fiscal 2015. In Q4, it generated revenues of around $5 billion, which represent a significant drop from $8.7 billion in the same quarter of last year. The company's revenue also declined 9% in the fourth quarter compared with the third quarter of 2015.For fiscal 2015, HAL's revenue of $23.6 billion represents a 28% drop, when compared to its $32.8 billion of revenue from last year. On the earnings side, HAL reported a continuing operations loss of $666 million, or $0.78 per diluted share, compared to last year's income of $3.4 billion, or $4.03 per diluted share. These numbers are definitely not pleasing to investors, nor are they encouraging to the company's management.HAL's cash flow situation is declining steadily, along with its fall in earnings. In fiscal 2015, the company generated operating cash flows of nearly $2.9 billion while its capital expenditures stood around $2.1 billion. Its free cash flows of $722 million are adequately covering its dividend payments of $614 million, which means the company's dividends are still safe. Its liquidity situation is also strong with assets of over $15 billion and its current liabilities remain low, at approximately $5.3 billion.What's Next?The question here is, what's next for the company this year? I believe that Halliburton's financial performance will decline even further in 2016. The company's revenue base is directly dependent on activity in the oil & gas industry. At the moment, the data are not encouraging for this industry. Many E&P and oil companies have posted major losses over the latest quarter and for fiscal 2015. For instance, ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) posted a loss of $4.4 billion in fiscal 2015. Even majors like Chevron (NYSE:CVX), Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) and BP (NYSE:BP) have posted significant losses for the past year.In fiscal 2015, these companies on average have lowered their investments around 40% compared to 2014. After posting significant losses, they have now cut their capital investments nearly in half for fiscal 2016.In addition, oil prices are showing no signs of stabilization this year. The EIA has predicted oil prices to stay around $37 per barrel for this year, at a time when most companies need to see it at $50 per barrel to just break even.In the month of January, OPEC members generated record output, not a good sign for oil prices, nor for the already oversupplied market. In addition, Iran is ready to add its significant oil inventories into the mix, starting in the second half of this year. This is likely to wield quite a blow to oil prices. Consequently, I'm not expecting any improvement at all in the price of oil this year, certainly not to the level of $50 per barrel.Prospects are even bleaker for Halliburton, as its revenue base is mostly dependent on the North American region. Oil & gas production is quite cheap in the Middle East while its cost is very high for North American producers. That explains why low oil prices are impacting North American producers so significantly. In Q4, HAL's revenue from the North American region declined to only $2.1 billion compared to $4.7 billion in the same quarter of last year. Its revenue base in the Middle East is quite low compared to its involvement in the North American and European regions.In ConclusionIt's obviously wise to pick stocks when they decline to multi-year lows. However, it is also important to take into account a stock's upside potential. In the case of Halliburton, the company is employing innovative technologies, and its expected merger with Baker Hughes (BHI) will further enhance its portfolio. Halliburton is a good buy at the moment, but only for long-term investors who can wait for a turnaround in the oil market, which could take quite some time. In the short term, the company's fundamentals are not particularly strong for the first half of this year."

Source: Houston ChronicleIn Q4, Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) reported revenue of $5.08 billion and a net loss of $0.03 per share. Revenue was just shy of the $5.11 billion analysts were expecting. Below is my take on the quarter:EBITDA Margins - A Magic Trick?Halliburton's revenue declined 9% sequentially and 42% Y/Y. Revenue from every region declined, but North America (down 13% Q/Q) was the worst performer.The quarter was marked by unprecedented declines in North America activities:North America represents 42% of total revenue, down from 44% last quarter; Halliburton's sizeable presence in North America and the fact that it pioneered pressure pumping technology are strong reasons for the company to defend its turf.The story of the quarter might be the company's cost containment efforts. EBITDA margins were steady at 16% despite the revenue decline. Revenue has fallen 42% from $8.8 billion in Q4 2014 to $5.1 billion. Management cut operating expenses by 40% - almost in lockstep with revenue declines. This was nothing short of magic, in my opinion.Whether management can keep this up we will soon find out. Since Q4 2014, the global rig count has fallen 46% and Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI) believes it could decline as much as 30% in 2016. The first half of 2016 is setting up to be a dismal market for oilfield services.Strong Balance SheetHalliburton ended the quarter with $10.1 billion in cash that will allow the company to sustain itself in case of a protracted downturn in the market. Cash increased by $7.8 billion from $2.3 billion in Q3, while debt rose $6.8 billion to $14.7 billion. Debt at 4x run-rate EBITDA appears manageable given Halliburton's large cash position. The company might eventually need that large cash position as well.The implication that a customer ""flight to quality"" has emerged during the downturn could also portend that Halliburton is taking share from smaller, lesser-capitalized competitors. If smaller competitors have been weakened, then regulatory bodies may be reticent to approve the Baker Hughes merger, fearing it might disrupt the current competitive balance. If the merger is not approved, then Halliburton will be on the hook for a $3.5 billion break-up fee - about $2.6 billion after-tax. That strong balance sheet may come in handy in more ways than one."

If the deal falls through, HAL could get punished.Divested assets could be sold for a lower multiple than the 15x EBITDA multiple HAL is paying for BHI.$2B cost synergies may have been realized already, which could hurt the merger post-deal.HAL remains a sell.","Source: Offshore Energy TodayOilfield services stocks have been hammered by the free fall in oil prices from their peak in Q2 2014. Halliburton's (NYSE:HAL) cost containment measures and its proposed merger with Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI) have buoyed the stock. HAL is off about 28% over the past years versus an 8% decline for the S&P 500 (NYSEARCA:SPY). Over a year after the merger was announced, Halliburton is still trying to clear regulatory hurdles:Secondly, regulators in Brazil and the EU are concerned the transaction could hurt competition or result in higher prices for oilfield services. Reports have now surfaced that the company might need to divest even more assets to appease Australian regulators; Australia is reportedly looking for an alternative buyer of divested assets in order to create stronger competition across various markets. As regulators require a strong number three competitor across all products in every market, the merger may be untenable. Moreover, even if the deal is approved, HAL shareholders may not win out long term for the following reasons:Negative ArbitrageThe acquisition price for BHI is [i] 1.12 HAL shares of each BHI share and [ii] $19 per BHI share. Halliburton would also inherit Baker Hughes's net debt of $1.7 billion. Based on Friday's closing share prices, Halliburton would pay about $25.4 billion for BHI or over 15x its 2015 adjusted EBITDA. If Halliburton's divested assets are sold for less than the 15x EBITDA, then is could create a negative arbitrage. While BHI's EBITDA has fallen over 60% from $4.7 billion in 2015 to $1.7 billion in 2015, the deal value hasn't fallen in lockstep.Secondly, potential buyers of the divested assets could apply a much lower valuation multiple given [i] the free fall in oil prices and [ii] the potential difficulty in raising capital to fund the deal in a capital markets environment that is less inviting for energy deals. In particular, banks are looking to shun energy exposure, and might be less enthusiastic to provide debt for an oil services deal than they were a year ago.$2 Billion Cost Synergies Might Not Be RealisticThe proposed merger has gotten HAL longs excited due to expected cost synergies of $2 billion. However, after tens of thousands of headcount reductions and other cost containment efforts, those cost synergies might not be as robust as first thought. On its Q4 earnings call, HAL management gave little additional color on its ability to meet previous cost synergy estimates.Total operating expenses for both companies were $46 billion in 2015. They fell 12 billion to $34 billion for full year 2015. With combined costs much lower, the lion's share of cost cuts expected to be generated by the merger might have been realized already.HAL is all about risk and reward. The downside is that the stock could plummet if the merger is not approved. In my opinion, the company would likely be better off with the merger, but the potential upside could be limited due to [i] oil prices sub-$40 and [ii] the potential for synergies to be lower than once expected. That upside does not warrant the 9x EBITDA multiple that HAL is currently trading at. The stock remains a sell."
3856736,41741,2016-02-02T14:00:28-05:00,"Baker Hughes has fell 20% over the last year despite a buyout offer.
        Weakness in the oil markets could pull BHI down further, providing a buying opportunity.
        Both companies, and an activist investor, are committed to getting the deal done.","All the way back in 2014, Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) and Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI) announced a merger deal that would combine two of the oil services industry's largest providers. Since then, Halliburton shares have tumbled 43% and Baker Hughes is off 18%.The consolidation comes as the industry continues to struggle with low oil prices and a focus on cost controls. Consolidation is a focus for the industry as challenges and other large companies use mergers and acquisition to improve their own cost structures. Exxon (NYSE:XOM) is one example of a large conglomerate who has been actively taking advantage of acquisition opportunities in the industry - although not as much as some investors would like. Meanwhile, the merger of Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) and Cameron International (NYSE:CAM) also highlights the need for oil servicer companies to band together.Once completed, the merger of Halliburton and Baker Hughes is expected to generate cost synergies of $2 billion annually with accretive cash flows in the first year and accretion for earnings per share in the second year. The reasons are solid.In Halliburton's most recent third quarter it reported total revenue of $5.58 billion, down 36% from the comparable quarter, and earnings per share of $0.31, down 30% from the previous quarter. Baker Hughes reported revenue of $3.79 billion for the third quarter, down 39% from the comparable quarter, and an EPS loss of $0.05, up slightly from the $0.14 loss in the previous quarter.Enter the activistA majority shareholder in both companies, Jeff Ubben of ValueAct, is a big supporter of the deal. Holding right at 5% of Baker Hughes and Halliburton, the investor says the deal will greatly help both companies to control costs and enhance efficiencies in a difficult market environment for the energy industry.While the benefits of the deal are clear, the market hasn't appreciated it - hence the selloff in the stocks. However, they're working against a bigger force here - lower oil prices. Then there's the other big issue, and one that's a big overhang, regulatory approval.Baker Hughes is trading at a 20% discount to Halliburton's takeout offer. The regulatory review is underway in a number of countries. The biggest hurdle is in Europe, where the EU is questioning market competitive factors following the acquisition. The EU is questioning monopolized effects on oil prices and energy services that could potentially be a result of the merger, specifically following the recent merger of Schlumberger and Cameron in August of 2015.Halliburton say that it will comply with the EU and initiate any necessary modifications needed to gain approval (and Jeff Ubben has reiterated this sentiment in the past - that HAL will do whatever necessary to get the deal done).This investigation still lengthens the approval process for the oil service providers and could further negatively effect the market premium as energy stocks continue to be volatile.Overall, the Halliburton-Baker Hughes deal still has enough positives and is a way to manage oil price pressures. Both companies sentiment to get the deal done is a positive and they have the activist hedge fund, ValueAct, putting pressure on them to get this done. All positives that have us interested in Baker Hughes - as the discount to the acquisition price seems overdone. Granted, the big risk is lower oil prices and a further drop in Halliburton stock. In the deal you'll get 1.12 shares of Halliburton and $19 in cash. Owning shares of Halliburton isn't a complete negative, as it will be a formidable opponent to Schlumberger after the Baker Hughes buy. But we're still playing wait-and-see, as the deal will likely take most of 2016 to close, but are on the lookout for a good entry point at Baker Hughes - i.e. somewhere back below $40 a share."
3834066,40351,2016-01-26T08:33:58-05:00,"Halliburton has recently released its fourth quarter results.The company actually managed to improve its operating margins at home and abroad, easily outperforming Schlumberger.But the company is bracing for a tough 2016.","Halliburton (NYSE:HAL), the world's second largest oilfield services company, has recently released its quarterly results in which the company delivered a solid performance at home and abroad, better than its bigger rival Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB).Image: Copyright 2016 HalliburtonHalliburton posted 42.1% year-over-year decrease in total revenues to $5.08 billion for the three months ending December. The company also booked a number of one-off after-tax charges, including $192 million related to asset write-downs led by the ongoing downturn, $79 million of costs related to Baker Hughes (BHI) acquisition. Halliburton also raised $7.5 billion debt in the fourth quarter, leading to additional interest expense of $27 million. Due in large part to an increase in one-time charges, Halliburton swung from a net profit from continuing operations of $900 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 to a loss of $28 million. But excluding the special charges, Halliburton reported a profit of $270 million or $0.13 per share. This was better than analysts' estimate of a profit of $0.24 per share, according to data compiled by Thomson Reuters, through revenues were slightly short of expectation of $5.11 billion.Halliburton's performance was particularly impressive in North America. As a context, the North American market has borne the brunt of oil's collapse. Oilfield service companies operating in this region have faced greater pricing pressure as compared to international markets. Consequently, Halliburton has seen its North America operating margins shrunk from more than 18% in FY2014 to just 0.3% in the third quarter of last year. It also didn't help that Halliburton had to keep an elevated cost structure due to activities related to Baker Hughes merger. I was expecting Halliburton to report a loss in the fourth quarter for North America, but surprisingly, the company actually managed to lift the region's margins by 160 basis points sequentially to 1.9%.The increase in margins has come on the back of Halliburton's aggressive cost cutting measures. The oilfield services giant slashed 22,000 jobs in 2015 all over the world representing a quarter of its workforce while capital spending for the full year clocked in at $2.2 billion, down from $3.3 billion in 2014. Moreover, if oil prices fail to recover, then Halliburton has said that it could cut additional jobs. For 2016, the company has planned another large cut in capital spending to $1.6 billion.Overall, Halliburton's revenues and operating profits in North America dropped 54.4% and 95.5% on a year-over-year basis to $2.16 billion and $41 million respectively. But what's also impressive is that on a sequential basis, Halliburton posted 13.4% drop in revenues which looks impressive when compared against 15% drop in rig count for the same period. Schlumberger, on the other hand, reported a 178 basis points sequential drop in North America operating margins to 7.1% while its revenues declined 14% in the same period to $1.96 billion. In these terms, Halliburton has outperformed Schlumberger.Meanwhile, in the international markets, Halliburton reported 27.6% decline in revenues and 17.7% decline in operating income to $2.93 billion and $502 million respectively, on a year-over-year basis. The drop in revenues and earnings was considerably smaller when compared against North America. This shows that international markets have, once again, softened the blow of the downturn. In the international markets, Middle East remains the best house in a bad neighborhood where operating income dropped by just 16.6% from the prior year while operating margins actually improved by 130 basis points to 22.1%. This trend (strong performance from international markets in general and Middle East in particular), according to Halliburton, will persist through 2016.But what's even more impressive is that Halliburton actually managed to pull off improvement in international operating margins as well, with 210 basis points year-over-year increase to 17.2%. That's something which is not supposed to happen right in the middle of a downturn. Schlumberger, on the other hand, reported 219 basis points drop in international margins in the fourth quarter, and that was understandable.Halliburton did not provide any significant update on the merger process, though Dave Lesar, Halliburton's CEO did say that the company has given ""an enhanced set of proposed divestitures"" to the Justice Department and has also informally notified the European Commission and other authorities in this regard. Halliburton originally planned to sell $7.5 billion of annual revenue generating assets to address antitrust concerns, but now it looks like the company will be forced to shed more assets.Halliburton delivered a strong fourth quarter performance. If it continues to go like this, then its North American business, which is the backbone of Halliburton's operations, could remain profitable throughout the downturn. That being said, Halliburton is preparing for the worst, which is sensible considering the uncertainty in the global oil market. During the conference call, Lesar repeatedly said that 2016 is going to be a ""tough slog through the mud."" The company has reduced its capital budget by 27.3% from last year and is willing to further tighten its belt, which indicates that the company is bracing for a challenging year."

3835006,22148,2016-01-26T12:19:07-05:00,"Halliburton continues to maintain solid margins despite the downturn in the oilfield services sector.The pending Baker Hughes merger still offers a lot of upside once approved.The stock isn't without risks, but the rewards are extremely attractive considering the strong operations provide protection to the downside risks.","Similar to the Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) results, Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) is surviving the industry downturn by cutting costs at a fast clip to keep up with reduced customer spending. The latest results show that Halliburton has used the downturn to recently improve efficiency in comparison to the larger peer.The stock is down substantially over the last 18 months, but the Q4 results aren't showing a dire situation. In fact, the company has likely used the pending Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI) acquisition to streamline some operations and cut extra costs. The regulatory delay is a problem that I previously addressed here.The impressive part about the Q4 results is that Halliburton absorbed a sequential $500 million shock to revenues while maintaining operating income levels. Analysts forecast a sequential decline in earnings to $0.24 for the quarter, yet the oilfield services giant was able to improve margins in North America to maintain earnings levels at $0.31 per share.The biggest part of the merger with Baker Hughes was the intent to improve margins of the two firms principally in the North American markets. For Q4, Halliburton's standalone operating margins in North America grew 160 basis points to 1.9%. Of course, the margins collapsed from 19.4% in the prior Q4.In comparison, Schlumberger still generated a 7.1% operating margin in North America despite a slightly smaller business. These numbers continue to highlight the benefits of integrating with Baker Hughes to create more scale in North America and increase efficiency via striping out costs estimated at roughly $800 million in that region alone.The main reason consolidating Baker Hughes is important to shareholders is the upside potential from competing with Schlumberger on size. Schlumberger is currently worth $80 billion due to the sustained higher margins. The combination of Halliburton ($25 billion) and Baker Hughes ($17 billion) is only worth roughly half that of Schlumberger that has a roughly equal revenue base prior to completing the merger with Cameron International (NYSE:CAM).The below chart best highlights the discrepancies in ongoing value with Schlumberger that the Halliburton and Baker Hughes merger hopes to close.HAL PS Ratio (Forward) data by YChartsThe ability to combine and strip out the $2 billion in synergies is the prime method to close this big gap in valuation differences.The key takeaway is that Halliburton is an attractive stock to play an eventual rebound in the oilfield services sector. The Baker Hughes acquisition is proving more difficult to close than expected, but the combination still offers huge upside to the stock once closed.Halliburton is not without risk from the $3.5 billion termination fee the company has to pay Baker Hughes if the deal isn't approved. The risks still appear low with all of the concessions the company is offering, leaving the reward part of the equation in favor of owning the stock at around $30."
3832956,32971,2016-01-25T17:56:52-05:00,Will Halliburton's Q4 earnings call deliver significant merger-related news?What is the potential impact of the low oil prices on the probability of the merger succeeding?What are the recent moves in the deal spread telling us?,"Important Note: This article is not an investment recommendation and should not be relied upon when making investment decisions - investors should conduct their own comprehensive research. Please read the Disclaimer at the end of this article.Merger arbitrageurs invested in the Baker Hughes (BHI)/Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) deal spread continued to ride the roller coaster in January. The spread widened again in mid-January to just under $14 per Baker Hughes share, before coming back in to ~$11 level as of the end of last week.The spread remains extremely wide, indicating that the market is giving the deal at best a 50/50 chance of going through.A market-neutral arbitrage trade position - depicted by the spread on the graph above - would consist of going short 1.12 HAL shares for every 1 BHI share on the long side (the spread is adjusted for dividend distributions on a looking-back basis). A long position in the spread is a bet that the deal will eventually close.The significant development on the regulatory review front in January was the announcement by the European Commission for Competition that it would launch the second phase of its investigation into the deal, which could last until late May. The announcement was anticipated. European regulators had indicated competitive concerns related to more than 30 product and service lines, which suggests that the review will be intense and eventual approval should not be taken for granted.The lack of news on the divestiture front does not add much confidence in the deal's success either. Halliburton has been running sales processes for large asset packages for many months now. However, no announcements have been made to this point.While the announcement by the European Commission is the most obvious factor driving the recent spike of skepticism with regard to the deal's outcome, the deterioration of oil price environment may be another contributing factor.With the commodity prices setting new lows in December and January and the outlook for 2016 being uninspiring, it is possible that the market is anticipating that regulatory authorities will take an even stricter view on the deal's potential impact on the industry's competitive landscape as a result.On one hand, one might argue, lower commodity prices have created significant spare capacity in the industry, reducing the deal's impact on pricing in the immediate term.However, there is another angle that regulators may have to take in consideration, given that the cyclical trough is proving to be more extended than anyone could expect. Regulators cannot be unconcerned that under a ""much lower for much longer"" scenario, the number of viable industry competitors may be materially reduced. It would be logical to expect, therefore, that regulators will be increasingly looking at the combination not only in the context of the current competitive lay of the land in the oil service industry, but also on a ""pro forma for attrition and consolidation"" basis, looking few years ahead under a variety of scenarios.Regulators would need to take into consideration not only the large number of smaller industry participants that may be forced to close up shops in the next few years, but also larger participants who will be handicapped as competitors due to their distressed balance sheets. Weatherford International's (WFT) challenges and ultimate decision several months ago not to bid for Halliburton's assets offered for sale - arguably, due to balance sheet constraints - is the case in point.Given that under a pessimistic scenario attrition and consolidation in oil service industry may be significant, such forward looking ""pro forma"" tests may prove to be much tougher for the proposed deal to satisfy.While many investors are likely expecting a significant merger-related update and guidance to be delivered during Halliburton's Q4 2015 earnings conference call tomorrow morning - which may be a reason for the deal spread narrowing sharply in advance - a case can be made that in the current commodity price environment slowing down the process may be Halliburton's preferred strategy, with the hope that oil prices will stage a quick recovery in the next few months. Higher commodity prices may lower the bar in the regulatory review. In addition, Halliburton may be able to receive higher valuations in the massive asset divestitures that will ultimately be required (possibly beyond the already announced packages).In this context, the decision by European regulators to pursue a full review of the deal may be a convenient excuse for both Halliburton and Baker Hughes to extend the deadline for the closing.Clearly, both Halliburton and Baker Hughes are critically motivated to see the deal succeed. For Halliburton, the deal's failure would likely equate to the $3.5 billion break-up fee coming due, hundreds of millions of dollars of merger-related costs without payback, and, very possibly, a leadership change. For Baker Hughes, the $3.5 billion fee would not offset the loss of the lavish premium being paid in the transaction.While it would be premature to conclude that the merger is not happening, the current deal spread, even after the strong pull back, suggests that the market has little confidence in the outcome at this point.Disclaimer: Opinions expressed herein by the author are not an investment recommendation and are not meant to be relied upon in investment decisions.

The decline in the rig count has hurt spending on oilfield services and equipment.Source: Shock ExchangeWhile Halliburton's revenue from North America fell 25% sequentially in both Q1 and Q2, it was only off 7% last quarter. This gave the impression that the double-digit declines had subsided.However, if Schlumberger's (NYSE:SLB) Q4 earnings report is a proxy, double-digit declines may have returned. Schlumberger's revenue from North America was off 14% sequentially as ""E&P budgets were exhausted."" A double-digit decline in North America could have an outsized impact on Halliburton has it receives about 45% of its revenue from the region. Look for North America to weigh this quarter.Extended Activity WeaknessThere may not be any relief in sight, at least for the first half of 2016. Schlumberger sees ""extended activity weakness"":That implies that declines in oil & gas industry E&P and Halliburton's revenue has further to fall. Longs have held out hope that the company's merger with Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI) will be approved by regulatory bodies. In my opinion, it would be more prudent to invest in HAL based solely on the company's merits. HAL is off over 20% over the past year and will likely fall further if management gives a sober outlook on oil & gas E&P. Given Schlumberger's poor outlook I would expect Halliburton's management to echo that sentiment.EBITDA MarginsThe company's normalized EBITDA margin declined from 19% in Q2 to 16% in Q3 as Halliburton lost the benefits of scale. Schlumberger announced 10,000 lay offs in reaction to the industry downturn. Rumors suggest Halliburton has plans to lay off 20,000 already. Based upon Schlumberger's Q4 report Halliburton may need more head count reductions in order to maintain its EBITDA margins. In my opinion, the risks are twofold. First of all, it would not dispel rumors that the company's proposed merger with Baker Hughes is simply designed to cut costs; the regulators may look askance on more head count reductions. Secondly, if the company cuts into too much muscle it may be difficult to benefit from a potential rebound in oil prices and E&P.ConclusionA dismal outlook will likely send HAL lower post-earnings. Avoid the stock."
3917876,32971,2016-02-22T20:01:15-05:00,The European regulatory review promises to be challenging.Fragmented divestitures do not seem to be a cure for some of the concerns expressed by the EU Commission.The EU Commission's preliminary views likely reflect similar scrutiny areas by U.S. antitrust regulators.,"Important Note: This article is not an investment recommendation and should not to be relied upon when making investment decisions - investors should conduct their own comprehensive research. Please read the disclaimer at the end of this article.The news of the European Commission suspending its review of the proposed business combination between Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) and Baker Hughes (BHI) confirms that the EU antitrust review may prove to be a challenging one.The suspension is technical in its nature. The Commission stated that the two companies' filing did not contain all the required information. However, as one can see from the status report below, the deadline is being extended by 20 days, which moves the Commission's response deadline into July 2016.(Source: The European Commission)The worry over the EU regulatory review goes far beyond simply technical process.The Commission stated earlier that it intends to ""look closely"" at the proposed merger to make sure it would not reduce customer choices or push up prices for oil & gas exploration and production services in the EU.It is also worth noting that the Commission sees an energy security angle in the proposed combination:The Commissioner in charge of competition has stated the Commission's awareness that the takeover would eliminate one of the three current main global competitors in global oil services. The Commission has ""serious potential competition concerns in more than 30 product and service lines, both offshore and onshore.""Particular concerns relate to the merger's impact on competition in tenders and in innovation. The Commission's preliminary view was that competition from smaller suppliers is limited in tenders for projects of greater complexity, where more challenging conditions and higher costs are involved, such as offshore projects. Quality of service and reputation are particularly important in such tenders.In addition, it believed that only three suppliers were currently able to provide integrated services that run across many product and service lines, namely Halliburton, Baker Hughes and Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB). In the Commission's view, the ability to offer such integrated solutions represents a significant competitive advantage, for reasons of cost-saving in particular.Therefore, the Commission's preliminary view was that the merger...The second major concern related to the merger's potential impact on innovation:While the Commission is investigating whether these initial concerns are justified ""without prejudice,"" it appears highly questionable if these major objections can be cured via fragmented divestitures that are substantially smaller in scale than Baker Hughes.It is important to note that the concerns publicly stated by the European regulator will inevitably correlate with the areas of review by regulators in other jurisdictions, including the U.S. and Australia.How did the market react to the news of the likely delay in the EU regulatory review?As one can see from the graph below, the deal arbitrage spread widened moderately in the past few days and remains at the high end of the range observed since the announcement of the merger.It is important to note that both stocks have moved higher since the news, with Halliburton running ahead of Baker Hughes.What is the probability of the deal closing?Taking in consideration the $3.5 billion non-success fee that amounts to over $8 per share of Baker Hughes stock, the current deal spread effectively discounts a roughly 50/50 probability of the deal's success, based on my assessment.In ConclusionGiven the nature of the concerns expressed by the European regulator, fragmented divestitures proposed by Halliburton may not be an effective cure. The success of the regulatory review appears to require a solution that may be too big of a sacrifice for the company to accept.In this context, the market's skepticism with regard to the deal closing is understandable. In fact, the risk of non-closing may be undervalued in the current deal spread.Low oil prices is a another factor that may influence the review, as the regulators will need to look at the competitive landscape in the aftermath of the potential shake-out and consolidation in the industry due to the current severe downturn.For more in-depth data and analysis of commodity fundamentals, please consider subscribing to Zeits OIL ANALYTICS that provides in-depth analysis of the global and North American crude oil market.Disclaimer: Opinions expressed herein by the author are not an investment recommendation and are not meant to be relied upon in investment decisions.

3832076,33291,2016-01-25T14:37:51-05:00,"Q4 earnings are our for Halliburton.In many respects the quarter was similar to Schlumberger's but outperformed on key fronts especially compared to Q3.While oil prices and drilling activity are driving share prices, I think you need to focus on the most critical factor for the company right now.","Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) is an oil service stock that I have traded many times over the years despite having long preferred rival Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB). That said, both are very similar in many respects. I recently reported on Schlumberger and asked whether it was time to abandon ship. I discussed how despite that absolute bloodbath in the oil sector, and the pain being real, the long-term investor could start to add to their positions strategically, rather than dumping now. I just saw too much upside potential relative to downside fears even if the oil glut is prolonged. I also discussed how Schlumberger was pulling out all of the stops to cut costs, preserve its dividend and maintain profitability. All in all, I concluded that Schlumberger is prepared to battle poor oil prices for the next few years. Turning to Halliburton, despite being similar to Schlumberger in many respects, it has unique differences. It provides a range of services and products for the exploration, development, and production of oil and natural gas to oil and gas companies all over the globe. Of course, at the present moment in history as it pertains to oil, the similarities are uncanny in trading activity; the stocks have been crushed. Halliburton has also suffered the pain that Schlumberger has endured which have made the differences between the companies all but an aside for traders.No doubt, the sector has been decimated. All one has to do is look at any Pull any 6, 12 or 18 month chart of the trading activity. Nothing but red will be found. Now it may sound simplistic, but truer words have never been spoken when it comes to investing. It just doesn't matter where a stock has been, it matters where it is going. And to determine where a stock may be heading, aside from oil prices, we need to talk about the company's recent performance. With oil prices so low of late, it has crushed the company. Simply put, the higher the price the better. That's just a fact that is true for all of the oil names. That said, like Schlumberger, Halliburton missed on revenues but beat expectations on the bottom line.So what kind of numbers are we talking about? Well, despite an earnings beat, a comparison to last year clearly demonstrates the pain the company has been experiencing. Of course, it should surprise no one, with oil having dropped a ten year low coming into 2016. Quarter-over-quarter I was pleased to see the company actually was flat on the bottom-line, which also surprised analysts. The company saw income from continuing operations in its third quarter of $270 million. This translated to $0.31 per share. Still, this beat analyst estimates by $0.04 per share. For those paying attention, this income is flat from Q3 2015 which saw $265 million, or $0.31 per share. Adjusted operating income was $473 million in Q4 2015, down from the adjusted operating income of $506 million in the Q3 2015. Halliburton's total revenue in the fourth quarter of 2015 was $5.1 billion, compared to $5.6 billion in the third quarter of 2015. This missed estimates slightly, by $30 million.So just how did Halliburton get here and beat earnings by this much? Well, it managed to control expenses and this the key to survival for this sector right now. Over the last year the company has slashed its expenditures in just about every category. That's really all that matters in the short-run and really what you need to keep an eye on. Revenue is mostly driven by the commodity pricing, so the bottom line can thus be impacted by watching spending. I want to add that Halliburton recorded company-wide charges related to asset write-offs and severance costs of approximately $192 million, or $0.22 per share, in Q4 2015 adding to write-offs of $257 million or, $0.30 per share, in Q3 2015. Further, Halliburton recorded Baker Hughes (BHI) acquisition-related costs of $79 million, or $0.09 per share as well as $27 million, or $0.03 per share, of interest expense associated with the $7.5 billion debt issuance in the quarter. Of course that debt issuance will help keep the company funded if this oil downturn lasts for years.It is no surprise that with revenues declining so precipitously that operating income would be hit year-over-year, but the company did well quarter-over-quarter, relatively speaking. Loss from continuing operations was $28 million, or $0.03 per share versus a loss of $54 million, or $0.06 per share, in Q3 2015. Reported operating income was $86 million versus operating income of $43 million in Q3 2015. Commenting on the quarter, Jeff Miller, President, said:Looking ahead there is no sign that oil is going to rebound in the near-term. However, considering what has happened in the sector, Halliburton is doing very well. I was impressed with the quarter-over-quarter results given oil has gone nowhere but down pricewise. Its quarter was similar to Schlumberger's and the pain is real, especially if you are watching the value of your investment decline week to week. I continue to expect positive developments from the Baker Hughes deal, but we will have to watch and see how the company prepares for integrating that company's infrastructure into the Halliburton umbrella. I have a hold rating on the stock at present on the stock, but do think you can add to holdings under $30 for the long-term. Until the turn-around in oil, keep an eye on expenses, which to me are the most critical factor for the company right now.Note from the author: Christopher F.

3803746,31441,2016-01-11T19:03:24-05:00,"Halliburton missed a deadline to propose remedies to the EU pursuant to its merger with Baker Hughes.
        Halliburton has been practically groveling for merger approval. Such an approval could be pushed back until May.
        I predict BHI and HAL will continue to decline amid dismal Q4 earnings reports.
        Potential ""strong number 3"" players like Weatherford and C&J Energy Services could collapse in 2016.
        I believe there is strong likelihood the deal will not get approved. Avoid HAL and BHI.","Source: MarketWatchHalliburton (NYSE:HAL) has been practically groveling for approval of its Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI) merger. The company has agreed to do anything, including selling assets beyond what is required by the DOJ. After missing a deadline to propose remedies to assuage the EU pursuant to the merger, Halliburton's groveling could become more protracted:The decision could hurt the merger's prospects since the two oilfield services giants set a deadline for April 30 to close the deal. I believe further delays could hurt both companies for the following reasons:Time Is Not On Their SideThe closer we get to the April 30 deadline without regulatory approval, the more HAL and BHI will trade down, in my opinion. Secondly, a big selling point was the $2 billion in cost synergies the merger would generate. Since the merger was announced, both companies have cut costs. Baker Hughes' run-rate operating costs are about 27% below what they were in 2014; Halliburton's costs are down by 15%. That said, I believe a lot of the efficiency gains have already been achieved and the $2 billion cost synergy estimate could be passe'.The market appears to have also soured on the transaction. The discount between Baker Hughes' share price and its implied merger value has consistently been in the 8% - 10% range. That spread is now at an eye-popping 25%. Those who have bet on the ""Buy BHI, Short HAL"" carry trade might be deep in the red. Its spread could widen as economic headwinds and both companies' dismal earnings prospects begin to weigh.Smaller Competitors Will Likely FoldThe rigmarole over asset divestitures could be to ensure a strong number three oilfield services firm emerges. Regulators fear that outsized power by the merger partners could create coordinated behavior or cause prices to increase. If a strong number three player stepped up it could assuage regulators' fears. General Electric (NYSE:GE) is rumored to be in the final stages of negotiations for some of the divested assets. Whether such a deal would make GE a strong number three in every product and in every market the merger partners' participate in is unclear.Meanwhile, the downturn in oil prices have ravished the operations of smaller competitors like Weatherford International (NYSE:WFT) and C&J Energy Services (NYSE:CJES). Weatherford is currently considered the number four player among firms with outsized exposure to land drillers. However, it is in dire straits; its $7.7 billion in debt is at junk levels, and declining cash flows will make it difficult to service that debt. It has about $500 million in cash on hand and will be hard-pressed to make a $350 million principal payment next month. After February, I believe Weatherford could collapse under its mountain of debt and liquidity strain.C&J's $1.1 billion debt is also at junk levels. In Q2 its $4 million in EBITDA was not enough to cover its $24 million in interest expense. Its limited cash could create liquidity strain. Without access to more credit, C&J could fold before Weatherford does.ConclusionThe longer the merger takes to approve the wider BHI's merger spread will likely become. It could also become clear that potential strong number three candidates -- Weatherford and C&J -- may not survive a protracted oil industry downturn. There is a risk that the oilfield services equilibrium created by Halliburton, Baker Hughes and Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) could be undone by the merger. Therefore, there is a strong possibility it will not be approved. Avoid HAL and BHI."
3819386,40351,2016-01-19T15:42:45-05:00,Halliburton stock has fallen close to its 52-week lows.The company is facing increasing pressure from regulators regarding its merger with Baker Hughes.The oilfield service industry will likely face another tough year as oil producers further slash capital budgets.But Halliburton stock can still outperform its peers.,"Last week was a tough one for Halliburton (NYSE:HAL), the world's second largest oilfield services company, as its stock dropped nearly 5%, settling at $30.85, near 52-week lows, on Friday's close. The stock has been weighed by concerns regarding Halliburton's takeover of Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI) as well as weak oil prices.Merger concernsPreviously, I wrote that Halliburton's $26 billion takeover faced above-average risk of being shot down by regulators from day one, given this is the biggest deal that the oilfield services industry has ever seen and requires a green signal from Obama administration and other governments. It doesn't help that Halliburton has a history of close ties with the Republicans (it was previously headed former vice president Dick Cheney) and was involved in the worst environmental disaster in US history (the Deepwater Horizon oil spill disaster).Image: HalliburtonLast week, Financial Times highlighted that Halliburton is also under pressure from the European authorities. The region's competition commissioner has launched a ""Phase II"" probe into the deal while raising concerns that the merger could lead to higher prices in Europe. The commission is now required to finish its investigation within 90 working days, or by May 26.European Commission's concern isn't surprising. The tie-up between the two Houston based companies will effectively remove the third largest oilfield services company (Baker Hughes) of the world. In the long run, this can have far reaching consequences on the pricing environment in the global oilfield services industry which is currently dominated by just three companies - the industry leader Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) followed by Halliburton and Baker Hughes. In theory, the market will become less competitive, which could lead to higher prices.Halliburton previously agreed to sell $7.5 billion of revenue generating assets, but it looks like regulators want more. The sale of a large chunk of the Halliburton and Baker Hughes portfolio of assets can significantly strengthen Halliburton's competitors, such as Weatherford International (NYSE:WFT), or even give birth to a new major competitor, such as General Electric (NYSE:GE). This could alleviate European Commission and the US administration's apprehension regarding decline in competition.Oil price environmentOn top of this, Halliburton stock has been under pressure due to the recent weakness in oil prices, with both European Brent and US WTI falling below $28 a barrel following renewed fears of worsening supply glut after lifting of Western sanctions on Iran. The introduction of Iranian crude to the market can potentially lead to 50% to 60% increase in supplies from Iran from current levels of around 1 million barrels a day.The energy industry will begin reporting the fourth quarter results and capital spending guidance for 2016 in the coming days as the earnings season picks up. Amid a highly uncertain future, the spending levels will be largely underpinned by the trailing oil price environment. Oil major BP (NYSE:BP) has recently slashed 4,000 jobs while Petrobras (NYSE:PBR) has cut its spending plan for the next four years by 25%. I believe other oil producers will likely follow suit and the industry will witness another round of spending cuts in 2016. The onshore and offshore drilling activity will remain subdued, at least until we get through the bottom of the downturn which could be the first half of 2016. For the oilfield services industry, this is going to be another tough year, or at least another challenging first six months. Most oilfield services stocks will likely remain range bound in this period.Meanwhile, Halliburton will continue to report declining revenues and earnings while its margins will come under additional pressure. In the North America region, where Halliburton reported operating margin of 19.2% in the Q3-2014, the company was barely profitable in Q3-2015. The international region has been holding up well, though margins shrunk to just 1.1% in Q3-2015 from 18.4% a year earlier. As we head deeper into the downturn, Halliburton, particularly its North America division, may find it increasingly difficult to remain profitable. The company will report its fourth quarter results on Jan. 25, before markets open.Worth bettingIn this environment, with growing pressure from the US and European regulators and oil's extended downturn, it is difficult to see how Halliburton stock could outperform its peers; except, if the company gets a green signal from the US and European regulators.Halliburton has set merger deadline of April 30, which is nearly a month ahead of European Commission's deadline. Delay from competition commissioner can force Halliburton to extend its deadline by a month. But even if the company extends the merger date, any positive development from the US administration and European Commission that lowers the regulatory risk and indicates that the company may actually close the merger within months could fuel HAL's rally. In this scenario, Halliburton stock may end up outperforming peers. And this is not an expensive bet either.At the current price level, Halliburton stock is priced less than 2x its book value. The only point in time over the last decade when Halliburton stock has traded at around 2x book value was back in 2009, during the financial crisis, and 2012 when the pressure pumping market was weighed by excess supply."
3891486,84276,2016-02-12T08:30:25-05:00,Halliburton has dropped 30% since I last advised shorting at $41.54.The pain might not be over for the energy company as outlook for oil remains bleak.Lower 20s would present a favourable opportunity to investors.,"The last time I wrote about Halliburton Company (NYSE: HAL), I advised investors to short the stock in my analysis Halliburton: Short or Not?. At that time, the stock was trading at $41.54. As of today, the stock is currently down more than 30% at $28.80 as the oil situation gets worsened, and the deal with Baker Hughes Inc. (NYSE: BHI) still awaits completion.Energy companies are now scaring even the most seasoned investors, with a majority of them seeking refuge in dividend-paying companies such as Exxon Mobil (NYSE: XOM) as there seems to be no easy solution to the oil glut which keeps pushing the oil price lower. My assessment is that oil will trade in the $20-$25 band before it gets better.The oil market has reached a stage where it has become anybody's guess to call a bottom or a rebound, but I find it hard to see oil trading above $50 per barrel in the next couple of years. And that will further drag down the stock prices of energy companies which require higher prices to cover their costs. Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) being strongly correlated to the oil price will not be spared too. Check out the monthly HAL vs. NYMEX Crude price chart below.ImageKeeping aside oil's contribution to the plummeting stock price, I believe that the market is also closely watching the deal with Baker Hughes Inc. The market is beginning to price in the prospects of a failed deal. Though April 30 has been kept as the final date for the transaction, Morgan Stanley believes that there is a possibility that the deal might not go through and has therefore downgraded Baker Hughes to equal-weight from overweight. A failed deal will not only weaken BHI's position but also lead to more losses for the HAL investors. An entity combined of HAL and BHI would be expected to better weather the low oil price environment. Individually, the companies are facing constrained revenues and future expectations remain grim to say the least.Halliburton recently announced a quarterly dividend of $0.18 a share, bringing the year total to $0.72 and the yield to 2.43%, in an attempt to keep the investors from dumping their holdings. As the tide turns dangerous for investors, dividend-paying stocks and safe-haven assets such as gold and US dollar are shooting upwards.From a balance-sheet perspective, I see lower 20s as more appropriate levels for the stock. As of December 31, Halliburton had total current assets of $21.61 billion and total current liabilities of $5.36 billion, putting the working capital at $16.25 billion. Valuations closer to the working capital will provide a short-term cushion to the stock. The market cap of Halliburton as of yesterday's close stands at $24.72 billion.ConclusionI do not think that Halliburton presents a really attractive opportunity at current levels, and therefore, buying can be postponed as the sell-off is yet to end.Having stated my cautious view, I must admit that I can be completely wrong about the oil scenario. If oil were to rebound from current levels, the decline in Halliburton will be stopped and investors would be rewarded for sticking with the company."

Revenues from North America region plunged 54.8% to $1.96 billion while international revenues were down 30.4% to $5.71 billion. This includes 31.5% drop in Latin America revenues to $1.41 billion, 32.8% drop in Europe/CIS/Africa revenues to $2.06 billion and 27.3% drop in Middle East & Asia revenues to $2.25 billion.Source: Stock photo.Schlumberger also booked $2.1 billion in one-time pre-tax charges related to restructuring and asset impairments. The company cut an additional 10,000 jobs. Schlumberger swung from a net profit of $302 million, or $0.23 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2014 to a loss of $1.02 billion, or $0.81 per share - its first quarterly net loss in 12 years. But this loss was largely driven by abovementioned one-off charges. Excluding those, the company reported a profit of $0.65 per share, down from a profit of $1.50 per share a year earlier. The company ended up beating analysts' consensus estimate of a profit of $0.63 per share.Schlumberger reported 83.6% drop in pre-tax operating income in North America to $139 million, 24.5% drop in Latin America to $324 million, 37.3% drop in Europe/CIS/Africa region to $428 million and 42.2% drop in Middle East & Asia to $507 million.The North America market witnessed severe pricing pressure across all product lines, particularly pressure pumping, which led to a sharp decline in operating margin from 19.6% in the fourth quarter of 2014 to just 7.1% in the latest quarter. Outside of North America, Schlumberger saw operating margins drop from 24.2% a year earlier to 22.0%.Schlumberger generated $798 million of free cash flow in the quarter. It has decided to keep the dividend flat but approved another $10 billion share repurchase plan as the previous program of the same amount nears its conclusion.As for the Cameron International s takeover, Schlumberger said that the pre-close integration plans were substantially complete and the company has already received a green signal from regulators in US, Canada, Brazil and Russia. The company expects to close the merger by the first quarter of 2016.AnalysisSchlumberger's takeover of Cameron International is moving forward smoothly, unlike Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) which is facing growing pressure from regulators at home and abroad over its takeover of Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI), which I have recently covered (here and here). That's not surprising, given the significant difference in size and scale of the two deals. Halliburton's takeover of Baker Hughes is the biggest deal the global oilfield services industry has ever seen that could potentially alter the pricing environment. Moreover, unlike Halliburton and Baker Hughes, there is little overlap in the core business of Schlumberger and Cameron International.Overall, Schlumberger delivered a solid performance, considering the tough macro backdrop. The revenues and earnings in North America declined significantly, but that was largely anticipated. In fact, the company's revenues from the region fell 14% from the third quarter, which was roughly in line with the 15% drop in rig count in the same period.Schlumberger's performance in the international markets, on the other hand, has been holding up well. The company's international operating margins were still more than 20%. We've seen this trend throughout 2015. The company, as well as its peers, has consistently delivered a superior performance outside of North America. This, once again, shows that North America is facing the brunt of oil's collapse. Here, the response of oil producers, in terms of capital spending cuts, has been quicker and bigger than what we've seen in the international markets. This has put Schlumberger, which gets most of its revenues and profits from international markets, in a much better position than other US focused oilfield services stocks, such as Halliburton, Helmerich & Payne (NYSE:HP) and Patterson-UTI Energy (NASDAQ:PTEN).The rout in the energy sector is positioned to intensify in the coming months, despite oil's recent rally. The macro environment hasn't improved. Rather, the International Energy Agency has warned that the oil market could ""drown in oversupply"" of the commodity in 2016 as Iran ramps up crude exports. Meanwhile, China's economic slowdown has raised concerns regarding oil demand. The world's second largest economy grew by just 6.9% in 2015 - slowest pace in a quarter of a century. And the growth could slow to 6% by 2017, according to IMF. Capital spending from oil producers, Schlumberger's customers, will likely decline further in 2016. Schlumberger itself is not expecting a turnaround this year. The company will, therefore, continue to battle with pricing pressure and weak demand.But Schlumberger will have an advantage, thanks to its leadership in the international markets which will likely outperform North American market in 2016, just like last year. Besides, Schlumberger continues to generate best-in-class free cash flows. The company generated $798 million of free cash flows, roughly 98% of its adjusted earnings - this could be the highest rate in the industry. The company is generating more than enough cash to fund its growth and has roughly $10 billion cash available. This makes Schlumberger the best positioned pure-play oilfield services company to take advantage of the downturn by making another accretive acquisition. For these reasons, Schlumberger stock is well positioned to outperform its peers."

        Halliburton does not currently present a buying opportunity.","Halliburton's (NYSE:HAL) situation has been declining over the past couple of quarters. The company has faced extremely high pressures on both its financial performance and its backlog, because of downward spiraling oil prices and falling demand. The company's revenue base is highly dependent on growth in North American oil. However, this region is the most strongly impacted by oil's falling prices, due to its potential for high-cost oil production.In Q3, the company's sales in the North American region fell 47% Y/Y and 7% Q/Q, dropping to $2.49B. In addition, operating income from this region dropped sharply 21%, down to $506 million, compared to the second quarter of 2015. The situation is not much different for Halliburton in other areas of the globe. Revenue from other regions declined 5% with unchanged operating margins, compared to the second quarter of 2015.In addition to falling revenue and earnings, the company's cash generating potential is also dropping at a considerable rate, which is not even covering its dividend payments. In the first nine months of 2015, it generated free cash flows of only $300 million, while its dividend payments were standing at about $460 million. This means that Halliburton's free cash flows are not sufficient to cover its existing dividend payments. It raises a question mark over the stability of dividends, since its cash generating potential is also likely to remain depressed.The company's share price also tumbled significantly, along with the falling financials and poor market fundamentals. HAL's shares lost almost 18.34% of their value in the past twelve months, which is a significant amount for the company and its shareholders. Now the question is what's next? Does this dip in the company's share price present a buying opportunity, or should investors wait further before buying this stock?Many investors love to pick stocks when other are fearful. It is always a wise strategy to buy a stock when it's at bottom and sell it high. But it is also important to predict the exact bottom point, as well as the expected upside of that stock. And for that, many investors use valuations and other matrices. While, I also pay attention to valuations, but future market fundamentals are more important to me when predicting the bottom and upside potential of any stock. I believe that future market fundamentals are the growth engine for any company and its share price.In the case of Halliburton, the company's business model is entirely dependent on growth activities in the oil and gas industry. In 2015, investments in this industry declined by almost 35%, which significantly impacted backlogs and financials of oilfield service companies. In the final two quarter of 2015, many exploration and production companies posted record losses due to very low oil prices. As a result, their cash flows were squeezed and they lost the potential to invest in capital projects.In the final quarter of 2015, oil prices declined significantly, averaging around $40 per barrel, an amount too low for producers to make a profit. ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP), the largest E&P Company, said they need oil at $60 per barrel for cash flow neutrality. Therefore, these companies are heading to post big losses for the final quarter of 2015, which I believe will further reduce their potential to invest in future projects.If we ignore the results from the final quarter of 2015, the prospect looks even bleaker for the first half of 2016. Oil prices have dropped sharply since the start of 2015. At present, oil prices are trading near the $30 per barrel mark, too low a price for most oil producing companies to survive.In ConclusionBarclays recently predicted oil will dip to $20 per barrel, which I believe is certainly true. Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries are not looking to cut their production levels, despite falling prices. In addition, many companies are also employing a similar strategy of offsetting low prices by increasing production volumes. This strategy is further exacerbating the imbalance between supply and demand. As a result, I'm not seeing any sign of stabilization in oil prices any time soon.Halliburton, whose business model is entirely dependent on investment from oil producing companies, will experience a significant pressure on its backlog and financials. Consequently, its share performance will also feel the impact of bleak fundamentals and poor financial performance. Because of this, I suggest investors hold off on buying this stock until they can see of the beginnings of oil price stabilization."

A hurdle for the DOJ is that Halliburton divest certain overlapping operations. I believe low oil prices make a sale problematic. However, according to Bloomberg, General Electric (NYSE:GE) is in advanced talks for Halliburton's drill assets:Selling both the drill bits and drilling services businesses was expected to fetch about $5 billion when the units were put on the block in Q2.GE Has A Sizeable Presence In Oil And Gas...GE is known as an industrial giant. Little known is that it is also a leading provider of oil and gas drilling equipment and subsea systems. Its oil services business was built via acquisitions totaling over $10 billion and represents 15% of GE's revenue (sans GE Capital).Source: Shock ExchangeIn Q3, GE's oil and gas segment underperformed the other operating segments. While total revenue was off 1% Y/Y, oil and gas revenue fell 16%. Total operating profit was up 2% Y/Y while operating profit for the oil and gas segment was off 12%. Falling oil prices have caused a downturn in oil and gas E&P, which in turn has punished oil services firms.GE may only be interested in acquiring specific units of Halliburton or Baker Hughes' divested assets. GE CEO Jeff Immelt has already had to defend his forays into oil and gas and its strategic fit with GE's other businesses. That said, buying all of Halliburton or Baker Hughes' divested assets may give GE outsized exposure to an industry that may not hit rock bottom until 2017 or beyond....But Halliburton May Need Multiple BuyersOn its Q2 earnings call, Halliburton's management claimed the divested properties had attracted 25 bids; the robustness of the sale process appeared to have assuaged those involved in the ""buy BHI, short HAL"" carry trade. Two things have changed since then. First, oil prices have fallen from the $60s in Q2 to sub-$40 in Q4. Buyers may be less optimistic about the future of oil and gas E&P at these levels, which could make the sale process challenging. Secondly, the European Union (""EU"") may have concerns that post-deal, a combined Baker Hughes/Halliburton could facilitate coordinated behavior.If Halliburton has to sell divested assets piecemeal, it may not be able to convince regulators that the buyers (GE or others) of those assets will be large enough to prevent ""coordinated behavior"" or a dislocation in the oilfield services market.Why Bother?Halliburton is on the hook for a $3 billion break-up fee if the merger does not close, so it has a lot riding on the deal. However, for regulators to try to prevent the merger of the number two and three oilfield services companies from [i] creating concentration in the marketplace and [ii] fostering coordinated behavior post-transaction seems like a lot of rigmarole for an uncertain benefit. The question for regulators is this, ""If the marketplace is at or near equilibrium and the merger could potentially upset that equilibrium, then why bother?ConclusionGE may be interested in buying certain divested assets from Halliburton. However, a sale of substantially all the assets to one interested party may be required to meet regulators' requirements. I do not believe Halliburton will get there. Avoid HAL and BHI."
3793766,38631,2016-01-06T13:50:16-05:00,"The recent widening of the deal spread has led many investors to think that the market considers the deal extremely unlikely to be completed.
        However, if investors analyze the data more carefully, they will conclude that the market assigns an approximate 50% chance on the completion of the deal.
        The recent deterioration of the outlook of the oil sector has rendered the negative scenario (no deal) much worse than before.","Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) agreed to acquire Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI) about a year ago. While the stock of Baker Hughes spiked on the announcement, it soon gave up most of its gains and has recently fallen even below its pre-announcement levels. This has led many investors to believe that the market considers the deal extremely unlikely to be completed. For instance, this SA article implied that the deal is very unlikely, judging from the wide deal spread. However, if investors analyze the data more carefully, they will conclude that the market assigns an approximate 50% chance on the completion of the deal.First of all, Halliburton agreed to acquire Baker Hughes for $19 in cash plus 1.12 shares of Halliburton for each share of Baker Hughes. Therefore, at the current stock price of Halliburton around $34, the corresponding deal price of Baker Hughes is $57.08, which is 25% higher than the current price of Baker Hughes. As the deal is expected to close till April, the 25% arbitrage spread of the deal is really pronounced and may lead many investors to think that the deal is considered extremely unlikely by the market.However, that would be true only if Baker Hughes was trading around its true value, i.e., its fair stock price without the deal being considered. This is certainly not the case, as the prolonged recession of the oil sector resulted in losses per share $0.36 in 2015 and expected losses per share $0.09 in 2016. A stock with such losses can hardly trade at the current price of $45.75, though it is hard to come up with a fair stock price given that the P/E ratio does not work in this case. Nevertheless, Jefferies recently warned that Baker Hughes will fall 25%-30% if the deal does not materialize. This is the exact reason for the pronounced divergence of Baker Hughes from its deal price. To make a long story short, if the deal does not materialize, Baker Hughes is likely to plunge by about 25% due to the collapse of the oil price and its resultant prolonged recession of the oil sector. On the other hand, if the deal materializes, Baker Hughes will rally about 25% from its current price, as mentioned above. Therefore, the current stock price indicates that the market attaches an approximate 50% chance on the deal to materialize.It is also worth noting that the recent widening of the deal spread has been attributed by some investors, including the above mentioned SA author, on increasing concerns of the market on the chances of the deal. While this view cannot be fully rejected, the deal spread has also increased due to the great deterioration of the outlook of the oil sector. More specifically, while many analysts were expecting a rebound of the oil price in 2016, oil recently plunged to new multi-year lows and is now expected to remain suppressed much longer than previously expected. Consequently, the recession of the oil sector is now expected to last much longer than previously thought. Therefore, the stock of Baker Hughes is now worth less than before in the case of cancellation of the deal and this is the main reason for the recent increase of the arbitrage spread. In other words, the odds of the deal being completed have not changed but the negative scenario has become much worse so the stock of Baker Hughes has lost about 15% in the last month, thus causing the deal spread to widen.In reference to the chances of the deal materializing, I believe that the deal will eventually materialize, though it may take longer than currently expected in order for the two companies to satisfy the requirements of the DoJ. The unusually high cancellation fee of $3.5 B provides a great motive to Halliburton to exhaust all available means in order to get the deal approved. Moreover, the deep recession of the oil sector underscores the need for great mergers and their resultant economies of scale. Halliburton expects annual cost synergies of nearly $2B while the purchase will be accretive to its cash flow by the end of the first year and accretive to its EPS by the end of the second year.To sum up, some investors have recently concluded that the Baker Hughes/Halliburton deal is considered highly unlikely by the market, judging from the great divergence of Baker Hughes from its deal price. However, given the expected trajectory of the stock in either of the two scenarios (deal, no deal), the market currently implies an approximate 50% chance of the deal being completed. The recent widening of the deal spread can be mostly attributed to the recent plunge of the oil price to new multi-year lows and the deterioration of the outlook of the oil sector, which has rendered the negative scenario (no deal) much worse than before."
3783156,31441,2015-12-30T10:59:08-05:00,Baker Hughes trades at a 19% discount to its implied merger price. The market may have soured on the merger.Standalone Haliburton is worth $26 or 25% below its current price.Including the $3.5B break-up fee ($2.6B after-tax) HAL is worth $23 -- 33% below its current price.The possibility of a failed merger is real. Avoid HAL.,"Source: Offshore Energy TodayOver a year after the merger between Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) and Baker Hughes (BHI) was announced, the deal is in limbo. The DOJ and EU appear to question whether the merged entity will reduce competition. Brazil's anti-trust regulator has voiced concerns that the merger could result in higher prices for oilfield services. Once thought of as a sure bet, the ""Buy BHI, Short HAL"" carry trade may be falling out of favor; BHI now trades at a 19% discount to its implied merger value of $58.Halliburton has to divest certain non-core assets while oil prices settle below $40 and shale plays are fighting for survival. This may be a good time to remind HAL longs about that $3.5 billion break-up fee Halliburton owes if the deal falls apart.About That $3.5 Billion Break-Up FeeHalliburton's bottoms up valuation is not pretty. I believe HAL has a standalone value of $26, or 25% below its current value. However, if you include the $3.5 billion break up fee, the valuation declines further. Below are the details:The valuation is based on year-to-date revenue and EBITDA through September 30, 2015, and annualized. EBITDA at a 7.0x multiple equates to an enterprise value of $28 billion. The break-up fee would not impact the EBITDA in this example because it is non-recurring. However, it does impact net debt.At Q3 2015 Halliburton had cash of $2.2 billion and debt of $7.9 billion; net debt was $5.7 billion. The 3.5 billion break-up at 2014's tax rate of 27% equates to about $2.6 billion. Thus would reduce cash, and increase net debt to $8.2 billion. The fact that Halliburton doesn't have enough cash in the till to pay for the break-up fee is rather alarming. The resulting equity value of $19.8 billion equates to $23, or 33% below HAL's current share price.ConclusionIn effect, the break-up fee would negatively impact longs by an additional $3 per share by reducing HAL's standalone value from $26 to $23. Given that $2.6 billion could have been squirreled away to help survive the oil market downturn, the fee could also negatively impact sentiment towards HAL. Investors should avoid the stock given the merger's many pitfalls."
3787766,32971,2016-01-04T07:47:02-05:00,What is the merger arb score card to date for the HAL/BHI proposed merger?What is the current spread telling us?What are the implications for the two stocks of the deal not being able to go through?,"Important Note: This article is not an investment recommendation and should not be relied upon when making investment decisions - investors should conduct their own comprehensive research. Please read the Disclaimer at the end of this article.The proposed merger between Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) and Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI) announced in November 2014 was a ground-shaking development for the Oilfield Service sector. If successful, the transaction has the potential of drastically changing the industry's competitive landscape, particularly internationally, impacting other oil service and equipment providers and customers.In terms of its potential strategic impact, the deal without doubt holds the #1 ranking among Oilfield Service transactions announced in the past decade.However, in terms of financial returns, the BHI/HAL risk arbitrage trade - based on the performance to date - is one of the most disappointing in the large-capitalization space. For risk arbitrageurs who initiated a market-neutral position in BHI/HAL two years ago with a hope of collecting a rich payout at the deal's closing, the spread has been a massive loss maker on a mark-to-market basis. It is likely that some traders saw their positions stopped out by risk managers, with painful losses locked in.As of year-end 2015, the spread remained remarkably wide, indicating the market's serious concerns over the deal not going through.The History Of The Arb SpreadTo understand the evolution of the market's view on the likelihood of the deal closing, one needs to look at the performance of the deal spread.The graph below shows the BHI / HAL deal spread following the announcement (the orange line) and compares it to the same metric calculated for a pre-announcement period. Stock prices are adjusted for dividend distributions on a looking-back basis.As a reminder, a market-neutral arbitrage trade position would consist of going short 1.12 HAL shares for every 1 BHI share on the long side. A long position in the spread is a bet that the deal will eventually close.As one can see from the graph below, BHI stock significantly underperformed HAL stock during the first ten months of 2014 (the blue dashed trend line). The underperformance reflected Baker Hughes' weaker operating margins, on one hand, and Halliburton's continued success in strengthening its position in international markets, on the other. The strong ""currency"" gave Halliburton additional leverage to make a bid for Baker Hughes.(Source: Zeits Energy Analytics, January 2016)The $3.5 billion break-up fee that was designed to compensate Baker Hughes in the event the deal was rejected for regulatory reasons, was a notable element of the transaction. I would argue that the huge conditional penalty agreed by Halliburton enabled some arbitrageurs to take a view that the deal had a reasonable probability of closing, despite the significant antitrust risk. Indeed, by taking on such an enormous contingent liability, Halliburton effectively ""burned the bridges,"" signaling to the market that it would go to the very end in its effort to receive necessary regulatory approvals. The inclusion of the $3.5 billion fee also might have created an illusion that Halliburton was taking on a well-calculated risk.Those arbitrageurs who initiated their positions immediately after the transaction was announced, entered into the spread at levels in the ~$7-$9 range. Total capital tied up in each long/short pair (1 BHI share long and 1.12 HAL shares short) was approximately $115 per pair at that time.Marking such position to market as of December 31, 2015, the loss on each pair would be ~$2-$4. However, adding significantly to that loss is the cost of carrying the position.For professional merger arbitrageurs, the cost of borrowing HAL shares and the cost of capital tied up in the long/short position can be relatively low. Let's assume that the total cost of funds for the arbitrageur - including the cost of borrowing HAL shares - has been 3% per annum on total capital deployed. The financing costs accumulated to date would be ~ $3.75 per pair.As a result, total loss to date per pair is in the $6.75-$8.75 range, which is huge by merger arbitrage standards.The loss is much greater for those arbitrageurs who entered the trade during the ""complacency"" period when the spread contracted to the $4-$6 range (the graph below). For arbitrageurs who established positions during the first half of 2015, the loss on the trade to date can be as wide as $10 per pair. At certain points in November and December, mark-to-market losses widened to as much as $13 per pair.(Source: Zeits Energy Analytics, January 2016)The big adverse moves in the spread in August and then again in November-December suggest that some arbitrageurs likely lost their ability to carry the trade due to stop-loss mechanisms. It is not uncommon for arbitrageurs to have defined loss limits after which the losing position comes under mandatory review. Mark-to-market losses exceeding the limit may trigger a forced position reduction or liquidation, with the loss effectively locked in.What Would Be The Implications, Should The Deal Not Go Through?The wide deal spread is a reflection of the market's strongly divided view on the probability of the merger ultimately closing. The behind-the-scenes negotiations with the DOJ and EU's Commission for Competition are more difficult than might be visible to a common observer.Based on December 31, 2015, closing prices of $34.04 for HAL and $46.15 for BHI, the spread stood at $10.97 per BHI share, indicating that the market is discounting a high risk of the deal not being approved.Clearly, both Halliburton and Baker Hughes are critically motivated to see the deal succeed. For Halliburton, the deal's failure would likely equate to the $3.5 billion break-up fee coming due, hundreds of millions of dollars of merger-related costs without payback, and, very possibly, a leadership change. For Baker Hughes, the $3.5 billion fee would not offset the loss of the lavish premium being paid in the transaction. Therefore, it would be premature to conclude that the merger is not happening. However, if the deal ultimately goes through, its cost for Halliburton shareholders is likely to be gargantuan.The outcome of the deal's regulatory review remains uncertain. The proposed merger has so far received regulatory approvals in Canada, Colombia, Ecuador, Kazakhstan, South Africa, and Turkey. However, the deal is still under review in several critically important jurisdictions, including the U.S., European Union, Australia, Brazil and China.Given that the two companies are likely to fight to the very end, it would not be surprising to see another round of concessions followed by another round of regulatory reviews. The process may keep grinding forward for several more months, hence the recent extension of the deadline in the merger agreement to April.It is interesting to note that HAL stock has held up relatively well in the past six months, sustaining only moderate losses. The market is obviously not penalizing the company's stock price, despite the continued slide in commodity prices, poor activity outlook for 2016, and the increased probability that the giant $3.5 billion merger cancellation fee will have to be paid.I have written in my earlier notes that the market may in fact sigh with relief if news about the deal being called off came out. Paying the fee and moving on may not be the worst alternative to paying the premium for assets in an over-capacitated market. So far, that thesis has proven to have some validity.(Source: Google Finance)Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) is perhaps the greatest indirect beneficiary from the uncertainties associated with the proposed Halliburton/Baker Hughes transaction. Customers cannot be completely unconcerned about potential turmoil in certain parts of Halliburton's and Baker Hughes' organizations and are likely including these considerations when awarding new business.In addition, the anticipated further workforce reductions at both Halliburton and Baker Hughes impact employee morale and productivity.What Are The Implications Of Low Oil Prices On The Probability Of The Deal Closing?Arguably, the current low commodity prices are an incrementally positive factor from the regulatory review perspective. While regulators typically focus on market shares, a case can be made that higher concentration of market share in the aftermath of the merger will not create a threat to competitive price formation, the fact that significant excess capacity currently is available in the industry, at least in the immediate term.That being said, regulators obviously will look at the potential change in the industry's competitive landscape with a longer-term perspective in mind.For more in-depth data and analysis of commodity fundamentals, please consider subscribing to Zeits OIL ANALYTICS that provides in-depth analysis of global and North American crude oil market.Disclaimer: Opinions expressed herein by the author are not an investment recommendation and are not meant to be relied upon in investment decisions.

3762156,32971,2015-12-17T07:57:31-05:00,What are the implications of yesterday’s HAL/BHI press release?What is the merger arbitrage spread telling us?What are the implications for the two stocks?,"Important Note: This article is not an investment recommendation and should not to be relied upon when making investment decisions - investors should conduct their own comprehensive research. Please read the Disclaimer at the end of this article.Bad News And More Bad NewsThe key takeaway from yesterday's joint press release by Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) and Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI) with regard to the status of the merger antitrust review by U.S. authorities:While the press release mentions that the DOJ ""acknowledged that they would assess further proposals"" and is not initiating litigation at this time to block the transaction, the statement is an indication that DOJ's concerns are significant and there is no certainty that Halliburton will be able to find a workable solution.Early on in the process, Halliburton proposed to the DOJ a substantial divestiture package, with assets generating up to $7.5 billion in revenue. The company's pitch to the regulators was that the businesses being sold would facilitate a platform for a new major competitor (or competitors) to enter the markets, mitigating the departure of Baker Hughes. The divestiture package was recently enhanced, apparently to address the DOJ's specific concerns.It is obvious, however, that the proposed divestiture package does not come anywhere close to Baker Hughes' scale and scope of service and product offering. U.S. regulators are worried that the merger would lead to reduced competition, higher prices and reduced innovation in the industry.The deal has already faced antitrust objections in Australia. While discussions with regulators are still ongoing, Australian officials have delayed final approval three times and most recently stated concern that the merger would create conditions that allow for ""coordinated behavior.""The status of review by European antitrust authorities also raises alarms. According to a Reuters article last week, the ""state of play"" meeting between Halliburton and European Union antitrust regulators is scheduled for late this week. Such meetings usually take place at the end of the third week of the preliminary review by the EU Commission for Competition where the enforcer conveys its concerns related to the proposed M&A deal. If the merging companies are not prepared to offer sufficient concessions in the course of the preliminary scrutiny (which is scheduled to proceed through January 12), they may face a lengthy investigation which could last five months or more, with an uncertain outcome.The European Commission has been reviewing the proposed deal since November 27 when Halliburton re-filed a request for approval after an earlier application was dismissed due to insufficient data. The Reuters article indicated, citing ""a person familiar with the matter,"" that Halliburton ""would likely be told about competition worries over its bid for Baker Hughes."" Worrying about competition is the Commission's job, so there is nothing in the Reuters article that suggests that Europe's regulators are blocking the merger. However, given the context of the proposed transaction, it is clear that there can be no guarantee that an approval can be won based on the current divestiture plan.The proposed merger has so far received regulatory approvals in Canada, Colombia, Ecuador, Kazakhstan, South Africa, and Turkey. However, the deal is still under review in several critically important jurisdictions, including the U.S., European Union, Australia, Brazil and China.Can Regulators' Concerns Be Addressed?The fact that the proposed merger has led to many concerns among regulatory authorities is not surprising. Indeed, taking a 10,000-foot view of the situation, it is surprising that the two companies decided to pursue such a risky undertaking in the first place.The marketplace - particularly internationally - is dominated by three integrated ""Oil Service Majors,"" Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB), Halliburton and Baker Hughes. While Weatherford International (NYSE:WFT) pursues a similar business model, it remains a much smaller competitor and is challenged by high financial leverage. All the four companies pride themselves on premium technology and the ability to provide a near-full range of products and services to customers worldwide.Service integration, bundling and cross-selling are critical elements that distinguish the four companies' integrated business model.Clearly, a consolidation of Halliburton and Baker Hughes would effectively lead to a near-duopoly, particularly in international markets, of two giant providers who would be able to use their size, balance sheets and dominance in certain high-tech product niches to defend their margins.While the deal promised advantages to all integrated oil service providers, customers and regulators might have taken a different view. In addition, given that both the U.S. and European Union are significant net importers of crude oil, the regulators' concern over reduced competition likely goes beyond their respective domestic industries.A Risky Risk ArbitrageAs one can see from the graph below, the BHI/HAL deal spread ""exploded"" in the past two weeks, indicating the market's view that the likelihood of the deal falling apart is very high.(Source: Google Finance)I should note that from the outset the BHI/HAL pair did not fall within the ""risk arbitrage"" category. The term ""arbitrage"" means ""certain outcome."" However, given the extremely high risk of the deal not being able to gain necessary approvals, the pair was never an ""arbitrage."" Based on my conversations with arbitrageurs, from the very beginning this special situation was not investable for many merger arbitrage portfolios due to its uncertain outcome.Generally speaking, a market-neutral arbitrage trade position would consist of going short 112 HAL shares for every 100 BHI shares on the long side.In my previous note, I provided a discussion of the arbitrage spread. Using September 29, 2015 closing prices of $34.66 per share for Halliburton and $50.47 per share for Baker Hughes, the merger arbitrage spread was ~$7.32 per share, assuming one BHI and one HAL dividend payment captured before the deal's close.For professional merger arbitrageurs, the cost of borrowing HAL shares and the cost of capital tied up in the long/short position can be relatively low. By establishing a neutral merger arbitrage position - going long 1 BHI share and going short 1.12 HAL shares - the arbitrageur uses total capital of $89.29 per pair. Let's assume that the cost of funds for the arbitrageur is 3% per annum on total capital deployed. The arbitrageur would also have to pay dividends on his short position in HAL. If the transaction closed in 4 months, the arbitrageur would have posted a net gain on the trade of ~$6.42, or ~7.2% above the cost of funds in just four months.In the merger arbitrage world, such a high return indicates a very high risk of the deal not closing.In the past two weeks, the implied BHI/HAL deal spread widened dramatically, to $14.35 per BHI share, based on the closing prices on December 16 of $35.83 for HAL and $44.79 for BHI. The market is increasingly discounting the risk of the deal not being approved.It is also quite notable that the market is not penalizing Halliburton's stock, despite the continued slide in commodity prices and the giant $3.5 billion cancellation fee that Halliburton would have to pay to Baker Hughes in the event the deal falls apart.I wrote in my earlier note that the market may in fact reward the news about the deal being called off with a run-up in Halliburton's stock. So far, that thesis has proven to have some validity.What Are The Implications For The Stocks?Clearly, both Halliburton and Baker Hughes are critically motivated to see the deal succeed. For Halliburton, the deal's failure would likely equate to the $3.5 billion break-up fee coming due, hundreds of millions of dollars of merger-related costs without payback, and, very possibly, a leadership change. For Baker Hughes, the $3.5 billion fee would not offset the loss of the lavish premium being paid in the transaction. Therefore, it would be premature to conclude that the merger is not happening. However, if the deal ultimately goes through, its cost for Halliburton shareholders is likely to be gargantuan.Given that the two companies are likely to fight to the very end, it would not be surprising to see another round of concessions followed by another round of regulatory reviews. The process may keep grinding forward for several more months, hence the extension of the deadline in the merger agreement to April.In Conclusion…The unusually wide deal spread is a reflection of the market's collective view on the probability of the merger ultimately closing.As I wrote in the previous note, the deal spread at the end of September suggested that the behind-the-scenes negotiations with the DOJ were more difficult than might be visible to a common observer.With the spread doubling, the market appears to assign a ~50/50 probability to the deal actually going through.Disclaimer: Opinions expressed herein by the author are not an investment recommendation and are not meant to be relied upon in investment decisions.

Merging the second and third largest oil services companies was expected to face numerous regulatory hurdles so the approval delays aren't shocking.According to the official press release from Halliburton, the merger approval requires more remedies in order to obtain a settlement with the Department of Justice. With the suggestion that the DOJ is willing to work with the new entity to find a suitable solution, the market is reading the news as a sign of a likely solution down the road.The news had both stocks up solidly with Baker Hughes rallying over 4% before giving up the gains at the close. The companies agreed to extend the closing date to no latter than April 30, 2016.The additional delay and inability to obtain DOJ approval does heighten the risk for the merger being blocked. The merger already faces hurdles from non-US regulatory bodies. The lack of a deal has large ramifications for the stocks.Halliburton agreed to a $3.5 billion fee if the deal terminates due to a failure to obtain regulatory approvals. At a market cap of only $31.5 billion, the fee would be a substantial hit to the balance sheet. The cash balance sits at only $2.3 billion and would require debt to pay.The biggest risk is to the Baker Hughes stock that hasn't seen the downside from the collapse of the oil market and the related services industry. Halliburton offered a fixed exchange ratio of 1.12 shares plus $19.00 cash for each Baker Hughes share. At a current price of $37.00, the deal offers a value of $60.44 to existing shares. Of course, Baker Hughes would collect the $3.5 billion fee to cushion the downsideAt the time of the merger, the proposed value was listed at $78.62. With Baker Hughes trading at $48.00, the incentive for the company to find a solution is significant. The discount to the $60.44 value is now an astonishing 21% providing a mixed risk/reward for shareholders.Besides these huge incentives for both Halliburton and Baker Hughes to find a solution to close the deal, the $2 billion in annual synergies will help the combined entity obtain the valuation metrics of Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB). The below P/S multiple is a basic way of viewing the gap between the valuations of the stocks that is enormous.HAL PS Ratio (Forward 1y) data by YChartsThe ability to catch up with Schlumberger provides significant upside potential. For now though, the question is which vehicle to invest in to capture that potential. Using the price change of the industry stocks including Weatherford International (NYSE:WFT) from a couple of weeks prior to the merger announcement, the downside for Baker Hughes on a blocked merger could easily top 25%.HAL data by YChartsWith Halliburton already hit with a bigger loss than Schlumberger, the market likely won't punish the stock too much. Baker Hughes is set to swing some 20% either way based on the current stock price. The fee will help, but investors don't always care about the balance sheet with the standalone company is generating losses.The key takeaway is that the willingness for the DOJ to continue working on a workable solution to resolve competitive concerns is positive for the closing of the merger. The recommendation remains for investors to use Halliburton as the less risky way to benefit from an approved merger. Baker Hughes has too much downside risk at the current price to recommend."

        It is becoming increasingly likely that Halliburton and Baker Hughes will have to sell significantly more assets than they initially promised.
        The merger, however, could lose some of its appeal due to a large increase in divestitures.","The merger between Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) and Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI) -- the biggest one for the oilfield services industry - has run into a regulatory hurdle. Halliburton originally planned to close the transaction by the second half of the current year. But last week, the company said that it has decided to extend the time period for closing the deal to April 30, 2016, since the two companies have been unable to satisfy the U.S. Justice Department's anti-trust concerns.Last year, Halliburton said that it would be willing to sell assets that generate $7.5 billion in annual revenues to satisfy regulatory concerns. The two have already put $5.2 billion of annual revenue generating assets on the block, including Halliburton's drill bits, directional drilling and Baker Hughes's completion assets. Halliburton and Baker Hughes have also been mulling over additional divestitures. In fact, in their press release, the two companies said that they have already ""significantly enhanced"" the divestiture package to address the Justice Department's specific competitive concerns which should have been ""more than sufficient"" to satisfy the regulators. But clearly, it hasn't.The regulators, however, haven't closed their doors. Halliburton also said that the Department of Justice is looking forward to further proposals that would allay anti-trust concerns while the two companies will continue to work with the regulators and remain focused on completing the transaction as early as possible in 2016. Though the companies have warned that ""there is no guarantee that an agreement with the DOJ or other competition authorities will be reached.""Halliburton has also not received a final approval from regulators in other key regions - Europe, Australia and Brazil. The European regulators in particular have also not been kind. The company re-filed an application with the European Commission after their previous request was dismissed on grounds of insufficient information, which has further delayed the progress.The merger between the world's second and third largest oilfield services companies faced above-average regulatory risk from day one, and the biggest hurdle is getting an approval from the Obama administration. This threat has been reinforced by the latest update. After all, Halliburton was previously headed by the former Republican Vice President Dick Cheney during days of Clinton administration and was also involved in the Gulf of Mexico oil spill - the worst environmental disaster in U.S. history.That being said, although it is clear that the Obama administration is not eager to let Halliburton and Baker Hughes merge into the biggest oilfield services company of the world, they are not adamantly opposed to it either. If they were, then they would have already gone to court to block the deal. Perhaps the Department of Justice wants to play tough, at least until we hear something from the European Commission by the second week of January, and use this period to put some more pressure on Halliburton in order to extract additional divestitures. I believe that it is becoming increasingly likely that Halliburton and Baker Hughes will have to sell significantly more assets than they initially promised, perhaps twice as much as they have already sold.The merger, however, could lose some of its appeal due to a large increase in divestitures. Remember, one of the key benefits of the merger has been that it would decrease the competition in the global oilfield services market through elimination of Baker Hughes, which could have a positive impact on pricing in the long term. However, if Halliburton were to sell tens of billions of assets, then we may not witness any meaningful decrease in competition.On the contrary, due to the ongoing tough market conditions, additional divestitures at this time could lead to an emergence of major new competitors, such as General Electric (NYSE:GE), as opposed to pure-play energy companies.Nearly every other oilfield services company is currently struggling in the downturn, which makes it difficult for them to acquire the divested assets. Companies such as Weatherford International (NYSE:WFT) and Superior Energy Services (NYSE:SPN) could have been the frontrunner in buying the major assets of Halliburton and Baker Hughes. But the oilfield services companies are more concerned about preserving their own financial health than anything else, which means they simply can't spend $3 billion to $5 billion in buying some of those lucrative assets - such as Halliburton's Sperry drilling business. This makes General Electric the top contender to buy those large assets and emerge as a major competitor in this space.Still, For Halliburton, the merger will be a game changer over the long term. It is the only way Halliburton can quickly catch up with industry leader Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) while significantly growing its global scale and product offerings."

The wide discount could reflect traders' uncertainty over whether the transaction will be consummated.The SituationThe free fall in oil prices and corresponding cut in oil & gas capex have pummeled oilfield services companies. In Q3 Halliburton's revenues were off 6% sequentially; this followed double-digit revenue declines in Q2 and Q1 as well.Source: Shock ExchangeIts merger with Baker Hughes is expected to provide about $2 billion in cost synergies. Halliburton has been groveling with regulators to approve the deal, even suggesting it would divest assets beyond what is already required by the DOJ.However, antitrust regulators are beginning to look askance on the combination of the numbers two and three oilfield services companies; some may be fear that the combination could tamp down competition post-deal. In October the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission feared the combined companies could create conditions that would facilitate coordinated behavior in the market.Last month Jefferies threw shade on the merger after the EU had reportedly been ""asking a lot of questions"" about the transaction; Jefferies intimated the EU could have been concerned that the merged entity would reduce competition at the upper end of the energy services market.

According to oilpro.com, Brazil will do what is in the oil giant's best interest. Pertrobras is partially owned by the Brazilian government and is a source of national pride. That pride has been sullied by a corruption scandal where Petrobras executives were accused of awarding suppliers inflated contracts in exchange for kickbacks. Petrobras cannot afford many more missteps as the country heads towards recession.Secondly, Petrobras has laid off workers and trimmed its operating budget in order to service its $90 billion debt, currently at junk levels. It can ill-afford to pay higher costs for oilfield services to a combined Halliburton/Baker Hughes with outsized negotiating power. Therefore, I believe the merger will receive heightened scrutiny in Brazil.ConclusionThe Halliburton/Baker Hughes merger could receive heightened scrutiny in Brazil. Even if the merger is approved, that approval could delay the deal by months. Avoid HAL and BHI."

        The TWA Treatment could be the EU's smoking gun to kill the merger. Avoid HAL and BHI.","Halliburton employees. Source: cnbc.comThe merger between Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) and Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI) has come under scrutiny over the past few weeks. Late last month the Australia Competition And Consumer Commission (""ACCC"") questioned whether the merger of the numbers two and three oilfield services players would facilitate coordinated behavior post-transaction. Last week Jefferies expressed less confidence in a successful closing for the merger after EU regulators began to ""ask a lot of questions"":I have warned investors about the risk of the merger not closing. The market appears to have come to that realization. At $48 BHI trades at a 21% discount to its implied merger value (1.12x HAL shares for each BHI share, plus $19) of $61 per share. Historically, BHI has traded at a discount of 8%-10% to its implied merger price; the widening spread to BHI's merger price could indicate that investors are also becoming skeptical of a successful deal.The Smoking GunWhen two large companies merge a big fear for regulators is that the merged entity [i] will have outsized power post-transaction and [ii] it will potentially use that power to reduce competition. This may not be good for clients. Halliburton has been punishing competitors in the oil patch, particularly in North America. My previous article informed investors of market chatter from Blueshift Research on how Halliburton was giving Weatherford (NYSE:WFT), amongst others, the TWA treatment:Evidence suggests that Halliburton's management team knows its competitors are hurting. On its Q2 earnings call management had this to say:The TWA Treatment could potentially exacerbate competitors' dire straits.Tale Of The TapeBased on certain parameters like liquidity and debt/EBITDA ratios, there is a line of demarcation between the ""haves"" versus the ""have nots"" in the oilfield services space.Cash & EquivalentsI used cash and investments as a proxy for how much liquidity selected oilfield services firms like Halliburton, Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB), Oil States International (NYSE:OIS), Weatherford and National Oilwell Varco (NYSE:NOV) had to survive a downturn in the market.Source: Shock ExchangeAt Q3 2015 Schlumberger had cash and short-term investments of over $7 billion, followed by Halliburton and Baker Hughes with $2.2 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively. Weatherford and Oil States International's cash balances were both below $1 billion; on the face of it they appear to be less-positioned to survive the price compression. They both derive over 30% of their revenue from North American land drillers.Debt/EBITDADebt/EBITDA is a proxy for how indebted a company is and how much flexibility it has to react to lower prices. For companies with a lot of debt, declining prices and cash flow is even more painful as it limits their ability to service that debt.Source: Shock ExchangeOf the six selected companies, Weatherford is the most indebted with debt/run-rate EBITDA exceeding 5x. Run-rate EBITDA for the chart is simply EBITDA through nine months ended September 2015, and annualized. Weatherford was recently junked by Moody's given its high debt levels and dismal cash flow amid the oilfield services downturn.Oil States International has the lowest debt level at less than 1x debt/run-rate EBITDA. Debt levels at the other competitors appear manageable at 2.1x run-rate EBITDA or less.The EU Has Taken NoticeBased on cash and debt levels, Halliburton is sitting in the catbird seat amongst competitors. It has the heft to sustain price concessions that smaller competitors may not. The question remains, ""If Halliburton is punishing competitors in the oil patch now, what will happen after its merger with Baker Hughes?"" It could get worse as a combined Halliburton/Baker Hughes would potentially wield more power.That said, the EU has taken notice. My article on Halliburton's TWA Treatment was published on August 7th. Website data from clicky.com suggests that as early as August 18th someone from the EU's headquarters in Brussels read the article and visited my website (newyorkshockexchange.com) via a link on my Seeking Alpha profile:Source: clicky.comThe above picture is a screen shot of visitors to my site on August 18, 2015; the information is based on data gathered from clicky.com which tracks website visitors. The fifth visitor (that was actually tracked) was at 12:56pm from the EU. The link the visitor clicked on to reach my site was the Seeking Alpha article, ""Halliburton Gives Weatherford The TWA Treatment.""The following screen shot gives further details:Source: clicky.comThe visitor form the EU stayed on my site for over ten minutes; he/she also read my Seeking Alpha article titled, ""Weatherford Is Worth $4."" Part of the rationale for my $4 valuation of WFT was the company's dismal results in North America which suffered from cut throat competition:The EU has been aware of the TWA Treatment which in my opinion, if sustained, could reduce competition as lesser-capitalized competitors could be hard-pressed to match Halliburton's price concessions.ConclusionI am not surprised that the EU is asking a lot of questions about the merger. I also agree with Jefferies that the EU's behavior could signal it is concerned about whether the merger would reduce competition in the oilfield services space post-transaction.

Both companies have spent months preparing for the merger and Halliburton is on the hook for a $3.5 billion breakup fee if the transaction is not consummated. According to ValueAct, Halliburton will do whatever is necessary to receive regulatory approval for the transaction:Since the deal was struck last year between the number two firms, its approval seemed a foregone conclusion. BHI has historically traded at an 8%-10% discount to its implied merger price. It now trades at a 17% discount, which could mean investors are not certain the deal will close.The SituationA few weeks ago, Jefferies threw shade at the merger because the EU was ""asking a lot of questions"" about the deal. Jefferies interpreted the EU's stance that it was concerned the combined companies would reduce competition at the upper end of the oilfield services space. Halliburton is already offering price concessions in the oil patch; some could interpret this as the company's attempt to use its balance sheet to thwart smaller competitors.Someone from the EU has read my previous article describing Halliburton's ""TWA Treatment,"" which may have prompted a bevy of concerns:At Q3 2015, Halliburton had $2.2 billion in cash and equivalents, second only to Schlumberger's (NYSE:SLB) $7.0 billion. Cash for Oil States International (NYSE:OIS) and Weatherford (NYSE:WFT) was $86 million and $519 million, respectively. Their cash balances pale in comparison to Halliburton's. They also happen to compete in the North American land drilling space where market chatter suggests Halliburton is offering price concessions.Reports suggest that Halliburton and Schlumberger are also considering offering amenities such as [i] extending credit to clients and [ii] covering upfront costs for certain producers. This could put Oil States, Weatherford and other smaller competitors further in Halliburton's rear view. The competition has gotten so cutthroat that Weatherford recently scaled back its pressure pumping operations due to punitive economics:Again, some could take the stance that Halliburton is already reducing competition. Could you imagine the impact that a combined Halliburton/Baker Hughes could have on competition?Halliburton's Groveling Is TellingThe DOJ is requiring Halliburton to divest certain assets (""divested assets"") that overlap with Baker Hughes. With oil prices sub-$50, the sales prices for the divested assets could be underwhelming. This could create a negative arbitrage where Halliburton sells the divested assets at a lower EBITDA multiple than it is buying Baker Hughes for.It all begs the question, ""Why bother?"" If Halliburton is [i] going to acquire Baker Hughes, [ii] divest required assets and [iii] and offer even more assets to divest, then how can the transaction possibly make sense financially? By offering more assets to divest without being prompted by regulators, Halliburton is effectively negotiating against itself. Secondly, if there are no lengths that Halliburton would go to get regulatory approval, one way the deal could work economically is if the combined companies could reduce competition post-transaction.Regulators Need To Send A MessageThe proposed merger would make Halliburton bigger and even more formidable. Commenters on my previous article suggested that the regulators were nothing more than a rubber stamp:Commenters give the impression that regulators should be concerned about how a failed deal could impact Halliburton's pocket book and share price. In fact, regulators should be more concerned about the impact on competition and customers if the merger is approved. This would be a great opportunity for the DOJ and EU to send that message.ConclusionPursuant to how the merger's potential impact competition and clients, in my opinion, the negatives outweigh the positives. There is a chance the DOJ and/or EU could feel the same. Avoid HAL and BHI."

Jefferies recently downgraded the probability of the deal being completed from 85 percent to 67 percent, indicating concern over the antitrust review being run by the U.S. government. Halliburton will have to sell roughly $7.5 billion in assets to get regulatory approval for the deal. More importantly though, it will have to sell those assets to a single buyer.Given that price tag, conglomerates General Electric and Siemens look like the most likely buyers. There is always the possibility of a dark horse bidder like Berkshire Hathaway or Blackstone, but that would be an unusual move for either party. Competitor Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) is off the table as a buyer given the competitive concerns that such a sale would create both from the point of view of the Department of Justice and Halliburton itself.Halliburton is still strongly backing the merger and there is a good chance the deal will still go through. Yet, if the deal does fall through, shareholders can still profit. Baker Hughes' stock in particular would be hammered if the deal falls apart and that creates an opportunity for investors. The stock of BHI is trading in the low $50s currently, but would likely fall to at least $45 and perhaps $40 if the merger with HAL ends up imploding. Investors can play this possibility (or hedge against a merger collapse if they own BHI stock) by owning puts in BHI at $40 or $45. These 'out of the money' puts are reasonably priced and long-dated versions of the puts would increase dramatically in value were the merger cancelled.SLB and HAL both might make attractive short targets as well in the event of a merger breakup, but neither has nearly as much risk exposure as BHI does. HAL would certainly suffer given the multi-billion dollar break-up fee that it would have to pay to Baker Hughes, but this risk is probably already impounded into the depressed stock price of HAL. Similarly, Schlumberger shareholders would probably have mixed feelings about a deal collapse as well, since it would mean a less powerful competitor facing SLB, but also less opportunity for oligopolistic profits in the industry. In fact, Schlumberger has its own merger to worry about completing.In late August, SLB agreed to buy Cameron International (NYSE:CAM) in a deal worth roughly $15 billion. In comparison to the BHI-HAL tie-up, SLB's deal to buy CAM looks comparatively clean and straight forward. Schlumberger and Cameron do not have much in the way of overlap in their product portfolios, and Schlumberger has indicated it does not foresee significant antitrust issues in the approval of the deal. The purchase of Cameron will not substantially transform the much larger SLB, but it does offer a nice bolt-on acquisition at a time when stock prices are very reasonable across the industry.Given the industry circumstances, if the BHI-HAL merger does fall apart, it's likely that neither firm would stay on the sidelines of the M&A game for long. Instead, both Baker Hughes and Halliburton would probably jump back in and look to take advantage of the fire sale pricing on a variety of smaller peers from Frank's International to Weatherford.To that end, Baker Hughes would be particularly well-positioned, given the roughly $3.5 billion break-up fee that it would receive from Halliburton. This cash would go a long way towards letting the ~$23 billion Baker Hughes pick up some consolation acquisitions of its own. In that respect then, even if a break-up in the Halliburton acquisition does eventually come to pass, BHI shareholders may find themselves in a strong position over the long term regardless of any short-term hiccups."
3713176,38631,2015-11-25T09:22:08-05:00,"BHI is trading at a great discount compared to the stock price implied by the deal with HAL.As the decision of the DoJ is due in just 3 weeks, it is evident that the market believes that the deal will not be approved.However, the deal will most likely materialize thanks to a number of reasons.","Credit: Gerd Fahrenhorst. Some Rights ReservedSince oil started falling in the summer of 2014, Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI) has lost almost 1/3 of its market cap. Although the stock spiked when the company agreed to be acquired by Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) in a cash-plus-stock deal, the stock has returned to its pre-announcement level around $51. Therefore, as the implied price of the deal currently stands at $61.95, investors can greatly profit from the pending deal by purchasing shares of Baker Hughes.As a general note, when a merger is announced, the price of the acquired stock jumps close to the deal price. However, it does not usually reach the deal price, thus leaving a potential profit for investors, the magnitude of which depends on the degree of uncertainty of the deal and the time required for the deal to close. If the deal is eventually cancelled, the target stock plunges towards its initial level. Therefore, investors should be very selective in the deals they pursue.Halliburton has agreed to acquire Baker Hughes for $19 in cash plus 1.12 shares of Halliburton for each share of Baker Hughes. As Halliburton currently trades at $38.35, the deal value of each share of Baker Hughes is $61.95, which is 20% higher than the current stock price of Baker Hughes. Even more surprisingly, the deal is in its final stage, with less than a month left for the verdict of the DoJ. More specifically, while the shareholders of both companies have approved of the deal, the DoJ will accept or reject the deal in mid-December. From the depressed stock price of Baker Hughes it is implied that the market believes the deal will not materialize, as the merger would greatly reduce the competition in some areas. However, I believe that the deal will materialize for a number of reasons.First of all, while the recession of the oil sector that has resulted from the collapse of the oil price is negative for the two companies, it is strongly positive for the acceptance of the deal by the DoJ. More specifically, the adverse environment for the suppliers of services and products to the oil industry has suppressed their earnings and has made it almost mandatory to look for economies of scale. Therefore, while the deal might be rejected during good times, it makes great sense in the current rough environment for oil companies. Halliburton expects annual cost synergies of nearly $2B while the purchase will be accretive to its cash flow by the end of the first year and accretive to its EPS by the end of the second year.It is also remarkable that Halliburton will pay a termination fee $3.5 B if the deal is cancelled. Given that the current value of the deal is $27 B, the termination fee is a huge 13% of the deal value, far higher than the usual ~4% paid by U.S. acquirers this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. This high fee only proves the confidence of Halliburton in getting the deal done. Moreover, it provides Halliburton with a great incentive to exhaust all the possible means to complete the deal. To this end, the two companies have already agreed to divest assets that generated $5.2 B in revenues in 2013. Another indicator of the confidence of Halliburton in completing the deal is its recent move with the issuance of bonds for financing the deal.Several analysts seem to agree that the deal will soon materialize. To be sure, Argus recently upgraded Baker Hughes to ""buy"" from ""hold"" with a $78 price target while UBS reiterated its ""buy"" rating and $70 price target. In addition, Oppenheimer and Sterne Agee believe that the deal will soon materialize.To sum up, investors can make a profit of up to 20% within just a few months if they purchase shares of Baker Hughes. This is an exceptional profit for such a likely outcome, in a market that is starving for yield. Thanks to the markedly adverse environment for the suppliers of oil products and services, economies of scale are mandatory for these companies and hence the deal is likely to be approved by the DoJ. Even if the DoJ has some reservations, the two companies will be willing to divest numerous assets in order to merge, enjoy the huge synergies and avoid the excessive termination fee. Therefore, the deal will most likely materialize, probably in December."

My previous article explained why Halliburton's divested assets may not be enough to assuage regulators:If the asset divestitures are not enough to convince regulators that the demand/supply dynamics of the marketplace will not be disrupted, a strong number three firm must emerge.Weatherford's Financial Collapse Could Kill The MergerSchlumberger (NYSE:SLB), Halliburton and Baker Hughes are considered the top three oil services firms. Weatherford International (NYSE:WFT) is ranked number four, particularly for firms with high exposure to land drillers. Post-deal, it may be logical to assume that Weatherford could be strong enough to maintain a competitive landscape. However, in my opinion, Weatherford may not survive much longer amid a free fall in oil prices and $7.7 billion of debt.In Q3, Weatherford experienced a 6% sequential decline in revenue and incurred a $98 million pretax loss. Its North America operations (37% of revenue) are particularly concerning. Loss from operations were $54 million; this followed a $92 million loss in Q2. The competition is so cut throat that in Q3, Weatherford had to scale back two product lines - rentals and pressure pumping - due to ""punitive economics.""$7.7 Billion Debt Load Appears UntenableWeatherford built its number four position in the sector via acquisitions when oil prices were much higher. In the process, it also amassed $7.7 billion debt which is at junk levels. It has nearly the same amount of debt as Halliburton ($7.7 billion versus $7.8 billion), though its run-rate EBITDA is nearly one-third less ($1.4 billion versus $4.0 billion). With debt/run-rate EBITDA at over 5x, Weatherford has the worst balance sheet amongst its peers, including National Oilwell Varco (NYSE:NOV) and Oil States International (NYSE:OIS).Source: Shock ExchangeWhile oil prices and E&P have declined, Weatherford's debt service requirements have not. Its covenant with short-term lender, JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), requires it to maintain a debt-to-capitalization of less than 60%. I believe it has potential asset impairments (goodwill and inventory) exceeding $2 billion. Such impairments could [i] cause a breach of its debt covenant and/or [ii] prompt lenders to accelerate its short-term debt ($1.7 billion).With only $519 million of cash on hand and a $350 million principal payment due in Q1 2016, Weatherford may need about $1 billion to avoid bankruptcy. Coincidentally, Weatherford attempted to raise $1 billion in September to ""pre-fund acquisitions.""ConclusionIf regulators are looking for a ""strong number three"" to compete against Schlumberger and a merged Halliburton/Baker Hughes, Weatherford is not the answer. If or when JPMorgan accelerates it debt, Weatherford's days could be numbered. Its financial debacle may end up killing the Halliburton-Baker Hughes merger. I recommend that investors avoid HAL, BHI and WFT."
3625486,76305,2015-10-30T09:17:35-04:00,Baker Hughes agreed to be acquired by Halliburton in November 2014 (set to close end of 2015).The deal would make it the biggest in the history of the sector.Shares look appealing with a weighted return profile of 26.51%.,"In November 2014, Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) announced a deal that would combine the #2 and #3 oil-field service companies [Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) is #1]. As a prerequisite of the deal, they agreed to sell overlapping assets to the tune of $7.5 billion to pave the way for regulatory approval. Baker Hughes (BHI) is one of the leading suppliers of oilfield services and they operate in over 80 countries. The company has been under tremendous pressure of late citing an exceptionally week market. They expect these conditions to continue through the end of 2015. If oil and gas prices stay at the lower end of their range, we'd expect little activity until we see a pick-up in prices.Rig counts appear to be stabilizing, which could bode well for prices in the future if demand does begin to pick up as we come into the winter months. Baker Hughes has already taken big steps to insulate itself from the decline in commodity prices. Even today's current environment they remain free cash flow positive.Halliburton shares are currently trading at $38.44. Baker Hughes shareholders are set to receive 1.12 shares of Halliburton, or $43.05. When you add the $19 per share in cash to be paid for each Baker Hughes share held, we get a buyout price of $62.05 per share. Of course, Halliburton shares would have to remain at the 38.44 level or higher by the close of the transaction for the buyout price to be at least $62.05. Baker Hughes would receive a $3.5 billion breakup fee if the deal were to fall through.Speculation over a potential problem with the merger did cause shares to pull-back. The merger was initially on track to close by the end of 2015. This looks doubtful at this point. The two parties continue to have discussions with the DOJ, the European Commission, and other authorities. The overlapping businesses is a main concern right now. The combined company would certainly be a major player in the oilfield services industry.The issue of late is the DOJ forcing Halliburton to find a single buyer for the $7.5 billion in assets that they have to sell. As you can imagine, finding a single buyer for $7.5 billion is a much harder task. General Electric (NYSE:GE) and Siemens (OTC:SMQFY) are a couple of players in the industry who would likely make a bid at that high a price -- but there aren't many.The DOJ is scheduled to close its investigation of the merger on November 25th.So is there opportunity as a Merger-Arbitrage Candidate? Let's dive in and find out!THE 4-STEP CHECKLISTEvery merger-arb opportunity is different and must be scrutinized heavily for probability of completion. This strategy is not for the average investor…you need to conduct our own extensive due diligence on merger arbitrage opportunities. To see an explanation of this checklist, Click Here.(11) How likely is it that the promised event will indeed occur?We do not see a high probability of failure given Halliburton's capital position and access to capital. The financing segment of the deal does not concern us. Especially since the majority is from the issuance of Halliburton stock. The sale of the overlapping assets and regulatory approval is what concerns us the most.(22) How long will your money be tied up?The deal is said to close in late 2015. As we get closer to that the date, the less likely we are convinced it will happen by the end of the year. However, we do believe the deal will eventually be finalized. The eventual sale of the $7.5 billion in assets should help pave the way for a smooth transaction. Seeing as we don't believe the deal will be done by the of 2015, Q1 2016 seems like the likely date. At the very least it gives us a larger margin of safety in our analysis.(33) What chance is there that something still better will transpire - a competing takeover bid, for example?We don't see the likelihood of a competing bid coming in at this time (but we've seen stranger things happen). Baker Hughes is reasonably priced in what could be a trough period for earnings. So we wouldn't be surprised by a higher takeover price, we just don't expect it.(44) What will happen if the event does not take place because of anti-trust action, financing glitches, etc.?There are many uncertainties around potential mergers, such as anti-trust approvals, multiple government reviews, changes in market conditions, shareholder approval, and due diligence.If the deal was not completed, we would expect prices to drop to the pre-deal price of ~$40, or a loss of $12.84. We give the deal a 90% chance of being complete based on the parties and terms of the buyout offer.RETURN PROFILEIn calculating our expected annualized return, we'll use Benjamin Graham's Risk-Arbitrage equation that was first discussed in the 3rd Edition of Security Analysis. Benjamin Graham and Warren Buffett have both used arbitrage opportunities. Here are the inputs we use for the merger-arb equation:If we look at the recent quote we the stock is trading at $52.84 per share, $9.21below the announced stock/cash offer of $62.05 per share by Halliburton.We calculate our expected return with the probability of a successful deal ($9.21 x .90 = $8.29). And we subtract that from our expected loss with the probability of that loss occurring (12.84 x .10 = $1.28). This is the expected weighted return which gives us a potential return of 13.26%, or $7.01 per share. To calculate our annualized Expected return we divide that by the expected time of holding in years (6 months = .50). This gives us an annualized expected return of 26.51%.The merger-arb strategy goes in and out of favor. Currently, the merger-arb strategy is very competitive and offers little opportunity. However, it's always good to be prepared to take advantage of opportunities as occur. Baker Hughes may be such an opportunity.BOTTOM LINEThe Baker Hughes-Halliburton merger is an interesting deal. And we do not see a high probability of failure given the two parties' capital positions. The regulatory hurdles are a concern but one we believe will be resolve. This appears to be an interesting opportunity at current levels with a potential 26.51% annualized return profile.In addition, we've seen some investment firms (Wallace Weitz, etc) getting long Baker Hughes as a way to gain exposure to Halliburton at a discount. It's a very interesting strategy. The timing may be off by a few months due to regulatory hurdles and the selling of assets. However, we do believe the deal will ultimately be finalized. Either way, this isn't a horrible level to own Baker Hughes or Halliburton for the long run.To better investing…cheers!WARNING: Merger-arb can be tempting for investors to use leverage to increase their annualized return on high probability events…Resist the urge! Many Wall Street firms conduct merger-arb as their main business and they will normally have 50 or more merger-arbitrage investments at any one time. They understand that if a couple of deals go bad, the winners will more than take care of the loses.Merger-arb can be a very crowded strategy at times. Similar to value investing, it can be cyclical and go in and out of favor over time.The key to merger-arb is to focus on the few deals that are highly probable (ideally ALL cash deals) with minimal regulatory hurdles and an acquirer with a great capital base. And if you're new to merger-arb, watch a few deals play-out over various industries to get an understanding of the deals.If you do invest in merger-arb situations conduct proper due diligence and make sure to spread your risk appropriately. If you are so inclined to learn more about these types of special situation, I highly recommend Graham's writing on arbitrage in his Security Analysis book.Notable Shareholders:Jeff Ubben (ValueAct) | Richard Pzena | Jeremy Grantham | George Soros | Glenn Greenberg | Michael Price | Wallace Weitz | Leon Cooperman | David DremanPlease share your thoughts in the comments section below as I learn just as much from you as you do from me.

3693476,93176,2015-11-17T17:13:19-05:00,"Defensive investors look for companies that have potential to generate sustainable growth in both earnings and cash flows.
        Halliburton’s earnings and cash flow growth has turned negative over the past couple of quarters.
        The company’s business fundamentals look weak; it will post even more losses in the quarters to come.
        This is hardly a perfect match for defensive investors.","Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) has been displaying strong resistance to the dramatic changes in market dynamics. Since the collapse of commodity prices, the company has shown that it is capable of doing business on the back of an innovative product line, extensive penetration, and efficient management.Here the question arises, is Halliburton is a pick for defensive investors, or it is good stock for a retirement portfolio? The answer to both questions is a resounding ""NO"". Let me explain why. I believe that a main product line and business fundamentals are the growth engine for any company and its shareholders.In the case of Halliburton, its business model is entirely dependent on commodity prices and the continued flow of investments in the energy sector. Ever since the collapse in commodity prices, almost all companies in the energy sector have adopted defensive strategies. With the start of this year, these companies have reduced their capital spending in order to give a boost to their cash flows.However, the environment is becoming more complicated every day. These companies are currently suffering major losses due to the unexpected and enormous collapse in oil prices. As a result, these companies are making additional cuts to their future capital investments, following the end of each quarter. They can see that their own entities are under threat from the steep fall in oil prices.Unfortunately, Halliburton's major revenue contributing region is North America, which is the most depressed place in the world for oil and gas companies, because of the high cost of production. This situation has forced oil field services companies to lower prices for their products and services; Halliburton is no exception. The company is offering major pricing concessions to its customers. HAL is desperately trying to offset the impact of these concession prices by cutting costs.Source: earnings releaseIn Q3, the company's sales in the North American region fell 47% Y/Y and 7% Q/Q to $2.49B. In addition, operating income from this region dropped sharply 21%, down to $506 million, compared to the second quarter of this year. Revenue from other regions declined 5% with unchanged operating margins, compared to the second quarter of this year. Its potential merger with Baker Hughes is in progress, which will expand its revenue base.Negative growth in revenue generation is always the biggest concern for any company. However, no one blames Halliburton; the poor market environment is in the driver's seat when it comes to the company's revenue growth. The real concern for me is how long this is going to continue. The company has experienced a steady drop for the past twelve months; this has already drastically impacted its overall entity. Halliburton's CEO recently stated in his conference call:""Our view is that the first quarter could end up being a mirror image of the fourth quarter. So just as the fourth quarter is facing a steep drop-off post-Thanksgiving we expect to see a slow ramp-up beginning in January and improving from there, suggesting that the first quarter could be the bottom of this cycle.If we look at oil prices, they are in freefall. The price moves up slightly on market speculations and then dips down on inventory reports. At present, oil prices are trading at a very low level of only $41 per barrel, while Halliburton's customers in the North American industry need oil back up to least $70 per barrel to make profits. Oil has been hovering around $45 per barrel since the start of the third quarter of this year. This extremely low price has significantly impacted E&P and other companies in Q3, forced them to make additional cuts in capital investments for 2016.For instance, ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) posted major losses in the third quarter and reduced its investment targets going forward. If this is happening to COP, which is among the largest E&P companies, how can smaller firms bear the situation? Overall, I believe oil prices will continue to hover in the $40 to $50 per-barrel range for the coming quarters, which will only further discourage activity levels.On the earnings side, Halliburton is also experiencing the bumps of costs related to asset write-offs and acquisitions, which has driven its net earnings down to a negative $643 million. Cash flows are painting a similar picture. In the past nine months, the company generated free cash flows of only $300 million while dividend payments stood around $460 million. This means the company's free cash flows are not covering its existing dividend payments, which raises a question mark over the stability of dividends, since its cash generating potential is also likely to remain depressed.Halliburton's share price declined with the fall in commodity prices. In fact, its share price is now completely mirroring each movement in oil prices. I'm not expecting any major upside potential to its share price in the next few quarters, due to weak business fundamentals. HAL's share price will remain depressed, since the company is heading toward posting even greater declines in sales and earnings over the next two quarters.ConclusionDefensive investors always look for companies that can offer a steady stream of income to investors, while sustaining low risk. For that to happen, companies need to generate sustainable growth in sales and cash flows. Unfortunately, in the case of Halliburton, its business model is likely to remain volatile, due to the direct impact of low oil prices. The company will continue to experience difficulties in the upcoming year, as its customers have adopted very defensive ways of spending their cash flows. Therefore, I do not believe that Halliburton is a good fit for a defensive stock portfolio, with its dividend yield of only 1.87% and very limited upside potential for share price appreciation."

I believe it has benefited from the euphoria over the Baker Hughes merger.Its financial results have been dismal amid the downturn in oil & gas E&P.Standalone HAL is worth closer to $26 or 30% less than where it currently trades.Getting the merger approved is no guarantee. Avoid HAL.,"Halliburton CEO Dave Lesar. Source: chron.comThe merger between Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) and Baker Hughes (BHI) has been the talk of the oilfield services industry. However, the transaction is not a layup. It has garnered major scrutiny from the DOJ, faces regulatory hurdles down under and required assets sales have yet to be announced. Despite all the hoopla, Halliburton is still suffering from lower oil prices and the contraction in oil & gas E&P.Source: Shock ExchangeThe company's Q3 revenue was off 6% sequentially. This follows a 16% decline in Q2. North America (45% of revenue) was one of the worst performers with a 7% decline. North American land drillers are demanding price concessions from vendors in order to compensate for declining cash flows. Meanwhile, EBITDA was off 16% sequentially despite tens of thousands of headcount reductions.I believe a lot of Halliburton's $33 billion market capitalization is driven by euphoria over the Baker Hughes merger and potential cost synergies. I did a bottoms up analysis of HAL and it wasn't pretty.Halliburton Is 30% OvervaluedBased on a bottoms up analysis, HAL is at least 30% overvalued.RevenueRevenue of $24.7 billion is simply YTD revenue through nine months 2015 annualized. It equates to about 25% less than the $32.9 billion the company reported for full year 2014.EBITDAEBITDA is nine months results annualized. It equates to an EBITDA margin of 16%, down from about 21% for full year 2014.Enterprise ValueThe company's enterprise value (equity and debt) is $28 billion at 7x EBITDA.Equity ValueAfter subtracting net debt (debt less cash and equivalents) of $5.6 billion, I derived an equity value of $22 billion.Per Share PriceI assumed 856 million shares outstanding which was sourced from Yahoo.ConclusionStandalone HAL is worth about $26 per share.

Avoid these stocks.","Halliburton Employees. Source: cnbc.comEach month it seems more news emerges that the merger between Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) and Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI) is in jeopardy. On Wednesday, Jefferies said it had less confidence in a successful closing for the merger:The news caused HAL and BHI to fall 2% and 5% respectively, in Wednesday's trading. The news also comes just weeks after Australia's Competition And Consumer Commission (""ACCC"") questioned whether the combination of the number two and number three oilfield services companies would create ""coordinated behavior"" in the market. A commenter from my previous article dismissed the ACCC as a potential impediment to the merger:However, the EU is larger than Australia and of more importance to Baker Hughes and Halliburton; a dissent by the EU could upend the deal. The market's reaction seems to support that thesis.EU's Concerns Could Be ValidThe EU's concerns could be valid, particularly in certain segments of the North American market. North American land drilling has been one of the hardest-hit segments of the oilfield services industry. Drillers, strapped for cash, have asked for price concessions. Companies like Halliburton which have strong balance sheets are meeting those price concessions, particularly for pressure pumping/well stimulation services. It begs the question, ""How does this impact other players in the marketplace?"" We got a glimpse on Weatherford's (NYSE:WFT) Q3 earnings call; management divulged it had scaled back its pressure pumping product line due to punitive economics:When I heard Weatherford's admission, my first thought was that Weatherford could have been a victim of Halliburton's price concessions. If Halliburton is reducing competition in certain segments today, imagine the impact it could have after merging with Baker Hughes.The Short HAL/Buy BHI Trade Hangs By A ThreadThe frothy stock market has been driven by momentum stocks like the FANGs - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) - and merger plays. The ""buy BHI, short HAL"" arbitrage play has been popularized by hedge funds and individuals who think they are smarter than the market. At mid-day Thursday BHI was at $50 - about 20% below its implied merger price of $63. Historically, BHI has traded at a discount of 8%-10% to its implied merger price. A widening spread could indicate investors' lack of confidence that the merger will actually close.Halliburton must also divest certain assets in order to garner regulatory approval. This provides another major hurdle as the M&A market for such assets could be soft given low oil prices. That said, the fallout from a potential failed merger will be painful for longs. HAL and BHI both trade at EBITDA multiples of 10x and 12x respectively; both are outside my range of 7x for cyclical stocks. By my estimation, if the deal falls through, HAL and BHI will decline by 38% and 48% respectively.ConclusionThe EU is reportedly asking a lot of questions about the Halliburton/Baker Hughes merger. Jefferies believes this indicates the EU is concerned that the deal would reduce competition. Based on data from the oil patch and Weatherford's Q3 earnings call, the EU's concerns may be valid. A failed deal would be ""punitive"" to the shares of both HAL and BHI. Avoid these stocks."

        There is risk of short-term weakness, but the medium- to long-term outlook is strong.
        Based on my analysis the company is fairly- to slightly undervalued.","IntroductionGiven everything that's happened in the oil market since last summer many investors are asking if now is the right time to buy oil stocks.Halliburton (NYSE:HAL), one of the world's largest oil services companies, is down almost 50% since summer last year. This begs the question, is it a good buying opportunity or a value trap?HAL data by YChartsBefore I started working on this analysis I did not know what the conclusions of my research would be. I simply thought Halliburton could be interesting at a 50% discount to where it traded a little over a year ago.I did not write this article with the intention of advising people whether to buy or sell Halliburton shares. I did the research for my own sake, but thought that I might as well share what I found.What I found was that Halliburton is a good company with solid financials and a strong management team. Despite the fact, I have not bought shares in the company because my discounted cash flow analysis shows that the company is currently somewhere between fairly valued to slightly undervalued.As an investor I like to have a bigger margin of safety, so I am not buying at these levels. That is not to say that Halliburton is a bad investment at the current price. I like the company, and I think it has a good long term future.For the sake of limiting the length of this article I have not included the above-mentioned discounted cash flow analysis in this article. However, if you are interested you can download it for free here.The CompanyHalliburton was founded in 1919 and has more than 70,000 employees in over 80 countries. The market capitalization of the company is currently around $33 billion and revenues in 2014 were almost $33 billion.The company serves the upstream oil and gas industry, i.e. the exploration and production segment of the market.In terms of geographical breakdown the company splits revenues into four areas (chart below) and the majority of revenues comes from North America, where unconventional drilling has been a major driver of growth over the last few years.Source: Halliburton annual reportsInvestment ThesisHalliburton is a strong company with several competitive advantages, an experienced management team and solid financials. However, the company is currently going through a cyclical downturn due to the lower oil prices. However, in the medium- to long-term the share price should rebound as activity levels and price levels in the oil services industry return to normal.Halliburton operates in three key business segments: unconventional oil, deepwater and mature fields. There are strong underlying trends driving growth in all of these markets, and Halliburton is positioned to benefit from these trends in the future.Firstly, unconventional oil has proven to be a big source of new supply in the market and will likely continue to be so in the future. However, in the short-term there is a chance of downside risks.Secondly, deepwater oil drilling has been growing over the last years because oil companies now have to scour more challenging environments to find new oil reserves. According to Halliburton's 2014 annual report, deepwater has accounted for more than 50% of hydrocarbons discovered from 2010-2014.Lastly, mature fields account for more than 70% of the world's oil and gas production and with the help of new technology oil companies can extend the life of these fields, which is less costly than finding new fields.Although Halliburton's market capitalization has dropped significantly since the oil market started to turn down, I believe that at current prices the company is fairly valued or slightly undervalued (to see the DCF analysis, download the report from the link above).Industry Outlook - Short Term Weakness, Long Term StrengthWhen oil and gas prices are high, Halliburton's customers have more money to spend and therefore Halliburton's profitability is largely dependent on oil and gas prices (mainly oil).I am constructive on the long-term outlook for the oil services industry, but in the short term there might be further downside. There are several factors that lead me to this conclusion.Wood Mackenzie is one of the most renowned oil and gas consultancies in the world and in a research note from October 9th 2015 they said they expect horizontal rig count in the US to bottom in the summer of 2016 (chart below), signaling that they expect further weakness in the short-term.This is significant for Halliburton because horizontal rigs are used in the unconventional oil industry, which is one of Halliburton's three key business segments, and a large driver of growth for the company. If the rig count is falling it means that oil companies are drilling less, which in turn means they will spend less money on products and services that Halliburton offers.Source: Wood MackenzieMoreover, North America accounts for a little more than half of Halliburton's revenues. If there is further weakness ahead in this market, it will affect Halliburton's revenues significantly.Furthermore, in an article on Naturalgasintel.com from 21st September 2015 called ""Upstream Investments 'Very Much at Risk' at $50 Oil, Says Wood Mackenzie"", Wood Mackenzie argues that $1.5 trillion of investments destined for US unconventional projects may be uneconomic at $50 per barrel. And investments for 2015 and 2016 are already down $220 billion compared to Wood Mackenzie's pre-oil crash projections.As mentioned above, future spending on oil services is dependent on the oil price, which Wood Mackenzie expects will start to recover sharply in 2017 and 2018 (chart below). They do predict the oil price will bottom in 2015, but it won't recover significantly just yet.Source: Wood MackenzieWood Mackenzie's opinions are echoed by McKinsey who said in their ""Quarterly Perspective on Oil Field Services and Equipment"" (August 2015) that their oil demand and supply model suggests a price of $65-85 per barrel is required to meet long-term demand growth for oil of 1% per year. McKinsey believes this price level could be reached in 2017.In the oil and gas industry further short-term weakness is the main concern today. Wood Mackenzie says that the fear of defaults in the North American unconventional market is overblown, but the company does expect further weakness in the near-term. They believe some smaller producers will fail in the coming months, and although these companies will probably be salvaged it will have a negative impact on the oil and gas industry.There has not been a big fallout from lower oil prices yet and a big reason is that producers hedged their production (i.e. they sold their future production when oil prices were high, locking in a future prices). These hedges are now starting to roll over and Wood Mackenzie estimates that for the top 26 independent oil and gas producers in the US, cash flow from hedging will drop from $9.1 billion in 2015 to $2.2 billion in 2016. This will weigh on the industry as producers make less money.The short-term picture for the oil services industry is therefore uncertain, but once this downturn is over it should set the stage for a sustained uptrend.Company Analysis- ManagementDavid Lesar has been CEO of Halliburton since 2000 and has worked for the company for the last 20 years. In 2007 he moved to Dubai, when the company opened a second headquarter there. The plan was to better service Halliburton's Middle Eastern and Asian clients, and it proved a savvy move by Lesar. According to Morningstar.com, Halliburton's annual revenue in the Middle East and Asia has risen from $1.2 billion in 2007 to $5.8 billion in 2014.Management has successfully positioned the company to take advantage of the growth in the unconventional oil and gas industry, and Halliburton is now the market leader in North American unconventionals.Management is continuously striving to enhance the competitiveness of the company and in each of Halliburton's three operating segments (unconventionals, deepwater and mature fields) they have developed products that help their customers improve operations.The management team has proven to be very capable stewards of the company and I expect they will continue to create value for shareholders in the future.Total key executive compensation was $57.5 million in 2014, which is reasonable given that Operating Income in the same year was around $5 billion.- Strong Capital StructureHalliburton's long-term debt compared to its total assets has on average been in the lower 20 percent range for the last five years (chart below). At the end of the second quarter 2015 it was approximately 25%. This shows the company is conservatively leveraged.Source: Morningstar.comMoreover, the company's Earnings Before Interest and Tax has more than covered its interest payments over the years, which is illustrated by its high Interest Coverage Ratio (chart below). This shows that Halliburton does not have any issues paying back their debt.Source: Morningstar.com- Strong LiquidityA good measure of liquidity is the current ratio, which ideally should be above 1.5. In Halliburton's case it's been far above this threshold for the last five years suggesting that the company has no problems meeting it's short-term obligations.Source: Morningstar.com- Competitive AdvantagesHalliburton is one of the premier oil services companies in the world and it has several competitive advantages that will ensure that the company maintains its earning power in the future.The oil services industry is a very competitive industry where price pressures are weighing down on margins. A key to staying competitive is therefore to continually develop new technologies, and Halliburton has been able to do this in each of its business segments (unconventional, deepwater and mature fields). These technological developments have helped improve the operational efficiency of Halliburton's customers.A clear example of this is that Halliburton has captured the position as market leader in the unconventional oil and gas industry in North America. Their ""Frac of the Future"" is now the most effective and reliable hydraulic fracturing system available today.Halliburton also has leading market positions in the deepwater industry in East Africa, Malaysia and Brazil, three robust markets that accounted for 9 of the top 10 discoveries in 2012.As a well-known company with a proven track record of developing competitive advantages through its technological advances, Halliburton should be well positioned for the future.- Return On Invested CapitalROIC was calculated by dividing operating income (or EBIT) by tangible assets. This measures the company's return on assets without taking the capital structure or tax structure into account.Warren Buffett alluded to using return on tangible assets in his 1983 letter to shareholders, which is why I use this measure.It's important to note that given its composition this method will give a higher ROIC than the figures you will get from other financial data providers (e.g. Morningstar.com).One concern I have about Halliburton's ROIC is that it hasn't rebounded to its pre-crisis (2008) levels. Today Halliburton requires more working capital and equipment to generate the same amount of income. The oil services industry is very competitive and capital intensive, and these findings suggest that it's getting more difficult to generate returns on capital. Halliburton needs to constantly spend on R&D to remain competitive.Investors therefore need to be aware that going forward profitability may not be as high as in the past.Baker Hughes AcquisitionHalliburton has said they will pay 1.12 Halliburton shares plus $19 for every share of Baker Hughes. Halliburton currently trades for around $38. This equates to a price per share of Baker Hughes of around $62. Currently Baker Hughes' shares trade around $50.I performed a quick DCF analysis of Baker Hughes and found that each share is worth around $40. This analysis is less detailed than the DCF I carried out on Halliburton so there is a larger margin for error.I used an annual growth rate of 5% to 2025, then a terminal growth rate of 2.5%. The discount rate was 10%. These are the same parameters I used for the Halliburton DCF.So if Halliburton pays $62 per share they are overpaying by around $22. However, the reader should not be too quick to conclude that the acquisition is destroying value. My valuation was conservative and I did not take into account the cost saving synergies that Halliburton's management expects (approximately $2 billion per year), so a valuation of $40 per share of Baker Hughes might prove to be conservative.Furthermore, Halliburton is acquiring Baker Hughes in a down-market, and they are paying a much lower price than they would have done during a bull market.As it stands I am therefore positive on the acquisition. The price might be a bit high, but when a company acquires another it is customary that the acquiring company pays a premium. Management expects to realize cost synergies, although we will only know after the fact if they will be successful. But I trust management to make the right decision for Halliburton and I like that they are buying the company during a down-market.RisksThe largest macroeconomic risk that Halliburton faces is a prolonged period of low oil prices. I believe that we will need higher oil prices for supply and demand to stabilize, but the oil market could surprise and prices could stay low for several years. In such a market environment, oil companies would keep a lid on capital expenditures and demand for Halliburton's products and services would be subdued.The biggest risk under a ""low for longer"" oil price scenario is that unconventional oil companies in North America could suffer and we could see mass defaults since these companies are highly leveraged.Another risk is that the Baker Hughes acquisition could turn out to destroy value for shareholders. Halliburton has more than 70,000 employees in over 80 countries, with a market capitalization of around $33 billion. Baker Hughes has 49,000+ employees in more than 80 countries, with a market capitalization of around $22 billion. These companies are very complex by nature and successfully integrating them can be difficult. We will only know after the fact if the acquisition added or destroyed value for Halliburton shareholders.Lastly, Halliburton could be entering a period where they are earning a lower return on capital, which has been the case since the 2008 crisis. If this is the situation going forward, share price appreciation could be limited.ConclusionHalliburton is a solid company with strong financials, a good management team and potential for future growth. However, based on my intrinsic value (NYSE:DCF) calculations the share price is not at a level where it is trading at a substantial discount to intrinsic value.That does not mean, however, that Halliburton is a bad investment at current levels, and if we look past short-term risks the company should do well in the medium- to long-term as the oil market rebounds."
3607156,95376,2015-10-27T09:37:50-04:00,"We initiate coverage on Baker Hughes with a Buy rating TP of $68. Our assumption is based upon the completion of the merger at the end of 1QFY16.
        We think that Halliburton will see the deal go through due to $3.5 billion breakup cost hanging over its head along with expected synergies of $2 billion following the merger.
        We think that the stock of BHI offer an attractive proposition in the combined entity, which would become the largest oilfield services company.","We initiate coverage on Baker Hughes Incorporated (BHI) with a Buy rating and a target price (TP) of $68. Our TP is based upon the assumption that the merger with Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) will be completed by the end of first quarter of fiscal year 2016 (1QFY16, ending March 31, 2016). At the time of merger, every share of Baker Hughes will be exchanged for 1.12 shares of Halliburton along with $19 in cash.Derivation Of Halliburton's TPCurrently, Halliburton's stock is trading at a one-year forward price-to-sales (P/S) multiple of 0.72x.Meanwhile, Schlumberger's stock is trading at a forward P/S multiple of 1.46x. This reflects a discount of 50.7% for Halliburton's stock. In the past five years, the average discount has been 43.7%. Following the completion of the merger, we think that the discount of Halliburton against Schlumberger will contract significantly. We think that the revenue of the combined entity at the end of FY17 would be $43.6 billion and the forward P/S multiple would expand to 1.65x.We have based our forward P/S claim on the fact that Schlumberger would trade at its current average five-year forward P/S of 2.43x at the end of FY17 and the discount between Halliburton and Schlumberger would contract to 31.9%. This is the lowest level of discount at which Halliburton's shares have traded against Schlumberger in the past five years (as shown in the graph below). Following the merger, we anticipate Halliburton's total shares count increasing to 1.40 billion.Revenue has been forecasted on our average price assumption of $54 per barrel and $64 per barrel respectively for West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for this and next year. Meanwhile, our long-term forecast for WTI crude is $70 per barrel. Brent estimate has been established at $58 per barrel and $67 per barrel respectively for this and the next year. Meanwhile, our long-term forecast for Brent stands at $74 per barrel.This would translate into 2017 target price of $58.30 for Halliburton's stock. Discounting back this value by 18-months to the end of 1QFY16 would give us a target price of $43.80. We have done the discounting at Halliburton's current weighted average cost of capital (OTC:WACC) of 9.8%. As part of the deal, shareholders would receive nearly $49 worth of stock and $19 in cash, making our TP of $68.Outlook Of The MergerWe think that Halliburton has significant impetus to complete the merger due to the breakup fees of $3.5 billion, which would be triggered if the deal does not go through. In order to do so, the company will divest as much asset as required by regulatory authorities globally. On September 28, both the corporations announced that they would divest multiple businesses. This lowers our concerns related to the merger considerably. The revenue of all the businesses planned to be offloaded was nearly $5.2 billion at the end of FY13.However, a new challenge from antitrust authorities from Australia has arrived. According to the Australia Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), a merger between the second and the largest OFS company could create a possibility of ""coordinated behavior"" in the market. This is the third time that the watchdog has delayed the decision on the deal, which will come out on December 27 now. In case of a further delay, stock prices of both entities can be adversely impacted in the near-term. However, Halliburton will do everything to get the approval as it would provide cost synergies of $2 billion and a threat of breakup fees also hang upon Halliburton's future.Recent Quarterly ResultsBaker Hughes reported 3QFY15 loss of $159 million or 5 cents per share as opposed to profit of $375 million or $1.02 per share during same period last year. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters anticipated a loss per share of 14 cents. Revenue declined by 39.4% year-over-year (YoY) to $3.79 billion, which missed consensus estimate of $3.8 billion.The 3Q results showed sign of partial recovery as the company was able to lower its loss as compared to 2Q loss of $188 million or 9 cents per share. Although revenue declined by 5% on sequential basis, the company was able to achieve lower losses due to cost-cutting initiatives.The North American segment impacted most adversely as its revenues declined by 57% year-over-year (YoY) to $1.4 billion. The decline can be attributed to 54% in average rig count as a result of decline in capital spending by oil and gas producing companies.ConclusionWe think at current price of $54, the shares of Baker Hughes do not reflect their fair value. If the merger deal is completed today, for every one share of Baker Hughes, investors would get $44 in the form of Halliburton's shares along with $19 in cash. This reflects an arbitrage of 16.7% or $9 from Friday, October 23 stock price of $54. The historical arbitrage of the deal since its inception is reflected in the graph below.We think that at current stock of Baker Hughes, it is an attractive opportunity for investors to get exposure in the combined entity. Since the announcement of the deal on November 17 last year, the average arbitrage between stock price of Baker Hughes and merger price has been 10.7%. The current arbitrage is higher than the average in the past 11 months. When crude oil prices recorded a six-year low in late August, the arbitrage reached a high of 23.7% or $10.83."
3595736,31441,2015-10-22T18:04:45-04:00,"Halliburton reported Q3 earnings earlier this week.Revenue and EBITDA were down Q/Q by 6% and 23%, respectively.Q4 2015 and Q1 2016 could be worse for the oilfield services space.Until oil industry E&P picks up, continue to avoid HAL.","Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) delivered Q3 earnings earlier this week. The company reported revenue of $5.58 billion and EPS of $0.31 (ex-items). Analysts were expecting revenue of $5.65 billion, but the company delivered and EPS beat. I had the following takeaways on the quarter:North America Continues To WeighNorth America has been bad words for the oilfield services space. The decline in oil prices has cut into drillers' cash flow. What's left over must first go to pay off debt accumulated after the financial crisis of 2009 when credit was cheap. The U.S. energy boom was fueled by high yield debt which has to repaid regardless of the fall in oil prices. That means drillers have to cut capex and squeeze vendors like Halliburton in order to stay afloat.Source: Shock ExchangeTotal revenue was off 6% sequentially while revenue from North America and Europe/Africa/CIS was down 7%. Halliburton's drilling-related businesses have been more stable than completion-related businesses. This is consistent with what we have seen at other firms; drillers' penchant for drilling, but not completing wells, has created revenue declines throughout the oil services industry.According to management, pumping is the most stressed part of its North American operations. Halliburton also expects this segment to rebound the sharpest, whenever oil E&P pick up. However, at oil prices sub-$50, it may take a few quarters before the company realizes any traction in this segment.Halliburton RetrenchesHalliburton has responded to the oil industry downturn by cutting capex and reducing head count. Heading into the quarter market chatter suggested that Halliburton's lay offs could total up to 20,000. Since the beginning of the year Halliburton has cut about 21% of its global workforce -- a common theme throughout the industry. Cost containment measures helped the company maintain its EBITDA margin at 16% this quarter, down from 19% in Q2. Among companies with large exposure to land drillers -- Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB), Baker Hughes (BHI) Weatherford (WFT) -- Halliburton's margins rank second only to Schlumberger's (28%).The company is also reducing its capex to $2.4 billion for 2015; this is down 27% Y/Y. The head count reductions and cuts to capex implies that senior management expects the industry downturn to continue for a few more quarters. It is difficult to convince the market that the oilfield services space is looking up when the vendors themselves are also contracting. Management described near term visibility for the oil industry as murky. This implies that there could be more pain ahead for the company.Baker Hughes Merger Still On TrackIn my opinion, a large part of Halliburton's story and valuation is based on its pending merger with Baker Hughes. Halliburton trades at 22x earnings -- pretty robust for a company in a contracting industry. The merger is expected to generate $2 billion in cost synergies. Both firms have cut costs since the deal was announced in Q3 2014. However, management is adamant that the $2 billion synergy figure is incremental to cost cuts already executed.The DOJ also requires that Halliburton divest certain assets in order to get the merger approved. Management intimated that it is in negotiations on one tranche of asset sales and is in the marketing phase on second tranche. Halliburton is acquiring Baker Hughes at an EBITDA multiple exceeding 14x; meanwhile, median multiples on similar deals are about 8.8x. The risk of a negative arbitrage on asset sales is an indication of [i] how desperate Halliburton is to get the Baker Hughes transaction done, and [ii] how bleak the oilfield services market really is. With the merger, I believe it would be difficult for Halliburton to grow revenues or earnings.ConclusionGiven the negative outlook for the oilfield services space, I would advise investors to continue to avoid Halliburton."
3587086,48411,2015-10-20T18:15:46-04:00,"Halliburton is out with Q3/15 earnings and has concluded its Q3 investor call.Halliburton management, particularly CEO Dave Lesar, put on a show during the investor call that should have investors comforted.Continue to consider scaling into Halliburton via long-dated LEAP CALL options.","Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) recently reported Q3/15 earnings, which were what most covering the energy sector and the service niche had expected. After an internal memo detailing massive layoffs leaked just weeks prior to earnings many knew that the structure of the financial report and the investor call to follow would be that of detailing stress management rather than that of detailing a quarter of operational outperformance. Underlining these expectations was peer and competitor Schlumberger's (NYSE:SLB) Q3/15 reporting just days prior. Based on both Schlumberger's financials and very alarmed investor call commentary the market largely knew that an upside surprise was not coming.True to prognostications, Halliburton revenue and earnings were depressed in-line with sector wide activity levels. Still, even with reporting a 6% sequential total revenue decline and near-breakeven North American operating income (that's pretty scary - operating income declined 21% overall with North America leading the downward charge) there was plenty left to take away from the Halliburton investor call. CEO Dave Lesar, acting CFO Christian Garcia, and President Jeff Miller all provided key commentary on the investor call that I believe speaks volumes about Halliburton's collective macro market outlook, how Halliburton views visibility spatially, and how the service provider intends to drive shareholder value into the immediate term. The following are my key takeaways and analysis.Visibility…These comments define Dave Lesar and really they define Halliburton. Halliburton, like CEO Paal Kibsgaard and Schlumberger, is as transparent as any company in any sector. If Halliburton values one thing, it's its shareholders. This level of frankness and this level of shareholder communication that Halliburton continues to example, quarter after quarter, regardless of sentiment is much appreciated. I'll start by saying that.As for the comments themselves, I think largely this is what many energy sector investors have come to understand the last twelve months. That's especially true for the last 6 months. While the statement above isn't ground breaking from a thought standpoint, it is shocking to hear. The idea of planning is, apparently, out the window. There is nothing of proactive management to be had outside of proactively getting cost structures as optimized as possible and proactively being prepared to do more. To do more layoffs, to do more divesting, and to do more of giving margin. Halliburton has been brilliant in all facets to this point. But of course, Halliburton knew just how bad this was going to get back in February when President Jeff Miller stated, ""…we expect to see a sequential drop in revenue and the associated decrementals that's worse than what we saw in the 2008, 2009 down cycle and we won't be immune to this"", among other sobering comments. The company has continued to give clear, real-time commentary as time and the situation has progressed.That said, there's at least an equal chance that Halliburton will have to do more in the next few quarters. More of the laying off, more of the cost cutting, more of the divesting (maybe even outside of Department of Justice/Baker Hughes (BHI) integration mandated), and more pricing concession making. Obviously that wouldn't do well for Halliburton's already struggling share price. Still, I think if you're going to hear the above words come out during an investor call the company (or one of the few) that you want to be long into that statement is Halliburton.The Shape of the Recovery…So, these comments are in direct conflict with the comments made in the excerpt above. I should provide some context. These comments were made using the assumption that we see a higher and sustained oil pricing that is accommodative of modeling and certainty. I wanted to include this in juxtaposition to the above except to allow readers to have contextual placement of Lesar's thoughts as to what would happen under current and optimistic assumptions.Still, please note that even under the optimistic assumptions Lesar is still not expecting a productive Q4/15 and is only expecting a slow ramp into the exit of Q1/16. That means at least two more quarters of punitive decrementals and two more quarters of likely near-breakeven operating margins. Clearly the operations line is quite a distance from the ""net"" or ""bottom"" line. Factor that into investment decision.My take on this and the above except having so much contrast based on highly variable inputs is that the safest bet for all parties looking to take a long position here, inclusive of those looking to build one, add to one, or hedge a heavy net short position, would be to scale into the LEAP CALL options. The LEAP CALL options shouldn't price down much lower into what might be forward looking 60/90/120 day capitulation for Halliburton equity but should still provide the obvious leverage to capture upside opportunity should it be there. I just don't think betting directionally right now makes sense unless you have a long-runway or margin for error. LEAP CALL options, I believe, provide that.""Drill or Die""…I think you can -- this is Dave, you can argue all the macroeconomics, where is the breakeven price point. I think it's - there's really actually, I think, a different way you need to think about the customer base in North America, especially the independent customer base. And that's essentially with the high decline curves that exist on these unconventional plays. They are really are in drill or die mode…So if you go a year without drilling a well, and your production starts to turnover, you are going to have to start drilling or you are going to have to take your infrastructure apart that you've built up as a company. So I think that as we get to the end of the year, if these guys have money, they are going to drill it up, and that's just the fact that it is…Now, oil is at 60, I think the banks will be more comfortable with extending lines of credit with the debt positions that are there, but I think that the real key is going to be the production declines you see, and when these companies get to the point where they have to start drilling or they have to start dismantling their companies, and they are not going to want to do that.""This is something I've been consulting on since roughly last November (11/2014). With most of my network believing that the Saudi/OPEC driven pricing collapse wasn't going to be short lived the idea of what the hyperbolic decline curves would do to national production, especially for natural gas, was a marquee question during presentations. With the current oil crisis now being the second longest in duration of 45% pricing decline or more the question becomes especially important to be able to answer.The short answer is, the effects are going to be marked. At this point of maturation, holding production on a boe conversion (all production being converted to boe/d - obviously this includes natural gas and NGL) flat might be possible still but it won't be an ""even"" process. What I mean by this is exactly what Lesar, I believe, is alluding to within this passage.I believe the cream of the crop will be able to hold production flat/increase production into just enough hedging and just enough scale to allow for suitable economics. But, I also believe that the bottom feeders won't be able to. Whether this is driven by tighter bank lending, not having any/enough core or highgraded assets to hide out in (read: to migrate to in an effort to offset poor economics and/or high decline curve impacts), or simply having sloppier operations prior (which are contributing to decline impacts) I just don't see anything but mid-level to best of breed producers being able to NOT unwind models into a continuation of the pricing crisis. Literally with each new quarter this crisis carves out we're seeing more and more examples of this. Non-mid-level/non-best of breed producers are selling more and more assets to survive. The phrase burning furniture to stay warm is apt.Lesar is making two points in pointing this out. The first is that ""desperation drilling"" or ""dice rolling drilling"" or however you want to phrase it is good for Halliburton. This means more activity, at least in the immediate term. Yes, it's still good in the immediate term for activity to uptick even if in an unhealthy fashion for the space.The second is that the consolidation of the space is also good for Halliburton. Consolidation would occur when this short-sighted management, the drilling noted above, eventually kills those models deploying it. Why is consolidation good for Halliburton? Because best of breed servicers like Halliburton and Schlumberger (which are in the process or have recently bought close comparable best of breed companies like Baker Hughes and Cameron (NYSE:CAM)) service best of breed producers. Consolidation creates more business for the Halliburton/Schlumberger duo and less competition overall. More business and less competition (which will eventually help with pricing) is a good thing. Lesar, I think quite poetically, pointed this out in the excerpt above.Bankruptcy/Takeover Activity…There isn't much to add here from an analysis standpoint but I did think that this is supportive of my ""consolidation"" bull thesis point noted above. Please take this into account as well.Summary Thoughts…While there were plenty more Lesar gems on the call I'll conclude my note prior to it passing readable length. I recommend a full review of the call for each investor. That said, I think despite another quarter of deep financial scarring Halliburton and management proved yet again to be well-planned, well-spoken, and to be well-capable of leading the company to the other side of this downturn. I exited the call and the quarterly reporting with a sense of comfort that really shouldn't be there considering just how punitive the financials reported were. That's a testament to the quality of leadership at Big Red.Again, I continue to recommend a scaling in of the long-dated LEAP CALL options for all parties not trying to get further net short. For those looking to get further net short this close to capitulation I can only the trade being prospected is shorter term and with a tight stop.Good luck everybody."
3598146,92136,2015-10-24T10:19:52-04:00,"HAL shares have remained resilient in 2015 and have even gained almost 18% in the past two months, but I think investors should wait for a better entry point.
        HAL will face weakness in at least the next two quarters as the North American rig count drops in the range of 15%-20%, creating more pressure on its top line.
        HAL is taking a number of steps to reduce costs, while its BHI acquisition will give it more synergies, but despite these moves, it is burning through cash.
        HAL has become more leveraged due to asset sales and its operating cash flow has dropped substantially, while its valuation is unattractive and indicates a weak bottom-line performance.","Despite the turmoil in the oil market, Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) shares have remained flat on the stock market. This is way better than peers such as Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB), whose stock price has declined almost 10% in 2015. Now, Halliburton's resilient performance on the stock market this year isn't surprising as the company has beaten Wall Street's earnings estimates in each of the last four quarters, and that too by handsome margins.This is despite the fact that Halliburton's top line has been under pressure on account of a weakening rig count as oil companies have refrained from drilling new wells due to weakness in the end market, which has forced them to reduce their capital spending. As a result, Halliburton's revenue last quarter was down 36% year-over-year, while adjusted earnings declined at a slower pace of 30% to $0.31 per share.The key reason behind the drop in Halliburton's massive top line drop was weakness in its business in North America, where revenue fell in half from last year. Looking ahead, the problem is expected to continue, at least in the short run.Both North America and international markets will remain weak in the short runHalliburton will continue facing weakness in North America, at least in the coming two quarters. For instance, the company itself forecasts that the average rig count of horizontal rigs will drop around 15%-20% in the fourth quarter as compared to the ongoing one. More importantly, this weakness is anticipated to continue in the beginning of 2016 before rig activity starts picking up pace later in the year.Now, the expected decline in the rig count isn't surprising as U.S. oil output has started declining, and the trend is anticipated to continue. In fact, next year, U.S. crude oil output is anticipated to fall to 8.9 million barrels per day from 9.2 million barrels per day this year. The drop in oil production will be a result of weak infrastructure spending and a pause in drilling activity, which is expected to continue until oil prices hit $60.Thus, it will be difficult for the rig count in the U.S. to start picking up pace until oil prices improve substantially, and $60 WTI pricing is still far off. On the other hand, international production isn't slowing down either. If we look at the chart below, Saudi crude inventories have reached record high levels at 326.6 million barrels in August.SourceThus, due to persistent oversupply in the end market, a turnaround in oil pricing cannot be expected in the short run.Halliburton is tackling the weakness nicelyHalliburton has taken various measures to reduce costs, which is essential for the company at this point of time. For instance, since the beginning of the year, it has reduced its global headcount by over 21%, which will strengthen its cash flow profile going forward. In fact, in the third quarter, Halliburton eliminated an entire level of management in North America, which will help it improve efficiency and save costs during tough times.Another factor that will help Halliburton reduce costs next year will be the acquisition of Baker Hughes (BHI) for $34.6 billion. Halliburton expects the deal to close by the end of the year, although it might move into next year. Now, the delay in the completion of the deal is hurting Halliburton's bottom line in the short run as its expenses have increased to the tune of 400 basis points due to the deal. However, the completion of the merger will allow Halliburton to recover these costs by selling off Baker Hughes' aging equipment.However, there are antitrust concerns looming around the deal that Halliburton needs to satisfy. According to World Oil, ""Justice Department lawyers reviewing the Halliburton and Baker Hughes merger weren't convinced that the proposed asset sales would be enough to maintain competition in the oilfield-services industry. Overcoming their objections may just be a matter of packaging businesses differently or selling more of them.""In fact, in order to get around the anti-trust concerns, Halliburton and Baker Hughes have decided to sell off more assets. The two companies recently announced that they will be selling assets that generated $5.2 billion in revenue in fiscal year 2013 in a bid to gain approval. As such, both companies are taking concrete steps so that the merger gets materialized. This is why Halliburton is confident of closing the deal by early next year.Once complete, the deal will give Halliburton annual cost synergies of $2 billion, which will help it lower costs further.What should investors do?It is interesting to see that Halliburton has done well on the stock market this year, with the stock having gained almost 18% in the past two months. But, this gain has come in the absence of any growth driver in the end market, so there is a possibility that Halliburton shares will face weakness going forward. In fact, even after the recent earnings report and the expectation of a steep decline in the North American rig count, Halliburton shares have continued rising.In my opinion, this rally in Halliburton shares will not continue for long, until and unless oil prices improve and the merger with Baker Hughes is complete. Additionally, Halliburton's valuation also indicates that the company will see weakness in its earnings performance in the short run. It has a forward P/E ratio of almost 33, while the trailing P/E is lower at 22, indicating a drop in the earnings performance.Additionally, Halliburton's fundamentals seem to have worsened of late, with its operating cash flow declining and leverage rising. This is shown in the chart below:HAL Debt to Equity Ratio (Quarterly) data by YChartsBut, investors should not forget that Halliburton is busy selling off its assets in order to gain approval for the Baker Hughes deal, which is why its debt-equity ratio has increased. However, the rapid decline in the cash flow is a point of concern, and this concern will be addressed only when Halliburton's revenue starts picking up pace.ConclusionThus, in light of Halliburton's recent appreciation on the stock market and expected weakness in the end market in the short run, it will be a bad idea to invest in Halliburton shares right now. In my opinion, investors can wait for a better entry point and think of gaining more visibility about where the rig count is headed before initiating a position in Halliburton."
3583576,22148,2015-10-20T18:31:18-04:00,"Halliburton generated solid operating income during Q3'15.
        The company is positioned to turn the weakness is North America into a strength after the Baker Hughes deal finalizes.
        The investment thesis remains solidly intact and the stock is attractive trading near multi-year lows.","The quarterly results for Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) were nothing special, but nonetheless impressive considering the massive reduction in North American drilling. The question is whether the profit picture is bottoming out with the stock close to multi-year lows.The key investment thesis on Halliburton hasn't changed after the Q3 earnings report. The oilfield services giant is primed for a rebound in the North American market. The company has always focused more on this region and has taken a bigger hit in comparison to peer Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) that is substantially larger in international markets.While Halliburton continues to manage the downturn by controlling costs, the biggest disappointment is a larger sequential decline in North American revenue. Halliburton saw revenue drop 7% sequentially while Schlumberger only took a 4% hit.The amazing part is that North American revenue is down to only 45% of revenue. The number sat at 54% last Q3, but the difference in the investment thesis is that Schlumberger is down to only 27% from this region leaving Halliburton as the clear play on the shale revolution turning into the marginal drilling dollars on an oil rebound.The profit picture remains the important part of the story. Despite North American revenue down 47% from last year, Halliburton produced operating income of $506 million, down only $137 million from the $643 million reported last year.The ability to generate this level of profits before even the Baker Hughes (BHI) synergies is a huge positive. The company beat analyst estimates by $0.04 with a reported $0.31 for Q3. With analysts forecasting an EPS of $1.36 next year, Halliburton is set for a huge boost depending on the merger approval date.Note that Halliburton reported Q3 operating income basically equivalent to the quarterly synergies from the Baker Hughes deal. The real promise of the deal comes from the North American operations where despite the size of the oilfield services giant, the company is still struggling to generate profits.During Q3, Halliburton generated a $47 million loss from the North American Completion & Production segment despite being the largest segment of the company. Even the Drilling & Evaluation segment only produced operating income of $57 million while similar sized international regions produced higher margins.The giant scope of North America is the prime focus of the synergies from the Baker Hughes deal. Halliburton continues to exert that the $2 billion target remains in place despite the combined companies already cutting substantial costs during the downturn. The original forecast is that the new entity can strip roughly $800 million from the North American cost structure of Baker Hughes.Source: Baker Hughes merger presentationThe key takeaway is that Halliburton remains the favorite play in the oilfield services sector due to the strong position in the future rebound in North American drilling. Not only is the service opportunity larger as highlighted in the last article, but also the Baker Hughes deal provides massive synergy opportunities.The stock needs to hold the recent lows around $35, but the recommendation is to build up a position heading into the summer drilling season next year."
3593946,55632,2015-10-22T13:19:58-04:00,"According to Halliburton, prices will stabilize when production activity does.The horizontal rig count, a proxy for U.S. shale, could further decline if headwinds continue.Both financial and policy effects also are playing a role in energy asset price volatility.","Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) CEO David Lesar said in the third-quarter earnings call that activity will remain slow through the first quarter of 2016, with an expected pick-up in the second half of 2016. He alluded to the idea that the oil market recovery, in an attenuated state like 2015-16, may conclude in a V-shape recovery. He stopped short of being able to articulate the exact shape of the recovery, however. International operations, to include land-based business and mature fields, are still resilient. This assessment isn't too different than a prognosis at year-end 2014, when looking at the tectonic shifts in the industry from a services provider viewpoint.While servicing the oil and gas industry is an especially rough road, Halliburton is taking the punches as well as anybody and adapting its practices, execution and cost structure. The flight to quality the company is witnessing is a positive development that sets it up when the market turns around. Lesar also acknowledged that the cost structure in the industry is out of balance, i.e., commodity prices were too low to sustain production at these levels, particularly in U.S. shale. (I borrow this chart below from a BP economist's recent presentation of October 13, 2015.)While declines in revenue were across the board, in North America, the rig count is expected to reduce further if headwinds continue. Horizontal activity is particularly telling in the Halliburton call:We also know that productivity in U.S. drilling and completion techniques have increased considerably over the 2013-15 period as producers have learned how to ""manufacture"" oil. (Earlier articles related to shale leaders' advances by Pioneer (NYSE:PXD) and RSP Permian (NYSE:RSPP) are here, here and here, sequentially.)A Credit ChannelIn a recent presentation by a BP (NYSE:BP) economist, brought to my attention by another contributor, the financing factor of U.S. shale was raised as an issue. I have alluded to the price-moderating effect of U.S. shale production, but the money volatility argument posed by the economist has a notable effect as well. And this known unknown may be one reason specific producers have experienced declines in stock prices that appear unusual compared to the past displays of volatility based more on commodity and economic cycles of the past. Mr. Dale writes:He further notes and summarizes that U.S. shale has introduced a credit channel to the oil market. This is exactly the ""bubble"" for lack of a better word that the Saudi and OPEC market share drive has attempted to prick. The financing of shale oil in a higher interest-rate environment poses an element of uncertainty. But all independents are not equal in the strength of their balance sheets (or acreage), so a sweeping generalization isn't appropriate.Changes to DemandThere are other demand factors that OPEC hopes to influence as well, such as impending climate change policy, but we'll save that for another day. Suffice to say they are thinking of the long-term sustainability of a primary economic engine of their economy, referenced in an earlier article. An earlier ""Outlook"" by OPEC offers clues about demand, but some automakers are posing a different future like Toyota (NYSE:TM). OPEC believes, at least in 2014, that more natural gas, LPG, hybrids and diesel engines will comprise future growth to 2040 than electric vehicles. And OPEC sees the conventional gasoline engine curve flattening from 2035 to 2040, while still clipping upward until then.Interestingly, Argentine unconventionals was one bright spot in the Latin American update, according to Halliburton. And incidentally, Chevron (NYSE:CVX) is active in the Vaca Muerta, one of the top global shale plays outside of the U.S. In the shifts in the oil and gas industry, the majors like Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron have the advantages of energy conglomerates, an academic finding, with balance sheets geared to weather downturns, according to the BP view.Numerous forces are afoot in the energy industry. A bottom-line assessment by Lesar was that prices will stabilize when production does. The financial arguments also are valid as the Fed impact continues to interact with asset choices and the re-allocation effects being witnessed. Recently, non-U.S. oil majors - BP, Total (NYSE:TOT), Saudi Aramco and Shell (NYSE:RDS.A) (NYSE:RDS.B) - acknowledged the climate change challenge as it relates to their industry. Paying attention to the responses to the challenges and insights of leaders at this time is a worthwhile endeavor."
3582246,86456,2015-10-19T11:22:40-04:00,"Halliburton reported adjusted third quarter earnings that beat analyst estimates. The company is working hard to cut costs in a challenging environment for oilfield service companies.The company's merger with Baker Hughes (in progress) should allow the company to generate savings of roughly $2 billion. Meanwhile investments in technology are driving lower breakeven costs for drillers.With oil prices now trading in a stable range, oil producers can hedge production at a profitable level. This should drive new business for Halliburton in the fourth quarter.","This morning, Halliburton Co. (NYSE:HAL) released its third quarter earnings report, posting a loss of 6 cents per share with North American revenues down 47% from last year's level. The world's largest fracking service provider is dealing with the aftermath of the last year's decline in crude oil prices.The quarterly loss for Halliburton is not unexpected. North American energy companies have been reducing spending on new drilling projects as the low price of oil has made it difficult for shale oil producers to profitably drill new wells. In the U.S., the total number of active rigs has dropped to the lowest level in five years.(source: Investing.com)But while Halliburton faced significant challenges in the third quarter, the company's earnings report did have a silver lining. Adjusted earnings - which exclude certain items like asset write-downs and costs associated with its merger with Baker Hughes (BHI) - came in at 31 cents per share. This is 15% above Wall Street analyst expectations for adjusted earnings of 27 cents per share.Positioning For Better DaysHalliburton has been working hard to place its business in a position to capitalize on a rebound in oil prices. The company is focused on managing costs and plans to reduce overall annual company expenses by roughly $2 billion.An important part of this cost-cutting process is the company's pending acquisition of Baker Hughes. By acquiring North America's number three oilfield service provider, Halliburton should be able to eliminate redundant overhead expenses.Ultimately when North American producers begin to initiate new drilling projects, Halliburton should be positioned as the go-to provider for fracking services, and should be able to grow profits sharply. Halliburton's President Jeff Miller had this to say about the current drilling environment:In addition to managing corporate expenses to boost profits, Halliburton is also focused on investing in technology advances that are already leading to lower costs for shale drilling projects in North America.Halliburton's CEO Dave Lesar chimed in on the company's earnings announcement, stating that technology advances and the company's investments in capital equipment should allow the company's North America business to outperform when the drilling market recovers.A rebound in drilling activity may not be far away, as advances in industry technology have led to lower costs for accessing trapped oil reserves in shale rock. While drilling costs vary widely by region, Citigroup analyst Eric Lee recently told CNBC that break even costs in North Dakota's Bakken shale formation have fallen into the low $20's for projects in the area.With North American oil currently trading near $46.70 per barrel, Bakken producers using advanced drilling methods can now generate lucrative profit margins. With these wide profit margins now available, we expect the North American rig count to increase, and for Halliburton to capitalize on this opportunity in the fourth quarter.Crude Oil Stability Could Lead to Q4 Profit GrowthWhile crude oil prices are still sharply lower than they were last year at this time, the recent price action indicates that the worst may be over. North American crude oil futures hit a low of $38.60 in August and are now up more than 20% from that level. More importantly, volatility in oil prices has diminished significantly, giving drillers more confidence that the market is stabilizing.(source: TradeStation)With crude oil settling in a range between $45 and $50, oil producers have had a chance to hedge their production at prices well above break even levels for many drillers. When crude oil briefly pushed above $50 per barrel earlier this month, rumors circulated that North American oil producers were selling forward contracts to lock in prices for future production.Now that oil prices are trading in a relatively stable range, giving oil companies the ability to hedge future production at profitable rates, we expect drilling activity to pick up. This should lead to a strong fourth quarter for Halliburton, and we believe that the company could wind up beating investor expectations and trading sharply higher.Halliburton currently pays a quarterly dividend of 18 cents per share, which nets out to a yield of 1.9%. While the yield doesn't offer investors a tremendous amount of income, it still gives investors positive cash flow while waiting for the stock to trade higher.If Halliburton is successful in ramping its North American business in the fourth quarter (while keeping costs low), the company could easily increase the dividend while still maintaining positive cash flow. Meanwhile, we believe that a relatively stable oil market coupled with falling breakeven costs for drillers should drive growth for Halliburton in the fourth quarter."
3582646,33291,2015-10-19T13:22:18-04:00,"Q3 earnings are our for Halliburton.In many respects the company followed the same pat has Schlumberger but outperformed on key fronts.Despite issues with oil prices, drilling activity, completion and production etc, there is really only one thing that matters with this sector right now.","Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) is an oil service stock that I have traded many times over the years. However, I have long preferred its rival Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB), although both are very similar in many respects. I recently reported on Schlumberger and discussed how despite that absolute bloodbath in the oil sector, and the pain being real, the long-term investor could start to add to their positions strategically. I also discussed how Schlumberger was pulling out all of the stops to cut costs, preserve its dividend and maintain profitability. All in all, I concluded that Schlumberger was very well prepared for this downturn and is prepared to battle poor oil prices for the next few years. While very similar to Schlumberger, Halliburton has unique differences. It provides a range of services and products for the exploration, development, and production of oil and natural gas to oil and gas companies all over the globe, but has also suffered the pain that Schlumberger has endured despite unique operating differences.Source: Arabianoilandgas.comThe pain has been real. Pull any 3, 6 or 12 month chart. It hurts. But it doesn't matter where a stock has been it matters where it is going. So let's talk about the company's recent performance. With oil prices so low of late, it has crushed the company. Simply put, the higher the price the better. That's true for all of the oil names. But because oil has dropped so much, expectations for the company have declined as well. That said, like Schlumberger, Halliburton missed on revenues but beat expectations on the bottom line.So what kind of numbers are we talking about? Well, not to burst anyone's bubble, but even though it beat earnings, a comparison to last year is enough to put anyone into a depression. That said, it should surprise no one. Quarter-over-quarter it was painful too. The company saw income from continuing operations in its third quarter of $265 million. This translated to $0.31 per share. Still, this beat analyst estimates by $0.04 per share. For those paying attention, this income is down from Q2 2015 which saw $380 million, or $0.44 per share. Adjusted operating income was $506 million in Q3 2015, down from the adjusted operating income of $643 million in the Q2 2015. Halliburton's total revenue in the third quarter of 2015 was $5.6 billion, compared to $5.9 billion in the second quarter of 2015.So just how did Halliburton get here and beat earning by this much? Well, it managed to control expenses. This is the key right now. The key to this name is its expenses and the company has slashed its expenditures in just about every category. That's really all that matters in the short-run. That said, it also delivered strong revenues that slightly missed expectations. Despite being down 36% year-over-year, revenues came in at $5.6 billion and narrowly estimates by $60 million. This is the same exact pattern of earnings that Schlumberger saw. Severe year-over-year declines in revenues that just missed expectations while beating on the earnings front. Now take the headline numbers for what you will, it is a testament to reduced expenditures and solid management. What I think is important to focus on is how the company did in specific areas.It is no surprise that operating income declined as a result of lower activity levels for all product lines, exacerbated by pricing declines, primarily in North America. In North America, revenue declined 7% quarter-over-quarter. It is important to note that operating income was at near breakeven levels. Although prices worsened in the quarter the impact to margins were less severe than previous downturns, demonstrating that Halliburton's cost reduction initiatives are helping to offset the current market challenges. This was similar to what Schlumberger saw. In Latin America weakness was driven by reductions in Mexico. Revenue and operating income were both down 4% in this region. The company also noted that its profitability in its Europe/Africa/CIS region continues to be strong, due to activity improvements in Eurasia and Norway. Projects in the Middle East are moving forward as planned. The quarter, as a whole, was superior to my preferred Schlumberger. Commenting on the quarter, Jeff Miller, President, said:Looking ahead there is no sign that oil is going to rebound in the near-term. That fact is, considering what has happened in the sector, Halliburton is doing very well. Its quarter was superior to Schlumberger's but the pain is real. The overall global economic outlook continues to be mixed. The gap between oil supply and demand had narrowed in recent months, which could help prices. I continue to expect positive developments from the Baker Hughes deal, but once it closes we will have to watch and see how the company prepares for integrating that company's infrastructure. Unfortunately there is more uncertainty ahead, but I have a hold rating on the stock at present on the stock. On sharp declines the long-term investor could consider adding to a position. Until the turn-around in oil, keep an eye on expenses, which continue to be well managed by Halliburton. Expenses are the key right now. They are the only thing you need to know about right now.Note from the author: Christopher F. Davis has been a leading contributor with Seeking Alpha since early 2012.

The current estimate consensus, according to Thomson Reuters, is for a 35.1% drop in revenue to $5.65 billion, accompanied by a 76.5% dive in earnings to $0.28 a share.Despite all the headwinds, HAL managed to outpace expectations in Q2 on both the top and bottom lines. Industry analysts attribute that to HAL's cost controls and higher margin technology but note that the company warned then that Q3 would be under pressure.Oil, Oil EverywhereCrude oil supply continues to be the big issue even after published reports in recent sessions implied that persistently weak prices were starting to dent production plans. Still, the U.S. Energy Information Administration this week showed crude stocks grew by 7.6 million barrels last week, the highest increase in six months. Oil supplies are holding near record levels and so-so demand has worsened its price outlook. Earlier this week, the International Energy Agency, in its closely-watched monthly oil market report, cut its forecast for oil demand growth for next year by about 200,000 barrels a day compared to its previous outlook issued in September.Analysts and traders are anxious to hear HAL's outlook for Q4 and beyond. The continued volatility in oil prices-back below $50 a barrel in U.S.-traded futures after a brief flirt with crossing above that line-leaves HAL in a position to soothe, or further ruffle, investor sentiment. Wall Street will also be listening for more information on its proposed merger with competitor Baker Hughes (BHI).Figure 1: Trending Lower for Now.

A year ago, MS turned in $0.65 per share earnings on $8.7 billion in revenue.Unlike its competitors, MS's trading department has been growing revenues, which were up roughly 28% in Q2, according to company reports; analysts believe that helped the firm beat Wall Street's earnings expectations. Will the same hold true for Q3?MS stock is flat on a year-over-year basis and is down more than 17% from its 52-week high in mid-July.

The next deadline is December 27th.If the transaction is not approved or is delayed further, shares of HAL and BHI could free fall.Avoid HAL and BHI.","Halliburton CEO Dave Lesar. Source: chron.comAccording to Reuters, Australia's antitrust regulator raised concerns about Halliburton's (NYSE:HAL) proposed $35 billion acquisition of Baker Hughes (BHI), creating another setback for the blockbuster deal; the transaction still has not been approved in the U.S. The Australia Competition and Consumer Commission (""ACCC"") fears that a combination of the number two and number three players in oil services could create conditions that would facilitate coordinated behavior in the market:Having delayed the ruling for the third time, the ACCC will make a final ruling on December 17th. In my opinion the ACCC has a right to be concerned. Why would the number two and number three players attempt to combine if not to eliminate competition in the marketplace?On its Q3 earnings call Halliburton's management reaffirmed its confidence that the transaction would be approved. Given the international presence of both firms, it would require a linear programming model to prove that the merger would not eliminate competition in every market that both firms compete in. If the ACCC does not approve the merger, or delays it further, the shares of both firms would fall for the following reasons:HAL, BHI Value Driven By $2 Billion In SynergiesHaving been hurt by cuts in oil & gas E&P, the oilfield services space is in a protracted downturn. Baker Hughes and Halliburton both reported dismal results in Q3. Halliburton's revenue declined 6% sequentially. It recorded a net loss of $53 million, versus earnings of $54 million in Q2. Baker Hughes' revenue was off 5% sequentially. It recorded a net loss of $159 million versus a net loss of $188 million in Q2. Things could worsen next quarter. Schlumberger's (NYSE:SLB) CEO believes E&P will be lower in Q4 2015 and Q1 2016:HAL trades at 22x earnings. BHI's earnings are so miniscule that a multiple of earnings is nearly irrelevant. Why would investors be so eager to own these shares with such dismal financial results? In my opinion, longs are assuaged by the potential earnings the merger could generate after factoring in $2 billion of proposed cost synergies.Over the past 12 months BHI has been one of the best performing stocks in the in oilfield services space. It had a flat return, versus a 20% decline for Schlumberger, a 30% decline for Halliburton and a 45% decline for National Oilwell Varco (NYSE:NOV). Baker Hughes has been buoyed by its agreed upon merger price with Halliburton, which was set when oil prices were much higher. Sans the merger, I believe BHI and HAL both would have underperformed the S&amp;P 500 by a much wider margin.HAL And BHI Could Trade Closer To Their Intrinsic ValuesAgain, BHI's valuation is driven more by its merger price. Just prior to earnings that merger price valued BHI at about 16x EBITDA:I previously valued BHI at 7x run-rate EBITDA or $25 per share -- more than 50% off its current price of $55.59. If the transaction is not approved or is delayed further, I believe BHI will trade closer to its intrinsic value. At 7x EBITDA I think Halliburton is worth around $30, or 19% below its current price. I my opinion, this potential loss of principal is too much to bear for known risks.ConclusionThe news of regulatory pitfalls down under will likely drive BHI and HAL lower. The potential downside of the merger not being approved or delayed further is real. I recommend that investors continue avoid BHI and HAL."
3565116,32001,2015-10-12T05:05:27-04:00,"Schlumberger, first oil-related major to report this week.2016 EPS and revenue estimates are still falling for both companies.SLB's dividend is between 25% and 30% of free cash flow, so it should be safe.HAL's dividend is sustainable with capex reductions and Baker-Hughes ""synergies.""","Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB), the oil services giant will report its calendar Q3 2015 financial results after the bell on Thursday, October 15, 2015, per Briefing.com.SLB will be the first of the oil majors to report its 3rd quarter; thus, there will be many on the Street that will want to hear its guidance for Q4 2015 as well as its early thoughts on 2016.Reviewing my notes on SLB's Q2 2015, it looks like SLB management thought - at that time - that Q3 2015 would be the bottom for the crude oil price and presumably fundamentals for the sector.As someone who took a position in the XLE and smaller positions in SLB and Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) in late September, for longer-term accounts, I have to be honest and say that - upon reviewing the trends on 2016 and 2017 earnings per share (EPS) and revenue estimates for both companies - the continued negative revisions were unsettling.Here are all the key numbers in a couple of tables:Schlumberger:EPS and revenue estimates based on consensus estimates. Revenue estimates in billions of dollarsHalliburton:EPS and revenue estimates based on consensus estimates. Revenue estimates in billions of dollarsThe surprising aspect to the above EPS and revenue trends for both SLB and HAL, is the sudden, sharp deceleration in 2016 growth rates, after there was an increase in EPS estimates after the March 2015 quarter.The big question remains for both these companies, ""How will 2016 look in terms of revenue and EPS growth?"" and while, for a while it looked like next year might see a rebound in growth, those prospects are rapidly declining.Quick look at Cash Flow:SchlumbergerHalliburtonDollars in billions, all figures 4-quarter trailingA quick analysis of the above numbers should leave the reader with the impression that SLB's cash flow is more stable, and after returning capital, SLB has had some excess cash to work with. HAL, on the other hand, tends to make big share repos all at one time, and doesn't have much of a dividend.This is borne out by the credit ratings: SLB sports a AA- credit rating from Moody's while Halliburton sports an ""A"" rating from Standard & Poor's.My own perspective is both companies will continue to protect the dividend first by reducing ""capex"" since with the supply of crude and nat gas, exploration opportunities will continue to shrink, and it is highly likely that any share repo plans will likely disappear as well.There is no question that the SLB's dividend is safer than Halliburton's at this point, although with the Baker Hughes acquisition, HAL gets scale and the opportunity to take expenses out of duplicate operations.In a shrinking market like oil services, scale and expense management will be key over the next few years.Valuation table comparison:In terms of the (static) valuation metric comparison, SLB continues to get the edge mainly on the cash flow generation and stability.With Baker Hughes, HAL can't be ignored, even though Morningstar considers this a narrow moat business.Technical analysis:For me, where both stocks will get very interesting is a test of the 2012 lows, where SLB traded down to $60 and HAL traded down to $26 per share. At these levels, which came about even though crude was much higher priced than it is today (North American margins came under pressure in 2012 and cash flow became crimped), the question will be do both stocks get lifted to a 4%-5% allocation within client accounts ?Here are the longer-term charts of both companies:Summary/conclusion: There is no question that at this stage of the downturn I'd favor SLB over HAL, thanks to cash-flow metrics, and the safety of the dividend, but the declining 2016 numbers leaves me anxious that the bottom is not in for the stocks or the sector.Those 2012 lows should be key technical support, but they remain considerably lower for both SLB and HAL.If you want to own one stock, through heck or high water, no question it would be SLB today, but I want to wait and see what the 2016 and 2017 numbers look like after the Q3 2015 earnings report.The intriguing aspect to HAL is the BHI acquisition, and the opportunities that the merger presents to HAL to preserve margins, reduce redundant operations, and improve cash-flow stability."

Analysts expect revenue of $5.65 billion and EPS of $0.28. The revenue expectation implies a decline of 4.5% in comparison to the $5.92 billion reported in Q2. The following are key items investors should focus on during the quarter:Foreign Currency Headwinds55% of Halliburton's revenue is derived from outside North America.Source: Shock ExchangeThat may be problematic this quarter and next. Investors have been fleeing emerging markets due to their dependence upon China whose economic growth is slowing. That capital flight has caused a sharp depreciation in emerging markets' currencies.The Brazilian real, Russian ruble and the euro have been the biggest decliners. Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and Kimberly-Clark (NYSE:KMB) experienced Q2 revenue declines of 10% and 8%, respectively, due to weakening international currencies. I expect Halliburton to experience similar woes this quarter.In addition, Schlumberger's (NYSE:SLB) Q3 revenue fell 6% sequentially due to persistent pricing pressure in both North America and the International area. Declining prices in North America have stymied Halliburton for a few quarters now, but pricing in international markets have been relatively stable; this does not bode well. Foreign currency headwinds, amplified by ""persistent pricing pressure"" could cause the company to miss Q3 revenue estimates. If Halliburton misses estimates or gives weak guidance, the stock could experience a sharp sell-off.EBITDA MarginsIn Q2, the company's normalized EBITDA margin improved from 15% to 18% due to a reduction in headcount and other cost containment measures. Market chatter suggests that Halliburton could lay off up to 20,000 people when all cuts have been finalized - the size of a small town. Such sizeable layoffs imply that the downturn in the oilfield services space could be longer than previously thought. I believe the company will be hard pressed to maintain EBITDA margins amid currency headwinds and competitive pricing pressure. I would expect EBITDA margins to decline going forward, making its 22x P/E multiple - consistent with that of a growth stock - unjustifiable.Conclusion""Persistent pricing pressure"" - amongst other things - will haunt Halliburton longs this quarter. Avoid the stock."

The company ended up beating analysts' earnings estimate of $0.27 per share but missed on revenue estimate of $5.64 billion, according to data compiled by Thomson Reuters.Halliburton's revenues and earnings were dragged by a poor show in North America where drilling activity has fallen sharply due to the slump in oil prices. Halliburton's revenues in this region fell by 47.3% from the same quarter last year to $4.89 billion while operating income dropped from $906 million to just $8 million, due in large part to the weakness in completion and production unit.Analysts were already expecting a large drop in operating margins due to the reduced drilling activity and pricing pressure in North America. In a research report emailed to me, Oppenheimer's analyst James Schumm predicted 2% margin, which would have been significantly lower than last year's 19.2%. But Halliburton failed to meet these estimates by a big margin when it reported North America margins of just 0.3%. It appears that pricing pressure, particularly in pressure pumping, has been greater than market's expectations.Bright spotsThe disappointing performance in North America is clearly a cause of concern, given Halliburton has historically generated a majority of its revenues and earnings from this market, unlike Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) which has greater exposure to international markets. Moreover, North America market will remain subdued throughout the current year. During the conference call, the company has warned that ""activity levels could drop substantially in the last five weeks of the year."" Halliburton, therefore, will likely continue to struggle.However, a deeper look inside Halliburton's results reveals that its performance wasn't all that bad. The company's completions related activity has actually fallen by 18% since last year's peak in November, outperforming the 58% decline in the U.S. land rig count in the same period. Halliburton is also carrying excess capacity as it prepares for its merger with Baker Hughes (BHI), and this has dragged the region's margin by 400 basis points.Moreover, Halliburton also managed to deliver a strong performance in the international markets, but this time, unlike the second quarter, the company outperformed its bigger rival Schlumberger in terms of changes in revenues and margins. Revenues declined by 22.2% from last year to $3.09 billion while operating income fell by just 9.7% to $556 million. Operating margins actually improved from 15.5% last year to 18%.Drilling & Evaluation business also seems to be holding up well, making up for the struggling completion and production business. The former segment witnessed 27% decline in revenues and just 11% lower earnings before interest and taxes.Upside aheadBut more importantly, Halliburton now sees light at the end of this tunnel. During the conference call, Dave Lesar, Halliburton's CEO said that the first quarter of 2016 could actually be a ""mirror image"" of the fourth quarter. Activity will likely drop sharply in the fourth quarter, but it will begin to pick up in January and would slowly ramp up from there. On a bigger scale, just like the first quarter of 2016, the entire calendar year 2016 could end up being a mirror image of 2015. In other words, the first quarter of 2016 could be the bottom of this cycle. Therefore, this might be a good time to load up on Halliburton stock while it trades near 52-week lows of $31.Remember, for Halliburton, the Baker Hughes merger is a major catalyst at work that could push its shares higher by 2017. The merger process hasn't exactly gone on smoothly, but this was anticipated given the marriage between two of the world's biggest oilfield services companies faced above average regulatory risk from day one. But Halliburton is inching closer towards a successful merger. By 2017, Halliburton would have significantly grown its size, achieved a number of cost synergies while the market conditions would have improved, which will justify higher valuation."
3531306,48411,2015-09-24T11:52:30-04:00,"Two days ago, my network provided me access to an internal Halliburton memo detailing layoffs coming over the next two weeks.I've since come to find out that the layoffs could number into the 20,000 range and that Houston area layoffs could be starting as early as today.Because the triggering event for these layoffs is still unknown, but could be stemming from potentially concerning developments, I recommend a hold or an avoid of Halliburton shares.","Two days ago, my oil and natural gas contact network allowed me access to an internal Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) document that was sent out by Halliburton President Jeff Miller to the company-wide employee base.This internal memo summarized the commodity pricing downturn driven structural pressures that the company is under as well as cost reduction measures HAL would take to help remedy some of the structural stress pressing down on its share price. Of course, Halliburton is also in the midst of acquiring Baker Hughes (BHI), which has provided its own equity pressure addition in the form of short selling coming from parties doubting the success of the transaction, as well as those hedging the merger spread.Since I published this memo for public viewing, and it was immediately sent out to my Seeking Alpha follower base via Seeking Alpha's new contributor messaging function, Suzanne Edwards of the Houston Business Journal has confirmed with a Halliburton spokesperson that the memo is accurate and was sent out by Miller.The spokesperson, from what I gather from Edwards' reporting, did not confirm or deny the memo-stated ""two week"" window before layoffs would start. That said, I've since come to find out from members of my oil and natural gas network that Halliburton has blocked off time today (September 24, 2015) for ""HR people"" to begin ""addressing"" certain working verticals within the Houston office. From my understanding, these ""meetings"" are not limited to any single division within the local area. I've also come to find out that at least some international layoffs have taken place over the last two days (since Monday, September 22, 2015). A very credible source of mine has told me Halliburton could let go up to 20,000 employees on a global basis when all cuts have been finalized. So, while the memo did state that workers being cut would receive notification over the next ""two weeks,"" it appears that the cutting has already started. Again, this closely follows Williston Herald confirmed layoffs in North Dakota from just a few days ago.I continue to view this development as multi-directional, but a development that is bullish under only a single circumstance, even saying that is asking for analysts to lean hard into the idea that maintaining the status quo is bullish. Only under the assumption that these cuts are being made from strictly a defensive posturing to the probability of a ""lower for longer"" oil pricing and energy activity environment could this development be viewed as anything but highly concerning. This is, it should be noted, something that Halliburton had stated it might consider as a way to relieve its operating structure and equity pricing of stress. Both Miller and SVP of Finance/acting-CFO Christian Garcia were open about this in addressing the analyst community at the Barclays CEO Energy-Power Conference.Now, if these cuts are being made either in reaction to the recently canceled Weatherford (WFT) attempt to raise ~$1 billion in funding - presumably Weatherford planned to bid for Halliburton assets that must be divested to meet a Baker Hughes merger mandate set in place by the Department of Justice, or in reaction to deteriorated visibility into the Baker Hughes merger in general - something that a Halliburton spokesperson adamantly denied to Suzanne Edwards of the Houston Business Journal; this development should be viewed as highly concerning. Analysis of this development should also include the realization that Weatherford being removed as an asset off-take candidate might have triggered reduced Baker Hughes merger visibility in that this would leave only one at least obvious off-take partner to be negotiated with - General Electric (NYSE:GE).Remember, should Halliburton not be able to close this transaction, the company is on the hook for a $3.5 billion reverse termination fee.In that the cause of these layoffs to come can't be addressed with certainty, and that the company has yet to officially comment, I have to recommend an immediate-term avoid of Halliburton's equity. I'll continue to update readers and followers as new information is discovered.Good luck everybody."
3557976,31441,2015-10-07T18:30:20-04:00,"Halliburton's acquisition of Baker Hughes was set when oil prices were above $100.
        Merger terms value BHI at 16.0x run-rate EBITDA, while comparable deals since the oil price slump were priced at 8.8x EBITDA.
        The buyout multiple could be untenable and Baker Hughes' dismal financial results suggest it could be a broken property.
        Halliburton may have a fiduciary responsibility to kill the deal. I am short BHI.","Halliburton CEO Dave Lesar. Source: chron.comI am bearish on the pending merger between Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) and Baker Hughes (BHI). The transaction was struck in Q3 2014 when oil prices were above $100; now that prices are 60% off their Q2 2014 peak, BHI is worth much less than it was nearly a year ago. I still believe the transaction could be in trouble for the following reasons:Baker Hughes Has Been Hard Hit By Oil Industry ContractionAccording to consultancy firm Wood MacKenzie, upstream investment has declined by about $220 billion for 2015 and 2016 versus estimates prior to the oil price decline; another $1.5 trillion in projects could be uneconomical at oil prices below $50. That said, Baker Hughes' financial results have been hard-hit by the oil industry contraction. Q2 revenue fell 14% Y/Y to 4.0 billion from $4.6 billion in the year earlier period. Though ""normalized"" EBITDA was flat at $459 million due to cost cutting, if revenue continues to decline the company may lose the benefits of scale.Secondly, its run-rate EBITDA of $1.8 billion (first half 2015 EBITDA annualized) is 61% off the $4.7 billion achieved in full-year 2014. Such dismal results gives me the impression that the Baker Hughes could be a broken property, representing a material adverse change to the business.16x Run-Rate EBITDA Multiple Could Be UntenableBased on 7.0x Baker Hughes' run-rate EBITDA, I believe the company's intrinsic value is about $25 per share. However, Halliburton's merger agreement values BHI at an enterprise value of $29 billion or 16.0x run-rate EBITDA:Halliburton agreed to pay [i] 1.12x HAL for each BHI share, plus [ii] $19 per share. The $19 per share price -- regardless of Baker Hughes' financial results -- sets somewhat of a mini-floor on BHI's merger price. That said, the 16.0x EBITDA multiple seems like a misprint given that the median multiple for comparable deals since the oil price slump is about 8.8x EBITDA.Notable oil-related acquisitions in 2015 were the Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB)/Eurasia Energy transaction (priced at 5.2x EBITDA, but never closed), Noble Energy's (BATS:NOBL) acquisition of Rosetta Resources, and Schlumberger's acquisition of Cameron International (NYSE:CAM). Of the three deals, the Cameron transaction had the highest multiple at 10.6x EBITDA.In my opinion, all three comparable deals reflected the decline in the targets' business prospects after the oil price slump. The HAL/BHI transaction at 16.0x is nearly twice the median multiple of comparable deals, implying that Halliburton may be overpaying for BHI.The ""buy BHI, short HAL"" carry trade is popular amongst arbitragers; as long as the transaction is approved, they could make out handsomely on their trade. The popular narrative would imply that Halliburton's management team exists to make money for arbitragers and not shareholders. However, if Halliburton's financial results or its share price suffer post-transaction, Halliburton could be exposed to shareholder complaints and/or lawsuits.ConclusionIn addition to scrutiny from the DOJ, Halliburton's buyout multiple for Baker Hughes could be an impediment to consummating a deal. The deal's 16.0x EBITDA multiple is over 80% more than that of comparable transactions. Halliburton's management may be forced to revisit the transaction to ensure it remains in the best interest of shareholders. I am short BHI on the thesis that the transaction will not close on the agreed upon terms."
3542236,32971,2015-10-01T08:25:09-04:00,"The closing of the merger between Halliburton and Baker Hughes increasingly looks like an early 2016 event.The spread implies a ~27% annualized return on a long/short merger arbitrage position, assuming a January 31, 2016 closing.The arbitrage spread appears to reflect a perception that a substantial risk of the deal being called off still exists.","Important Note: This article is not an investment recommendation and should not to be relied upon when making investment decisions - investors should conduct their own comprehensive research. Please read the Disclaimer at the end of this article.Timing Agreement With The DOJAs recently as August 26, 2015, Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) re-iterated in its Integration memo to employees that ""both Halliburton and Baker Hughes (BHI) are fully committed to the goal of closing the acquisition in late 2015."" Halliburton also noted that the acquisition agreement did provide that ""the closing can be extended into 2016, if necessary."" (As reminder, the pending transaction was announced in November 2014.)(Source: Halliburton, August 2015)Yesterday, the two companies announced that they have amended their timing agreement with the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice to extend the earliest closing date by three weeks, to the later of December 15, 2015 (from the current date of November 25, 2015) or 30 days following the date on which both companies have certified final, substantial compliance with the DOJ second request. The timing agreement should provide the DOJ additional time to review the two companies' responses to its second request.To accommodate the timing agreement with the DOJ, Halliburton and Baker Hughes have agreed to extend the time period for closing of the acquisition pursuant to the Merger Agreement to no later than December 16, 2015. The companies' joint press release also states that the closing can be extended into 2016, if necessary, under the provisions of the Merger Agreement.While technically the transaction could close prior to or on December 16, 2015, the risk of the closing being pushed out into 2016 appears very significant, given the complexity of the regulatory review.The announcement highlights the fact that the timing and outcome of the antitrust review process should not be taken for granted when the second and third largest companies in the same sector decide to merge. The merger arbitrage spread between the two stocks' prices has reflected the elevated degree of risk all the way along.As reminder, the proposed transaction requires approvals from competition authorities in numerous countries. While the pending acquisition has already received unconditional regulatory clearances in Canada, Kazakhstan, South Africa, and Turkey, the press release specifically states that there is no agreement to date with any competition enforcement authority as to the adequacy of the proposed divestitures and that the companies will ""continue to work constructively"" with all competition enforcement authorities that have expressed an interest in the proposed transaction.Additional DivestituresThe cost of getting the deal done to Halliburton is continuing to increase as additional divestitures in highly unfavorable market environment are required. Yesterday, Halliburton and Baker Hughes announced that they will market for sale additional businesses ""in order to permit completion of Halliburton's acquisition of Baker Hughes.""As reminder, Halliburton has previously announced sale processes for several of its businesses with a combined 2013 revenue of approximately $5.2 billion. The two largest businesses that have been offered for sale are the Drill Bits and Directional Drilling/LWD/MWD. Halliburton announced that last Friday it received bids from multiple interested parties for each business.The additional businesses announced for divestiture yesterday include:All divestitures will be conditioned on final approval of the Baker Hughes acquisition by competition enforcement authorities and on the closing of the acquisition.A Risky Risk ArbitrageThe merger arbitrage spread between Halliburton and Baker Hughes stocks continues to reflect the deal's elevated risk.As one would expect, the relative price of the two stocks is currently defined by merger arbitrageurs who establish large market-neutral positions in the two stocks (going short 120 HAL shares for every 100 BHI shares on the long side).Using September 29, 2015 closing prices of $34.66 per share for Haliburton and $50.47 per share for Baker Hughes, the merger arbitrage spread is currently ~$7.32 per share, assuming one BHI and one HAL dividend payment captured before the deal closes.While the spread may appear very rich, costs and risks need to be taken in consideration.For professional merger arbitrageurs, the cost of borrowing HAL shares and the cost of capital tied up in the long/short position may be relatively low. Let's assume for illustration that by establishing a neutral merger arbitrage position - going long 1 BHI share and going short 1.12 HAL shares, for total capital of $89.29 per pair - the arbitrageur incurs a 3% per annum funding charge. The arbitrageur would also have to pay dividends on his short position in HAL. If the transaction closes in 4 months, the arbitrageur would post a net gain on the trade of ~$6.42, or ~7.2% above the cost of funds earned in four months.In merger arbitrage world, such a high return indicates a high risk of the deal not closing.For individual investors, arbitrage economics may look somewhat differently. Some brokers apply charges for borrowing shares to maintain a short position. Interest is also charged if the investor borrows in a margin account. Transaction costs, particularly for small positions, also should not be overlooked. The expected return on the trade needs to be calculated by taking in consideration all such costs and using the entire position size as the denominator to arrive at a realistic return metric. By the time all the costs are factored in, profit on this trade for an individual investor who takes a small position is likely to be lower than the 7.2% calculated above (individual investors would have difficult time competing with professional arbitrageurs on cost of capital and transaction costs).One of the risks to this trade - both downside and upside - relates to the timing of the closing. A closing in four months, for example, would provide ~27% annualized return before any funding charges. In the event the closing occurs in six months instead, the annualized return before funding costs drops to ~17%.The most devastating outcome would of course occur if the transaction is terminated. Given that both Halliburton and Baker Hughes at this point have a tremendous amount vested in the deal, it would be logical to expect that the companies will do everything humanly possible to satisfy requirements of antitrust authorities. Therefore, while the cost of getting the deal done may end up high and additional delays should not be ruled out, the probability of a termination is not very high, in my opinion.In the (not very likely) event the deal fails to close for regulatory reasons, the investor may incur a triple loss:While the enormous break-up fee should reduce the negative impact of a potential termination due to regulatory reasons, it would only reduce the loss, not eliminate it.In Conclusion…Yesterday's press release appears to be a sign that Halliburton and Baker Hughes are working with the DOJ in a constructive fashion and are moving along the path towards closing.That said, the unusually wide spread is a reflection of the collective view of merger arbitrageurs on the probability of the deal ultimately closing. The spread appears to suggest that the behind-the-scenes negotiations with the DOJ are more difficult than might be visible to a common observer.Disclaimer: Opinions expressed herein by the author are not an investment recommendation and are not meant to be relied upon in investment decisions.

However, times have both tough and interesting. Halliburton has been going through its plants to acquire Baker Hughes (BHI) for quite some time now. Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) has recently announced its plan to acquire Cameron International (NYSE:CAM).Source: Halliburton - BwbxThis consolidation stems from current troubles in the oil space. Oil prices have a whole have had a difficult time recently. Since the start of last year, due to an oversupply of several percent, oil prices have been dropping rapidly. That has represented the opportunity for a number of mergers.More significantly, it has also resulted in Halliburton stock tanking by almost 50% since the start of the crash. The company current, however, has a yield of almost 2%. The company also trades at a relatively low P/E ratio of almost 20. More significantly, the company has the potential to grow its dividend yield bringing increased earnings.Previous DownturnsTime and time again I have been told that the past is not a valid predictor of the future. And that is potentially a viable argument. However, while the past may not be a great predictor of the future, it is definitely the best one we currently have.Source: Previous Downturn Rigcount Change - Halliburton Investor PresentationThe falling image compares the indexed rig count of the different major oil crashes of recent years. The time periods which go back to back from 1997-14 with one three year break from 2011-14 show how cyclical oil is, it seems to be always in recovery or always in crash never just steady and happy.Currently, rig count has dropped almost 60% which is comparative to the worst crash of recent years from 2008-11. However, the 2008-11 crash had a lot more than dropping commodity prices it also had a slowing global economy that resulted in decreased oil demand. Despite all that, the above image is a pretty solid indication that we seem to be nearing a potential bottom.Source: Supply v. Flexibility Oil Projects - Halliburton Investor PresentationThe following shows an image of different types of supply along with their advantages and disadvantages. Because of its higher cost of supply, during the crash oil sands and LNG projects will most likely be put on hold. However, companies who already have significant projects in these areas will be able to use them to boost their earnings.Instead, producers will most likely shift towards North American Unconventionals with a lower cost of production and more flexibility for their growth. In fact, it is an oversupply from these unconventionals that has led to the current oil crisis.HalliburtonHalliburton is an oilfield service company. Which means this oil crash potentially has a huge advantage for its long-term growth.Whether the company is financially secure like Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) or financially questionable at best like Breitburn Energy Partners (BBEP), this crash has been a wake up call. It came in the midst of a rapidly growing worldwide economy and many producers like Chevron (NYSE:CVX) currently have a number of large projects in the works.In the future, I expect producers will start focusing more on wells that produce quick rewards and are highly flexible. Enter North-American Unconventional -- the fast growing oil area in the market.Source: Halliburton Service Opportunity For Different Field Types - Halliburton Investor PresentationThe following shows the service spending per well for a number of different regions. Here, you can clearly see the revenue potential NAM Unconventionals poses for Halliburton. However, it is also worth directing attention to the Deepwater regions.The ocean along with the Arctic remain the great frontiers of oil exploration with both regions though to hold many billions of barrels. More importantly, both regions also have solid service costs. That means that as oil continues growing, through exploration in these regions, Halliburton will continue getting significant revenue from the necessary service in these regions.Source: Halliburton Growth Plays - Halliburton Investor PresentationIn fact, Deepwater drilling along with Unconventionals represent two of the three major areas of Halliburton's growth plan. However, the company is also looking to Mature Fields for growth. Major fields like the Ghawar Field in Saudi Arabia which supplies more than 50% of Saudi Arabian oil are expected to run out in the coming decades.As Saudi Arabia's largest field gets emptier and emptier, they will begin looking for ways to more efficiently extract additional oil and that's where Halliburton's mature fields plan comes into play.OutlookNow that we have talked about the downturns along with Halliburton's growth plan, it is now time to talk about the overall market outlook.Source: North American Oil Crash Reaction - Halliburton Investor PresentationLooking specifically at North America, the rig count seems to be balancing, however, in recent weeks oil prices have dropped down further. This drop which included a dip below $40 per barrel may result in another dip in rig count.However, such a drop may hurt Halliburton less than other oil companies. During such a drop, company's will focus on extracting the maximum amount of oil from existing wells before they turn to drilling new high cost wells.Source: Halliburton New Technologies - Halliburton Investor PresentationAs a result, many will turn to Halliburton for its technology which decreases extraction costs and helps companies get more from every well. The shift towards increased usage of this technology will help Halliburton's earnings.Source: International Rig Count Change - Halliburton Investor PresentationInternationally, rig count is down a much less significant 13%, the majority of which is in the offshore sector. However, oil majors are having a difficult time replacing the amount of oil that they are removing on a daily basis. Eventually demand for rigs in these areas will have to pick back up which should help Halliburton's earnings.ConclusionHalliburton has had a difficult time recently dropping roughly 50% from its 2014 highs. However, the company pays a solid dividend yield and has a strong vision for future growth in areas of major profitability.The company has also announced an acquisition of Baker Hughes . This deal is expected to lead to $2 billion in cost synergies a significant amount since it will amount to several percent of the combined company.More so, the deal will result in asset sales in the short-term which will allow Halliburton to raise a significant amount of cash that could be used in the short-term. Due to the bottoming rig count and recent lows in oil prices, we have most likely seen the bottom for many of these stocks.I recommend you begin investing at this time."
3509196,92136,2015-09-15T14:51:28-04:00,"HAL shares have remained resilient this year despite plunging crude prices as its bottom line performance has remained strong and the stock has received upgrades from analysts.
        HAL’s technologies such as DecisionSpace and ESTMZ allow oil and gas companies to reduce their structural costs significantly, which will help it in tapping the 69% growth in deepwater drilling.
        The DoJ has thrown a new rider into HAL’s acquisition of BHI by announcing that HAL needs to sell its assets to a single buyer, creating more complications.
        However, HAL might be able to find a buyer in the form of GE or Siemens, both of whom have deep pockets and are expanding their oil operations.","Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) shares have remained resilient this year despite the new lows that crude oil prices have set. In fact, the stock is down less than 6% so far in 2014, which is commendable. This impressive performance can be attributed to Halliburton's impressive bottom line performance over the past two quarters, as it has beaten the Wall Street estimate by an average positive surprise of 42%.In fact, in the second quarter, even though Halliburton's revenue fell around 16% on a sequential basis to $5.9 billion, earnings adjusted for special items declined to $0.44 per share as compared to earnings of $0.49 per share in the first quarter. Both numbers topped the Wall Street estimate by significant margins.Moreover, earlier this month, HSBC upgraded Halliburton to Buy from Hold, putting a price target of $44 on the stock. Now, this is not surprising as Halliburton has taken smart steps to counter the weakness in the oil market, which is why the company has been able to gradually improve its cash flow performance of late. Let's take a look at Halliburton's moves and why the company is still a good bet in the current oil environment.Efficiency improvements are key to HalliburtonHalliburton is making use of technological innovations to improve its efficiency. For instance, Halliburton's Landmark business line has come up with a new solution to help oil producers to increase production and lower costs.Landmark's DecisionSpace software enables oil and gas companies to reduce drilling days by integrating well construction design and geological data. As a result, Halliburton is able to reduce the structural cost of drilling wells by eliminating work stream activity. In fact, driven by this technology, one of Halliburton's deepwater customers was able to reduce drilling time by 15 days.On the other hand, Halliburton is using its Enhanced Single-Trip Multizone (ESTMZ) Packer system in the Gulf of Mexico. This system enables the operator to stimulate and gravel pack multiple production zones in a single trip, and allows the highest treating rate with the greatest volume of proppant in the industry.The bottom line of these solutions is that Halliburton is helping its clients achieve a greater level of efficiency, which is key to sustaining production and bring down costs in the current crude oil environment. Moreover, as Halliburton is helping its customers reduce costs, it will be able to capture more of the deepwater drilling market going forward.Now, this is a good opportunity for Halliburton to improve its financial performance as research firm Douglas-Westwood forecasts an increase of 69% in deepwater drilling to $210 billion during the period 2015-2019 as compared to the previous five-year slab. Thus, Halliburton's technology improvements could play a key role in helping Halliburton gain more business going forward. In fact, the company's operating cash flow has already started improving of late due to its efficiency moves, as shown below:HAL Cash from Operations (NYSE:TTM) data by YChartsAn uncertainty that investors need to keep in mindLast year, Halliburton had announced that it will acquire Baker Hughes (BHI) in order to combine the second and third biggest oilfield services companies into a single entity. As a part of this $35 billion deal, it was decided that Baker Hughes shareholders will receive a fixed exchange ratio of 1.12 Halliburton shares for each Baker Hughes share, plus $19.00 in cash. Moreover, the combined company will retain the name Halliburton.However, Halliburton has been facing problems in the merger process, and consequently, it has extended the time period to close this acquisition. According to CEO David J Lesar, ""On July 10, both Halliburton and Baker Hughes entered into a timing agreement with the department of justice ((DoJ)). We have agreed to extend the period for their review of the acquisition to the later of November 25, 2015, or 90 days after both companies have certified substantial compliance with the DoJ's second request.""In order to complete the deal, Halliburton has planned to divest some of its business units such as fixed cutter and roller cone drill bits, directional drilling, and logging-while-drilling (LWD)/measurement-while-drilling (MWD) businesses. The main reason for these divestments is to get approval from competition authorities over the Halliburton-Baker Hughes transaction.More importantly, the company received nearly 25 indications of interest for each of the businesses in early July. However, the company ran into yet another hurdle last week as the Department of Justice wants Halliburton to find a single buyer in order to gain approval. This presents yet another challenge for Halliburton, as buying a single buyer is considered difficult for assets that are worth $7.5 billion. But, as The New York Post points out, Halliburton's asset sale might attract interest from General Electric (NYSE:GE) or Siemens.As reported by Investor's Business Daily:But, by selling its assets to GE, Halliburton will strengthen the conglomerate and give rise to a stronger rival in its industry. But, at the same time, investors should not forget that the merger of Halliburton and Baker Hughes will give rise to synergies worth $2 billion, irrespective of market conditions or any cost reduction actions taken by either company. At the same time, the merger gives Halliburton's shares a potential upside of 90% over the next three years, according to Citigroup.Thus, if GE indeed buys Halliburton's assets to strengthen its oil and gas segment, Halliburton will be in a stronger position to deliver upside in the long run once its merger is complete.ConclusionHalliburton has displayed remarkable resilience on the stock market so far this year despite the plunge in oil pricing. This is not surprising in light of the efforts undertaken by the company to maintain its financial performance in difficult times. Moreover, the completion of the Baker Hughes acquisition will also play a key role in driving Halliburton's performance going forward, which is probably the reason why it is forecasted that Halliburton's bottom line growth will outpace the broader industry in the next five years.Hence, in light of the points discussed above, I believe Halliburton is a stock that investors should continue holding in their portfolio."
3511056,48411,2015-09-15T10:42:19-04:00,"Execs Jeff Miller and Christian Garcia made presentations at a the Barclays CEO Energy-Power Conference.
        The duo explained how Halliburton sees the next few quarters and what if anything Halliburton can do to alter the inertia of punitive pricing.
        Halliburton's commentary comes at a time when investors are at stressed levels rarely experienced before - I provide my analysis of key takeaways.","Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) President Jeff Miller and SVP of Finance/acting-CFO Christian Garcia recently presented at the Barclays CEO Energy-Power Conference. Miller and Garcia, whose company is the world's second largest energy service company and also has market-leading businesses spanning several E&P drilling and completion segments, touched on several marquee areas of wonder in what was hosted as a very fireside chat-like presentation. While both executive presented from prepared slides the commentary was much unstructured and in the moment.I believe the commentary given comes a very important time for Halliburton as it comes just after what was a tough reported earnings in which the company faced several material headwinds. Many of these headwinds the company has no control over and will not have control over moving forward - these include extremely punitive oil pricing, global GDP concerns, a growing more volatile global FX environment, Department of Justice driven M&A concerns, etc. Again, any commentary management gives I believe should be very closely followed and analyzed.The following is my analysis of the conference presentation and are my key takeaways.More Pain AheadOne thing I can say about Halliburton is that it's an incredibly honest and transparent company. Halliburton, since it first came out to address the oil crisis and what it would mean to the company, has never tried to disguise what was ahead. Garcia has been especially pointed in his commentary in trying to express to investors the seriousness of the coming (now realized) decrementals. Halliburton has also been extremely accurate in its prognostications. Having been through many a cycle, one would have expected as much.So when Halliburton comes out with commentary like that in the excerpt above you better believe it matters. You also better believe that quite a few eyeballs and ears were tuned in to see exactly what Miller and Garcia would say. Back in late-February at the Credit Suisse Energy Summit Garcia noted that he thought this pricing crisis wouldn't yield the level of pricing concessions that the 2009 pricing crisis did. He also noted that decremental margins should be lower than 2009. Now, with the current Oil Bear having aged much older than many in the industry expected, it appears Garcia is softening on his stance. If the budgetary concerns of Halliburton's customers are as significant as Garcia is implying Halliburton could see worse than 2009 reported financials peak to trough and worse than 2009 decrementals. Much of that, in my opinion, has already been priced into shares but any general panic selling/capitulation selling would exacerbate an already terrible equity pricing performance.I think the biggest takeaway from the entire conference came early with Garcia and Miller being frank with a grim outlook for the next few quarters. Halliburton should still get a bump from the Baker Hughes (BHI) merger when it closes but you can expect a series of lower lows with activity/oil pricing correlating to 1:1. The one major upside provider for Halliburton in the interim? A potential backing off of OPEC pressure to the global oil supply glut. Not likely, but possible.Redeterminations, Cause For ConcernThis more than ""sort of"" falls in-line with what I detailed above regarding more pain. But I actually found this to be lined with silver, although it does require a very hard look to come away with that opinion. First, the elephant in the excerpt above is that operations pricing is expected to continue to be under pressure - service providers (even the big ones like Halliburton) have been the single most hurt segment of energy since the oil and gas commodity pricing downturn. To hear that the pricing give (on Halliburton's part) isn't done yet is concerning to say the least but we already broke out those thoughts in the takeaway above. This is one of the big reasons that the Baker Hughes merger actually coming to fruition is such a big deal, the optimization of the pro forma model along with an even greater economy of scale can help negate punitive pricing. Again, the Baker Hughes merger should provide a much needed shot in the arm for Halliburton.The other point of focus for readers, I'm sure, is that these pricing takes are being driven mostly from fear of redeterminations lower. Also, that activity levels are mirroring sentiment which is being determined by redetermination risk expectations. Unfortunately, nothing can be done in this regard either from a proactive standpoint or from a reactionary standpoint. They simply ""are what they are"". The only good news to come from this, and here's your silver lining - the best thing resembling it at least, is that we'll soon be on the other side of redeterminations and maybe those that make it out without too much damage will begin to look towards the future with a bit more certainty. That just might be good enough to lift activity levels assuming a flat commodity pricing deck. Still, here's more reason to focus on the Baker Hughes merger which as of late has seen its chances improve.Any Fat Left To Trim?Again this is in-line with the general theme of the presentation in that Halliburton 1) sees continued harsh operating environments and 2) is not willing to simply be a ship lost at sea. Halliburton will cut down to having at least breakeven operating margins in any environment if it believes this environment to be anything but immediate term. I believe that means even if the topline must be sacrificed. Now Halliburton hasn't alluded to that just yet, that it would create divestitures outside of the Baker Hughes acquisition (ones necessary to please the DOJ), but I believe it will consider this strongly in just a few more quarters if we see a flat pricing deck with no major improvement to the operating margin profile.Of course closing the Baker Hughes acquisition along with some general spatial attrition for service providers, which presumably would work to help establish a bottom for operational pricing, might provide some sort of help in this regard but at this point there's no telling. The big takeaway here is that Halliburton could be getting aggressive from the cost cut side, and it likely will, in an effort to help out its acquisition initiatives in stabilizing margin profile. Nothing should be considered safe at Halliburton in size (which could mean more layoffs coming) or in scope (which could mean divestitures). Still, this type of optionality is the reason why so many own Halliburton. When the going gets really tough, Halliburton can get tough in its own right.Final ThoughtsLook, the reality is that Halliburton is in a tough spot - its equity pretty clearly reflects that. But Halliburton and Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) are the two names in the entire space that can ""grow"" even in extremely punitive downturns. What I mean by ""grow"" is in grow their market share percentages simply by holding serve with operations. Attrition, while it wipes out the weakest operating models and the smallest players, is a good thing for the two kings of the hill. In that sense on the other side of this pricing deck Halliburton will be better off. This pricing deck also helped facilitate the Baker Hughes M&A which, in my opinion, was recently greatly helped along by this pricing deck helping facilitate the Schlumberger/Cameron deal. So not everything has been bad for Halliburton as a result of this now 388 day old oil bear.Halliburton isn't going to zero and if it's going to be forced to take desperate measures like making non-DOJ forced divestitures you can rest assured its competition down the size chain is feeling the heat as well. Again, that's not the worst thing in the world for Halliburton longer term. So, while I personally think the Baker Hughes merger gets done and that provides a bottom for Halliburton shares (actually, I think it will provide quite the pop as merger arbitragist and a those hedging the merger failure close short positions) the reality also is that shares can trade much lower. Especially if 1) the merger fails to close and/or 2) if oil pricing holds this level for materially longer or gets much worse on any duration. I'm betting that Halliburton stretches its legs to the upside though and I think that's the much higher percentage bet, despite it looking very contra trend right now.Good luck everybody."

The industry news likely reduces the risk of a merger block by the Department Of Justice, yet for various highlighted reasons Baker Hughes (BHI) is a higher-risk play to avoid.The recent slump in the oil market does question whether the oilfield services industry will rebound and whether Halliburton will truly avoid DOJ issues. With the stock trading near $38, Halliburton trades at roughly multi-year lows outside of the market crash in late August, providing an opportunity.Industry ConcernsWith the Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) agreement to purchase Cameron International (NYSE:CAM), some of the risks related to government approval of the merger with Baker Hughes is diminished. The news of the day though suggests that the DOJ wants Halliburton to sell the proposed assets totaling $7.5 billion in annual revenues at 2014 levels to one company.Halliburton originally proposed selling several divisions separately, but an industry source quoted by the N.Y. Post suggests that industry players balked at this idea. The big oil request is supposedly for the ability to price a suite of deals, instead of having to work with multiple contractors. Of course, the single-buyer request and the Schlumberger purchase would argue for not requiring Halliburton to split operations.The news interestingly flies in the face of the information provided at the Barclays Energy conference a few days prior. The President made it clear that the bidding process had already transitioned to the second round of bidding on the three business lines already identified for divestiture.Ultimately, the divestments will cause problems if it requires one large bidder. It only leaves a couple of companies with the ability to bid and likely reduces any purchase price. The main issue though remains the price of oil and natural gas. The forecast by Goldman Sachs that oil prices could collapse to $20 per barrel would send Halliburton and other oilfield service stocks lower. This price target isn't a base case, but it is a huge problem for the stock.North America Rebound PerspectiveThe reason that Halliburton remains a favorite oilfield services player for a rebound is two folds: the synergies from a Baker Hughes merger and the focus on North America. The below slide highlights the importance of North America unconventionals, where up to 50% of capital spending goes towards services.Source: Halliburton's Barclays presentationThe North American market is such an important piece of the equation since the related production is now the swing amount. Due to lowered costs and the short-cycle nature of the wells, it has become much easier to turn these wells off and on.The importance to Halliburton is that its business is a lot more skewed towards North America. For Q2 '14 when the market was peaking, the company had over 67% of revenues from North America. For Q2 '15, the vast majority of the $1.5 billion YoY revenue decline was from North America.In addition, as highlighted in previous research, Baker Hughes had substantially lower domestic margins providing for a lot of the synergies in the merger. At the time of the merger, Halliburton had margins that were 700 basis points higher and providing for $800 million of synergies alone.TakeawayHalliburton remains a huge relative value compared to Schlumberger due to the relative size difference and the larger focus on North America drilling. The Baker Hughes merger that appears more likely to close now makes Halliburton the best investment for a rebound in the unconventional drilling that is increasingly becoming the swing plays and likely will take market share from other sources over the next few years."
3495136,24018,2015-09-08T09:39:05-04:00,"The pending Halliburton / Baker Hughes acquisition is wading through regulatory hurdles.
        Investors on either side of the deal have a number of important risk/reward items to monitor.
        This article includes a pro forma valuation analysis, discusses the current arbitrage spread, reviews 2015 performance results, and considers the repercussions if the transactions falls through.","Into the homestretch, the pending Halliburton - Baker Hughes acquisition is not yet a done deal. Regulators haven't blessed it. Investors worry it may not happen at all.This article will explore key implications for investors on either side of the transaction.The DealIn November 2014, the companies agreed to combine. Baker Hughes (BHI) stockholders agreed to accept 1.12 shares of Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) stock plus $19 cash for each common share. At the time, Halliburton shares were bid at ~$55 and Baker Hughes at ~$60 each.A lot changed in a little less than a year.Let's look at the potential transaction from several angles:A Pro Forma Valuation ExerciseWhen the deal was announced in late 2014, I ran some pro forma numbers using the preceding 9 months' data through September 30. At the time, energy prices were rolling over. Therefore, the data includes 6 months' business in ""high cotton,"" and 3 months as the business was tanking. This may not be a bad ""run rate"" model scenario. Energy is cyclical. Today it's down. Tomorrow it's up.Let's start with some raw inputs:NOTE: I elected to use unadjusted EBITDA figures. Company-adjusted EBITDA increased performance results, so this approach built in a factor of safety. Share prices above were approximate at the time of the November acquisition announcement.Extrapolating 3 quarters' data to a full year, and combining the results offers $11.4 billion pro forma EBITDA. A total of 1.34 billion HAL shares will be outstanding after adjusting the share count to reflect post-acquisition dilution.How to combine the EBITDA multiples?Well, I premised the new Halliburton approaches, but does not reach, its pre-acquisition EBITDA multiple. Therefore, I estimated the combined business may command a 6.5x EBITDA multiple.Taking the resultant figures and doing the math indicates HAL shares to be worth ~$55 each. That's not much fun for Halliburton stockholders, though the HAL shares trade today at $38.However, that figure doesn't consider post-acquisition growth. Over the past 15 years, Halliburton has recorded cash flow CAGR of 10.5%; Baker Hughes' exhibited 8% CAGR over the same period.Assuming the aforementioned baseline run rate, and a 2-year, 9% EBITDA growth rate; the 24-month valuation target rises to $65 a share. This excludes $2 billion of proposed post-acquisition synergies advertised by management.Adding those synergies in, the 2-year target rises to $75.It's important to realize Halliburton will be required to divest significant assets to obtain regulatory approval. The potential EBITDA lost by these assets wasn't considered. Nor was the utilization of cash received.The Current Arbitrage ""Spread""The acquisition math is simple: for each common share, BHI stockholders get 1.12 shares of HAL stock plus $19. Once the deal is approved and awaits close, Halliburton and Baker Hughes shares should be harmonize to reflect that reality.However, the deal isn't set. There's been considerable noise about regulators scuttling it.Today, HAL shares are valued at approximately $37. Based upon the current price of Halliburton stock, Baker Hughes shares should be worth ~$60.44 apiece assuming the merger is successfully completed:One can now buy a share of Baker Hughes common for just $53.50, or a 11% potential post-close discount. Typically, the arbitrage spread for a late-stage, straight up deal is about 4%. Investors worries about antitrust approval are causing the disconnect.Indeed, if you like Halliburton stock, and you believe the deal will go through; there's an opportunity to pick up a quick 11% bonus by buying Baker Hughes stock instead. Both companies expect the acquisition to be finalized by the end of the year. However, as part of the agreement, HAL and BHI can extend the timeline into 2016.But will the deal get done?It's hard to say. However, I suspect the recent Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) and Cameron (NYSE:CAM) merger has the potential to help Halliburton and Baker Hughes.Why?Halliburton / Baker Hughes management can point to Schlumberger / Cameron and say to the regulators, ""The biggest energy service company in the world is getting bigger. We need to keep up.""In addition, Schlumberger management is well-aware of the Halliburton / Baker Hughes combo. If they thought that deal was in serious jeopardy, would Schlumberger risk the time, energy, and expense to enact a competing acquisition? I think not.Nevertheless, the aforementioned discussion suggests an action item:It also begs a question:Halliburton and Baker Hughes Recent ResultsFirst, let's look at this years' performance.Energy prices, and both companies' near-term results have gone in one direction: south.However, despite the horrendous industry backdrop, results have not been disastrous.Here's some data points.Revenues: Both outfits saw revenues slip. Halliburton 2Q revenues declined 16% versus 2015 1Q, while Baker Hughes' top line fell 14% over the same period.Operating Margins: Halliburton reported its 2Q 2015 adjusted operating margin improved to 12.0% from 10.9% in the first quarter. Baker Hughes adjusted margins were about breakeven in both quarters: 2% and 1%.Revenues and margins were weak. However, cash flow was another story.Operating Cash Flow: On a 6-month, per-share basis, both outfits recorded solid operating cash flow. Halliburton generated $2.33 in the first half 2015 versus $2.44 a year earlier. Not bad. Baker Hughes experienced a year-over-year OCF increase; $1.91 per share this year, compared to just $1.58 through the first 6 months of 2014.Free Cash Flow: On a per share basis, Halliburton showed improved YoY free cash flow. The Company recorded $0.91 this year versus $0.82 in 1H 2014. Capital expenditures were down 11%. Baker Hughes recorded good results, too. First half 2015 free cash flow was $0.99 per share versus $0.08 last year. However, year-over-year capex was reduced 34%.Cash: Halliburton holds $3.23 per share on the balance sheet, or ~8% of its share price. Baker Hughes has $4.50 per share balance sheet cash, representing a similar 8% of its share price.Debt-to-Equity: As of mid-year, HAL has a 50% debt-to-equity ratio versus 48% last year. BHI carries less debt; the D2E ratio is 22% compared to 21% as of June 30, 2014. Neither company has required additional debt to operate in today's environment; the businesses are not over-levered.Interest Coverage: Calculating the 2015 6-month interest coverage ratio as a function of free cash flow before interest expense (versus the more traditional EBIT), both organizations are sound. Halliburton has 4.6x coverage, while Baker Hughes has a 5.1x FCF-to-interest expense ratio.Commentary: To date, Halliburton and Baker Hughes have weathered crumbling business prospects intact. The companies are large, and managed conservatively. Expenses and capex has been cut. Neither company's solvency, leverage, or durability has been compromised.Between the two, Halliburton appears to be holding up a bit better, generating reasonable good operating and free cash flow without resorting to major capex cuts. Operating margins are decent, as very weak North American margins have been offset by strong international margins. Debt has remained constant and serviceable. Asset utilization is down, but not out. The Company noted a 2Q 2015 85% asset utilization rate.Baker Hughes continues to create positive operating cash, but slashed capital expenditures to maintain free cash flow. Operating margins all but evaporated, leaving little to no profit. On the other hand, long-term debt levels are quite low. The Company is buttressed by a solid balance sheet. In the most recent quarter, asset utilization fell to 66% from 81% a year earlier.Price and Fair Value: Since the beginning of 2015, stock prices have held somewhat steady. HAL shares are down ~4%, while BHI has seen its common slide about 2%.A look at 2 F.A.S.T. graphs offers some insight.Currently, I believe earnings are not the best FV measure. Given today's tough business climate, I view operating cash flow as a more appropriate valuation metric.First, here's Halliburton's long-term, historic relationship between price and cash flow:In the first half 2015, Halliburton generated $2.33 operating cash flow; analysts project the company will make $4.25 for the full year. Using the long-term 10.8x P/CF ratio, we obtain a $46 fair value estimate.Looking back to the 2008 to 2012 down-cycle period, the average P/CF ratio fell to 10.2x. Using that multiple offers $43 fair value.Both estimates are above current market prices.Now, Baker Hughes:courtesy of fastgraphs.comBaker Hughes appears slightly overvalued on a P/CF basis. Street estimates indicate expectations the Company will make $3.79 operating cash flow in 2015. Applying a 12.7x cash flow multiple offers a $48 stock. Even if 2016 OCF improves somewhat, the results point to the potential BHI shares may fall in the event Halliburton fails to complete its acquisition. On the other hand, if the shares are bought out, Baker Hughes shareholders should receive an eventual uplift both from the undervaluation of Halliburton shares, and the arbitrage bonus highlighted earlier in the article.Of course, the future trajectory of energy prices is unknown. Bottom line, I believe either Company can adapt and adjust to a sustained downturn. Comparing both businesses, I contend Halliburton is the better managed and has a stronger overall franchise.What If the Halliburton / Baker Hughes Deal Blows Out?In the event no deal gets done due to antitrust problems, Halliburton agreed to pay Baker Hughes a $3.5 billion breakup fee. This amounts to a BHI receiving an $8 per share cash windfall. Under the current business backdrop, $8 cash represents over 2 years' operating cash flow. Pretty stout.However, given Baker Hughes' nil operating margins, and need to prop up free cash flow by slashing capex, I suspect BHI shareholders stand to take a hit if the deal doesn't close.Our earlier P/CF analysis suggested a similar outcome.In the event of a regulatory dead end, Halliburton will need to borrow in order to meet the $3.5 billion payment. I premise the Company would borrow about half of it, and fund the remainder with cash-on-hand. Such a scenario should increase Halliburton's long-term debt to ~$9.6 billion. This remains a serviceable figure, and one that Halliburton could work itself out of within a couple of years, even if current energy price remained low.Please do your own careful due diligence before making any investment.

The fall in prices for commodities has caused capital flight from emerging countries to safe havens like the U.S. Oil stocks and shares of companies like Alcoa (NYSE:AA), which markets aluminum and Glencore (OTCPK:GLCNF), (OTCPK:GLNCY), which markets copper have recently hit 52-week lows. However, little has been made of the stiff headwinds currency swings cause for multinationals like Halliburton (NYSE:HAL).Foreign Currencies Are In Free FallOver the past year, foreign currencies have been in rapid decline.The Russian ruble and Brazilian real have declined 45% and 39%, respectively. This comes as no surprise. Russia has spent capital to finance its incursion deeper into Europe, and has also suffered from economic sanctions from the U.S. and the EC. Brazil's economy entered a recession in Q2, and the country continues to run budget deficits. Even the euro, which I would not have expected to depreciate noticeably against the dollar, has declined over 14%.That does not bode well for Halliburton. Total revenue was down 16% Q/Q in Q2, yet its international revenue was only off 13%:Source: Shock ExchangeThe Europe/Africa/CIS (18% of revenue) and Middle East/Asia (22% of revenue) regions anchored the company, as revenue growth was relatively stable. The fact that Halliburton derived about 55% of its revenue outside the U.S. was a big selling point. That may not be the case in Q3 given that once international revenue is converted into dollars, it could be less than previously realized due to declining foreign currencies.In Q2, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and Kimberly-Clarke (NYSE:KMB) experienced Q2 revenue declines of 10% and 8%, respectively, due to weakening international currencies. The flow of capital to the U.S. has been amplified due to China's recent currency devaluation and the expected rate hike by the Fed later this month. That said, I expect stiff foreign exchange headwinds to take a toll on Halliburton's top line in Q3.North America Will Continue To WeighNorth America, which saw revenues decline 25% in Q2, will continue to weigh next quarter. The decline in the North American rig count and financial woes of U.S. shale drillers have made North American land drilling one of the most moribund sectors of the oilfield services space.According to the Financial Times, U.S. shale producers experienced $30 billion in cash outflows in the first half of the year. That means that after servicing its debt load, shale companies will have less to spend on oilfield services provided by Halliburton, Baker Hughes (BHI) and Weatherford (WFT). The sector is so competitive that Halliburton has been offering price concessions in order to win new business. This could drive down North American revenues even further next quarter.ConclusionI expect revenues from North America to continue to decline in Q3, while international revenues will face headwinds from currency swings. Investors should continue to avoid Halliburton.Editor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks. Please be aware of the risks associated with these stocks."

        The Street has indicated this by moving much higher the price target that has acted as a proxy for confidence in this closing.
        I believe this target moving higher while the equity has remained flat is reason to aggregate shares or leveraged vehicles.","It seems to be consensus that Halliburton's (NYSE:HAL) chances of executing its Baker Hughes (BHI) integration have moved much, much higher in light of the Cameron acquisition by Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB). Consensus is that with the added size and capacity, Cameron is a really good fit for Schlumberger - fit is largely the biggest determining factor of M&A success in my opinion, that the Department of Justice should be satisfied with Halliburton's competitive positioning in the industry and its ability to monopolize the space with Schlumberger (jointly but separately). Put simply, Halliburton's case that it needs to be bigger to compete and that with divestitures it won't be able to create a menu pricing with Schlumberger (read: pricing so low because of economies of scale that lesser economies of scale can't compete) that makes it impossible for smaller servicers to compete begins to hold quite a bit more weight. I'm not sure that it ever didn't but with the Department of Justice causing delays for Halliburton maybe they didn't see Halliburton's case as the market does.So, the consensus belief that the Halliburton deal is likely to go through should be consensus. But then, outside of the Department of Justice maybe or maybe not interfering with progress (depending on which side of the political aisle you stand), not many in the industry thought this merger had high chances of failing in the first place. Not with Baker Hughes' $3.5 billion reverse termination fee built into the process, not with Halliburton's CEO Dave Lesar being extremely confident and extremely vocal of his confidence in the deal and his unwillingness to accept failure, and not with both companies being so much better off with the deal closed than the transaction not consummating.I say this confidently, that the industry never really waned in support and belief of the merger, in that throughout the soap opera that has ensued since the initial announcement analysts reporting to Thomson have continued to hold Halliburton price targets flat even though the market in all its wisdom has allowed Halliburton equity price to plummet. The sequential distance from analyst price target expectation to underlying spot pricing for the equity has been incredible. At least sequentially since I started closely tracking the public spectacle that has become the Halliburton/Baker Hughes merger:From April to July the mean, median, high and low price targets for Halliburton implied 13%, 12%, 14%, and 13% higher pricing from spot pricing - this was entirely driven by a falling Halliburton equity price as the price targets largely held flat. Sequentially, from July to September these same targets implied 18%, 11%, 69%, and 15% upside to spot pricing. Two things should be pointed out.The first is that the jump in upside expectation from April to September has been absurd as pricing expectations held flat while the equity price plummeted. Some of this, to be sure, had to do with oil pricing plummeting as well. Please, take note of that. Second, notice the high price target has moved higher in the September reporting from both the July reporting which was held flat from April. This is the Baker Hughes merger target, essentially. This target, in my opinion, acts as a proxy for industry confidence in the success of the transaction. It appears, at least using this as a proxy, that confidence has skyrocketed.Now, conceding that Halliburton will and should trade largely in-line with oil pricing AND that I don't believe oil has bottomed, if Halliburton closes this transaction the shares should see an immediate and significant move higher. Maybe putting a floor on Halliburton pricing and decoupling the name from a current 1:1 correlation pricing with oil. Again, it certainly looks like Halliburton is going to be able to close this deal in light of the Schlumberger move for Cameron. Not only does the closing take a $3.5 billion potential liability off the books but it opens up the name to all the positives that have had analysts holding price targets flat all along. With these being covered in depth across multiple mediums I won't reiterate them within this note.That said, making this case primarily from the foundation that the underlying risk of the reverse transaction fee has been removed, that Halliburton might decouple from oil pricing as a result of 1) high visibility near-term EPS expansion as a result of synergy from the Baker Hughes deal (assuming flat oil pricing) and 2) high visibility long-term EPS expansion as a result of synergy form the Baker Hughes deal (again, assuming flat oil pricing), and that underlying 2016 and 2017 modeling hasn't degraded even into lower oil pricing since last reporting (see graphic below), Halliburton shares should be considered for adding on an immediate basis and with leverage with a view as a long-term investment. Specifically I believe long-term CALL options should be considered. Even a one-time purchase, with the understanding that if I'm right and Brent does bottom at $39 Halliburton shares would be decapitated into capitulation (maybe - depending on how far shares decouple from oil pricing as a result of the Baker Hughes merger), should still have long-dated CALL options deep in the money come expiration. I expect the oil pricing crisis to be long gone at that point.A look at full year 2015 and 2016 modeling which has now priced in the EPS additions and expansions of the Baker Hughes merger:A look at full year 2017 modeling which has held flat into after stabilizing into the much lower oil pricing table:Finally, a look at skyrocketing (all-time high) short interest as a result of 1) the ""long Baker Hughes/ short Halliburton"" trade which hedges the transaction and tries to arbitrage the transaction spread and 2) short sellers speculating that the transaction won't close. Remember, I believe at the closing of the transaction quite a bit of this will be taken off:So, in summary, I expect long-dated CALL options to pay huge over the lifecycle to expiration. I believe that the market continuing to discount Halliburton share price (some the result of arb trading, some the result of hedging via shorting) despite recent increases to deal close possibility present a rare opportunity to lever up on a very quality long-term name.Good luck everybody."

        HAL got hit in last week's stock market rout, yet is still 15% overvalued.
        HAL is worth $30 standalone, and remains a sell.","The free fall in oil prices has triggered $180 billion in capex cuts by big oil this year - the largest in nearly 30 years. Oilfield services firms like Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) have also been collateral damage. The market for oilfield services is slim, and what remains has been characterized by cut-throat competition and price concessions.HAL is down about 55% over the past 12 months. The stock has been buoyed by the expected $2 billion in cost synergies from its pending merger with Baker Hughes (BHI). However, the deal still has to meet regulatory approval. Part of that approval involves the company divesting certain overlapping operations, which I believe will be challenging amid low oil prices. If the transaction is not consummated Halliburton may be subjected to a $3.5 billion break-up fee which may not sit well with longs.Size Is A Differentiator In The Oil PatchSource: Shock ExchangeIn Q2 Halliburton's revenue declined 16% sequentially. Revenue from North America (45% of total revenue) was off 25%. The company has been offering price concessions in North America which could amplify revenue declines. The company's $10 billion in working capital should sustain the company at the expense of smaller competitors. Its hefty balance sheet should be a differentiator as oil prices look for a bottom and a global recession appears on the horizon.Halliburton Is Worth $30To cut through the clutter of potential deal synergies and the impact of the oil price free fall, I did a bottoms up analysis of Halliburton. The stock is worth $30 or 15% below Friday's close of $35.69.RevenueThe starting point for the evaluation is revenue of $25 billion which equates to first half results annualized. If the company's quarterly revenue falls further it could undershoot the revenue estimate used in the valuation.EBITDAEBITDA is first half results annualized. It equates to a 17% EBITDA margin. Through cost containment efforts Halliburton actually increased its Q2 EBITDA margin to 18%, up from 15% in Q1.EBITDA MultipleA multiple of 5.0x to 7.0x is appropriate for an industry leader in a cyclical industry in decline. I valued the company at the top of the range given its leading position within the industry.Enterprise ValueThe company's enterprise value (equity and debt) is $30 billion.Equity ValueAfter subtracting net debt (debt less cash and equivalents) of $5.1 billion, I derived an equity value of $24 billion.Per Share PriceI assumed 855 million shares outstanding which was sourced from Yahoo!.ConclusionHalliburton's intrinsic value is $30 or 15% below where it currently trades. Investors should focus on the company's fundamentals and ignore deal noise; the Baker Hughes merger is challenged on so many levels, and last week's stock market rout will not help deal sentiment. I expect the stock market rout to continue into next week, taking Halliburton's share price with it. HAL remains a sell."
3491226,84656,2015-09-04T14:43:31-04:00,Halliburton is currently in a special situation.The oil price and the attempted acquisition of Baker Hughes are the dominating risk factors at the moment.We estimate the probabilistic evolution of these risk factors and its effect on valuation under this special situation.At $33 the normal earning power of the business offers long-term support and the special situation offers an interesting probability weighted reward.,"Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) has caught my attention. The dynamics in the oil price and the attempted acquisition of Baker Hughes (BHI) has set up a special situation where two clearly observable risk factors dominate its stock price.Let's be explicit:If an investor was to assume in the current environment the dominant risk factors determining HALs stock price over the next 12 months were:We could apply a simple probability weighted model to determine the value of HAL if we made the following assumptions:I have made some estimates on HAL's value under various scenarios. You may disagree with them. That's fine - feel free to comment on what your inputs would be and why. Happy to send you the simple spreadsheet constructed if you wish to play with the different scenarios.With the above assumptions the probability-weighted price of Halliburton is $49 - a 29% premium to the current market price.The market is either assuming the deal has a lower probability of being executed, that if executed will generate less value for HAL (perhaps because of the potential divestitures required), or that the oil price will continue to decline.I feel at a 35% discount to the above estimate (around $33) it would be an interesting special situation investment considering the current (normal situation) earning power of the business which I believe offers long term support at that price level.Please note I make the strict assumption that in a ""special situation"" if the event described occurs it will lead to price converging to value. History has shown us this does not happen with the frequency we would like - so please take these numbers with a pinch of salt. They are only for reference to provide insight into the dynamics involved."

        North America continues to weigh, yet its Baker Hughes merger appears to be progressing well.
        Too much of HAL's value is predicated on its BHI merger which could face more hurdles.
        Investors should avoid BHI.","Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) reported Q2 earnings last week and the company beat analysts' expectations on revenue growth. Analysts were expecting revenue of $5.78 billion but the company delivered $5.9 billion. Revenue declined 16% sequentially, yet Halliburton improved its EBITDA margin from 15% in Q1 to 18% this quarter. It was an impressive quarter given the oil industry downturn. I have the following other observations:North America's Free Fall Has Not SubsidedTotal revenue fell 16% sequentially, but North America revenue was off 25%. This followed a 25% decline in Q1.Source: Shock ExchangeBrent oil prices troughed in mid-January at $50 and bounced to as high as $67 in mid-May. It could have been a head fake though; prices are now below $60 again. For many North American shale plays, $65 oil prices may be their break-even point. They have been forced to cut capex and squeeze equipment suppliers in order to stem cash burn. Such cut backs are causing distress for oil services firms, thus the 25% revenue fall off for Halliburton.The situation may not abate any time soon. Halliburton was forced to make price concessions for clients during the quarter:The company's $10 billion in working capital should help soften the blow. For lesser-capitalized oil services firms, the decline in pricing power may be more detrimental.Baker Hughes Merger Progressing As PlannedA major development during the earnings conference call was how well aspects of the Baker Hughes (BHI) merger were progressing.$2 Billion Cost SynergiesOther than Halliburton's $3.5 billion break-up fee, the $2 billion cost synergies the deal is expected to generate are probably the only reasons Halliburton is still pursuing the merger. The $2 billion figure was bantered around when the deal was struck in Q4 2014, and both companies had more revenue and operating costs. Since, their revenue and operating expenses have come down. However, on the earnings call management reaffirmed its $2 billion cost synergy estimate:This revelation totally took me by surprise. For instance, both companies had combined operating costs of about $48 billion for full-year 2014. On a run-rate basis (Q2 results annualized) combined operating expenses are about $39 billion, or nearly 20% less than when the deal was first struck. It would only make sense that the $2 billion cost synergy figure would be reduced. For now, we have to take management at its word.Auction Process For Divestitures Is EbullientPursuant to the merger, regulators require Halliburton to divest certain overlapping operations. I previously suggested that oil jitters could stymie asset sales. According to management, the properties have attracted 25 bids:I assumed the asset sales could pose an impediment to the merger. Let's see what the level of interest is if oil prices remain below $60 or fall further in the second half of the year.ValuationWith an enterprise value of $41 billion HAL trades at 6.6x EBITDA through 12 trailing months June 2015 (""LTM0615""). Though EBITDA margins are improving, EBITDA in dollar terms declined 36% Y/Y. On a forward basis HAL's EBITDA multiple is probably a lot higher. Sans the Baker Hughes merger, I believe HAL would trade a lot lower. That said, I believe there are still impediments to the deal - regulatory approval and lower oil prices. Investors should continue to avoid HAL at this time."

The transaction has a few hurdles to overcome, such as DOJ approval and asset divestitures representing about $7.5 billion in total revenue. Given the decline in oil prices, I questioned whether oil jitters would stymie asset sales. However, on its Q2 earnings call Halliburton's management claimed the properties had attracted 25 bids:Halliburton Has ProblemsThis is not the optimal environment in which to sell oil-related properties. In effect, Halliburton is asking buyers to ""Take my problems off my hands."" In Q2, Halliburton's revenue was down Q/Q by 16%, while normalized EBITDA was flat due to cost cutting. Revenue in North America was down 25% and the company is offering price concessions that smaller rivals may not be able to match.Source: Shock ExchangeWith their high break-even costs, many North American shale plays have to cut capex and keep drilling simply to stay afloat. Secondly, several shale plays are saddled with interest expense from heavy debt loads, which means they have less funds to shell out for oilfield equipment services. These sound like big problems for Halliburton and others competing for dollars from North American land drillers.Do GE, CAT Or Dover Really Want Halliburton's Problems?Halliburton is auctioning its Fixed Cutter and Roller Cone Drill Bits, Directional Drilling, Logging-While-Drilling and Measurement-While-Drilling businesses. According to Bloomberg, names like General Electric (NYSE:GE), Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) and Dover (NYSE:DOV) have shown interest. First of all, any property that includes the word ""Drilling"" as part of its name is going to be a tough sell. Secondly, when potential buyers do not have confidence in their own operations, it becomes even more difficult.The following chart outlines Q2 revenue and profit for GE, Caterpillar and Dover:Source: Shock ExchangeProfit declines were consistent with revenue declines:Source: Shock ExchangeGE's profit fell less than revenue, which implies cost cuts outpaced revenue declines. Nonetheless, under Jack Welch, GE set a standard of consistent earnings increases. Highly cyclical industries like oil and gas did not seem to fit its DNA. Going forward we shall see if GE shareholders can stomach the ebbs and flows of the oil and gas industry. Meanwhile, Dover's Energy segment decline (down 62%) was exacerbated by a negative product mix and pricing pressure.ConclusionSo-called interested buyers like GE, Caterpillar and Dover are experiencing revenue and earnings declines in their own oil and gas operations. With Brent oil now hovering around $50, results may worsen in Q3. I find it hard to believe they want to add Halliburton's problems to their bailiwicks. Dismal asset sales will likely cause shares of both Halliburton and Baker Hughes to decline. I am short BHI partly based on that thesis."
3439906,31441,2015-08-14T07:36:08-04:00,"Pursuant to the Halliburton / Baker Hughes merger, the DOJ requires them to divest certain overlapping businesses.
        Such divestitures amid slumping oil prices will be difficult.
        Since China's yuan devaluation oil prices have fallen further and investors may have lowered future economic growth expectations.
        China may have wrecked the Halliburton / Baker Hughes merger.","Part of China's strategy is to have a strong trade surplus with the U.S. and other super powers. Through July 2015 China's trade surplus more than doubled to $306 billion, yet its net exports were down 0.9% versus the year earlier period. In my opinion, worries over its anemic export growth is what prompted China to devalue the yuan by 2% earlier this week.The move will hurt foreign multinationals like General Motors (NYSE:GM) by making their revenues from China less valuable when converted into dollars. Commodity prices reacted negatively since China is the largest consumer of commodities. Currencies of East Asian countries like South Korea and Taiwan who trade with China have also been under pressure. Unforeseen collateral damage could be the Halliburton (NYSE:HAL), Baker Hughes (BHI) merger.Halliburton's Divestitures Could Be In TroubleOn Tuesday evening the following headline from Bloomberg News flashed across the television screen:The news flash was most likely paraphrasing an article from the Street.com. A quirk in the transaction is that the DOJ requires the merger partners to divest certain overlapping operations. A concern is that Halliburton may not be able to find buyers strong enough to compete with a combined Halliburton/Baker Hughes post-transaction. That said, China's yuan devaluation could wreck the merger due to the following reasons:It Could Hurt Oil PricesThe line of demarcation for falling oil prices was Q2 2014.Source: Shock ExchangeBrent oil is currently below $50, testing January lows. However, crude oil prices slumped to a 6 1/2 year low just three days after China's currency move:China overtook the U.S. in April as the world's largest importer of crude oil, hitting 7.4 million barrels per day.Source: Financial TimesThe country's robust oil consumption is partly due to its penchant for stockpiling oil. A lower yuan would make oil purchases more expensive, potentially reducing imports and resulting in lower oil demand and prices.Lower Oil Prices Portend Less Investment By Big OilAttempting to sell an oil-related business with oil prices this low is the equivalent of setting sail in stormy seas. According to Rystad Energy, big oil has cut $180 billion in capital expenditures so far this year - the lowest in nearly 30 years:Source: BloombergThe contraction may not have abated. According to Jefferies, oil companies need to cut another $26 billion in investments in order to maintain their dividend payout schedule.It Could Cause Buyers To Lower Return Expections And BidsThere are other signs that the global economy is slowing, such as the recent commodities rout, Greece's implosion and Puerto Rico's $72 billion debt default. Lower expectations about the economic growth could cause potential buyers to reduce expected revenues and earnings growth post-transaction. Such lower projections could result in bids below what Halliburton was anticipating.Secondly, potential buyers like GE (NYSE:GE), Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) and Dover (amongst others), are experiencing declining revenues and earnings in their own oil and gas operations:Source: Shock ExchangeProfits declined by double-digits Y/Y. When potential buyers are less optimistic about their own operations they may be reticent to take on someone else's problems.Moreover, North American land drilling - the segment some of the divested assets compete in - has been the hardest hit segment of the oil services space. Several shale plays have high break-even costs and high debt loads and have cut capex to the bone in order to stem cash burn. When the oil industry contraction dissipates is anyone's guess.ConclusionI have been saying for some time now that an impediment to the merger is Halliburton's ability to divest assets amid weak oil prices. China's yuan devaluation just made that task much harder. Investors should avoid HAL and BHI."

        I think CEO David Lesar and CFO Christian Garcia did a great job illustrating this on the Q2/15 investor call.
        While the call was largely what you would have expected there were some key moments during the call worth a further look and a breakout.","As much as Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) is taking it on the chin right now and as painful as owning the equity has been for those long shares, the recent Department of Justice news regarding the Baker Hughes (BHI) acquisition didn't help, the company will likely be much, much better off on the other side of this commodity collapse. I think CEO David Lesar and CFO Christian Garcia did a great job illustrating this on the Q2/15 investor call.While the call was largely what you would have expected, Halliburton defending its global positioning while framing its financials as bullishly as possible (actually they weren't all that bad), there were some key moments during the call worth a further look and a breakout.A flight to quality…This matters and it's going to moving forward. This is also why the DOJ is scrutinizing the Baker Hughes deal so closely. What does Energy (the sector) do in crisis, time and time again? Move into quality names that have solid balance sheets and access to credit/liquidity. Why? Because in Energy you can't afford to play the game of revolving service providers. You go where the fundamentals are.In Halliburton's universe that means you either go to it, you go to Baker Hughes - which we've stated Halliburton is trying to buy, or you go to Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB). That's pretty much it. So, while this should provide plenty of comfort to Halliburton & Co. (meaning investors and employees) it's also the cause of the DOJ problems. For right now, and even moving forward - even if the Baker Hughes deal falls apart and costs Halliburton $3.5 billion in fees, this is a big plus and a reason why at just under 50% off from 52-week highs (with a near 2% yield) Halliburton is an interesting name that should be on your Big Board.I'm not saying go out and buy it today, but you should be stalking it. Why shouldn't jump in with both feet today? Unlike Lesar I don't believe service pricing has bottomed. I can see Brent touching $39 before we begin to see oil base off in pricing and even then I don't it over $55-$60 for meaningful amounts of time until at least 2H/16. If I'm right, service pricing hasn't bottomed just yet. Time will tell but I'm betting Halliburton gets cheaper from here.The rich get richer…In regards to pricing, Lesar should pray that I'm right and he's wrong. Why? Because of what I just outlined above. The space will gravitate towards The Big Service Three (or Big Two and A Half with the pending merger?) anyways and the The Big Three have the balance sheets and access to liquidity to survive an extended stay at low oil and gas pricing. This low pricing environment is productive to those that can survive and you better bet Halliburton, Baker Hughes, and Schlumberger sure can. In fact, Lesar did an excellent job reiterating a Q1/15 point he made that illustrates just the point I'm making in this section:It sure can't Mr. Lesar. Because if it does that means you're competition is waving bye-bye in a big way and likely at the hands of you, Baker Hughes (if the DOJ blocks the merger), and Schlumberger buying them for pennies on the dollar. Halliburton is currently playing what Game Theory refers to as a Dominated Strategy. To summarize - heads Halliburton wins, tails Halliburton wins. But still, as noted above, that doesn't mean the equity has bottomed just yet. Just know that this Dominated Strategy is in play if you're wondering when to start averaging in to the name. Nobody knows when the pricing environment makes an upward move that is meaningful but those willing to buy and hold Halliburton might not need all that much of a lift in the long run as Halliburton survives the sectors Hunger Games. Growth, even by attrition and vulturing, is still growth folks.When there's blood in the streets…Halliburton, always one to example itself of higher class whenever it can, has done it again. Halliburton announced a MOA with none other than BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) in which it will be provided a $500 million funding mechanism specifically tethered to the company's refrac efforts. Can you say homerun?Halliburton is positioning itself for an extended stay at lower pricing, despite Lesar's kind and hopeful premonition of service pricing bottoming (which again implies oil and gas pricing bottoming), while not having any obligations attached to that positioning. Halliburton, which will get to have its cake and eat it too, now has access to a half-billion dollar funding facility to help it stimulate its refrac business at the exact time when this likely will becoming en vogue. Further, Halliburton alluded to the fact that it might be able to use this facility to finance the refrac operations for operators. Yes, my jaw dropped as well.This means that Halliburton would be getting into a turnkey operation that would see it not only servicing the demand but also helping facilitate the demand. Think about that for a second. This is the equivalent to a roofing company helping finance the work it's about to perform on your recently hail destroyed home topper. What do you think this is going to do for Halliburton's growth rates permanently let alone on an immediate basis? I'd say accelerate them without a doubt. As the ""refrac revolution"" really gets going, and the longer we're in this oil and gas pricing environment the more attractive the risk/reward looks, Halliburton is going to be in pole position to take home business. That too, friends, is a reason to consider Halliburton on anything of its stock finding technical support.The Return of Big Red?...I've been asking if we're going to see the ""Return of Big Red"" since mid-Q1 and the market/price of oil and gas hasn't let Halliburton off the mats. The last 8 months have been a constant beat down of anything energy and especially anything service. Halliburton, as evidenced by the 50% off discount from 52-week highs, has been no exception. That said, I continue to remain cautious about getting long Halliburton in the face of what I believe is a much longer drawn out lower pricing environment even despite the current share price. All told I would recommend readers have Halliburton on their Big Board and watch it closely for it to show anything of a bottom. If and when it does, get long some shares. When Big Red does come back it's coming back with a Dominated Strategy vengeance.Good luck everybody."

3390755,48411,2015-08-03T12:57:12-04:00,"Halliburton has been working on cement R&D consistently dating back nearly 100 years.
        With Cementing being so key in the completion process and with Halliburton being a consistent industry leader in execution is this where we should look for Halliburton's next great tech?
        I think so and I think I've stumbled upon something that should play a larger and larger role for the company in the immediate term.","Has the recent oil and natural gas commodity pricing collapse positioned Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) for even more market share dominance than it was prior? This is a question that I've been pondering seriously since being on the Q2/15 Halliburton investor call and hearing over and over Halliburton stress its ability to lead a refracturing revolution for US oil and gas producers. Further, how Halliburton considers itself so committed to being the leader in servicing refrac demand going forward and how it so much believes that this is now economically viable and necessary that it has secured a $500 million funding mechanism with BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) specifically tethered to its refrac efforts.That's right, Halliburton has aligned itself with a third party for the first time in history to facilitate the actual funding efforts for increasing refrac demand. That's the level of desperation we've reached in oil and gas, a sector I cover very closely. I pay attention to levels of desperation in any industry I'm invested because it's in this desperation that disruption can occur. It takes years and years of market seeding and coaxing to typically change a standard operating procedure or an accepted process - even for billion dollar market cap giants like DuPont (NYSE:DD) who have built hundred year old businesses out of the process. Or, it takes economics suddenly and severely being disrupted. R&D desks become very, very important parts of the team during times like these, time of desperation, in answering the question of ""what can we do?"".It means that companies like Halliburton, which Halliburton is turned to by customers for technology as much as it is for field operating execution, have an opportunity to monetize years of money invested in R&D and to really flex a unique part of their models. Frankly, Halliburton is the best in energy at aggregating field tech ahead of it being necessary or deployable - it perfects processes and technologies before the broader industry realizes it even had a need. I believe Halliburton has done this again with its Cementing services division and that it's ready to breakout a particular tech it's been working on in which a small microcap many have never heard of, Applied Minerals (OTCQB:AMNL) - currently valued at ~$42 million, is tethered. This is a convenient break for Halliburton in that oilfield service companies especially are looking for any advantage to capture market share and protect activity levels. Even utilizing and promoting the deployment of historically fringe services like refracs.We're in a ""new normal"" in oil and gas and one that has generally been guided by industry participants as one that's going to take a while to change. I personally believe Brent touches $39 prior to finding a bottom which would have the industry in an even tougher spot than its in if this comes to fruition:For market participants that believe oil isn't heading back to $100 anytime soon it might be time to start looking for those publicly traded companies that can offer something unique in the new normal world of ~$50 oil. That said, and with that setting the figurative context table, Halliburton with its near-100 years of Cementing expertise should be ideally positioned to capitalize on an industry ready for a differentiated player to capture huge market share.First, Cementing is a process of using cement to create a cement sheath to bond and support casing (tubing that is set inside the drilled well to protect and support the wellstream - think the spine in the human body protecting the spinal cord). Cementing also provides zonal isolation in the process of completing a well - zonal isolation is paramount to limiting fluid and gas migration and a host of other problems, some environmental and potentially legal issues causing. Adequate Cementing is necessary to prevent the loss of production, control inter-zonal flow and/or flow to the surface, reduce water production and improve confinement of stimulation treatments. Put simply, Cementing basically provides the structure necessary facilitate production and to ensure the integrity of the well and its production moving forward. It's the all-important structure provider to a well in the same way that ""cementing"" a bridge is the structure provider to the asphalt or cement road used to cross it. I can't understate the importance of Cementing in overall completion and production.The industry sure hasn't as Halliburton has leaned on being the leader in Cementing - even inventing what is known as the ""two plug"" system (which is now SOP for Cementing and which Halliburton has patented) back in 1922, as a way to become an overall service juggernaut. Halliburton has also focused R&D efforts on Cementing and Cementing tech, it has an entire Cementing R&D division, in an effort to continue to be the leader in this process. That's where Applied Minerals comes into play.Halliburton Cementing R&D in 2014 had a patent published for Cement Compositions Comprising Deagglomerated Inorganic Nanotubes and Associated Methods. What does this mean? It means that in researching how to enhance properties of concrete used in well construction that Halliburton achieved significant improvement in tensile strength of concrete when using Applied Minerals mineral Dragonite (a holloysite derivative - halloysite is the primary mineral that drives Applied Minerals company and physical asset valuation currently) as an additive. Halliburton began working on this patent way back in late-2012 in most likely anticipating needing a cement that could hold integrity at higher pressures due to longer laterals and greater depths being achieved industry wide. This has only continued with each year so if this was the case this was a good read by Halliburton. The search for an additive or alternative mixture led Halliburton to Applied Minerals' additive.Now, what Halliburton was able to show was incredible. Halliburton R&D showed that with just a 1.5% loading by weight with halloysite that it could increase the tensile strength of its concrete by a whopping 135%. It wasn't able to show a marginal difference but an incredible one. The best part is that Halliburton Cementing R&D didn't stop at publishing this patent. Cementing R&D has been all over the use of halloysite, which is a member of the kaolin sub group and only found in commercially viable quantities in two mines in the entire world - only one in the western hemisphere (at Applied Minerals' Dragon Mine in Utah), for other fracturing uses and technological advantages. Advantages that are going to become hugely important going forward:Halliburton also published the following patents in using kaolin sub group materials (patent has been hyperlinked to the method):Further validating Halliburton's kaolin/halloysite R&D efforts have been other patents published in securing halloysite's deployment in fracturing and well construction use cases:The point to be made here is that Halliburton might have been the first to research into the uses of Applied Minerals' halloysite for cement/clay enhancing properties but it has been followed in by several other companies - I think this is a good sign as to the validity of the use case. I should also note here that shortly following the publication of the Halliburton patent Applied Minerals hired a Director of Sales, its first in company history as Applied Minerals has been slowly building out infrastructural capacity and seeding market verticals, formerly of BASF (OTCQX:BASFY) employment.Why does this matter? BASF has a huge construction division that itself could benefit from a stronger cement tensile strength (read: BASF's construction division builds bridges and other large cement usage projects). I believe this could have been the result of Applied Minerals lab testing a similar mixture as that patented by Halliburton (or a variant) and proving out the same results. For a cash strapped company like Applied Minerals to bring on additional overhead in a Sales Director it would have to have been very motivated. Again, I believe this to be a validation of the use cases possibly being chased by Halliburton.The bottom line is that Cementing is never going away in the completion process for oil and gas. It's been around for a hundred years and it will continue to be around. Halliburton has paid a particular attention to this part of the operating process in that it knows it's a fixture. I don't believe Halliburton would have invested the R&D dollars into trying to find a way to enhance the properties of cement, especially R&D dollars and the time associated with chasing these enhancements for one of its most important R&D divisions, without seeing something secular it could chase or without intending to deploy the tech in the mid-term. Considering these efforts started three years ago I'd say we're in the mid-term now.There's also the refrac push I mentioned in the beginning of the article and continued deployment of longer and longer wells. Both of these are going to call into question the integrity of wells with a particular focus on Cementing. How convenient is it that Halliburton has a patented method for improving both. Doesn't it make sense for top names like Range Resource (NYSE:RRC) (just to use one example) to build out its well inventory with Cementing that would allow it to restimulate, refrac, and potentially go in longer on the front end should it want to in the now/future? What if Halliburton can get Applied Minerals to JV or partner with it, in the same way it's now doing with BlackRock, to get the economics down to a point where it could say ""no extra charge"" for the tech advance in Cementing it offers? Wouldn't that be a great way to capture market share in a market ripe for disruption?What we know for a fact at this point is two things: 1) Halliburton has invested in developing this Cementing tech and further in setting up an IP moat around it; and 2) that Applied Minerals is the only provider of halloysite in the western hemisphere and only one of two in the world (the other being in Asia). Halliburton has already proven out the tech and it stands to be very reasonable that it could secure oil and gas exclusivity to the tech by partnering, securing a JV, or simply contracting out to Applied Minerals. I believe Cementing will be the division to lead Halliburton's next big market share capture push.Good luck everybody."

Too much leverage is what befell Trans World Airlines (TWA) after Carl Icahn took it private via an LBO in the late '80s. TWA's debt load left it unable to weather the recession brought on by the Gulf War; the airline entered bankruptcy protection in 1992. In May 1992 competitors engaged in the TWA Treatment - slashing air fares when the cash-strapped, heavily-indebted TWA could ill-afford to compete on price.Carl Icahn. Source: twaflight843.comOn my previous article, Blue Shift Research explained how Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) was giving competitors the ""TWA Treatment"":Similar to the airline industry in the early '90s, the oil services industry is cyclical and suffering from declining pricing power. Big oil has cut capex amid lower oil prices, and that has hurt oil services firms. North American land drillers have halved the rig count since Q3 2014, and cut high-margin well site services. Though some oil services firms have low debt and high working capital balances, others are akin to TWA with high debt levels and limited cash.The ""Haves"" Versus The ""Have Nots""To determine which of the oil services firms are best-positioned to survive the oil industry contraction, I compared selected firms based on debt/run-rate EBITDA and work capital positions. The selected firms with North America exposure are Halliburton, Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) Baker Hughes (BHI), National Oilwell Varco (NYSE:NOV), Weatherford (WFT) and Oil States International (NYSE:OIS).Source: Shock ExchangeFor National Oilwell Varco, I used its completion & production unit as a proxy for its North America exposure. This unit sells equipment and solutions used for hydraulic fracking. For Oil States, I used its Wellsite Services division as a proxy. As the chart illustrates, each firm derives over 20% of its revenue from North America. Halliburton and Baker Hughes have the highest exposure at 45% and 38%, respectively.Of note is that Weatherford's Q2 EBITDA in North America was only $5 million and it had a pretax loss of $92 million. Weatherford experienced price declines across most products and services; pressure pumping declined the most, which supports the thesis that Halliburton may be giving price concessions in pressure pumping.Debt/Run-Rate EBITDAThe following chart illustrates debt/run-rate EBITDA for each firm. Run-rate EBITDA is [i] Q1 EBITDA plus [ii] Q2 EBITDA and [iii] annualized.Source: Shock ExchangeMost of the selected firms appear to have debt that is manageable. However, Weatherford's $7.8 billion debt load is 5.2x run-rate EBITDA; in my opinion, its debt is approaching junk levels and could attract the attention of credit rating agencies in this quarter or the next. Its $117 million in quarterly interest expense also makes Weatherford less able to compete on price vis-a-vis competitors.Working CapitalAnother metric that could help determine which firms are best-positioned is working capital, or liquidity.Source: Shock ExchangeHalliburton has over $10 billion of working capital, followed by Schlumberger, National Oilwell and Baker Hughes. Weatherford has nearly $3 billion in working capital; however, it includes $2.9 billion of inventory that I would describe as ""slow-moving."" Weatherford's inventory was $3.1 billion at Q1 2015 and Q4 2015, despite the fact that revenue has declined sharply over that period. To the extent inventory is stale, working capital could also be overstated.Oil States' working capital of $0.5 billion is paltry vis-a-vis competitors. It also includes $240 million of inventory which increased from $232 million in Q4 2014. To the extent inventory is stale, Oil States' working capital could also be overstated. Ultimately, its low working capital offers Oil States less of a buffer in case prices continue to contract. Moreover, nearly 40% of Oil States' revenue is related to drilling and completion services primarily marketed to drillers in the Permian basin in West Texas and the Rocky Mountains - reportedly a hotbed for price concessions.ConclusionHalliburton is offering price concessions on certain products and services to North American land drillers. Of the aforementioned competitors, I believe Weatherford and Oil States lack the balance sheet and/or working capital to withstand such pricing pressure and a protracted decline in the oil industry. Investors should avoid these two stocks."
3349245,48411,2015-07-23T08:05:26-04:00,"Houston, we have a problem. Or rather I should say Halliburton we have a problem; it’s a big one, a $3.5 billion problem.That’s what Halliburton is on the hook for if the Halliburton/Baker Hughes purchase doesn’t go through.There’s good reason, as of the most recent developments, to believe that at best this deal might take more than initially thought to be completed.At worst, there’s reason to believe this deal could fall through.What does this mean for Halliburton and Baker Hughes? I explain.","Houston, we have a problem. Or rather I should say Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) we have a problem. It's a big one, a $3.5 billion problem.That's what Halliburton is on the hook for if the Halliburton/Baker Hughes (BHI) purchase doesn't go through and there's good reason, as of the most recent developments, to believe that at best this deal might take more than initially thought to be completed. At worst, there's reason to believe this deal could fall through.Of course Baker Hughes fully understood the regulatory risk inherent in being gobbled up by the world's second largest oil services company and by a major competitor. In that, Baker Hughes demanded the whopping $3.5 billion reverse termination fee that it did. Halliburton being confident that it could navigate the regulatory risk and that it was willing to do whatever was asked of it (read: divesting Baker Hughes and/or Halliburton assets/revenue segments) by the Department of Justice to close the deal gladly accepted.Baker Hughes, as evidenced by the reverse termination fee, wanted significant assurances that Halliburton had 1) correctly read the regulatory risk and 2) was hugely invested in doing whatever it took to complete the deal. This was made readily apparent in letters between the two companies that Baker Hughes made public:Halliburton all along has been confident that at most it would have to divest businesses that generate ~$7.5 billion in revenues and that likely it would have to do far less. The Department of Justice seems to be thinking more and more these days that even divestitures at the top end of Halliburton's expectations wouldn't be enough to restore a competitive balance to the space. In thinking this it has assigned, according to sources of Bloomberg, one of its top lawyers to the matter.At the center of the competitive landscape question is whether a Halliburton/Baker Hughes NewCo would be able to indirectly outprice smaller competitors from winning contracts when ran parallel with pricing being offered by competitor Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB). Even at half the size of oil servicing space juggernaut Schlumberger the idea of having two much larger than comparable competition names in the space worries regulators in this would essentially set menu pricing in general. Menu pricing that smaller competitors wouldn't be able to match because of smaller economies of scale. There's also the fact that Halliburton/Baker Hughes and Schlumberger would create pricing markets that, based on superior economics from economies of scale and efficiencies, could largely decay competition over time. This of course would exacerbate the problems of concern set forth by the Department of Justice. It's my opinion that the Department of Justice would rather block this acquisition on the front-end rather than try to manage an unwinding or perpetual balancing of competition on the back-end.What does this mean for Halliburton and Baker Hughes? Both companies would be hurting in the immediate term as both would do very well to be able to realize more optimized models as a result of the total restructuring required to execute the acquisition and from the substantial cost savings realized once a NewCo. For a time, these benefits were being priced into both companies' equity. Halliburton would also be out the $3.5 billion fee and the costs associated with progressing the acquisition to this point. Both, obviously, would be counterproductive to the outcome being aimed for in cost cutting and efficiency. I think quite clearly the markets would react negatively to this. Baker Hughes, being the recipient of the $3.5 billion fee, would be hurt significantly less and (depending on total outlay so far that is acquisition related) would likely be better off than where it was prior to signing the acquisition agreement considering the size of the fee taken in. Maybe this is also part of the reason Baker Hughes CEO Martin Craighead demanded the premium 10% deal breakup free rather than the 2014 average of 4%.We'll have to watch closely the next few weeks (months?) for updates from the Department of Justice or from the companies involved (not likely) before making further determinations. In the meantime, expect plenty of volatility and for both Halliburton and Baker Hughes stock to have tops placed on them as a result of the likelihood of this deal now being in question.Good luck everybody."
3353975,84276,2015-07-24T05:20:00-04:00,"Halliburton faces some negatives which investors must factor in before rushing to buy.Stock is a tad expensive at a PE of 23.42.Price is at a crucial technical level, below which we may see $30 per share.","The world's largest fracking services provider recently beat analysts' estimates by 15 cents a share (excluding certain items) in Q2 2015 and has become the new favorite of many investors.Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) is currently trading at $41.54 per share, at a price-to-earnings ratio (ttm) of 23.42. The higher PE ratio is indicative of the investors' bullishness in the future earnings of the company.However, I believe that investors, existing and potential, should NOT jump right in to add shares without weighing the possible negatives that are in store for the company.Halliburton's Baker Hughes Takeover Will Not Be EasyIn November 2014, Halliburton announced that it will acquire the world's third-largest oil services provider Baker Hughes Inc (NYSE: BHI) for $34.6 billion in order to compete with the industry giant Schlumberger (NYSE: SLB). However, the deal has run into difficulties with the US Justice Department who is concerned that the acquisition will be detrimental to smaller oil and gas businesses.Halliburton has proposed selling off assets generating worth $7.5 billion in annual revenue to smaller companies so that they remain competitive but, the enforcement officials are not convinced.Now there are two cases which must be considered here.1. The Deal Gets Blocked - If the deal does not go through, Baker Hughes and Halliburton lose a combined $2 billion in potential cost savings. But what's worse is that if the deal is blocked on antitrust grounds currently haunting HAL, it will have to pay Baker Hughes a breakup remuneration of 10% of the total deal value.2. The Deal Does Get Closed - There is a very strong chance that both the companies will relent further to make this acquisition happen. By relent, I mean that instead of the total $10 billion worth of assets that both the companies have proposed to sell, they agree to shed even more. As the Justice Department looks to increase the pressure, that is certainly a strong possibility. Slowdown in Canada and Falling Rig Count Will Take a Toll on RevenuesThe Bank of Canada was recently left with no choice other than to cut interest rates. The North American economy is now in a recession, having recorded four straight quarters of declining GDP growth rate; the last one came in at -0.1%.In the latest quarter, Halliburton reported better-than-expected profit numbers in North America due to heavy cost-cutting efforts. But if the low oil price environment were to prolong, even that may not help decisively and push the stock price considerably lower from current levels.Halliburton has witnessed a steep decline of 39% in sales in the U.S. and Canada, where the rig count continues to fall. According to the latest set of oil rig count released by Baker Hughes, the number has dropped by 7 to 638.SourceAccording to PacWest, a unit of IHS Inc, companies such as Halliburton that provide fracking services are expected to lower their prices by as much as 35% in North America this year. Since North America raked in exceptional gains for the company in the second quarter, it must be seen whether the same can be achieved in the coming quarters as well.Sounding an alarm on the oil businesses in the United States, Weatherford International Plc had said in April -This may work in favor of Halliburton given its ability to generate higher sales and capture a bigger market share, but this also highlights that the oil situation will only become more precarious going ahead.Iran Will Bomb the Energy MarketAccording to the latest report from Reuters, Iran is eyeing oil and gas projects worth $185 billion after its risky gamble with the nuclear deal.   Saudi Arabia, which is already pumping record crude oil, will up the ante as it seeks to dismantle Iran's plan of cutting into its market share. This oil war, unless stopped quickly, will push the price even lower as the demand for oil fails to match the overwhelming supply.The ""forcefully subdued"" oil and gas prices are challenging even the likes of giants such as Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) which looks poised for a fall. Halliburton, trading at a PE of above 20, may witness jettison by investors if it fails to sustain its profit margin.Take a look at the Monthly Price Chart of Halliburton compared with Crude Oil.SourceIt must also be noted that the price is currently at a make-or-break support point, on the trendline drawn from the lows of 2009. The support line has been retested at least four times and a breach would lead to a massive slide in the stock price. The next strong buying zone is $28-30 (marked in blue). Ouch.As can also be seen from the chart above, Halliburton has a strong correlation with the crude oil prices. Therefore, if the oil price does head further downwards, the stock may face a technical correction to the above-stated support zone, at which it may witness renewed investor attraction.ConclusionIf you believe that the oil prices will remain depressed for an extended period of time, do consider shorting the expensive Halliburton stock now as the technical support may also be breached. However, if you think that the company is available at cheap valuations, do add to your positions but by placing a stop-loss below the historically strong support line."
3363715,86166,2015-07-29T10:36:32-04:00,"HAL has exceeded expectations despite weak oil pricing, and the trend will continue as it is focusing on the needs of oil producers in the current energy environment.
        HAL's Illusion dissolving frac plug is gaining traction in shale areas as it eliminates the need for coil tubing and enhances production at the same time.
        HAL's Q10 pumps deliver 20% higher flow rates with 50% lower maintenance costs than legacy pumps, leading to better cash flow for its clients.
        HAL will see strong demand for Q10 pumps as the global pressure pumping market is slated to grow at a CAGR of 14.6% until 2019, indicating strong addressable opportunity.","Despite challenges prevailing in the oil and gas industry, Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) has exceeded expectations in the last four quarters. In fact, the company has delivered average positive earnings beat of 25% in the last four quarters, which is an indicator of its smart cost management. More importantly, in the second-quarter results reported last week, Halliburton posted earnings of $0.44 per share, beating the consensus estimate of $0.29 by a big margin.Also, its revenue of $5.92 billion was significantly higher than analysts' expectations of $5.78 billion. As such, considering the company's impressive performance, it is not surprising to see that UBS Securities has raised its price target on Halliburton to $80 from $87. In my opinion, Halliburton will be able to achieve this target in the long run on account of its low cost solutions that will help oil producers procure more oil at a lower cost, apart from its own cost reduction moves.In this article, we will take a look at the reasons why Halliburton is a good investment for the long run.Technology improvements will help it land more customersAfter a period of recovery in the first half of the year, oil prices have dropped once again, with the WTI index now trading at around $47/barrel. At the same time, drilling activity in the U.S. has increased, with the latest data suggesting that 21 rigs were brought online in the U.S. last week. A combination of higher production, along with weakness in China, has weighed on oil prices of late.But, oil producers in the U.S. are expected to keep production at strong levels this year despite the drop in oil prices, and this is good news for Halliburton. For example, in Texas, oil output is slated to hit a 43-year high of 1.28 billion barrels this year. This will be a result of a 17% increase in crude production in Texas this year, which will be achieved despite a rapid drop in rig counts over the past year.In fact, companies such as Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY), Noble Energy (NASDAQ:NBL), and Concho Resources (NYSE:CXO) had raised their production outlook earlier this year, even though they have reduced their capital budgets. The reason behind this increased production can be attributed to advanced oil extraction techniques, as oil producers are looking to maintain their production despite lower prices and capital expenses.In such a scenario, Halliburton's latest solutions should gain more traction going forward. Halliburton launched the Illusion dissolving frac plug in the previous quarter. This dissolving frac plug provides high performance isolation during plug-and-perf operations, while functioning like a normal plug. This plug doesn't need any balls, baffles, or a different special casing design. Moreover, once dissolved, it leaves the full wellbore open that will help oil companies maximize their production.Additionally, this frac plug eliminates the need for coil tubing that is needed to extract the plug, thereby leading to lower costs. As a result, by deploying this technology, Halliburton will help its customers increase production at a lower cost. As a result, it is not surprising to see that this technology is already gaining traction in the end market.According to Artie Burke, Halliburton's Vice President of Completion Tools, ""We have successfully run Illusion plugs for our customers in the Eagle Ford, Bakken, and Woodford shale plays. This is a truly game-changing technology for the industry. We're excited to bring this next-generation product to the market that will reduce risk, allow production to commence sooner and improve the overall cash flow for our customers.""Increased conversion of the pressure pumping fleet to frac of the future is a catalystDue to a reduction in the rig count and idling of more than 40% to 50% of industry capacity, the pressure pumping segment has not done well this year for Halliburton. However, oil producers have started focusing on lateral drilling. In fact, the stages per well have increased more than 20%, while proppant volumes pumped per well are up 35% year-over-year. These growing volumes in the stage count as well as proppant volumes indicate positive market conditions for pressure pumping.Also, the smaller oil players have also started to order incremental frac capacity. This is driving the market for pressure pumping. This should help Halliburton as it is continuously investing in the pressure pumping market, particularly in the frac of the future solutions. The company recently said that it now plans to deliver incremental Q10 frac spreads into 2015 and beyond. The Q10 pumps are ideal for larger volume jobs as they consistently deliver 20% higher flow rates with 50% lower maintenance costs than legacy pumps.In fact, Halliburton has replaced close to 40% of its pressure pumping fleet till date to its frac of the future solutions, and expects to raise the conversion to 50% of its pressure pumping fleet by the year-end. In fact, Frac of the Future represents about 30% of Halliburton's North American fleet currently, which indicates that the company is seeing stronger demand for this solution due to the merits that it provides.Additionally, Halliburton is doing the right thing by focusing on this area, as according to TechNavio, the global pressure pumping market is slated to grow at a CAGR of 14.6% over the period 2014-2019.ConclusionHalliburton's performance in the previous quarter indicates that the company is managing the downturn in oil pricing smartly. Moreover, by focusing on solutions that will help oil companies enhance production, reduce costs, and augment cash flow performance, Halliburton is focusing in the right area. Thus, in my opinion, investors should remain invested in Halliburton for the long run as it looks well-positioned to perform well even in a weak oil pricing environment."

In its first-quarter release, it noted that ""Industry prospects will continue to be challenged in the coming quarters, and visibility to the ultimate depth and length of this cycle remains uncertain.""But on Thursday, Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB), the world's largest oilfields-services firm, outpaced its earnings expectations, though they dove 30%, and offered recovery hope: ""We believe that the North American rig count may now be touching the bottom, and that a slow increase in both land drilling and completion activity could occur in the second half of the year,"" Chief Executive Paal Kibsgaard said in its earnings release. More than 50% of Halliburton's revenues are gleaned from North American operations.The company no doubt will update investors on the progress of its $35 billion bid to buy smaller rival Baker Hughes (BHI), which has roiled anti-trust regulators across the globe. The two agreed earlier this month to extend the Dept. of Justice's review of the acquisition until Nov. 25 and its closing until Dec. 1. They're also in negotiations with the European Commission and other foreign regulators. Should regulators rebuff the deal, Halliburton is on the hook for a $3.5 billion breakup fee, an unusually hefty sum.While most analysts believe the two will overcome the antitrust hurdles, not all investors agree. Halliburton's stock has tumbled some 18% since the friendly takeover was announced in November, and there have been three times as many short-sellers in the stock in recent sessions. Based on current implied volatility levels, traders are looking for a 3% move on the stock and we've been seeing 39 puts and 42 calls for August expirations.Also reporting ahead of the bell Monday is financial services giant Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS). The struggle for financials this quarter has been beating the topline.Analysts, on average, are looking for a per-share profit of 74 cents on revenues of $9.1 billion, though some are modeling 75 cents a share on revenue of $9.2 billion. Either way, it will be more than 10% below year-ago results.Trading revenues are expected to rise from easy comparisons to year-over-year fixed income and secondary equity activity in international markets. The stock has appreciated better than 22% on a year-over-year basis, far outrunning the Dow's roughly 6% increase.

3347725,40351,2015-07-22T17:51:52-04:00,"Drilling activity has dropped sharply all around the world following the slump in oil prices.
        And yet, despite the current downturn, Halliburton is outperforming at home and abroad.
        The company’s international margins are actually improving while it is showing remarkable resilience in North America.
        It appears that the markets have over-estimated the impact of the downturn on the international margins of Halliburton and Schlumberger.","The slump in oil prices and the subsequent drop in oil and gas drilling activity all around the world has hit oilfield service companies, but Halliburton (NYSE:HAL), the second biggest player in the industry, continues to impress.Crude oil price has come under pressure lately, with WTI futures briefly going under $50 a barrel on Monday, due in large part to concerns regarding an uptake in Iranian oil exports which threaten to exacerbate the supply glut. Drilling activity has already slowed down considerably, with the U.S. rig count falling by 40% in the second quarter. The latest data from Baker Hughes (BHI) showed a decline in the number of oil rigs during the week by seven to 638 units. The drop, which came on the heels of two consecutive increases, has dashed hopes regarding a sustainable uptake in drilling activity.Producers in the international markets, particularly the non-OPEC nations, are also dialing down on exploration and production work. In Norway, for instance, the leading operator Statoil (STO) will be drilling 50% fewer wells. Producers are also either canceling or delaying investments on major projects. For the 11 years ending 2013, oil companies approved investments at an average of more than 20 major projects per year, Deutsche Bank AG estimates. Last year, however, these companies committed to just six projects. In the ongoing soft oil price environment, this number could come down further. And yet, despite the current downturn, Halliburton is outperforming at home and abroad.Halliburton has recently released its quarterly results in which its revenues dropped by 26% from last year to $5.92 billion while its earnings fell from $0.91 a share to $0.06 a share. Excluding the impact of one-off items such as Baker Hughes merger related charges and restructuring costs, profits were down a modest 10.2% to $0.44 a share. The company's performance was better than market's expectation of a profit of $0.29 a share from revenues of $5.78 billion, as per data from Thomson Reuters.But what's particularly impressive that unlike the previous downturn of 2008 which led to significant decline in international margins in 2009-10, this time, Halliburton is actually improving its profitability. During the quarter, Halliburton's operating margins from international markets, which are responsible for 52% of the company's revenues, increased from 13.8% a year ago to 17.9%. In a research report emailed to me, Oppenheimer's analyst James Schumm noted that Halliburton delivered better than expected margins in every geographic segment. Interestingly, Halliburton's bigger rival Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) also managed to grow its international margins on a year-over-year basis. Analysts at Wells Fargo have said that Schlumberger's margins have ""significantly exceeded our expectations.""It appears that the markets have over-estimated the impact of the downturn on the international margins of the two leading oilfield services companies. That's probably because investors continue to look back at the previous down cycle of 2008, but that downturn was far more severe than what we're currently going through and came on the back of one of the worst financial crisis this world has ever seen.On the other hand, in North America, Halliburton's operating margins have fallen from 18.2% last year to 4.9% on the back of the relentless pricing pressure. But here, the company is not only showing resilience in the face of the sharp drop in drilling activity, but also seems to be gaining market share. The 25% sequential drop in revenues and less than 10% decline in stage count were better than the 40% drop in rig count witnessed during the second quarter.ConclusionDrilling activity has fallen considerably but Halliburton is gaining market share in North America and continues to report higher margins in international market. The company's merger with Baker Hughes will bolster its position against its competitors, particularly Schlumberger. As a result, Halliburton will emerge as a bigger and better company from the downturn. Therefore, I believe the current oil price weakness gives investors an opportunity to buy this stock at attractive multiple as compared to historical average. The company's shares are currently priced 6.5x 2017 EV/EBITDA, below historical average of 7x."
3339345,33291,2015-07-20T13:26:52-04:00,"It has been a rough time to be in oil so Halliburton's just reported results caught me by surprise.The company is controlling expenses and the negative impact of continued pricing pressure is not crushing margins to the degree we saw in prior downturns.While there is no sign oil is about to recover, this is a stock I believe can outperform in a recovery, but I would hold for now.","Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) is an oil service stock that I have traded many times over the years. As many of you know I have long preferred its rival Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB), although both are very similar in many respects. I recently reported on Schlumberger and discussed how despite that absolute bloodbath in the oil sector, things weren't as bad as they seemed. While very similar to Schlumberger, Halliburton has unique differences. It provides a range of services and products for the exploration, development, and production of oil and natural gas to oil and gas companies all over the globe.It has been a rough time to be in oil so let's talk about the company's recent performance. With oil prices so low of late, it has crushed the company. Simply put, the higher the price the better. Expectations for the company has declined along with toil prices. That said, like Schlumberger, Halliburton has surprised the Street with its second quarter results. The company saw income from continuing operations in its second quarter of $380 million. This translated to $0.44 per share. Still, this beat analyst estimates by $0.15 per share. For those paying attention, this is about half the numbers that were seen at this time last year. Ouch. Last year the company saw $776 million, or $0.91 per share in earnings.So just how did Halliburton get here and beat earning by this much? Well, it managed to control expenses, but also delivered revenues that beat expectations. Despite being down 27% year-over-year, revenues came in at $5.91 billion and beat estimates by $130 million. This is the same path the Schlumberger saw. Severe year-over-year declines, but much better than expected. Operating income was adjusted operating income was $643 million in the second quarter of 2015, also down heavily year-over-year. What I think is important to focus on is how the company did in specific areas.It is no surprise that operating income declined as a result of lower activity levels for all product lines, exacerbated by pricing declines, primarily in North America. In North America, revenue declined 25% quarter-over-quarter. It is important to note that this significantly outperformed the 40% decline in average rig count. Although prices worsened in the quarter the impact margins were less severe than previous downturns, demonstrating that Halliburton's cost reduction initiatives are helping to offset the current market challenges. This was similar to what Schlumberger saw. In Latin America weakness was driven by Venezuela, primarily due to the negative currency impact of the new exchange rate, as well as budget cuts throughout the region as customers are focused on cash flows. The company also noted that it saw increased profitability in its Europe/Africa/CIS region, due to activity improvements in Eurasia and Norway. Projects in the Middle East are moving forward despite markets in Russia being uneasy. Dave Lesar, chair and chief executive officer, said:Looking ahead there is no sign that oil is going to rebound. However, Schlumberger has been seeing upgrades since its report. I suspect Halliburton could follow. That fact is, considering what has happened in the sector, Halliburton is doing very well. The overall global economic outlook continues to be mixed. The gap between oil supply and demand had narrowed in recent months, but there is some evidence, as I discussed in the Schlumberger article above that this could be turning around. I have a hold rating on the stock at present on the stock, but I could not fault those who started initiating a longer-term position at present levels."

        Especially considering that shares have drifted lower while analyst estimates and all other fundamentals have remained in-line with that of much higher pricing.
        I realize that the BHI merger being hung up currently and lower oil pricing have had a press down effect on shares but this much?
        I mean, Halliburton is now down near 15% since late-April.
        That’s real valuation having been evaporated and on what exactly?","Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) is a really, really interesting name at current pricing. Especially considering that shares have drifted lower while analyst estimates and all other fundamentals have remained in-line with that of much higher pricing. I realize that the BHI merger being hung up currently while under a review from the DOJ and lower oil pricing have had, and justifiably should have had, a press down effect on shares but this much? I mean, Halliburton is now down near 15% since late-April. That's real valuation having been evaporated and on what exactly?Again, I understand that the sustained low pricing environment for oil and the growing more unpredictable weekly pricing of the commodity has had a drag on Halliburton shares. I get that and clearly Halliburton now trades near a 1:1 correlation with oil. This is after having a loose if any correlation to the commodity prior to roughly 12 months ago:There's also the fact that Halliburton now trades with an anchor around its neck. Halliburton trades at an all-time high short interest. In the last 30 days short interest has upticked 11.3% while in the last 90 days it's upticked a whopping 17.3%. Yes, this is still Halliburton that we're talking about. To put the current short interest into context, actual shares outstanding that are sold short have increased 500% dating back to November 2014. That's five hundred percent. All told 5.8% of the float is being shorted, a meaningful number:But getting back to the overall fundamentals, at least what we can opine on between quarterly reporting, not much has changed since 15% or so ago. From a valuation and modeling standpoint, inclusive of the sustained low oil pricing, analysts have marked down Halliburton's full year 2015 and 2016 diluted EPS estimates $0.06. That's it. They've also collectively held firm on Halliburton's revenue and EBITDA estimates for both years:Further, net debt and free cash flow per share hasn't seen any marked negative estimate revisions. Both are hugely important indications of long term health as both are transparent indications of balance sheet and operational integrity. Both, at least to the analyst community, continue to look at least as good as they did 15% ago:Maybe the cause for the drop has been analysts getting conservative and hitting the stock with lowered price targets? Maybe it was the consensus opinion shifting? No, not that either as Halliburton has maintained price targets across the board. In fact, it's now at its widest divergence between consensus price targets and spot trading price that it has been in a long, long time. This has been a buying signal in the past but always into counter technical trends:So what's my final analysis of why Halliburton has traded lower? Pretty simple - negative beta and a correlation to oil. That's it and neither one of those has anything to do with the underlying model or the health of Halliburton longer term. Which I think is a buying opportunity if you can take a buy and hold approach with shares.That means if you can layout the capital for long-dated CALL options or if you can simply begin accumulating shares with the understanding that the only sure thing coming your way in the mid-term might be the 1.72% yield you should be OK. Everything is going to be OK at Big Red when it's all said and done. The pain trade might go on for a while longer, it might go on for a lot longer, or it might be near its end. In any situation what I know is that Halliburton isn't going to zero and the company is in a unique competitive position from a global standpoint. It's going to be a necessary player in a necessary space for a long, long time. If oil stays at low pricing for too much longer its ""too big to fail"" positioning in the space will greatly benefit it. Famine isn't always a bad thing if you're the end survivor.Good luck everybody."

        The merger with Baker Hughes remains on track for $2 billion in cost reduction evens after current cuts.
        The stock remains the play for a rebound in shale drilling as lower costs make the industry more profitable at lower commodity prices.","Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) reported another solid quarter, especially considering the upheaval in the prime North American land drilling market. The oilfield services giant is trading near the lows while working on closing the Baker Hughes (BHI) merger.The stock got a little bump from easily surpassing estimates and suggesting that reduced costs will help the company maintain solid margins going forward. Without a bigger draw down in EPS numbers, Halliburton has possibly bottomed especially considering the research (see Halliburton: Slowly Moving Merger Still Provides A Huge Catalyst) that the Baker Hughes deal will help the company produce significantly higher margins.The company produced earnings of $0.44 that easily smashed estimates. Halliburton forecasts some more pressure during Q3 due to a full impact of Q2 pricing declines. The key though to the better than expected numbers was the ability to increase Eastern Hemisphere income by 17% with a small 3% hit to revenue. In essence, Halliburton was able to remove the costs due to the global downturn without taking the actual revenue hits.Maybe the most interesting statement from the earnings release is the suggestion that the new entity will provide $2 billion in synergies beyond any of the cuts already taken by both companies. One big concern was that a lot of the synergy gains were already included in some of the current employee reductions.Along with the synergy benefits after closing the merger, the CEO sees the land drilling industry unable to keep pricing at the current level.It appears that Halliburton has withstood the big hit from the industry while remaining very profitable. Along with that, it has the catalyst from Baker Hughes for a big profit improvement going into 2016.Halliburton still relies on North America for nearly 60% of revenue so it is clearly the industry leader to play on a return to shale drilling. Remember that Schlumberger is the exact opposite with a bigger play in International locations to a tune of over 70%.The key takeaway is that the Q3 results are likely the low point in the industry. The all-important domestic market shows signs of rebounding and pricing is unsustainable. Halliburton should see some bump up in estimates going forward. After that, remember that Baker Hughes provides an immense catalyst for improving profits once it closes later this year."

        The company generated significant decline in sales and earnings.
        Oil prices are likely to remain volatile.
        Halliburton could experience more volatility in the coming days on muted oil prices.","Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) announced results for the second quarter of fiscal 2015. The company generated soft results on slow demand and falling oil prices. It consolidated revenue declined 16% to $5.9 billion on sequential basis. Its revenue growth declined from all regions including Latin America, North America and Eastern Hemisphere. In addition, it's both business segments declined significantly compared to the recent periods. Revenue from Halliburton's Completion and Production segment declined 19% to $3.4 billion compared to the first quarter of 2015. Revenue from Drilling and Evaluation segment declined 12% to $2.5 billion, relative to the first quarter of 2015.On earnings side, Halliburton posted income from continuing operations of $380 million, or $0.44 per diluted share, relative to $418 million, or $0.49 per diluted share in the first quarter of this year. The company's adjusted operating income stood at $643 million in the second quarter, relative to adjusted operating income of $699 million in the first quarter of this year. Its earnings declined significantly on falling sales and depressed margins. Its cash generating potential is also falling on significant decline in earnings.On the positive side, the company is working on achieving its long-term goals despite headwinds. Halliburton is progressing on the proposed acquisition of Baker Hughes. In addition, the company is selling its low-performing assets. Recently, it announced a decision to sell the Fixed Cutter and Roller Cone Drill Bits, Directional Drilling, and Logging-While-Drilling/Measurement-While-Drilling businesses as part of the regulatory review of the pending Baker Hughes acquisition.HAL's share price is declining on fall in oil prices. Halliburton is an oilfield company and its profitability entirely depends on the growth in exploration & production activities. With the constant decline in oil prices over the past three quarters, its share price is also falling. In my recent article, I predicted it to be a risky play for defensive investors on an expected volatility in oil prices. Declining sales and earnings growth along with the volatility in its share price validated my opinion. Moving on, with predicted decline of 35% in E&P investments in North America and 15% in international markets could hurt its financial performance.In addition, this situation will create strong competition among oilfield companies and will result in low prices for their products and service. Moreover, oil prices are falling on slump in China's equity markets along with a liquidity situation of Greece. Furthermore, Iran's latest nuclear deal is also creating volatility in oil prices, as Iran has an estimated 30 million barrels of crude in storage. Bank of America predicted that oil could drop below $50/ barrel in 3Q15 on falling demand and increasing supply. I also have a similar opinion on oil prices, as Arab countries are growing their production despite imbalance in supply and demand. In addition, oilfield services firms have a tough year ahead as producers squeeze them for deeper discounts.In ConclusionHalliburton could experience more volatility in the coming days, as oil prices are not showing any sign of stabilization. Its merger with Baker Hughes will expand its revenue base, but this merger could adversely impact its financial performance and cash balance if the oil prices do not climb back in the range of $60-$70 per barrel. In the short-term, I am not seeing oil prices back at $70 per barrel on increasing production from Arab countries along with nuclear deal with Iran. Thus, I think buying Halliburton in a current situation would not be a wise idea."

Analysts are expecting revenue of $5.78 billion and EPS of $0.29. The revenue estimate is off 18% compared to the $7.1 billion the company reported last quarter. Below are the company's historical financial results:The following are key items investors should focus on:North AmericaAfter Schlumberger's (NYSE:SLB) Q2 earnings report showed a decline in North American revenue of 27% sequentially and 39% Y/Y, ""North America"" remain curse words for oil services stocks. Where Schlumberger derives about 26% of its revenue from North America, Halliburton's exposure is 50%:Source: Shock ExchangeIn Q1 2015 Halliburton's North American revenues fell 25% sequentially, while total revenue was off 20%. Given its outsized exposure to North America, a continued erosion of revenue from the region will punish Halliburton on Monday.Declining EBITDA MarginsRevenue declines are already baked into the story. For Halliburton to keep investors excited about its business prospects, it must maintain operating margins. Q1 EBITDA declined 28%, outstripping the fall off in revenue. EBITDA margins also fell from 20% to 15%:Source: Shock ExchangeThe company has already laid off 6,600 employees since the oil industry contraction, and I expect more this quarter. However, Halliburton must do more than simply lay off workers if it wants to maintain margins. Industry chatter suggests it unsuccessfully tried to cancel railcar orders from The Greenbriar Companies (NYSE:GBX) and Trinity Industries (NYSE:TRN). I will be keen to hear from management about its other efforts to cut costs in lockstep with revenue declines.ValuationDespite it declining revenue and EBITDA margins, at $40 HAL trades at over 15x earnings. The stock has been buttressed by its pending merger with Baker Hughes (BHI), and the $2 billion in cost synergies the marriage is expected to yield. However, I would prefer to focus on Halliburton's fundamentals. In my opinion, its declining revenue and earnings do not justify its 15x p/e multiple.ConclusionHAL is down over 40% over the past 12 months, versus a 10% gain for the S&P 500 (NYSEARCA:SPY). Given Halliburton's outsized exposure to North America and declining EBITDA margins, I expect the stock to fall further. Investors should avoid HAL."

According to Bloomberg, the divestitures include a drill bits unit and a unit that uses data to steer and track the direction of drills. Despite early chatter that heavyweights like GE (NYSE:GE), National Oilwell Varco (NYSE:NOV) or Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) could be interested, market chatter now suggests that uncertainty over oil markets could stymie the sale process:Halliburton's asset sales may face headwinds for two reasons:Q1 Oil Price Rebound Could Be A Head FakeThe market chatter of a challenged sale process is not that surprising given stagnant oil prices. Average oil prices have bounced off of their Q1 2015 lows of $54; however, at $64 they are still about 42% below the $110 average price enjoyed by big oil in Q2 2014.Source: Shock ExchangeChina, the world's largest oil importer, is not helping matters. Its crude oil imports fell 50% Y/Y for the month of May. China's economy grew 7.4% in 2014; according to the IMF that growth is expected to decline to 6.8% and 6.3% in 2015 and 2016, respectively. That excludes the country's current stock market turmoil, which has seen Hong Kong's Hang Seng index pull back nearly 9% on Wednesday.China has urged brokerages to invest $19 billion in the market to stem the free fall. This liquidity measure is ultimately back-stopped by China's central bank, which means that's about $19 billion less that the government could spend on commodities like oil, aluminum, etc. Iron ore prices have also pulled back on fears of a slow down in China, which is also the world's largest steel producer. At this juncture, as China goes, so goes commodities which is not good for Halliburton's asset sales.North America Land Drilling Is Out Of FavorMorgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) estimates that oil industry capex could decline by $130 billion or 25% Q2. To stem cash burn big oil has also reduced its rig count, which has negatively impacted North American land drilling equipment sales and services. Q1 Sales to North America for Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB), Halliburton and Baker Hughes fell sequentially by 25%, 25% and 39%, respectively. Since, ""North America"" are curse words for the oil services space.Q1 revenue for Weatherford's (WFT) land drilling segment fell 43% sequentially, while Oil States International (NYSE:OIS) recently warned its well site services revenue could fall 37% in Q2. If Halliburton's asset sales related to drilling activity are also experiencing declining revenue and operating income, they could scare away potential buyers. Furthermore, it would be difficult for buyers to project future earnings and cash flows for the properties - building blocks for a valuation methodology.Implications For The MergerIn effect, Halliburton is attempting to sell assets in the worst -performing sector of the oil services space, while the direction of oil prices are uncertain. The implications for a disappointing sale process would have the following implications for the Halliburton / Baker Hughes merger:Negative ArbitrageThe acquisition price for Baker Hughes is [i] 1.12 HAL share of each BHI share and [ii] $19 per BHI share. Halliburton would also inherit Baker Hughes' net debt of $2.3 billion. In early June the transaction equated to 8.1x Baker Hughes' last 12 months EBITDA through March 31, 2015 (""LTM15"") of $4.0 billion:Source: Shock ExchangeIf Halliburton's assets are sold for less than the 8.1x EBITDA Halliburton is acquiring Baker Hughes for - this would create a ""negative arbitrage."" This is a likely scenario; a major part of Baker Hughes' merger value is derived from $2 billion in projected cost synergies from cutting out overlapping fixed costs. If prospective buyers of Halliburton's assets did not place a value on cost synergies, they may not be willing to pay the same EBITDA multiple. At the end of the day, a negative arbitrage would destroy shareholder value.Negative Merger SentimentThe ""buy BHI, short HAL"" arbitrage play has been popularized by hedge funds and individuals who think they are smarter than the market. Supporting the trade is a $3.5 billion break-up fee Halliburton would have to pay if the deal is not consummated. However, prior to consummating the merger Halliburton must first pull off the asset sales. A disappointing sale process could create negative sentiment for the merger. It could also cause investors to question whether the buyout price, set in Q4 when average oil prices were $74, is too rich.Worse, a hung deal could signal that the business prospects of oil services companies are more bleak than anticipated. The one scenario where the merger arbitrage play would not work is if the merger unraveled. In my opinion, a hung deal for Halliburton's asset sales would be one of two events that could force its board to re-examine the deal. A dreadful earnings report in Q2 or Q3 by Baker Hughes would be the other.ConclusionHalliburton currently trades at 6.4x trailing EBITDA, which is in the range of my 5.0x - 7.0x metric for cyclical names. However, its Q2 EBITDA fell 42% sequentially and I expect that trend to continue. On a forward basis, Halliburton's EBITDA multiple is probably a lot higher. We will know more when the company reports earnings later this month. Sans the merger, I believe Baker Hughes' value would free fall 60%. Investors should avoid both Halliburton and Baker Hughes."

        Low cost profile will allow it to renegotiate contracts and still be profitable.
        Current market conditions call for the renegotiation of contracts and lower costs will allow the company to offer better rates to the clients.","The fall in the crude prices has affected every player in the industry regardless of the size of the business. Whenever the industry goes through such situation, there is always an opportunity for consolidation. Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) has taken advantage of the situation by merging with Baker Hughes (BHI). This merger will bring a number of benefits to the company - the most important benefit will be the scale - a larger scale will allow the company to have lower costs, which is extremely important in current situation as most of the E&P companies are looking to renegotiate the contracts.The company has good prospects lined up for the future as it has diversified its business around the world. It is currently working on a number of projects and has some smart strategies to tackle the current slump in the industry. Another reason why Halliburton could be a long-term pick is the opportunity to operate in three areas - unconventional, deepwater and mature oilfields. It is making use of surface efficiency to drive down costs per barrel of oil. On the other hand, the deepwater strategy will enhance reliability and decrease uncertainty in the business. These strategies will allow Halliburton to increase the life of the oil wells for its customers, and hence, the company can expect to gain more business. Efficiency matters a lot in the poor pricing environment.Halliburton is enhancing its service capacity by expanding infrastructure and transport potential. In fact, the company has enhanced its sand terminal capacity above 100%, and it is doubling the current rate fleet as well. These combined initiatives should help the company achieve better efficiency. However, in the past few months, several oil companies have reduced their capital spending by a considerable margin due to the weak pricing environment. As such, an increase in oil prices will eventually create better market conditions and encourage these companies to increase investments.Halliburton's merger with Baker Hughes will bring substantial cost synergies for the company. As it is common with the merger of this scale, the company will have to sell some assets in order to get through the regulatory process and get rid of some redundant operations. These cost synergies will allow the company to offer lower rates to its clients as the E&P companies look to remain above the water through cost cuts. Halliburton has now cut a total of 9,000 jobs, or more than 10% of its global workforce as the crash in oil prices forced drillers to cut back. Furthermore, it expects to cut capital spending by 15% this year to $2.8 billion.The fact that Halliburton is able to increase its revenue over the course of the last two years and maintain its profitability in such adverse oil price environment is quite impressive. The company has good valuation metrics - P/E Ratio of 16 is well below the industry average of 24. However, as the stock price has taken a massive hit over the last 12 months, the trailing P/E might not be a good indicator of value - forward P/E of 21, however, still looks attractive at 21. The most important metrics to look at are the growth in net income and the operating/net margins. Average net income growth over the past three years have been over 7% while operating and net margins are also above the industry averages. In addition, HAL is generating strong cash flows, and it returns value to its shareholders by stock buyback and increasing dividend payments.Keeping in mind the crash in oil prices with little improvement in the second half of the year, I see stock prices for Halliburton to be more or less the same level as they are now in the short-term. However, this stock makes a good long-term investment due to its growth and expansion prospects. The merger with Baker Hughes gives it a better cost profile and a larger scale and as the crude prices start to recover, HAL will be one of the first few stocks to gain.Disclosure: I am not a registered investment advisor and the views expressed in this article are my own.

For example, Seeking Alpha contributor FX Analyst recently wrote that the company will survive the downturn in oil prices through acquisitions. Stock Exchange also considered the effects of the Baker Hughes (BHI) merger as paramount in the valuation, and Value Ideas believes Baker Hughes will help bring low-cost solutions in the deepwater segment. Such a qualitative analysis is important before making an investment decision, but it is critical when analyzing Halliburton to consider the company's intrinsic value in relation to its price.In fact, Benjamin Graham, the father of value investing, taught that the most important aspect to consider is whether a company is trading at a discount relative to its intrinsic value. It is through a thorough fundamental analysis that the investor is able to make a determination about a potential investment's merits. Here's a look at how the company fares in the ModernGraham valuation model.The model is inspired by the teachings of Benjamin Graham and considers numerous metrics intended to help the investor reduce risk levels. The first part of the analysis is to determine whether the company is suitable for the very conservative Defensive Investor or the less conservative Enterprising Investor who is willing to spend a greater amount of time conducting further research.In addition, Graham strongly suggested that investors avoid speculation in order to remove the subjective elements of emotion. This is best achieved by utilizing a systematic approach to analysis that will provide investors with a sense of how a specific company compares to another. By using the ModernGraham method, one can review a company's historical accomplishments and determine an intrinsic value that can be compared across industries.HAL data by YChartsDefensive Investor - Must pass at least 6 of the following 7 tests: Score = 6/7Enterprising Investor - Must pass at least 4 of the following 5 tests or be suitable for a Defensive Investor: Score = 6/5Valuation SummaryKey DataBalance Sheet - March 2015Earnings Per ShareEarnings Per Share - ModernGrahamDividend HistoryHAL Dividend data by YChartsConclusionHalliburton passes the initial requirements of both the Defensive Investor and the Enterprising Investor. The Defensive Investor is only concerned with the level of earnings growth over the last ten years, while the Enterprising Investor has no initial concerns. As a result, all value investors should feel very comfortable proceeding to the next part of the analysis, which is a determination of the company's intrinsic value.When it comes to valuation, it is critical to consider the company's earnings history. In this case, the company has seen its EPSmg (normalized earnings) rise from $2.39 in 2011 to only an estimated $2.51 for 2015. This level of earnings growth does not support the market's implied estimate for 4.81% annual growth over the next 7-10 years.The recent earnings growth has averaged around 1% per year, so the market is implying there will be a jump in earnings growth. However, the ModernGraham valuation model uses a much more conservative growth estimate and returns an estimate of intrinsic value falling below the market's price, indicating that Halliburton is overvalued at the present time."

Pair trades can be a sensational way to play the market. They can take not only market risk, but also sector risk out of the equation. Of course, an investor has to choose wisely and make sure the short side doesn't get a buyout offer.I can predict two things about my pair trade. First, I guarantee my trade won't generate the highest return in the contest. Second, it's very likely that I will come closest to predicting the exact return. I expect my trade to return just under 10% and to do it within six months.My pair trade: Long Baker Hughes (BHI) and Short Halliburton (NYSE:HAL).The Deal and Deal TermsOn November 17, 2014, the second- and third-largest oil service companies in the world announced that they would merge. Halliburton agreed to pay a whopping 41% premium to the stock price of Baker Hughes on October 10, 2014, the day prior to Halliburton's initial offer to Baker Hughes. The transaction is structured as a cash-and-stock deal, with BHI holders receiving a fixed exchange ratio of 1.12 HAL shares plus $19.00 in cash.The Deal SpreadThe market priced the spread on day one at 14%, due to the high price tag of the deal and potential regulatory concerns. While the spread has bounced around in the past 7 months, it is currently at 9.9%, having crept up lately. Some investors may be starting to worry that the closing isn't a sure thing. Articles on Seeking Alpha such as this one have been making the bear case.The VotesOn March 27, shareholders of both companies overwhelmingly approved the deal. 99% of HAL shareholders approved Halliburton's proposal, while 98% of BHI shareholders voted in favor of the tie-up.RegulatoryIn February, a second request was issued by the United States Department of Justice. This was not unexpected in a deal of this size and between two of the top three companies in oil services.During the merger announcement, Halliburton had said it agreed to divest businesses that generate up to $7.5 billion in revenues, if required by regulators, although the company believed that the divestitures required would be significantly less. In April, HAL announced that it would divest $3.5 billion in assets in the first round of divestitures. The final sale of those assets are subject to obtaining final approval of the BHI deal. Also, during the Q1 conference call, the company said it expects there will likely be additional divestitures and that it would provide updates at the appropriate time.IntegrationIn December, the two companies announced an Integration Leadership plan. In April, they provided an update:Break-up feeBefore the merger deal was signed, Baker Hughes was less than 100% certain that the DOJ would approve. So Halliburton agreed to pay a fee of $3.5 billion if the transaction terminates due to a failure to obtain required antitrust approvals. This is quite a large sum, which equates to about $8 per BHI share. Halliburton is confident that a combination is achievable from a regulatory standpoint.Halliburton clearly wants Baker Hughes. In fact, before the signed agreement, the company was preparing to go hostile.The TradeBuy BHI and short 1.12 HAL shares. If and when the deal closes, the gain would be about 10%. Should it not close, which I don't expect will happen, the trade would likely be a loser, as BHI could fall under $50 - perhaps under $40. The $8 break-up fee would cushion the pain somewhat.ConclusionThe idea of a pair trade is to be long one stock that goes up and another which is correlated in some way to go down. If the Halliburton/Baker Hughes merger closes, as is extremely likely, my trade will be a winner."

Drilling activity is off 47% Y/Y.If ""cutbacks by energy companies"" do not abate by Q3, Halliburton's shareholders might sour on its deal with Baker Hughes.Any indication that the Baker Hughes merger is in jeopardy would send Halliburton's stock plummeting.","According to the Federal Reserve, industrial production declined 0.3% in April, its fifth consecutive monthly decline. Manufacturing growth helps create jobs and is broadly used to predict growth in GDP. Capacity utilization also fell from 78.6 to 78.2; declining capacity utilization could portend a slack in labor or a decline in prices for raw materials. That said, cutbacks by energy companies caused drilling activity to plunge 14.5%, negatively impacting industrial production:""Cutbacks by Energy Companies"" Ominous for HalliburtonDrilling activity has declined about 47% over the past 12 months; there has been talk of shale oil companies opening up the spigots over the coming months, but that remains to be seen. That said, ""cutbacks by energy companies"" are ominous for Halliburton (NYSE:HAL). In Q1 Halliburton's revenue declined 20% sequentially; ""North America"" was like a curse word as the decline in rig count and drilling activity caused revenue from North America to fall 25%. Meanwhile, EBITDA fell 42% sequentially on lower revenue and margin deterioration:With an enterprise value of $45 billion, the company trades at 7.5x last 12 months EBITDA of $6 billion. In my opinion, the valuation reflects investors' expectation of a rebound in oil prices. Oil prices have rebounded over 30% from their trough in mid-January. However, rising oil prices does not equate to an immediate pickup in capex spending by drillers -- a driver of Halliburton's revenue. Oil companies might be loathe to complete wells or increase capex, particularly North American shale companies with the highest production costs. Instead, they may prefer to squirrel away capital in case the oil rebound is a head fake.Impact on Baker Hughes DealAnother driver of bullishness is the company's pending merger with Baker Hughes (BHI). The deal -- which currently values Baker Hughes at about $71 per share (9% premium to $65 share price) -- assumes about $2 billion in synergies from cutting overlapping operations. Baker Hughes trades at 7.7x LTM0315 EBITDA, which is not justified by its 83% sequential decline in Q1 EBITDA. Q1 EBITDA fell to $259 million from $1.5 billion in the previous quarter due to a decline in revenue, and a decline in margins from 22% in Q4 2014 to 6% in Q1.The merger has been approved by shareholders and is expected to close late in the second half of 2015. However, if drilling activity does not pick up and declines in revenue and EBITDA have not abated by Q3, investors could sour on the transaction. At some point, Halliburton's management could have a fiduciary responsibility to reconsider the merger. Indications that the deal might not close would cause Halliburton to trade closer to its fundamental value -- less than 7.7x trailing EBITDA.TakeawayThe words ""cutbacks by energy companies"" don't bode well for Halliburton. If the narrative doesn't change by Q3, Halliburton might have to reconsider its merger with Baker Hughes, which would send the stock plummeting."
3276745,31441,2015-06-23T05:33:58-04:00,"Market chatter suggests that the Halliburton/Baker Hughes merger could be stalled due to a delayed EU filing.The deal could be delayed 2-3 months.Halliburton's 8.1x trailing buyout multiple appears reasonable, but the multiple of forward earnings will be higher.Over time the market will focus on the diminution the earnings of Halliburton and Baker Hughes, and the likelihood of a deal.If market chatter is correct, investors could sour on the merger.","Last Thursday I saw a message on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) how market chatter was suggesting that the Halliburton (NYSE:HAL), Baker Hughes (BHI) merger could be stalled two to three months. The rub was that there was a delay in filling for European Union (""EU"") approval and the EU was requesting additional information. I ignored the message as mere noise. After HAL fell 1.6% on Friday to a six-week low on no new reports, I was forced to investigate.Joseph Triepke of oilpro.com alerted me that Bloomberg terminals had relayed the following market chatter from Mlex Market Insights:Halliburton/Baker Hughes had previously targeted early May as a filing date for EU approval. That filing may not come until July, or later; if other requirements, such as asset divestitures take longer than expected, the late EU filing may not impact the transaction. That said, any delay in the transaction - real or imagined - could impact HAL and BHI for the following reasons:Value Driven By Merger, SynergiesThe merger is expected to generate $2 billion in cost synergies due to overlapping fixed costs. The cost synergies alone could make the transaction accretive to HAL shareholders in 2017. Halliburton is also paying [i] 1.12x HAL share for each BHI share and [ii] $19 for each BHI share - providing a floor for BHI shareholders. A $3.5 billion break-up fee is also a strong deterrent to Halliburton reneging on the deal.BHI Has Best 1-Year Performance Amongst PeersOver the past 12 months BHI has been the best-performing stock amongst peers like Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB), HAL, FMC Technologies (NYSE:FTI), and National Oilwell Varco (NYSE:NOV):BHI is down about 12% while SLB is off about 18%. BHI has been supported by the merger price, while SLB has benefited from its strong international presence (69% of revenue is international); its revenue has declined less than peers with heavy exposure to North America where the rig count has been in free fall. NOV and HAL have been the worst-performing stocks in the peer group. Sans the merger, I believe HAL would be down even further.Baker Hughes Has Worst Operating Performance Amongst PeersBaker Hughes also had the worst Q1 2015 operating performance amongst its peers:Source: Shock ExchangeBaker Hughes experienced revenue and EBITDA declines of 31% and 83%, respectively. The next two worst performers were FMC Technologies and Halliburton who both experienced sequential EBITDA declines of 29%. Based on its one year stock performance, Baker Hughes appears to be a best-in-class oil service firm. However, judging by its operating performance, Baker Hughes appears to be broken.Markets Will Focus On Forward MultiplesHalliburton's buyout multiple of 8.1x trailing 12 months EBITDA appears reasonable.Source: Shock ExchangeHowever, given the free fall in Baker Hughes' EBITDA, the buyout multiple based on forward earnings would be a lot higher. By the end of Q3 the market will begin to focus on 2015 results. If Baker Hughes' operating performance continues to deteriorate, Halliburton may have a fiduciary responsibility to its shareholders to revisit the transaction. That would not be good for either stock. As they trade closer to their fundamental values and less on deal synergies, I would expect HAL and BHI to decline. Sans a merger, I believe BHI would free fall 60%.ConclusionThe longer the deal goes unconsummated, [i] the more the market will focus on 2015 operating performance, and [ii] the more HAL and BHI will decline. If market chatter is correct, it could jeopardize the transaction. The time table for the merger to be consummated is now Q4 2015 and counting - that's not good for HAL or BHI."

I recommend avoiding HAL and BHI.","As part of its pending merger with Baker Hughes (BHI), Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) is required by regulators to divest assets equivalent to about $7.5 billion in revenue. Industry participants like GE (NYSE:GE), National Oilwell Varco (NYSE:NOV), Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) and Dover (NYSE:DOV) are expected to show interest. According to sources, the divestitures include a drill bits unit and a unit that uses data to steer and track the direction of drills, and could fetch $5 to $7 billion. One would expect a quality oil and gas property to go for 8x - 10x EBITDA, but Schlumberger's (NYSE:SLB) sweetheart deal for Eurasia Drilling could tamp down expectations:A company is worth the present value of its future cash flows. Given the decline in oil prices since Q2 2014 and cut in capex by big oil, cash flow from oil services companies is not as robust as they were last year. Schlumberger's Eurasia deal reflects that, and could help set the market for future deals. Secondly, if competitors paid a higher multiple for Halliburton's assets than Schlumberger's Eurasia deal, they could be seen as providing mullet money.Halliburton/Baker Hughes Deal ValueThe acquisition price for Baker Hughes is [i] 1.12 HAL share of each BHI share and [ii] $19 per BHI share. In addition to Baker Hughes' net debt of $2.3 billion, the transaction equates to 8.1x Baker Hughe's last 12 months EBITDA through March 31, 2015 (""LTM15"") of $4.0 billion:Source: Shock ExchangeThe total enterprise value is $32.5 billion, 25% of which is represented by the guaranteed $19 per BHI share. The 1.12x HAL shares equates to $50 per BHI share as of June 4th. Combined with the $19 per BHI share, BHI would be valued at $69 - about 9% above its $63.64 share price.At 8.1x EBITDA, the transaction is above 7.6x median trading multiple for HAL, BHI, NOV, Schlumberger and FMC Technologies (NYSE:FTI):Source: Shock ExchangeSchlumberger, the Rolls Royce of oil services companies, has the highest trading multiple at 8.9x. The one caveat is that HAL and BHI trading multiples are buoyed by investors' bullishness over their merger, and the potential for $2B in cost synergies. Q1 EBITDA for Halliburton and Baker Hughes fell sequentially by 29% and 83%, respectively. If not for their merger, their trading multiples would be much lower in my opinion.Negative Arbitrage For Halliburton Asset Sales?There is a scenario where Halliburton's assets are sold at a multiple below the 8.1x Halliburton is acquiring Baker Hughes for - this would create a ""negative arbitrage."" Notable oil-related acquisitions in 2015 were the Schlumberger/Eurasia transaction and Noble Energy's (BATS:NOBL) acquisition of Rosetta Resources (NASDAQ:ROSE).Schlumberger/EurasiaNoble Energy/Rosetta ResourcesThese two transactions may set the benchmark for Halliburton's asset sales. They also reflect my 5x to 7x EBITDA range I feel is appropriate for oil & gas properties in this environment. At a high level, [i] divestitures of $7.5 billion in revenue, [ii] at Halliburton's Q1 EBITDA margin of 15% and [iii] 5x to 7x EBITDA multiples would fetch $5.7 to $7.8 billion.ConclusionSchlumberger's sweetheart deal for Eurasia drilling and Noble Energy's recent deal for Rosetta could set a precedent for Halliburton's asset sales. Halliburton's 8.1x EBITDA buyout multiple for Baker Hughes could increase if Baker Hughes' revenue and EBITDA continue to erode. That said, based on similar deals in the market place, Halliburton's asset sales may not fetch the buyout multiples bankers are expecting. The potential for a negative arbitrage is another impediment to Halliburton's merger with Baker Hughes. I recommend avoiding the shares of both companies."
3178496,86166,2015-05-14T09:18:15-04:00,"Halliburton's hydraulic fracturing technology enables oil companies to lower well costs, and this will help it gain more contracts since lowering costs in the current oil environment is important.
        Halliburton's acquisition of Baker Hughes will help it gain expertise in artificial lift technologies used to enhance life of mature fields, leading to more business in North America.
        Since Baker Hughes can deliver low-cost solutions in the deepwater segment, Halliburton can tap growth in this area as it is slated to grow at 8% a year till 2022.","In a previous article, I had explained that oilfield services company Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) will continue getting business in key oil producing areas such as the Middle East and Latin America due to rising rig counts. Additionally, I had also discussed that rig counts in the U.S. are approaching a bottom, and they could rise once again going forward as incomplete wells are completed on the back of an increase in oil price. Now, apart from these factors, there's another reason why I believe Halliburton will continue getting more business in a tense energy environment -- its low-cost completion methods -- which are complemented by the Baker Hughes (BHI) acquisition.Hydraulic Fracturing 101 will help Halliburton gain more contracts as it lowers well costsMore specifically, demand for Halliburton's hydraulic fracturing 101 and well stimulation technologies should help it gain more contracts going forward due to a few simple reasons as discussed below.First, hydraulic fracturing 101 allows oil and gas exploration companies to drill and complete a well within 2 to 3 days. This is much better as compared to traditional fracking technologies that use trucks for the development of oil fields, taking about 10 to 14 days for drilling and completing a well. This makes hydraulic fracturing 101 a cost-effective process, allowing oil companies to save well completion costs and reduce time to market.Now, in the current energy pricing environment where oil producers are looking to decrease costs and focus on those wells that can generate higher returns, Hydraulic Fracturing 101 is an advantage for Halliburton. For example, Apache (NASDAQ:APA) is aggressively looking to lower its well costs in the Canyon Lime area, and it believes that it can drill a well at a cost of $7 million. This is 20% lower than its earlier forecast, which is why the company is encouraged to drill wells in this area despite an uncertain oil environment.Hence, Halliburton can expect to gain business from oil producers who are focusing on new wells with lower development costs.The Baker Hughes acquisition will lead to growth in unconventionals and deepwaterOn the other hand, Halliburton also enjoys the advantage of operating in the North American unconventionals market, which presents plenty of opportunity since it has 17% of the global unconventional gas reserves, and over 70% of pressure pumping equipment. As such, it is not surprising to see that the company gets over 60% of its revenue from Unconventionals, Deep Water, and Mature Fields segment.More importantly, according to Fuel Fix, ""the U.S. unconventional business is now the lowest-cost, fastest-to-market incremental barrel of oil available in the world today."" Hence, Halliburton will find plenty of opportunity to tap this market going forward, and its pending acquisition of Baker Hughes will play a crucial role in this area.Halliburton has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Baker Hughes in a deal worth $34.6 billion. The deal is expected to be closed during the second half of the current year. In my opinion, this is a smart move by Halliburton as it will increase its market share and lead to robust cost efficiency.In fact, the combined entity will deliver more than $2 billion in annual cost synergies going forward. But, more importantly, both these companies are into diversified product categories such as pressure pumping and completions. Hence, once the integration is complete, Halliburton will be able to minimize logistics and raw material costs significantly.The following chart indicates how the Baker Hughes acquisition will benefit Halliburton:SourceMore specifically, Halliburton will benefit from Baker's expertise in artificial lift technologies. This technology is being used to enhance the production rate of older wells and extract a higher return on investment. This will help Halliburton gain more business from mature fields in the U.S. that are looking to compete against the younger oil fields of Africa and Middle East.On the other hand, Halliburton will also benefit from Baker Hughes' high pressure, high temperature solutions, deepwater infrastructure, and lowest cost per foot solutions in the deep water segment. Now, the deepwater well count is expected to grow at a steady rate of 8% a year till 2022, so lower costs in this segment will allow Halliburton to gain more contracts going forward.SourceAs seen above, the deepwater market is anticipated to see solid growth in North America, Latin America, and Africa. Hence, by acquiring Baker Hughes and increasing its market share, Halliburton will be able to tap the increasing demand for deepwater wells across the globe in the future.ConclusionConsidering the points discussed above, and in my previous article as well, it is not surprising to see that Halliburton has gained over 20% this year despite uncertainty in the oil market. Looking ahead, I believe that the company will be able to sustain its recent momentum of the back of its low-cost technologies, the Baker Hughes acquisition, and growth in its end markets. Thus, investors should continue holding on to Halliburton despite its strong gains this year."

Tethered to the oil and gas commodity markets, timing share purchases is difficult; particularly when trying to call a cycle-trough bottom.I prefer to spend more effort attempting to identify well-managed companies with strong balance sheets instead of trying to fine-tune market timing. Since the energy investment cycle often unfolds over years, not months, I play the long game.Today, I am writing you with the second installment of a series about investable Energy sector stocks. While differentiated within the Energy sector, the names all have a common thread: a sound balance sheet.In the Part I of this series, we covered best-of-breed independent E&P company EOG Resources, Inc.Up for review today is Halliburton Company (NYSE: HAL), a worldwide provider of energy services and products. The Company plans to acquire rival Baker Hughes Incorporated (NYSE: BHI) via a $34.6 billion cash-and-stock transaction. The deal should close later this year.The Balance Sheet: Cornerstone of Fundamental InvestingOver the short to medium-term, I have little insight as to the direction of energy prices, and therefore, limited ability to accurately forecast energy companies' earnings and cash flow. On the other hand, I believe it is possible, with reasonable assurance, to evaluate individual companies' balance sheets.An ability to review and analyze the balance sheet is critical to successful, long-term investing.My view of this matter as relates to cyclical stocks is summed up as follows:Path and ProcessWithin the Energy sector, there are multiple Industries. The intent of this series is to review 4 energy sector stocks, each from a different industry, focusing primarily upon the balance sheet. In addition, we will acknowledge and identify other items that investors may find important to a long-term investment thesis. The four stocks:Today we cover Halliburton.Halliburton and Baker HughesHalliburton is one of 3 primary, global oilfield services companies. Of the trio, Schlumberger is the largest, and is often cited as the best operator of the lot. Baker Hughes is #3. In November 2014, Halliburton and Baker Hughes agreed to become a combined entity. Shareholders later ratified the decision. As defined by market cap, the ""new"" Halliburton Company will still trail Schlumberger (NYSE: SLB).In short, the transaction detail states Baker-Hughes shareholders will receive $19 in cash and 1.12 shares of HAL for each BHI share owned.Balance Sheet Summary and AnalysisWe will view the balance sheet through 4 prisms:Mindful of the pending Baker Hughes deal, we will also check whether the BHI combo is likely to help or hurt the balance sheet.Below are 5-year balance sheet dashboards for Halliburton and Baker Hughes:Halliburton balance sheet trends (2010 to 2014)Baker Hughes balance sheet trends (2010 to 2014)graphics courtesy of ameritrade.comCash PositionHalliburton maintains a reasonable level of balance sheet cash balance. Currently, it totals $2.71 a share, or about 6% of a recent share price. The linked first quarter cash balance remained steady.As an adjunct, the Company showed positive free cash flow in 1Q 2015, despite a 30% decline in operating cash.Capital and expense discipline, coupled with a strong balance sheet has long been integral to Halliburton's long-term strategy.At the end of 1Q 2015, Baker Hughes held $1.6 billion in balance sheet cash. This represented about 5.8% of market cap. The figure was down somewhat versus the linked quarter.Pre-merger, the 2 companies hold ~$4 billion in cash and short-term investments; some paid to BHI shareholders to complete the transaction. As outlined in the merger agreement, Halliburton will pay ~$8.3 billion cash to Baker Hughes shareholders. Some cash-on-hand will be used to close.On balance, the Baker Hughes acquisition should not have an undue detrimental effect on the cash position of the company.LiquidityLiquidity represents a businesses' ability to meet ongoing cash requirements. There are several tools to assist in the matter: cash on hand, borrowed funds, equity offerings, credit lines, and good working capital management.Halliburton has excellent liquidity.The Company has a 2.8x current ratio. Baker Hughes has a similar 2.9x current ratio. No problems there.Both Halliburton and Baker Hughes earned ""A"" credit ratings from S&P. Access to credit markets is unlikely to be an issue. In a press release, HAL management reported ""fully committed debt financing"" will be used to fund the portion of merger transaction not paid via cash-on-hand.Post-acquisition, Halliburton shareholders will experience ~4% share dilution. Halliburton will issue 52 million additional common shares. However, management has indicated cash proceeds from expected regulator-driven asset sales may be utilized to repurchase shares.On balance, the new organization should retain excellent liquidity.DebtHalliburton has a good debt structure. Baker Hughes has an even better one.HAL maintains a 50% debt-to-equity ratio, reasonable and at mid-point versus industry peers. Total debt has remained flat since 2013; at that time, borrowed funds enabled the repurchase of 8.6% of total shares outstanding.BHI sports an even-better 23% debt-to-equity ratio. Net debt-to-equity is only 14%. Between 2012 and 1Q 2015, Baker-Hughes management has reduced long-term debt by 17%.In order to close the BHI transaction, Halliburton management is likely to use about $2 billion from cash-on-hand, and complete the payout by borrowing the balance.If so, Halliburton is should retain a total debt-to-equity ratio approximately the same as it has today.Equity BuildAt core, I believe management has 2 essential imperatives: 1) build total equity per share, and 2) provide sound returns on the capital entrusted to it. Successful execution of these items offers investors a clear line-of-sight to the creation of shareholder value.Over the past 10 years, Halliburton management has grown equity per share at a CAGR of 15.6%. A F.A.S.T. graph illustrates this point.Concurrently, Baker-Hughes management has built book value at a comparable 13.8% clip.We see that both companies' management teams have built shareholder equity sustainably, and at strong CAGRs.The second metric, return-on-invested-capital (or return-on-average-capital-employed), may be calculated using several methodologies. Using Halliburton's math, the results are nonetheless excellent versus peers or on an absolute basis. A slide from the 1Q 2015 earnings presentation captures this: In order to check Baker Hughes return on capital, I ran the numbers using the same methodology calculation as Halliburton.The result was weaker, but respectable: 2014 RoACE was 9%. While Baker-Hughes registered a lower return, the figure is approximates the cost of capital.On balance, a Halliburton / Baker Hughes combination is likely to enjoy continued equity build and above-average post-merger return-on-capital.SummaryHalliburton has an unqualified, strong balance sheet. The pending Baker Hughes acquisition is unlikely to compromise its overall strength.Notably, in order to satisfy regulators, Halliburton management has agreed to divest assets totaling up to $10 billion. This has the potential to re-arrange the balance sheet. However, I do not believe it will weaken it fundamentally. HAL management has long been driven to concentrate upon a strong balance sheet and return on capital.The Story LineIn brief, I offer additional corporate narrative for your review:After a precipitous 2014-15 drop in oil prices, oilfield service companies have faced a drop in client business, compounded by significant pricing pressure on products and services. Halliburton has been no exception. Management has responded by reducing headcount, overhead, and trimming capital; thereby maintaining positive free cash flow through 1Q 2015. In addition, Halliburton leveraged the downcycle by using its good balance sheet to engineer the acquisition of rival Baker Hughes.Senior leadership has stated its intent to uncover $2 billion in post-merger synergies and expense savings. Management teams often boast of such strong merger savings/opportunities: I believe Halliburton has the wherewithal to make good on the promises. The team has a demonstrated track record of strong execution and cost control.A combined entity will provide Halliburton a broader platform from which to develop focused, leadership strategies:Management intends to defend the North American onshore oilfield market.Comparison with SchlumbergerThis article would be incomplete without a quick-take comparison with Schlumberger, the largest energy service corporation in the world.The table below highlights a few select comparative, balance sheet and related metrics. I calculated these figures from company data and 10-K materials:Notes:Equity / Assets: advocated by Benjamin Graham, oft-cited as the godfather of fundamental value investing, E/A is a quick-check for overall balance sheet strength. A result greater than 0.50 indicates a strong balance sheet.Return-on-Equity: a measure of management effectiveness, RoE captures return upon the shareholders' investment. Typically, net profit is used in the numerator of the calculation. For purpose of this exercise, I substituted operating cash flow. Halliburton and Baker Hughes skewed recent earnings with unusually high impairment writedowns and restructuring charges; in part due to the pending merger activity. OCF was ""cleaner,"" and each of the companies listed historically generate cash flows greater than net profit.Return-on-capital-employed (RoACE): this measure was computed for using Halliburton's methodology.Asset Utilization %: I have long found this metric helpful when analyzing oilfield service companies. It measures management's ability to convert asset deployment into revenue. A higher number is better.ConclusionHalliburton has a demonstrably strong balance sheet, permitting the company to weather the current slump in energy prices. The good balance sheet has enabled the pending acquisition of Baker-Hughes. The combo is unlikely to diminish the new organization's net financial strength, and may augment it.Disclaimer: Please do your own careful due diligence before making any investment.

3300985,22148,2015-07-03T20:38:06-04:00,"Halliburton's merger with Baker Hughes continue to progress, though at a slow pace.The synergies provide a huge catalyst for Halliburton.The faltering oil production in Brazil and Iraq will shift oil drilling back to North America.Halliburton is too cheap in light of pending catalysts and an improving market heading into 2016.","The transformative Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) and Baker Hughes (BHI) transaction was announced over seven months ago. At the time, the transaction was projected to close in the 2H15, but the recent regulatory news and information from the company suggest the date is creeping towards the end of the year.The deal values Baker Hughes at roughly $66.00 (1.12 HAL shares and $19 in cash), suggesting the market expects some minor risk that the deal won't close. Anybody buying Baker Hughes today at $60.35 could see an immediate upside of around 9%. While typical for a target company to trade below the proposed price, it isn't surprising considering the drop in oil prices has hit Baker Hughes harder. Any failure to close the merger would hit the stock hard. As a result of the merger, the price has held up better this year.HAL data by YChartsThe synergies and struggles to compete with industry leader Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) suggest that Halliburton is still motivated to complete the merger for the following reasons, including a focus on domestic drilling.Don't Forget The Massive SynergiesThe company originally forecast annual synergies in the $2 billion range. At the time, Baker Hughes was on the pace for annual revenue of roughly $25 billion, placing the savings in the 8% of sales range. The plunging revenue situation in the oil services sector might impact these ratios, but also it improves the ability of the new Halliburton to cut costs in proportion to revenue.The prime reason these synergies seem extremely doable is the vast difference in operating margins between Halliburton/Baker Hughes and Schlumberger. As highlighted in previous research, Schlumberger has substantially higher margins due to its dominance in the international market, where operating margins were 23.9% in 2014. The domestic margins were nearly 19% - slightly ahead of the 18% from Halliburton and far beyond what Baker Hughes produces.The hope is the combined entity can provide a margin leadership position in North America and catch up with Schlumberger in the international markets. Note, the below chart highlights the historical differences in North America margins between Halliburton and Baker Hughes providing a substantial opportunity and quick fix. The $800 million in synergies only gets Baker Hughes up to the Halliburton level, and leaves plenty of room for improvements beyond that target.Source: Merger presentationOil Rebound By 2017One of the big negatives with Halliburton and Baker Hughes was a generally larger focus on the domestic drilling market. Schlumberger is far more focused on international markets providing some initial cushion when it appeared that Saudi Arabia's goal was to crush the domestic shale sector. Now, though, the news suggests that the struggles in Brazil and Iraq further open the door for shale drillers.According to this report, the oil market is setting up for a 2017 rebound just at the time the merger between Halliburton and Baker Hughes hits full force. The news suggests that Brazil, due in most part to the scandal at Petrobras (NYSE:PBR), will miss 2020 targets by 1.4 million bpd. The 2.8 million bpd target by 2020 falls short of the IEA forecast of 3.7 million bpd.At the same time, Iraq won't match the aggressive production increase targets after cutting back spending for oil majors. The IEA forecasted 4.6 million bpd by 2020, and Iraq itself had much higher targets. The spending cuts suggest the country will have a difficult time even raising production from current levels.While the news mostly shifts expenditures from one market to another, it should benefit Halliburton, as it likely returns spending to the domestic drillers. For 2014, Halliburton got over 50% of revenue from North America.TakeawayThe combination of the synergies from a finalized merger and a rebound in the shale drilling markets possibly in 2016 sets Halliburton up for a large rebound. The merger is slowly progressing at this point, but investors should prepare for the news flow to start picking up as the summer moves along. Halliburton is now too cheap after its recent drop to below $42."
3169446,86166,2015-05-12T13:00:48-04:00,"OPEC has continued to increase its oil production despite weakness in pricing, and the trend will continue due to improving demand, which is a positive for Halliburton.
        The decrease in the U.S. rig count is slowing down and a bottom is expected in the next two months, which will gradually increase demand for Halliburton's services.
        There are a huge number of incomplete wells in the U.S., and a sustained period of rally in crude oil prices will encourage energy companies to complete these wells.","It is surprising to see that despite a tough energy pricing environment, oil field services company Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) has been in resurgent mode this year after declining in the second half of 2014. But, Halliburton's stock price performance closely mirrors that of crude oil, so its recovery in 2015 is not out of place as crude has made a comeback of late. This is shown in the following chart:WTI Crude Oil Spot Price data by YChartsAs evident from the chart given above, Halliburton performs well as long as crude oil prices remain strong. The reason behind this relationship is simple. Higher crude oil prices encourage energy companies to employ Halliburton's services, while lower pricing leads to cuts in capital budgets, and this creates a headwind. As such, Halliburton's performance will depend on how crude oil performs going forward, and this depends on certain key macroeconomic factors.But, the good part is that Halliburton has a diversified business. The company has clients spread across North America, Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia. As a result, Halliburton looks set to benefit from OPEC's increasing production and demand in the end market. In fact, despite the recent crash in oil prices, OPEC is still increasing production.An increasing rig count in OPEC and higher production will act as a tailwindAccording to a survey by Platts, Saudi Arabia's oil production clocked over 10 million barrels per day in April. Meanwhile, OPEC's total production increased 210,000 barrels per day in April to 30.93 million barrels per day, the highest since November 2012. This is not surprising, as OPEC's rig count has increased at a solid pace in the past few months as shown below:SourceLooking ahead, it is highly likely that OPEC members will continue increasing their production as they anticipate demand to remain strong. As reported by Asharq Al-Awsat, a Middle Eastern news source:As a result, OPEC will continue raising its rig count going forward in order to pump out more oil. This is because OPEC anticipates that demand for its oil will exceed its production by the end of the year:SourceSilver linings emerging in the U.S.Hence, Halliburton will continue getting good business from OPEC countries as they try to maintain their supremacy over OECD. However, investors should not forget that Halliburton is facing weakness in the North American market. In fact, its North American revenue dropped 9% year over year in the first quarter, while operating income was down 54%. This was a result of a massive drop in rig counts in the U.S. as shown below:Source: Baker HughesNow, the U.S. crude oil inventory is currently at 487 million barrels, which is why oil producers are reducing their production. In fact, for the week ended May 1, crude oil inventories in the U.S. dropped 3.9 million barrels, way more than the consensus forecast of 1.5 million barrels. Hence, as production in the U.S. slows down and energy companies reduce their capital expenses, Halliburton will continue seeing weakness in this region.However, an increase in oil prices will help Halliburton make a comeback in this region due to the high number of incomplete wells. According to Fuel Fix:Thus, we cannot exactly predict as to when U.S. oil companies will start drilling again as the market is oversupplied. However, there are a few positives that investors should consider. For example, the WTI has made a comeback in 2015, while the drop in active rig count in the U.S. is slowing down. In fact, last week, the number of oil and gas rigs declined at a slower pace than the preceding week. Additionally, Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) will hit bottom in a couple of months, and could start picking up again based on historical data:SourceThis will act as a potential catalyst for Halliburton going forward, and could complement the growth that the company is seeing in OPEC nations.ConclusionHalliburton has turned in a market beating performance this year, and there is a possibility that it will be able to sustain this momentum on the back of the increasing rig count in the Middle East, along with an expected rebound in North America where the rig count is expected to hit bottom soon. So, despite strong gains so far this year, investors should stick to Halliburton has it can get better going forward."

In fact, the stock has appreciated almost 20% this year, which is not surprising as its financial performance has been better than expected in adverse circumstances. For instance, in the first quarter results reported in late April, Halliburton beat estimates on both top and bottom lines.In fact, Halliburton has been able to improve its revenue over the past year despite the weakness in oil pricing as shown below:Brent Crude Oil Spot Price data by YChartsAn improvement in oil pricing will spur investment in infrastructureNow, it is clear that Halliburton has done well in a tense oil pricing environment. From here, there is a chance that things will get better as crude oil consumption improves, while other macroeconomic factors will also play a role in crude's recovery. According to Marketwatch:Moreover, a record number of traders are anticipating a crude oil rebound. This is shown in the following chart:SourceThis is a positive for Halliburton since an increase in oil prices will encourage oil producers to increase their investments in infrastructure and exploration. In the past few months, several oil companies have reduced their capital spending forecast by huge margins due to weak oil pricing. As such, an increase in oil pricing will eventually create better market conditions and encourage these companies to increase investments. This will act as a tailwind for Halliburton.Halliburton's diversification is an advantageOne of the reasons why Halliburton is a good prospect is because the company's business is diversified across the world. The company is working on a number of projects. This essentially means that any sort of problem in one region of the world will not have a great impact on Halliburton's overall performance.For example, in the eastern hemisphere, Halliburton is expanding despite facing some geopolitical issues in areas such as Iraq, Libya and Russia. The company knows that once these regions settle down, it will be able to use them to its advantage by way of stronger production capacity. For instance, areas in the Caspian, West Africa, Southern Iraq and Saudi Arabia are already doing well, and the company expects to close a deal worth $1 billion for fresh work in Iraq.Hence, Halliburton's presence in conflicted areas should not be a big cause for concern in the long run. On the other hand, in Latin America, Halliburton is working on projects in different countries.In Brazil, Halliburton is progressing well with its negotiations on a retendered directional-drilling contract. In addition, Halliburton has recently signed a multi-billion dollar deal in Ecuador where it estimates solid growth as its new projects ramp up going forward. Meanwhile, in Mexico, energy reforms will open up opportunities for Halliburton in deepwater markets, mature fields and Mexico shale.A clear and smart strategy to pursue growthApart from diversification of the business, another reason why Halliburton could be a good long-term pick is because it is following a sound strategy. Looking ahead, the company is pursuing opportunities in three areas - unconventionals, deepwater and mature fields. Under its unconventional strategy, Halliburton is making the use of subsurface insight, custom chemistry and surface efficiency to drive down cost per barrel of oil equivalent.On the other hand, the deepwater strategy will enhance reliability and decrease uncertainty in the business, while the mature field's strategy is crafted to produce extra hydrocarbons in deteriorating fields by exploring fresh reserves and enhancing the recovery process of active reserves. Now, this last strategy will allow Halliburton to increase the life of the oil wells for its customers, and hence, the company can expect to gain more business.Also, Halliburton also is enhancing its service capacity by expanding infrastructure and transport potential. In fact, the company has enhanced its sand terminal capacity above 100%, and it is doubling the current rate fleet as well. For the last mile at the sand terminal, while trucking to the location from the railhead, it has added more than 30 fresh contract suppliers, allowing it to better handle higher volumes.In addition, Halliburton has established a sand logistics command center in Houston for monitoring supply levels in the basins and tracking its rail and trucking fleets in real time. These combined initiatives should help the company achieve greater efficiency.ConclusionHence, due to the reasons stated above, Halliburton looks like a good buy on the drop. Additionally, the stock is cheaper than its peers. It trades at 17.7 times last year's earnings, which is lower than its rivals.In addition, the company's cash flow is strong. It has generated $4 billion in operating cash flow over the past year, along with $1.5 billion in levered free cash flow. Thus, the company is financially sound as well. All in all, Halliburton looks like a good pick from different angles and it should be able to sustain its momentum going forward."

        Revenue from ""North America"" fell 25% sequentially as the decline in rig count has taken its toll.
        Revenue worldwide fell 20% sequentially, while EBITDA declined 42%.
        At 7.7x EBITDA the stock remains over-valued.","Eagle Ford Drilling Rig. Source: eaglefordshale.comHalliburton (NYSE:HAL) reported Q1 earnings Monday, and revenue and earnings were as bad as expected. The company reported revenue of $7.1 billion and eps of $0.49 (ex-items). Analysts were expecting revenue of $6.99 billion and eps of $0.37. The following are my takeaways on the company's results:""North America""After Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) had previously reported a 25% sequential decline in North American revenues, ""North America"" are curse words to oil services companies. Going into Q1 Halliburton generated 54% of its revenue from North America.The company's revenues from North America declined 25% sequentially, while Europe/Africa/CIS experienced the second largest decline of 18%. Worldwide, Halliburton's revenue fell an alarming 20% from $8.8 billion in Q4 to $7.1 billion in Q1. The declining rig count may be the culprit. At the week ending April 17th the North American rig count stood at 734. That's down about 60% from the three month average of 1,770 in Q3 2014. Oil companies have cut back on spending per well amid the decline in oil prices. As day rates for rigs have fallen off, so has Halliburton's revenue. There is no visibility as to when day rates will rebound.Deteriorating EBITDA MarginsHalliburton has not been able to cut costs at the same rate as revenue declines. Its declining economies of scale has hurt operating margins:ValuationDespite the decline in revenue and EBITDA, HAL actually rose about 3% to $48.14 on Thursday. With an equity value of $40.93 billion and net debt of $5.5 billion, the company has an enterprise value of $46.4 billion. That equates to 7.7x last 12 months EBITDA of $6.0 billion. Its run-rate EBITDA is about $5.1 billion or [i] Q1 2015 EBITDA of $929 million, plus [ii] Q4 2014 EBITDA of $1.6 billion annualized. That said, HAL trades at 9.2x run-rate EBITDA. Either way, the stock is outside my 5x - 7x EBITDA valuation range. Over the next few quarters I expect the company's stock price and earnings fundamentals to converge.ConclusionHalliburton's sequential decline in revenue and EBITDA of 20% and 42%, respectively, may be the tip of the iceberg. At 7.7x EBITDA, the company is over-valued."
3224596,52752,2015-06-01T07:14:59-04:00,"Despite the mild recovery of oil prices in Q1 2015, oil services companies are still facing revenue issues due to the lower oil rig count.HAL intends to outlast the competition, and in order to do so, it is acquiring Baker Hughes for scale advantage.HAL has become leaner with cost cuts but still remains committed to delivering quality products and services.HAL's advantages allowed it to seize the shrinking pie and it seems poised for better growth as economic growth gains traction.","Macroeconomic Background and Shrinking PieMy interest in the oil market came around during the oil plunge in mid-June 2014 which had a macroeconomic impact on inflation. There were doubts whether it would be wise to tighten monetary policy, but the Fed still moved ahead to end QE3 in October 2014. There was a period of disinflation in the United States. However, on a net effect, this is a good thing as the US is a net oil importing nation.The worst of the oil decline ended in January 2015 after oil prices bottomed out at $45 from a peak of $115 in June 2014. Currently, oil prices are around $65 which validate the Fed's view that the oil price decline is transitory and should be looked past in monetary decision making. Still, I was curious about how oil services companies are coping with the slow recovery from the plunge in the first quarter of 2015.First, I turned my attention to the leading oil services company which is Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL). HAL is a Texas-based company that has worldwide operations. It provides services and equipment for upstream oil rig and natural gas production facilities. Naturally, it had been badly affected by the reduction in oil rigs after oil prices plunged.Based on its earnings call of Q1 2015, HAL confirmed that global oil rig count dropped by 19% in Q1 2015 compared to Q1 2014. US oil rig count was badly affected with a 50% drop, but the fall in Asia's rig count was milder at 9%. In the face of this drop, global demand continued to increase at 1 million barrels per month. This means that the pie has shrunk for oil services companies across the world. Less oil rigs mean less work and less revenue. Period.HAL's Strategy To Deal With The DownturnBefore I go into the details of HAL's strategy, I would like to start with a summary of its strategy as glimpsed from its Q1 2015 earnings call. It would be to outlast the competition, and emerge as a leaner and keener oil services company of choice after this downturn.Size matters and economies of scale allows for more competitive advantage. A downturn is a cruel process where weaker competitors are eliminated and you will have to find ways to stay competitive. One way in which HAL is trying to stay competitive is by acquiring Baker Hughes (BHI). This acquisition, which is expected to enlarge HAL's menu of services to its clients, is expected to close by the end of 2015.There are regulatory hurdles to be cleared with the Department of Justice and other relevant authorities worldwide in terms of compliance with competition laws for the merger and divestiture of assets. This merger is expected to provide $2 billion in cost synergies and HAL is working hard to ensure that those synergies stick as quoted from Chief Integration Officer Mark McCollum:The other strategy would be to cut costs as its clients are demanding pricing concessions in response to lower energy prices. This means that HAL is forced to look at innovative manners to cut costs. One way in which HAL is doing this is by squeezing its suppliers and cutting out the weaker suppliers. This allows HAL to offer them higher volumes and allows its remaining suppliers to offer better prices. After squeezing its suppliers, HAL moved to squeezing its own employees and its assets. This resulted in a $1.2 billion restructuring charge and it wrote off its investments in Libya and Yemen.While it is common sense to cut costs in a downturn, especially one as severe as this, HAL continued to keep its eye on the quality of its service delivery. HAL chose to cut less for its acquisition of Baker. This quote from HAL President Jeff Miller underlines the company's long-term commitment despite the short-term costs involved:Lastly, HAL upgraded its oil equipment to provide better quality services to its clients. Some of the cutting edge technologies provided by HAL include Frac of the Future for drilling, CoreVault system for subsurface sample collection, and CYPHER for stimulation service. Jeff Miller described the benefits of HAL's cutting edge Frac of Future service:On this last point about upgrading its capability, it is HAL's cutting edge technology which allows it to seize clients from other competitors in this difficult operating environment.ConclusionUnless technology allows the world to reduce its dependence on oil and gas in a cost effective manner, we will continue require them in the long run. It is clear that the global economy has started on its mild recovery as seen in the relatively strong European GDP growth of 0.4% and Japanese GDP growth of 2.4% in Q1 2015. These 2 major economies emerged economically after generous dosages of QE to make credit cheaper and with sensible fiscal policies. The US is expected to grow strongly after it thawed out of its harsh winter in Q1 2015. Still, despite the harsh winter, the US grew by 0.2% in Q1 2015.While it is uncertain if upstream companies can find new oil reserves, they will require oil services companies like HAL if they are to try their luck. So as the economy recovers, oil demand would increase and bring along more demand for oil services companies. That said, the recovery would not be immediate and would take at least 9-12 months.So if I would have to place my bet, I would place it with a company that only lost 4% of revenue when the global oil rig count dropped by 19% worldwide. This showed that it has a competitive advantage to grab a bigger piece of the pie from its competitors who are also struggling. The difference is that HAL struggles less. HAL is also not complacent. It's proactively cutting costs to keep itself lean and expanding its economies of scale with the Baker Hughes acquisition. Therefore, it is likely that HAL would play a leading role in the market once the economic recovery gains further traction.HAL has a market capitalization of approximately $38 billion based on current prices. This chart shows that HAL's share price is making a steady recovery, as oil prices recover and the company grabs market share. It is the time to get some exposure while HAL is still relatively cheap at around 17 times earnings (trailing 12 months), and it is notable that the recent announcement of the Baker acquisition did not pressure HAL's price significantly in the short term."
3129246,22148,2015-05-02T15:00:59-04:00,"The volatile price of oil makes investment decisions difficult in this market suggesting that a pairs trade is beneficial.
        American Airlines Group benefits from lower oil prices while at the same time having catalysts for higher stock prices independent of oil.
        Halliburton benefits from higher oil prices along with the catalyst of major synergy benefits from the Baker Hughes merger.","When researching stocks in the current economic climate, one overriding issue continues to pop up. How to handle the volatile price swings of energy prices and specifically oil? Considering that some stocks benefit from lower oil prices and some need oil to rebound, the thought popped up that maybe the best move is to hedge a portfolio with stocks that balance each other out with the impact of oil.The issue really came to the forefront when researching investments in airlines and oilfield service stocks. More specifically, both American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL) and Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) have compelling catalysts for higher stock prices. The one catch with both is that a wild swing in oil prices could easily offset the bullish thesis.The best part is that both stocks have catalysts to propel the stocks higher if oil wasn't an issue.Natural HedgeThe fact that airlines benefit from lower oil prices having jet fuel as previously the largest cost and oilfield services rely heavily on drilling for oil makes the sectors naturally trade in opposite directions when oil moves. In the last year, American Airlines jumped and Halliburton collapsed on the plunge in oil prices starting in October.AAL data by YChartsThe story becomes even more compelling due to mergers that provide a natural catalyst for each stock. Both companies are involved in various stages of a merger that makes the related company the largest in the sector without the largest market cap.American Airlines Group is the combination of U.S. Airways and American Airlines that finalized December 2013 and is currently in the process of integration, including a very important reservation system. Halliburton is in the process of merging with Baker Hughes (BHI) that is expected to complete in the 2H of this year.These combinations provide for unique stock catalysts, but clearly from the chart above the better performing stock is likely a function of the price movement in oil.American AirlinesIn the case of American Airlines, the airline has the largest revenue base though it slightly trails Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) in terms of market value. American trails Delta by a vast amount when comparing PE ratios providing plenty upside for the airline.AAL PE Ratio (Forward 1y) data by YChartsIn addition and maybe most importantly, the stocks aren't fully valued based on the surging EPS estimates due to the lower fuel cost. American Airlines has seen the EPS estimate for 2015 soar to over $10 after only earning less than $4 last year. As previously highlighted, the stocks have plenty of upside to trade in a similar valuation of other industrial stocks.HalliburtonIn the case of Halliburton, the oilfield services stock has seen the stock collapse in the last year due to plunging oil prices. The intriguing case to this story is that the combination with Baker Hughes will create a duopoly in the industry with Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB).As highlighted in previous research, the new Halliburton will have a revenue base of roughly equivalent to Schlumberger after asset sales. The difference between the two is the vast valuation of Schlumberger that is nearly double that of the combined Halliburton. So prior to asset sales, Schlumberger has an enterprise value of $126.3 billion, compared to only $79.5 billion for the combined Halliburton and Baker Hughes. Remember though, the new entity is larger by some $7 billion in annual revenue. Depending on asset sales, the revenue base will end up nearly even with the enterprise value declining by some $10 billion to roughly $70 billion.HAL Enterprise Value data by YChartsThe main valuation difference are the larger margins obtained by Schlumberger that the new entity will hope to approach after $2 billion in synergies.TakeawayThe typical pairs trade involves marrying a long position with a short position. In this case, the idea is to remove the risk of a commodity from the investment position. With both American Airlines and Halliburton, catalysts exist for stock gains if the price of oil remains stable at the current levels. In fact, the goal is that the stock facing oil prices heading in the wrong direction is able to maintain a flat stock price. The real benefit comes with the stock that sees healthy gains from both the catalyst for higher stock prices playing out along with the benefit of favorable oil price moves."
3095346,48411,2015-04-23T12:43:07-04:00,"HAL reported Q1 numbers that were much better than I had modeled and from the sound of the conference call much better than The Street had modeled.
        I believe HAL to just be getting started as the name is packed with catalysts across all durations.
        Don't underestimate HAL's ability to be defensive in an extended downturn either - the big names in this space are better positioned to survive.
        I believe analyst upgrades should power HAL shares higher on the quarters reported and eventually create micro catalysts for between quarter momentum.
        Consider a HAL long position via common or long-dated CALL options.","Prepare for the worst, Hope for the best…Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) had a great quarter and conference call to follow. I wish CEO Dave Lesar could have been on the call after bravely facing the analyst community and being more than up front with just how severe the decrementals could have been at the company the last 90 days. Lesar never once tried to sugarcoat anything and never once didn't directly answer a question - a pretty rare instance of management facing the music in the bad times just as well as they face it in the good times. Again, I just wish he could have led the rally call after reporting a quarter that showed HAL might be much better off than modeling had shown.Sure, HAL reported some pretty brutal numbers. No doubt about it. But HAL also showed some positive internals to the numbers (highlighted in bold) that again indicate that HAL might be more resilient than even it knew. HAL's quarter broke out as follows (this is the abbreviated version for those who didn't read the release - SOURCE: HAL Q4 PR):That's going to be the subject of this article, the what I believe are soon to come positive revisions to HAL modeling and expectations and how that should create incremental catalysts for HAL quarter after quarter at quarterly reporting assuming HAL can continue to execute into its end-of-the-world survival strategy. Seeing how management and the company just performed into what should be the worst quarter of the current down cycle I have a good level of confidence that they can do this. That said, let's get to it.Catalysts for upside…HAL is currently modeled to see incremental and sequential improvements to revenues, EBTIDA and EPS for the current full year, FY16, and FY17. This happened just recently, the positive revisions, and should be expanded out here in about a week or so once the harem of analysts covering HAL have had a chance to promote the revisions to their books. That said, the fact that HAL is modeled for improvements isn't the groundbreaking news or the catalyst. I don't think that anybody is under the impression that this down cycle will stick and hold for multiple years (although I have it modeled in until mid-2016). What I think Seeking Alpha readers can get long (potentially using long-dated CALL options) is upward revisions to individual year estimates. I should be more specific.You see when analysts decide to start marking up estimates years in advance, past incumbent estimates, this skews forward looking valuation multiples. This in turn skews what HAL, in this case, is valued at by longer term buyers. This can create a constant chasing, higher pricing momentum that allows HAL to front run good news rather than lag the good news. Simply put, HAL shares will move higher on the same news than prior as the pricing of the stock will always be chasing the next upward revision. You'd be shocked at how often this takes place and how reliable the phenomenon is.Now, what catalysts are going to drive HAL's operational performance to be deserving of this ""trust me"" mentality from analysts? For starters, I believe each stage of the Baker Hughes (BHI) transaction that HAL can complete it should have its share price move higher. The sooner HAL gets to integration the sooner it can get an estimated 300 bps of higher overhead and infrastructure expenses out from its model that it's holding strictly because it's in BHI limbo - not knowing what it's going to need to divest, not knowing to what degree, etc. There's also the billions in synergies that HAL should be able to realize. You can imagine that this all adds up.HAL can also benefit and bring upside surprise by showing to have any of its prop efficiency technologies gain more traction than The Street is expecting. I also think along these same lines that HAL might be in the market currently, this was semi-alluded to on the Q4 CC, to add small roll-up technologies to its platform in general. If you follow the servicer space there's some really interesting new ones that have been popping up. In an effort to not be irresponsible with M&A speculation in regard to any of the names associated I won't get specific (Google ""Rapid-B Oil and Gas"" for an example of one). If HAL can find it an opportunistic time to fill out its total efficiency technology umbrella that's another way the company can be accretive (on this particular level) in an otherwise down time.HAL could also see some upticks to domestic activity via refracs. HAL, and I'm basing this strictly on asking around my network, is one of the leaders in the ""refrac movement"" of the future (along with the other big Major servicer) and has been positioning itself to grow into this segment for the last few years. If that's a direction that the domestic E&P space needs to go (say a few quarters from now) because economics are demanding it (refracs require much less spend to execute than a new drill to completion) HAL stands to be a huge market share aggregator.The Analyst Catalyst...So with those in mind as a few catalysts across near, midterm, and long term durations take a look at how all the estimate numbers have just recently broken negative slope lines (per individual years) and turned up:For clarity, the Y/Y/Y slope lines of estimates have been positive although the FY16 and FY17 estimates have contracted quite a bit to FY15 numbers. Again what I'm referencing are the individual year estimates tracking higher which you can see just barely happening across the board. Money is made on the margins of change folks and sometimes that means buying a trend before it happens.When this trend is finally well-established it's my belief that higher price targets and more bullish recommendations will follow:You can imagine that with pretty bullish targets already set and with consensus being a HAL BUY with anything of an upside surprise the harem would get outright frothy. You're going to want to own HAL at that point.Where's the trade?...I think with a situation like the one HAL is in there's two options. The first is you just buy the common and you hold it forever. HAL pays an OK dividend and is looking into looking into some buybacks in the near-term. That's great for pulling EPS forward and that's great for pulling future pricing (read: higher pricing) forward. So that's not the worst way to live.The other less capital intense option that offers a multiple to being long the common from a return standpoint is of course to own the long-dated CALLs. With Seeking Alpha not being a ""trading"" platform I'll direct readers to the video review of HAL at CapGainr.com for information on which options I think have good value. Still, owning the options is just another directional bet in the same way that owning the common is - only with the options you stand to lose all your money. So be careful when considering this route.I like HAL and I like it even more after Q1 reporting. I think readers should consider adding some exposure via one vehicle or the other.Good luck everybody."

        The fact that HAL was able to achieve revenue growth compared to two years ago and maintain being profitable even after the free fall in oil prices is quite impressive.
        Halliburton has good valuation metrics and strong earnings growth prospects; its enterprise value-to-EBITDA ratio is very low at 6.82.","In my previous article about Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) from February 11, I demonstrated that Halliburton's trailing twelve months EPS growth has been the highest among all major Oilfield Equipment & Services companies. However, after delivering EPS from continuing operation of $0.49 for the first quarter of 2015, HAL lost its leading position. However, it still posted a 15.6% ttm EPS growth.On April 20, Halliburton reported its first-quarter 2014 financial results, which beat EPS expectations by $0.12 (32.4%) and beat The Street's consensus on revenues. Halliburton has shown earnings per share surprise in five of the last six quarters, as shown in the table below.Data: Yahoo FinanceIn the report, Dave Lesar, chairman and chief executive officer, said:The decline in revenue for the quarter compared to a year ago was minimal considering the decrease in production activity due the crash in oil prices.

Average WTI crude price for the latest quarter of $51.53 per barrel was 42.4% lower than the average price of $89.39 per barrel for the first quarter of 2013. However, revenue for the latest quarter increased 1.1% over that of Q1'13, and earnings per share declined 26.9%, much less than the drop in oil price, as shown in the charts below.Data: Company reportsThe fact that HAL was able to achieve revenue growth compared to two years ago and maintain being profitable even after the free fall in oil prices is quite impressive.Oil PricesLast WTI crude oil price of $57.15 per barrel, is up 25.2% from its ten years low of $45.63 per barrel from March 18. However, WTI crude price has not crossed above its trading range upper limit of $58 per barrel.WTI crude oil June 2015 leading contractCharts: TradeStation Group, Inc.Brent crude price of $65.28 per barrel is up 30.1% from its six years low of $50.18 per barrel from January 13. Brent crude price also seems to have crossed above its trading range upper limit of $64 per barrel.Brent crude oil June 2015 leading contractCharts: TradeStation Group, Inc.Although the price of oil has not proved yet a definite exit from its trading range, I believe that it would not fall back to its low of mid-March, due to increasing demand. The current oil prices are about 11% higher than the average price of the first quarter. Hence, in my opinion, the sharp decline in the global rig count, and the decrease in demand for HAL's services should stop.Major developmentsDue to the severe fall in activity, particularly in North America, Halliburton has been taking steps to reduce costs. Halliburton has now cut over the past two-quarters a total of 9,000 workers, or more than 10% of its global workforce as the crash in oil prices forced drillers to cut back. Halliburton expects to cut capital spending by 15% this year to $2.8 billion.In advance of the pending Baker Hughes (BHI) acquisition, HAL has made the decision to preserve its global delivery infrastructure through the downturn, which is having a negative impact on its operating margins but will allow it to realize cost synergies after the close. According to the company, it continues to look beyond the cycle and invest in capital and strategic programs to maintain the health of the franchise and to emerge even stronger when the industry recovers.According to Bloomberg, Halliburton and Baker Hughes are planning to sell overlapping business lines to win approval from the U.S. Justice Department for the purchase. Revenue associated with the businesses Halliburton has so far announced for sale generated about $3.5 billion in revenue last year. More assets are expected to be sold to win antitrust approval, although it's not yet known which ones would be divested.ValuationHAL's stock is up 22% year-to-date while the S&P 500 Index is up 2.9%, and the NASDAQ Composite Index has risen 7.5%. However, in 2014, HAL's stock had lost 22.5% compared to a gain of 11.4% for the S&P 500 Index and an increase of 13.4% for the NASDAQ Composite Index in the same period.Chart: TradeStation Group, Inc.HAL's valuation metrics are good, the trailing P/E is low at 11.69, and the price to sales ratio is at 1.26. Moreover, its Enterprise Value/EBITDA ratio is very low at 6.82. According to Portfolio123, its PEG ratio using trailing EPS and current year estimates is very low at 0.86. However, its long-term PEG ratio is at 1.53.Halliburton has been paying uninterrupted dividends since 1972, In December 2014, the company raised its quarterly dividend by 20% to $0.18 per share, or $0.72 annually. The forward annual dividend yield is at 1.50% and the payout ratio is only 15.3%. The annual rate of dividend growth over the past three years was very high at 20.5%, over the past five years was high at 11.8%, and over the past ten years was at 9.7%.SummaryHalliburton delivered first-quarter results that were better than analysts' expectations, and it has been taking steps to reduce costs. The company expects to cut capital spending by 15% this year to $2.8 billion. Halliburton believes that the long-term prospects of the industry remain sound, and it is excited about the pending Baker Hughes transaction, which, according to HAL, will significantly enhance the growth potential of its organization. In my opinion, the fact that HAL was able to achieve revenue growth compared to two years ago and maintain being profitable even after the free fall in oil prices is quite impressive. Halliburton has good valuation metrics and strong earnings growth prospects; its enterprise value-to-EBITDA ratio is very low at 6.82. In addition, Halliburton is generating strong cash flows, and it returns value to its shareholders by stock buyback and increasing dividend payments. In my opinion, HAL's stock is an excellent long-term investment due to its strong growth prospects, and the impressive results it has obtained in this down cycle."
3091776,67775,2015-04-22T16:12:07-04:00,"US rig count -50% since Nov 2014 peak, an unprecedented decline causing severe pricing pressure.Operating income swing from $1.3 billion in Q1-14 to -$548m in Q1 2015.HAL’s flexible cost structure helps mitigate margin attrition.Baker Hughes acquisition synergies and divestments provide sentiment upside.","Halliburton's (NYSE:HAL) Q1-15 results were better than I expected given the extreme circumstances prevailing in the oil services industry. Revenues and operating income declined 4% and 28%, respectively, despite the US rig count being down 50% from November's peak and still falling, plus the global rig count down some 19%. Likely synergies from the Baker Hughes acquisition, plus possible disposal proceeds from divestitures, are positive sentiment drivers, but the waters remain muddy.Q1-15 results, HAL's high North American exposure impacts resultsHalliburton's high business exposure in North America (66% of revenues in Q1-14, dropping to 50% of revenues in Q1-15) was always going to weigh heavily on the results given the sharp declines in activity in this region. The US rig count is down 50% since the peak in Nov 2014 representing an unprecedented decline, albeit HAL's management team stated on the Q1 conference call that the pace of decline has slowed but investors should expect a further rig count decline of around 30% in Q2. Accompanied by pricing pressure, HAL's North American revenues declined by 9% Y/Y, but operating income declined by a much sharper 54% in the region. Some of HAL's International regions fared better, as the table below highlights;On the face of it, the declines don't look too bad, but when one factors in the other costs, such as the $1.208 billion impairment charge and a further $39m related to the Baker Hughes acquisition, operating income in the quarter amounted to a loss of $548m, which is a startling decline from the $1.3bn operating income profit in Q1-14.North American Q2 guidance robust given the circumstancesHAL's management team guided the stock lower, announcing projected operating declines in Q2, with the expectation of a 30% rig count decline in North America. That said, HAL is rapidly cutting costs with head count already down by 10% and a total capex reduction of about 15% scheduled for the full year. Notably, HAL manufactures its own equipment which gives it greater flexibility than some of its peers to quickly cut back on capital spending. Overall, HAL's guidance for its North American Q2 operating margin remains ""mid single digit"" which is quite impressive if it proves to be true.Baker Hughes acquisition has come at the right timeAssuming all goes to plan, HAL's acquisition of Baker Hughes International (BHI) will be complete in late 2015. HAL's CFO Christian Garcia stated that annual pre-tax synergies of at least $2 billion are expected and HAL will sell its Drill Bits and Drilling division as part of required divestments. This division derived revenues of $3.5 billion in 2014, but this is likely to be a lower number for 2015. Despite that, HAL expects high demand from both industry and financial buyers, so sale proceeds could easy reach around the $3 billion mark.Valuation and recommendation, a difficult callHaving recovered by about 25% during 2015, HAL's share price is now probably factoring in the worst of the commodity downturn and some of the potential BHI acquisition upside. With little full-year visibility on earnings and cash flow, however, plus the sharp share price upward adjustment recently, I'm inclined to wait for a better entry point again, which may present itself in the coming months."
3085266,23164,2015-04-22T08:48:42-04:00,"According to Halliburton's estimates, the oil and gas services industry is likely to bottom out by June 2015.Oil production in the U.S. is likely to decline in the coming months as companies leave wells incomplete to wait for higher oil prices.In general, stocks bottom out prior to the industry bottoming out, and I believe investors can start accumulating oil services and oil and gas stocks with quality credit profiles.","Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) reported its Q1 2015 earnings on April 20, 2015, and a brief results analysis is already available on Seeking Alpha. In this article, I will focus on the company's view of the industry. It makes sense to derive inputs from Halliburton as the company has global operations and can provide the best insights on the near-term direction of the oil and gas services industry.The first important point from the conference call is that Halliburton's management does not believe the bottom is in place for the industry. According to the company:There are several points to note:The next important point that I want to discuss is the outlook for oil production in the coming months in the U.S. The rig count has declined, but production continues to grow. However, this is bound to change in the coming months, considering the following point from Halliburton:Again, there are two points worth noting here:Considering these two points on the outlook for oil and gas services companies and the outlook for production, I believe that an ideal investment strategy would be as follows:1. Gradually invest in oil services companies with low leverage, such as Helmerich & Payne (NYSE:HP). I recently upgraded my view on the stock.2. Gradually invest in oil and gas companies with low leverage as these companies have the flexibility to lower production until oil prices recover. In the recent past, I discussed two stocks with a strong credit profile: Range Resources (NYSE:RRC) and Canadian Natural Resources (NYSE:CNQ). Investors can consider these names for gradual exposure.In conclusion, the key industry comments from Halliburton suggest more pain for oil and gas services companies in the coming months. However, the industry is close to the bottom, and the recovery will depend largely on the how soon oil prices trend higher and are sustained at higher levels."
3086606,22148,2015-04-22T13:32:26-04:00,Halliburton reported Q1'15 earnings that easily surpassed analyst estimates.The oilfield services company saw growth over the prior Q1 in several international regions.The stock continues to offer attractive value compared to the industry giant.,"While Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) may face an unprecedented decline in drilling, the solid results speak to strong execution during Q1. The second largest oilfield services firm easily beat analyst estimates with a surprise upside in several international regions.With the stock closer to a game changing merger with Baker Hughes (BHI) (see Halliburton: One Step Closer), investors need to think twice before discarding it on the recent rebound. Halliburton is up sharply from the lows around $37, but the stock remains far below the highs of nearly $75.After industry leader and specifically international-focused Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) reported 8% YoY declines in those geographic regions (see Schlumberger: Still Raking In Profits), the expectation was that domestic-focused Halliburton would follow. While clearly international results were down sequentially, an interesting point is the comparison to the prior Q1 results that occurred before the growth wave during the 2014 summer. In this case, Halliburton produced revenue and operating income growth in both Latin America and Middle East/Asia. Total revenue declined 4%, but nowhere near the large collapse in drilling rigs or the decline of Schlumberger.Source: Halliburton Q1'15 earnings releaseThe big difference between Schlumberger and Halliburton is the larger operating margins that Halliburton expects to narrow the gap with the Baker Hughes merger. Halliburton only achieved Q1 operating margins of around 10% whereas Schlumberger produced closer to 18% margins. In total, Schlumberger had adjusted operating income of $1.8 billion compared to only $699 million for Halliburton. The differences in margins do question whether Halliburton is willing to accept lower margin contracts in this weak market environment.The theory still remains that Halliburton will use the merger to close the valuation gap between itself and Schlumberger with estimates that synergies will reach $2 billion. Currently, every dollar generated by Schlumberger is worth nearly double that of Halliburton and Baker Hughes.HAL PS Ratio (Forward) data by YChartsThe key takeaway is that Halliburton is starting to show better operations at the same time it expects to benefit from the large cost synergies with the Baker Hughes deal (assuming government approval). Even with the recent bounce to $48, the combined Halliburton and Baker Hughes is worth roughly half of Schlumberger that will have equivalent revenue levels.Halliburton remains a good way to play a rebound in the oilfield services market. With analyst estimates for 2015 and 2016 still declining, investors shouldn't expect a further rally during the summer. The company needs to get through the merger with Baker Hughes and the related asset sales before it can eventually close those valuation gaps with Schlumberger. For now, investors should wait for dips in the stock price before adding to or building a position, as it will take time for the benefits to show up in the financials."
3079796,31441,2015-04-19T01:39:19-04:00,"Halliburton reports Q1 earnings on Monday.Schlumberger reported a sequential decline in Q1 2015 revenue of 25% in North America and 19% worldwide.Halliburton gets about 54% of revenue from North America (vs. 31% for Schlumberger), and I would expect similar revenue contraction.The words ""North America"" and an untenable forward EBITDA multiple will sink Halliburton on Monday.","Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) announces Q1 earnings on Monday. Analysts are expecting revenue of $6.99 billion and EPS of $0.37. The revenue estimate is off 20% versus the $8.8 billion revenue the company recorded in Q4 2014. Below are the company's historical financial results:The following are the key items investors should focus on:""North America""After Schlumberger's (NYSE:SLB) earnings report which showed a decline in North American revenue of 25% sequentially and 13% Y/Y, ""North America"" are curse words for oil services companies. Where Schlumberger gets about 31% of its revenue from North America, Halliburton gets 54%:Schlumberger's total revenue declined 19% sequentially and 9% Y/Y. If Halliburton's North American revenue free falls like Schlumberger's, its sequential decline in total revenue could exceed the 20% decline analysts expect. That said, I expect the words ""North America"" to be Halliburton's undoing on Monday.GuidanceHalliburton's proposed merger with Baker Hughes (BHI) has been the talk of the oil services industry. To appease anti-trust officials, Halliburton agreed to sell businesses representing up to $7.5 billion in revenue. The terms of the deal called for Halliburton to pay Baker Hughes [i] 1.12 of its shares and [ii] $19 in cash for each BHI share. Management has been careful when discussing the transaction and its impact on 2015 results. I would expect guidance to be based on the portfolio of companies current under Halliburton's umbrella.Schlumberger guided that 2015 E&P in North America and internationally would be down 30% and 15%, respectively. A corresponding reduction in capex spend would also negatively impact Halliburton's revenue and earnings. As big oil battens down the hatches amid the decline in oil prices, a 20% Y/Y decline in Halliburton's 2015 full-year revenue could be optimistic. As the company also loses the benefit of scale, I would expect management to guide that operating income and earnings will decline more than revenue.ValuationAfter adjusting for corporate costs related to the Baker Hughes acquisition ($17 million) and muting the impact of a $195 million insurance recovery, Halliburton had 2014 normalized EBITDA of $6.7 billion. Taking into account its [i] equity value of $39.8 billion and [ii] net debt of $5.5 billion, Halliburton trades at 6.8x EBITDA into earnings. This is the top of the range of the 5x-7x I would expect the company to be valued at. As EBITDA is expected to decline, Halliburton's forward EBITDA multiple is probably a lot higher.ConclusionGiven Halliburton's outsized exposure to North America and a forward EBITDA multiple outside my 5x-7x range, investors should avoid the stock."

For earlier installments, please see AT&T (NYSE:T) and Staples (NASDAQ:SPLS).During gold rushes, some prospectors strike it rich while many more go bust. But when the rush is through, as a group they rarely leave richer than they started on average. But the people who sell the shovels almost always thrive, whether or not the shovel strikes gold.The same holds true for petroleum exploration and production. It is a business of booms and busts (currently busting at the moment). But the oil services companies will be fine. Their costs are highly variable. There have been massive layoffs and deep cost cuts. As needed, they will cut deeper.Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) is one of the biggest, best oilfield services companies. It is in the middle of a definitive deal to acquire Baker Hughes (BHI). You can get exposure to HAL on sale by buying BHI instead.Deal TermsHAL and BHI announced a definitive agreement under which stockholders of BHI will receive, for each BHI share, a fixed exchange ratio of 1.12 HAL shares plus $19.00 in cash. The deal will probably close around October 1, 2015. The current spread of $4.19 represents an annualized net return of around 13%.Deal FinancingThe deal is not conditioned upon financing. BofA Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC), as lead arranger, and Credit Suisse (NYSE:CS) are providing fully committed debt financing in support of the cash portion of the consideration. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) advised BHI.Deal ConditionsThe deal is subject to approvals from each company's stockholders, regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. On March 27, 2015, both HAL and BHI holders approved the deal.HAL's and BHI' advisors reviewed the steps necessary to secure regulatory approval, and HAL and BHI are committed to consummating this deal. HAL agreed to divest businesses that generate up to $7.5 billion in revenues, if required by regulators, although HAL believes that the divestitures required will be significantly less. The contemplated divestiture package is probably both necessary and sufficient to secure antitrust approval. Halliburton agreed to pay a reverse breakup fee of $3.5 billion if the transaction breaks due to a failure to obtain antitrust approvals.The deal received a second request for additional information from the US DoJ on February 9, 2015. In addition to DoJ clearance, the deal needs approvals from the EU, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, India, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Russia and Saudi Arabia. HAL's regulatory strategy at the EU has been to engage in thorough pre-notification talks. This is a wise way to expedite ultimate approval.In the US, the antitrust process is going well. Upstream oil and gas producers do not appear to be complaining that this deal will result in pricing power. In part, the large scale of many of the exploration and production companies protects their negotiating position. Also, the weakness in the oil price has softened oil service demand enough that HAL and BHI are flexible. These markets operate on a bidding model and they will almost always have bids from Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) in addition to the merged company. With a $3.5 billion breakup fee at stake if the regulators block this deal, it is hard to blame HAL for their sincere and effective efforts to date.The divestiture process will not be that onerous for HAL. There is active interest in the divestiture package from firms including General Electric (NYSE:GE), Dover (NYSE:DOV), National Oilwell Varco (NYSE:NOV), and Superior Energy (SPN). HAL has books out on $10 billion of divestitures. HAL is going well above the minimum merger agreement's efforts duties in terms of the divestiture efforts. Not only does HAL probably solve the antitrust problems, but it is clear that HAL wants to solve those problems and their efforts are supererogatory.Deal PriceThe deal price is exactly in the middle of comparable transactions.To justify the premium that they are paying, HAL estimates $1 billion of fixed cost savings per year.While $1 billion was their initial estimate, it is reasonable to expect HAL to be able to cut closer to $2 billion.Event Driven Investing with Equity OptionsOne security to consider is the October 16, 2015 BHI $72.50 call option. It last traded at $2.20, with a bid of $1.65 and an ask of $3.15. For every 1,000 shares of BHI that you own, you can also write 10 of these contracts to capture premium and to pre-plan an exit around the deal closing date and around the current deal's value.If you are able and willing to write nominally uncovered calls in HAL, another alternative would be to write October 16, 2015 HAL $48 call options. These last traded at $3.55 with a bid of $3.50 and an ask of $3.60. As an alternative to writing BHI puts, you could write 11 of these HAL contracts for every 1,000 BHI that you own.Shareholder SupportI own $7 million of BHI and enthusiastically support the company, its management, and their plans. Fellow owners appear to largely agree. ValueAct's Jeff Ubben is a large HAL and BHI holder who supports the deal:How much does Ubben think Halliburton can save? They started at $1 billion, I expected at least $2, but Ubben estimates $3 billion.CaveatThis investment idea is typical of hedge fund investing, but may not be suitable for all types of investors. If this is not something that you are monitoring professionally, here are some additional thoughts on sizing, risk, and actively managed ideas within the context of a broader secure financial strategy.ConclusionMy favorite way to get safe and cheap exposure to an oil recovery is via oil service companies. My favorite oil service company to own is HAL. My favorite way to own it is via BHI. Net of the cash consideration that will probably be paid out around October of this year when the deal closes, the HAL shares that BHI holders receive will be on a sale of about 8%."
3083096,53422,2015-04-20T14:54:53-04:00,"Halliburton presented first quarter results today, which were defined by lower year-over-year revenues and a net loss of $643 million.Asset impairments and currency devaluation losses hurt the oilfield services company in the first quarter.U.S. rig counts fell further in the week ending on April 17, 2015, which adds to concerns about the state of the oilfield services market.I discuss whether an investment in oilfield service companies makes sense right now.","Oilfield services company Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) has released much awaited first quarter results earlier today, and they weren't pretty. Halliburton reported a $643 million net loss, or $0.76 per share, for the most recent quarter as a result of the slowdown in drilling activity. The first quarter was also defined by asset impairments and currency devaluation losses that speak a clear language: In the short-term, investors need to be prepared for some ugly results as the adjustment process in the drilling industry is in full swing right now.In terms of revenues, Halliburton billed customers $7.05 billion for its services in the first quarter, which compares against $7.35 billion a year ago; that's a decrease of 4.1% year-over-year. The Street expected revenues of $6.96 billion.Halliburton's first quarter earnings took a dive, partly because of lower revenues, but also because the company reported impairments and other related charges of $1.21 billion due to the oil market slowdown and negative currency impacts. In the year ago quarter, none of those charges affected Halliburton's earnings.In 1Q 2015, Halliburton reported a net loss of $643 million, or $0.76 per share, which compares against a net income of $622 million, or $0.73 per share, last year.A series of adverse developments hurt Halliburton in the first quarter. Specifically, the company booked a total of $1.21 billion in impairment and related charges, of which $823 million were asset impairment charges, net of tax, and $199 million, net of tax, was a devaluation loss related to the Venezuelan currency. Further, Baker Hughes acquisition-related costs in the amount of $35 million, again net of tax, also took a toll on Halliburton's earnings. After accounting for such one-time expenses, Halliburton reported an adjusted income from continuing operations of $418 million, or $0.49 per share. This compares against a reported continuing EPS of $(0.75). Analysts expected Halliburton to report adjusted earnings per share of $0.36.Falling U.S. rig counts suggest adjustment process in the oil market hasn't come to an end yet, but we might be near itWhen will rig counts stop falling? That's the million dollar question every investor would like to get answered so that they can place their bets on the table.Right now, rig counts are still falling, and at a fairly high rate. According to Baker Hughes weekly rig count information, the United States lost 26 oil rigs last week and now has 734 rigs in operation; that's a 3.4% week-over-week decline and, more frighteningly, a 51.4% year-over-year decline.Source: Baker HughesObviously, the downturn in the oilfield services market is in full swing right now as upstream companies cut back on capital expenditures in response to the lower oil price, which begs the question how many more quarters of poor results will investors have to expect.Like I said above, year-over-year, the number of U.S. oil rigs has already contracted substantially, and I would conclude that the correction is in its mature phase. Can rigs fall further and hurt companies like Halliburton in the second or third quarter? Absolutely. But U.S. rigs aren't going to continue to fall at the rate we have seen in the last week for an extended period of time. As soon as the pace of rigs coming off market slows, an anti-cyclical investment in Halliburton could make a lot of sense.Share performanceHalliburton's share price appears to have bottomed out in December. Shares tested the bottom again in January when the bottom, displayed in the chart below, was confirmed. Since the beginning of the year, Halliburton has returned 22%.Source: Yahoo FinanceIt is fairly unpopular now to go long drilling companies, which is also why an investment in the beaten-down oilfield services market could potentially be very lucrative. Personally, I am overweighting energy companies right now and try to ride the recovery in the oilfield services business with my investment in Chesapeake Energy's (CHK) spin-off Seventy Seven Energy (NYSEMKT:SSE). My investment thesis with respect to Seventy Seven Energy can be read here. The rational is pretty much the same.Your TakeawayFalling U.S. rig counts and more than a billion dollars in asset impairments/devaluation losses don't make Halliburton a screaming buy, on first glance. But when taking into account how much the total U.S. rig count has already fallen year-over-year, and that Halliburton's shares have bottomed out in December of last year, there is a good opportunity here for an anti-cyclical investment.As far as I am concerned, investors have seen the bottom in oil prices in January 2015. Companies like Halliburton or Seventy Seven Energy are now adjusting to reduced capex budgets of upstream companies, which is naturally a lagged response. As soon as the fortune in the oil market turns, Halliburton and Seventy Seven Energy could rally hard and fast."
3062046,72215,2015-04-10T10:59:27-04:00,"Halliburton has announced its divestment from Fixed Cutter and Roller Cone Drill Bits, Directional Drilling and Logging-While-Drilling/Measurement-While-Drilling business units.The long-term gains of the sell-off could translate into cost savings of $2 billion annually, and accretion to earnings per share of about 15%-20% by 2017.The drill bits and MWD and LWD units could bring in approximately $6.5 billion all together. Therefore, I anticipate more divestures to be announced during the next few months.Quarterly earnings for Halliburton have been forecast at a high of $0.98 and a low of $0.27, with a consensus EPS forecast of $0.59 per share.I anticipate stock prices to head north of where they are now, breaching the $60 mark, making it a good investment for the next 2-5 years.","Shareholder approval for the Halliburton's (NYSE:HAL) merger with Baker Hughes (BHI) has been the much talked about news of the week. With the deal now in the pipeline for receiving regulatory approval, Halliburton seems to be working on soothing regulators concerns about how much power the new merged entity will yield afterward. To this end, the latest news is regarding Halliburton's decision to divest from three drilling business units that it currently owns. The oilfield service company announced its divestment from Fixed Cutter and Roller Cone Drill Bits, Directional Drilling and Logging-While-Drilling (LWD)/Measurement-While-Drilling (MWD) business units. The divestment is expected to be completed on acceptable terms by the second half of the year. The latest divesture is part of the company's target of divesting from a total of $10 billion worth of assets in order to seek regulatory approval for the mega-merger.I believe that the move to sell off assets is indeed a much required one, for a potentially lucrative deal to fall into place. As most of us are already aware, Halliburton is interested in selling off overlapping businesses, which means that post-merger we can see the company holding a set of business units that it will be able to efficiently manage and run once the merged entity is in the operational phase. Moreover, the CEO, Dave Lesar, commented on how retention of these assets would be preferred, but the current scenario required the divestment to be made for the merger to fall into place.From what I understand, Lesar is aware that this might not be the best time to sell off assets, especially when the oil market is depressed. However, my concerns are pacified to some extent when Halliburton clearly states that no transaction will be closed until acceptable terms have been reached -- meaning I don't see the company just ridding themselves of the business units at throwaway prices for the greater good. Now talking about the greater good -- while Lesar showed interest in retaining these assets, the long-term gains of the sell-off could translate into cost savings of $2 billion annually, and accretion to earnings per share of about 15%-20% by 2017 if the merger is approved.Talking a little about when I expect the divesture to be completed, I think I'll go with Oppenheimer's expectations of an end of the year closing on these assets. Moreover, according to Oppenheimer's estimates, the drill bits and MWD and LWD units could bring in approximately $6.5 billion all together. Therefore, I anticipate more divestures to be announced during the course of the next few months as Halliburton strives to come close to its $10 billion sell off target.Not so optimistic about Q1Earnings season is just around the corner for energy companies whose first quarter ends in March 2015. As Halliburton is slated to report its quarterly results in the next few days, investors seem to be more concerned about how the stock might react in the wake of the earnings release. Let's get one thing straight: Results season is going to be a tough one this time around.According to analysts such as J. David Andersen at Barclays, the fourth-quarter earnings season for oilfield service companies was the ""calm before the storm"" with the real ""eye of the hurricane"" waiting to create havoc as the first-quarter earnings season approaches. Andersen expects this bumpy ride to prolong throughout the course of the year, before things begin to improve for companies. Throwing light on the numbers, we can see why.According to reports, the declining rig count has been a continuous cause of concern for all oilfield service companies, and we can see the impact of this being clearly visible in the first-quarter results. According to the latest rig count report, the number of oil rigs in the U.S. has declined to 802, which are the lowest levels since 2011. Since October of last year, rig count has dramatically declined by about half. Oil and gas rigs in the U.S. total to 1028, down by 790 rigs compared to last year. With the rig count having declined at an alarming pace in the first quarter, revenues and margins are likely to see some contraction in the first quarter results.That said, I will go by UBS's estimates of a 25-35% contraction in revenues reported for the first quarter, with margins for the North American region to range within 4-5%. As for earnings, there is no doubt about the fact that maintaining profitability will be a challenge for operators in this industry. Quarterly earnings for Halliburton have been forecast at a high of $0.98 and a low of $0.27, with a consensus EPS forecast of $0.59 per share.There is a very good possibility that earnings could be reported south of this figure in the latest earnings release, so it's best not to rule out that possibility either. Analysts project EPS to be in a state of decline at least until the first quarter of 2016, which is a very logical forecast as I anticipate oil prices to remain depressed for the first half of the year, with little improvement in the second half of 2015 as well.ConclusionAs the stock trades around the $45 mark, I anticipate that the current year will be a slow one for Halliburton. I foresee many buying opportunities as there is a possibility of dips in stock prices, especially as earnings for the quarters are released every three months. Going forward, however, I anticipate stock prices to head north of where they are now, breaching the $60 mark. I expect this gain to be fueled by the completion of the merger with Baker Hughes, and a better competitive edge to compete with and take away market share from rival Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB).I see this strength lifting the P/E ratio of the company as well, making it a good investment for those who wish to hold on to the stock for the next 2-5 years. For this year, I am bearish on stock prices and I don't expect them to pick up steam until the second half of the year. Overall, I would recommend a long position in the stock, and strongly urge investors to consider investing during the dips in prices."
3036096,85386,2015-03-29T06:10:48-04:00,"HAL's current share price is pricing in a rebound in oil in 2016.However, oil prices may stay at current levels until 2017 due to oversupply and weak demand.Hold off buying HAL until shares fall even further.","Oil prices are the main driver of Halliburton's (NYSE:HAL) revenues:Halliburton is an oil field services company that provides products and services for oil and gas exploration and production (E&P). The company derives approximately 54% of revenues from North America.E&P companies' willingness to spend billions of dollars drilling for oil & gas is highly dependent on the price of oil. The higher the price of oil, the more the companies can spend on taking oil out of the ground and still make a profit. Hence, demand for Halliburton's products and services are highly correlated to the price of oil.Oil prices, as many of you are aware, have declined significantly over the past few months. The oil price has fallen by more than 45% since June when it was close to $100 a barrel. The current price is at $51. With oil prices having fallen as much, E&P companies, particularly in North America, have slashed their drilling budgets for 2015. The market expectation for budgets cuts in the U.S. range from 25- 30%.This means that HAL's revenues in North America for 2015 should be down 25-30%. The real question that investors are asking are when will oil prices rebound and to what level? Currently, the market is expecting oil prices to trough in the first half of 2015 and bounce back to $60 to $70 a barrel in the second half of 2015 and into 2016. HAL's stock price reflects this expectation. However, I believe that there is a decent chance that oil prices remain below $60 for the next two years for the following reasons:1) Saudi Arabia can keep oil prices low for a whileAs noted earlier, the ability for an E&P company to remain profitable is dependent on the price of oil and the cost it takes that company to get oil out of the ground. Though the price of oil is the same for all E&P companies, the cost to get oil out of the ground varies significantly by geography. The table below shows the cost by region.Table: Cost of oil production by geographyAs you can see, Saudi Arabia clearly has the lowest cost to get oil out of the ground. One of the main reasons that oil prices collapsed as much was because Saudi Arabia decided not to lower its production in order to prop up the price of oil. It is speculated that the Saudis did this for two reasons. First, they want to hurt certain countries that they detest such as Iran and Russia. Second, they want to slow production of oil from the U.S. With such low costs to produce oil, Saudi Arabia can continue to generate profits at the current price of oil for quite a while. Additionally, it has $900 billion in reserves that it can tap into, should times get tough for the country.2) Oil production in the U.S. is very easy to turn on and off. Any increase in the price of oil will lead to an immediate increase in production, which will then increase supply and cause oil prices to decline yet again.There has been a huge energy revolution in the United States for the past few years. Fracking has led to a significant rise in oil and gas production. However, with oil prices having fallen more than 45% in the past 9 months, the U.S. E&P companies are slashing their budgets and cutting production. According to Baker Hughes (BHI), the total oil rig count in the U.S. hit 1,093 in Feb 2015 from 1,555 in Oct 2014. The rigs that have been shut off have primarily been older rigs in high cost areas of the country. Additionally, many E&P companies in the U.S. took on lots of debt to fund their operations during the energy boom years. The sudden decline in oil prices may cause these companies to shut down entirely. The result of these two actions is that the cost to get oil of the ground in the U.S. should fall. The current cost of getting oil out of the ground in the U.S. ranges from $40-$80 a barrel. After shutting off the more expensive rigs and after the smaller, less efficient E&P players have exited, the majority of the oil production in the U.S. should occur at cost below $60 a barrel. This means that the marginal cost of production in the U.S. should shift to below $60 a barrel. Additionally, getting shale oil out of the ground can occur much faster than conventional oil. Conventional oil takes a long time to slow down and a long time to speed up, while shale oil can be turned on and off much faster. The combination of a lower marginal cost and faster ramp up and down of production means that if the price of oil reaches close to $60 a barrel, production in the U.S. can turn on very quickly and introduce more supply into the market, leading to price softening yet again.3) Storage of oil is at record levels, making it easy to introduce supply into the market when oil prices rise.With the expectation of oil prices to rise in the future, many companies in the U.S. are storing the oil they produce hoping to sell at a higher price in the future. Their actions, however, may actually lead to oil prices remaining low for a while. If oil prices do rise in the future, it will be very easy for these companies to introduce supply into the market from their storage facilities. This would in turn cause oil prices to decline due to increased supply. Furthermore, oil storage is at its highest level ever. If refining capacity falls sharply for any reason, the actual storage space for oil may run out. This would lead to oil prices falling dramatically to less than $30 a barrel.4) The dollar should continue to strengthen as interest rates rise in the U.S. leading to further decline in the demand for oil.One of the reasons oil prices have fallen is weak demand from Europe and emerging markets such as China. The demand has been weak for two reasons. First, economic activity (i.e. GDP growth) has been weak in these regions. Another reason is that the dollar has been strengthening relative to other currencies. Since the price of oil is quoted in U.S. dollars, as the dollar strengthens, the ability of other countries to purchase oil goes down.Interest rates in the U.S. are expected to start rising as the Fed starts to raise rates sometime in the second half of 2015. As rates rise, the demand for dollar-denominated bonds increase. This increase in demand could result in the dollar strengthening even further. If the dollar continues to strengthen relative to other currencies, the demand for oil will further weaken, resulting in lower oil prices.Conclusion:HAL is a high quality business operating in a favorable competitive environment. Additionally, the company is in the midst of merging with Baker Hughes, which should result in an even better industry structure. However, its revenues and in turn its stock price are highly dependent on the price of oil. Even with the stock having collapsed from over $70 a share to $43 a share currently, the shares are still pricing in a rebound in oil prices to above $65 a barrel in 2016. Based on my estimates of 2015 earnings per share, HAL is currently trading at ~30x forward P/E. This is higher than what it traded in 2008 / 2009 during the previous down cycle in oil. This high P/E is common in cyclical stocks such as HAL. Investors place a higher P/E multiple on earnings that they believe to be at the bottom of the cycle, expecting the earnings to increase in the future. I believe that waiting for HAL to trade for <25x 2015 earnings, which is similar to what it traded during 2008 / 2009, is prudent, given the potential for oil to fall further.For all the reasons highlighted in the article, oil prices have a good chance of remaining below $65 for a while and may even fall significantly lower if certain events occur. I believe a disciplined investor, who is looking first for downside protection, should wait to buy Halliburton shares until they fall below $35 a share."
3057776,72215,2015-04-08T14:55:54-04:00,"Halliburton shareholders have approved the merger deal with Baker Hughes. The$35 billion deal is expected to close sometime during the second half of the year.The company is in the process of dropping off assets worth $10 billion from its portfolio to make the merger a more approvable venture for regulators.We could expect Halliburton’s revenues from the North America to be driven down by 25%-30%; the average amount of cuts in capital expenditure budgets introduced by companies in the region.The merged entity could be somewhat insulated from decline in drilling activity as they might be able to keep prices higher relative to what they charges prior to the merger.I foresee a rapid improvement in the P/E ratio of the company going forward, as the merger is expected to push stock prices upward gradually.","Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) has found itself in the limelight as shareholders have approved the merger deal with Baker Hughes. The deal between the two companies has been a largely talked about aspect, with the shareholder approval under scrutiny since November of last year. However, with that now out of the way, both companies are one step closer toward merging into one of the largest oil field servicing companies in the market. The $35 billion deal is expected to close sometime during the second half of the year, and it is evident that the company is prudent in taking steps of making the merger more possible by getting involved in asset sales.One of the main obstacles looming over the merger deal is the sheer size of the new entity, post-merger. With a wider revenue base expected, regulators might be scrutinizing the amount of power that the newly merged company and direct rival Schlumberger will yield from then on. Halliburton has actively responded to these concerns by proceeding with asset sales, in light of discussions with regulatory authorities. The company is in the process of dropping off assets worth $10 billion from its portfolio to make the merger a more approvable venture for regulators. The assets that the company will be divesting from include overlapping business lines like drill bits and directional drilling operations.One of the long-term benefits evident from this sell off is that it will prepare the merged entity to perform better, with a more streamlined and efficient asset base that it could use to fuel its future growth. At the same time, both companies' seem to be pursuing cost-cutting measures in light of the recent oil price downturn that is hitting the oil sector hard. Halliburton and Baker Hughes intend on cutting 6,500 and 7,000 people from their workforce, respectively. While this might also be in preparation for the merger to go through, it is a move stimulated by the weak oil environment where operating costs need to be kept to a minimum in order to endure healthy bottom lines.While the merger does have the potential to bring in a lot of benefits to the new entity, the downsides to top lines, due to weaker oil prices, should not be ignored. Halliburton derives over 50% of its revenues from North America. With the oil price declines now taking a hit on the capital expenditure budgets of oil companies operating in the region, we could expect Halliburton's revenues from the region to be driven down by 25%-30% -- the average amount of cuts in capital expenditure budgets introduced by companies in the region.Post-merger, however, I do anticipate things to be a little better in terms of revenue. Lower upstream spending will undoubtedly impact revenue growth for oilfield service companies. The only support being offered to revenues in these testing times is the contract driven nature of business. However, this support could be limited when future contracts begin to be signed as oil companies would obviously bargain, with sufficient bargaining power, to negotiate contracts at lower rates. The merger itself will offer both companies the capability of focusing on expanding their downstream business.Moreover, it could be possible that the merged entity could be somewhat insulated from the decline in drilling activity as they might be able to keep their prices higher relative to what they charges prior to the merger. However, this is just an assumption made after an analysis of the competitive position that the new company would hold once Halliburton and Baker Hughes join forces.My thoughts on the mergerI believe that the shareholder approval for the merger was the biggest step in the process that could have lead the merger to see its end of days. With that out of the way, regulatory approval is still pending but I anticipate things to go in a smooth flow. I believe that the efforts to divest from assets in order to appease regulators concerns about the firm being too large and powerful will pay off in the form of an approval. It is only after the merger is finalized and starts bearing fruit that I believe stock valuation could improve dramatically and even surpass that of Schlumberger, offering investors a much better PE in the future.ConclusionHalliburton's stock has given investors little incentive to invest for a healthy return. Stock prices have plummeted from $61.86 on 3rd October, 2014 to $43.96 on April 2, 2014. Analysts are not as optimistic about stock prices for the next 12 months, as they anticipate an 8% upside in prices from their current levels. I foresee a rapid improvement in the P/E ratio of the company going forward, as the merger is expected to push stock prices upward gradually. I see stock prices for Halliburton highly dependent on the trend of oil prices in the market.Since I anticipate oil prices to remain in the trench for the first half of the year, with only a mild improvement in the second half, I see stock prices for Halliburton to remain at the more or less the same levels as they are now. I expect stock prices to begin picking up once the mega merger receives approval from regulators. Halliburton's stock makes a good long term investment due to its growth and expansion prospects, and it would make a good value addition to any long-term portfolio."
2972836,67775,2015-03-04T11:39:07-05:00,"Halliburton is likely to be the hardest hit oil services company.Expect FY 2015 revenues to be down by 20% and EBITDA to be down by 40%.There won't be a bounce back until FY 2017, unless WTI crude oil price outlook improves significantly.DCF methodology suggests value of only $39 per share.","Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) operates globally, but its key expertise -- and thus profitability -- is in North America in the activities of hydraulic fracturing, cementing and directional drilling, all predominantly shale activities. In the current WTI crude oil price environment, HAL's FY 2015 revenue and EBITDA outlook is grim (-20% and -40%, respectively) with little chance of a substantial bounce back until FY 2017. Modeling this, my DCF suggests a fair market value of approximately $39 per share.Among Oil Service Companies, HAL Likely to Be Hit Hardest by Falling Crude Oil PricesAs mentioned in my recent article, Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB), Halliburton, and Baker Hughes (BHI) are the three main U.S.-quoted oilfield services and equipment companies and are dealing with sharp capital expenditure cutbacks being imposed by the oil majors in response to the near 50% decline in crude oil prices since last year. Due to HAL's relatively high exposure to the North American shale industry through its key activities of hydraulic fracturing (pressure pumping), cementing and directional drilling, as shown below, HAL's FY 2015 outlook is more negative than its peers.Levered Return's interactive peer analysis below compares HAL's historical and projected performance with its competitors. The trends tab clearly illustrates how SLB has consistently outperformed HAL and BHI over the last five years in terms of growth, margins, and capital expenditures. Equity analysts are expecting these trends to continue.Sharp EBITDA Decline in FY 2015, Followed by a Quick Bounce Back? Not So fast!It is very easy to look back at the events of 2009/10 and assume it will be the same this time in 2015/16 -- i.e., a deep EBITDA/earnings/share price decline, followed by an equally abrupt bounce back. Well, I'm not so sure about that. Due to the huge success of the U.S./North American shale industry in enabling crude oil extraction from previously inaccessible rock strata, global crude oil supply has increased significantly while demand has flatlined. Such a profile is likely to keep crude oil prices (especially North American crude) in check, with prices in a year or two still likely to be nearer $50 than $100. As a result, I believe that a bounce back in HAL's profitability and thus the share price is further away than most investors believe, with further downside still to come.My Forecast Assumes No Bounce Back Until FY 2017Utilizing the DCF model above, one can see that I assume a 20% revenue decline for HAL in FY 2015, followed by only a 1% improvement in FY 2016, to $26.5 billion. I also assume that EBITDA falls by 40% and subsequently bounces back by 13%, respectively, so its not until FY 2017 that I figure any appreciable bounce back will occur. Using this profile, my DCF model suggests a fair market value of $39 per share for HAL, 9% below the current share price. That said, however, should the WTI crude oil price outlook improve significantly, HAL is likely to benefit the most among its peers. So I suggest switching into HAL on such an event."
3013496,40351,2015-03-19T10:08:10-04:00,"The U.S. rig count will drop by 28% sequentially in the first quarter, as per analysts’ estimates.Based on what we've seen in the last two down cycles, the rig count numbers could bottom within a couple of months.Is this time to buy Halliburton stock?","The number of drilling rigs across the U.S. continues to decline, which was evident in the latest data released by Baker Hughes (BHI). The total number of oil and gas rigs in the U.S has fallen to 1,125 for the week ending Friday, down from more than 1,800 a year earlier, after the oil rig count fell for the fourteenth consecutive week to 866 -- its lowest level in approximately four years.However, so far, the low rig count has not made any major impact on U.S. oil production growth due to two main reasons. Firstly, a large portion of the rigs that initially came off were directional/vertical rigs rather than the horizontal rigs. The latter produce significantly greater volumes of hydrocarbons in a day than the former. Secondly, the process of the drop in the number of rigs and its impact on U.S. oil production is a lengthy one which usually takes a couple of months, not days.The number of rigs will likely continue to head lower in the near future. Oppenheimer's analyst James Schumm wrote in a recent report emailed to me that the U.S. rig count will drop by 28% in the first quarter as compared to the final quarter of the last year. That's bad news for oilfield services companies Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB), Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) and Baker Hughes whose woes have been compounded by service price reductions. With persistent weakness in oil prices which have now fallen for the seventh straight day at the time of this writing, it's not surprising that the shares of the big three have dropped by 9% to 10% over the last one month.However, if the U.S. rig count numbers starts to improve, then the oilfield services stocks could begin their recovery. If that happens, then Halliburton could be the biggest beneficiary, given the company already has greater exposure to the North American market than Schlumberger and will become a dominant player in this region following its merger with Baker Hughes. Last year, Schlumberger generated a third of its revenues from North America as opposed to Halliburton and Baker Hughes which got around 50%.The good news is that based on what we've seen over the last two down cycles, the improvement in the rig count numbers could be just around the corner. When WTI oil prices gradually declined from nearly $30 a barrel in the beginning of 2001 to $19 a barrel by the end of that year and when these prices fell by 69% in the second half of 2008, the rig count numbers declined for 38 and 39 weeks respectively, as per data from Oppenheimer. If the markets witness a similar pattern in 2015, then that would mean that the number of oil and gas rigs will continue to decline, eventually bottoming in the 38th to 39th week sometime in June. This could be followed by a slow recovery throughout the second half of the year.For investors who are willing to bet on the above-mentioned recovery in the next few months, this could be a good time to buy Halliburton stock as the shares of oilfield services companies usually touch their lowest levels around six months before the rig-count numbers begin to improve. Halliburton's shares have dropped by around 10% this month, settling at around $40 when the markets closed on Wednesday and are priced near their 52-week low of $37. The stock of the Houston, Texas based company will likely outperform its peers in the coming months as the markets figures out the bottom in the U.S. rig count numbers."
2959346,48411,2015-02-27T13:47:26-05:00,"HAL admitted at its Credit Suisse Energy Summit presentation that its Q4 guidance for decrementals can no longer be relied on.
        Management is now expecting sequential decrementals and revenue drops of greater than 60%.
        HAL shares were halved from 52 weeks highs from July to January and I think the recent bounce in pricing will be short lived.
        Avoid HAL until at least Q1 reporting.","Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) did little to calm the nerves of the investment community at its presentation at the Credit Suisse Energy Summit two days ago. Remember, this is an investment community that just watched HAL shares get halved from late-July to late-December. In fact, HAL may have added fuel to the ""sell first"" fire admitting that its Q4 expectations given just one month ago are no longer reliable.Of course HAL gave its best efforts to explain how its experience and size would lead it out to the other side of this down cycle and that it was in no serious financial trouble but nobody was realistically thinking that to begin with. What the market wanted answers to was how long HAL shares would trade on the lows and if we are at the bottom. According to HAL President Jeff Miller we aren't.First, let's take a trip back to Q4 when HAL management collectively thought it had an idea of what investors could expect in this down cycle:For clarity, ""decrementals"" is a made up word financial analysts use to describe what can most easily be explained as the opposite of operating leverage. It basically means for every dollar of sales lost how much profit is lost. According to management at Q4 reporting, decrementals were expected to come in slightly better than 60%. This changed as of two days ago at the CS Summit:That means at least 60% decrementals. What this also means is that because pricing never got back to peak levels from the previous down cycle trough is that, as HAL management alluded to, revenues will be hammered worse than the out of the gate quarter results from 2009. That's based on information as of 2/24/2014 - try to keep in context how quickly the rig count and pricing environments deteriorated in the last 30 days.These expectations could continue to devolve and probably should with oil pricing action the last 48 hours. By the way, HAL's share price is highly correlated to the price of oil which as of late has been more highly correlated to the US Dollar strength than inventories. I've plotted these correlations using HAL, The United States Oil ETF, LP (NYSEARCA:USO) to be representative of oil pricing, and PowerShares DB USD Bull ETF (NYSEARCA:UUP) to be representative of the US Dollar:The bottom line is that HAL's management grossly underestimated the severity of this downturn, they weren't alone but they're included in the group that did, and this leads me to believe that cost cutting and other concessions needed to be made quickly haven't been or are just now being executed. We already know that Q1/15 reporting will be a blood bath but I'm thinking it will be much worse than expectation.HAL admitted at Q4 reporting that it was having a hard time trying to size the opportunity in the US market because of constantly moving, constantly revised downward customer capital budgets. I wonder how much that still moving piece of the equation plays into Q1 results and potentially further out as I'm sure many of HAL's customers aren't planning for Armageddon (which to this industry would be less than say $50 oil pricing deep into Q3 or so) and might have to adjust budgets further lower at 1H/15 reporting. Plenty of HAL's customers have detailed in earnings calls that most of the CAPEX will be deployed in 2H/15, what if things get really tight and even less CAPEX is deployed than modeled in?HAL management tried to example just how extreme this most recent down cycle has been with a well put together slide showing context of rig activity drops:Absolutely brutal.The slope of the current cycle is sharper than any down cycle dating back to 1997. Only 2008 showed a deeper ""drill string"" of falling activity.So, what are HAL's solutions for dealing with the status quo? Essentially it can reduce headcount, it has and it will do so further, and it can peel back spending. Other than that it can make pricing concessions to its customers, it is already, and ask for pricing concessions from its supply chain and from companies that it's a customer of. Outside of that, it can't do much but sit back and hope that pricing improves.Now, HAL did note that quite a bit of ""boom town"" costs will come off the books as it moves out of expensive areas of activity in which it is paying for housing, food, etc., for employees that it had to convince to temporarily relocate as a result of wanting to get business done ""right now"" but how much and at what decremental margin defense is yet to be seen.Right now HAL is an absolute avoid and it might be worth taking a small PUT option position in if oil pricing doesn't move higher soon. HAL announces its Q1/15 results on April 20th but remember we're just about one month away from it booking those results from a calendar standpoint. Sure, quite a bit of downside has been priced into the stock already but there's plenty to be had if HAL comes out and reports that it was slower to make cost cuts, couldn't cut costs deep enough, didn't get the supply chain concessions it wanted, etc. Plenty of negative catalyst left in a fairly high visibility opportunity.Avoid HAL for now from the equity side and consider finding a way to profit from missed expectations at Q1 reporting.Good luck everybody."
2921196,72215,2015-02-17T03:03:38-05:00,"Revenues could remain on the lighter side and margins could contract as oil companies lower capital expenditure and wish to sign new contracts at lower rates with rig counts declining.Halliburton recently announced the trimming of its workforce by up to 8%, which amounts to 6,400 layoffs, in light of the prevailing oil price volatility in the market.The company’s first quarter earnings estimates have been revised downwards from $1.09 to $0.69. Additionally, the company’s full year earnings outlook has also been downgraded from $4.82 to $2.15.The first couple of quarters will be rough on the company’s revenues and margins, as the activity of the industry witnesses a slow down and as rig counts decline rapidly.We could witness further retreat in stock prices, especially during the initial earnings announcements of the current year. Those dips would be an ideal time to invest in the stock.","Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) saw a fairly good year last year. However, the turmoil in the industry indicates that keeping up the performance this year as well might be an uphill task. Amid declining rig counts, and cut backs in capital expenditures, Halliburton has been trying hard to combat potential margin contraction and lower revenue growth. In one of the latest developments, the company has been forced to introduce job cuts to ease the pressure off its bottom lines for the year.Despite the possibility of a slow 2015, the company's long term growth prospects are fundamentally intact making it one of the best buys in an industry that seems to have a slow year ahead of itself.Lighter revenues and contracting margins - the result of capex cuts and oil price volatilityCEO of Halliburton, Dave Lesar, warned investors against the tough year ahead for the company, in the company's fourth quarter conference call. Lesar could very well be right about the pains that Halliburton might see in the year ahead. To begin with, there are definite signs of a slowdown in activity in the industry as oil companies have revised their capital expenditure budgets downward. The risk of further reductions in capital expenditures is also possible, especially if oil prices plummet to lower levels. Additionally, the rig count in the industry has also declined dramatically in the past few weeks, according to a Baker Hughes reports. Though the rig count in the industry held up during the company's fourth quarter, we could see the decline in the rig count dent the company's first quarter earnings for the year. The company confirmed that it is in discussion with customers about price discount on it services, with many companies unwilling to execute contracts until service prices are lowered by at least 40%. Since oil companies clearly have the upper hand in this case, and as Halliburton could eventually be seen making concessions for customers, margin contraction could be a prominent feature of the year. In fact, margin weakness could prevail until oil prices rebound and capital budgets are increased, allowing new contracts to be negotiated at relatively better rates in the future.Halliburton cuts jobs in light of oil price weaknessJust as capital expenditure cuts have become common news for oil companies, job cut announcements in oilfield service companies have been made in the past few weeks. Schlumberger and Weatherford International already broke the bad news regarding job cuts, and now Halliburton has followed. Halliburton recently announced the trimming of its workforce by up to 8%, which amounts to 6,400 layoffs, in light of the prevailing oil price volatility in the market. The company has stated that the cut in the workforce is expected to occur across its global operations and is unrelated to its ongoing acquisition of Baker Hughes. With oil prices having fallen by more than 50% since June of last year, and with oil players cutting back their capital expenditures, future revenues for oilfield service companies like Halliburton could remain on the lighter side. With the retrenchment due to take place, Halliburton seeks to lower its costs in order to boost bottom lines. This announcement of job cuts was follows by the company's previous announcement of laying of 1,000 workers, somewhere around December of last year. Halliburton seems to be in pursuit in cost savings at the moment, at a time when the IEA has indicated that crude oil prices could average out to $55 per barrel this year. The agency has added that it may take about five years for crude oil prices to rebound to their previous levels. With that large a time span in a low oil price environment, the move to cut jobs is one that could allow the company to make cost savings down the road as well.Earnings review and outlook for 2015Halliburton ended last year with operating income of $5 billion against revenues of $33 billion. Its fourth quarter was a relatively good one as the company was able to outperform analyst estimates by 8.2%, posting its quarterly earnings at $1.19 per share. The company has continued its upward earnings trajectory in the past few quarters, delivering an earnings beat in 4 out of the 5 previously announced results.Halliburton has maintained its dividend payout tradition, after announcing a 20% increase in its quarterly dividend to $0.18 per share. The company has paid out continuous since 1972. The weakness in the year ahead does not put the paying out of dividends at risk for investors who are looking for steady streams of incomes from their portfolio.The outlook for the company's earnings is an indication of the weakness in the company's financials this year. The company's first quarter earnings estimates have been revised downwards from $1.09 to $0.69. Additionally, the company's full year earnings outlook has also been downgraded from $4.82 to $2.15.ConclusionTo conclude, I foresee that the first couple of quarters will be rough on the company's revenues and margins, as the activity of the industry witnesses a slow down and as rig counts decline rapidly. However, given the recent developments about a cut in the work force, we could see margins stabilize during the later part of the year, with continuation into the next few years as well. The company has done very well at improving its efficiency over the past few quarters and making the most out of its labor productivity, so I do not expect margins to contract rather sharply. The weakness in the company's financials could be offset slightly by the cut in the workforce as labor costs are driven down. With the acquisition of Baker Hughes likely to materialize sometime in the second half of the year, we could begin to witness the pressure on the company's bottom lines ease out, as the company expects to incur $2 billion in cost savings as a result of the deal.We have seen the company enter this year with a lot of positives on its side with almost all of its product lines doing well in the past year. The financial strength of the company remains intact and the merger with Baker Hughes could open up an all new stream of revenue diversification, with gains in market share, that will eventually allow the company to compete against its rival Schlumberger. The company definitely has the financial muscle to make it through the tough year ahead and is keeping its opportunities for long term growth open for itself. As the outlook for the oil market improves, Halliburton's present efforts of managing itself well at this point in time, could possibly allow it to boast of growth in the future.Halliburton's stock has witnessed a decline of nearly 34% in the past six months. Shares currently trade close to the $44 mark, at 10.76x their earnings. I expect share prices to continue hanging during the most part of the year, with some major improvements later on as the company's margins and earnings stabilize later on. Analysts are targeting a 7% upside in the stock price over the next 12 months. Moreover, in the medium to long term, I expect the company's valuation to improve, post-Baker Hughes acquisition.All that said and done, I think that we could witness a further retreat in stock prices, especially during the initial earnings announcements of the current year. Those dips would be an ideal time to invest in the stock. Investors would probably not want to hold an investment in this stock before that time. I remain bullish on Halliburton's stock in the long run and recommend buying the stock sometime after the first quarter earnings announcement of the year, when prices are likely to go down."
3049996,22148,2015-04-05T05:42:40-04:00,Shareholder approved the merger of Halliburton and Baker Hughes.Halliburton is moving forward with asset sales suggesting the U.S Justice Department is working towards a positive solution.The new Halliburton still trades at an attractive valuation providing potential alpha for the sector with the ultimate return based on oil prices.,"The recent shareholder approvals by Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) and Baker Hughes (BHI) place the megadeal one step closer to completion. The current oil market weakness causing the onshore drilling rig count reductions continue to hide the shareholder benefits of this merger. Not to mention, the current downturn is allowing both firms to cut costs that could improve margins during the next market boom.Though the deal isn't expected to close until the 2H of the year, should investors use the continued market weakness to buy the stock?Asset SalesBased on the original research of the double benefits of owning the stock on the merger, the only concern with buying the stock now is a block of the merger. The U.S. Justice Department could have a major issue with the #2 and #3 oilfield service firms forming to create the largest firm by revenue. Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) will still have the largest market cap, but the new Halliburton will have a larger revenue base prior to any asset sales.The following revenue totals are based on analyst estimates for 2015:Before any asset sales, Halliburton/Baker Hughes becomes the leader in the industry with $45.8 billion. The major concern with regulators is that the top two entities would have revenue bases of around $40 billion with the next largest firm at only slightly over $10 billion. The combined two entities would weld all of the power in the industry.The encouraging news is that Halliburton and Baker Hughes are reportedly moving forward with asset sales. This move is an encouraging sign that Halliburton is making these moves based on discussions with regulators. The suggestion is that the combined entity will attempt to unload up to $10 billion in assets. Halliburton had originally proposed selling businesses with revenue of up to $7.5 billion. Ironically, selling that amount of revenue adjusted for a 20% decline in business in this downturn would place the new Halliburton at right around the revenue base of Schlumberger.Valuation IntactWhile the Bloomberg article mentions that Schlumberger is twice the size of the new Halliburton, it fails to mention that is in market valuation only. Even with the potential $2 billion synergies from the merger, the market hasn't yet adjusted the valuation gap with Schlumberger. Both Halliburton and Baker Hughes trade at PS multiples roughly half of the current industry leader.HAL PS Ratio (Forward) data by YChartsTakeawayIf one expects oil prices to fall further, then the oilfield services sector as a whole won't perform well. If one expects oil prices to rebound by year end, the prediction is that Halliburton leads the rebound in the sector. Either way, this stock should provide alpha in comparison to the oilfield services sector."
2919726,60091,2015-02-16T08:43:28-05:00,Cost benefits analysis upon the examination of which company is a better buy (Halliburton or Baker Hughes).Synergies that will be created from a merged entity.The events that will take place if the merger does not materialize.,"Part one of this three piece article focused on the benefits of investing in Baker Hughes (BHI) to capitalize from this upcoming merger. Part two was attentive to the Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) side of the merger. Part one can be found here, and part two here, if you missed them. The final part will be devoted to a cost benefit analysis conferring upon the opportunity cost of investing in HAL vs. BHI. There will also be a part devoted to the synergies that these companies will bring to each other if the merger goes through.Profiting from mergers and acquisitions is a strategy that investors can use to swell up their portfolio returns. To do this requires tact, thoughtfulness and a little bit of luck. Knowing what company to buy, the acquirer or the acquiree, will also be very beneficial to investors. At the end of this article, readers and investors will be able to make an intelligent decision on which company to buy, HAL, or BHI. That is if they come to the conclusion that investing in HAL or BHI is an intelligent decision.Comparison of Earnings per ShareHalliburton StatisticsBaker Hughes StatisticsHAL has done a better job at growing earnings over the past decade from a CAGR perspective. The past year (2014) could be assumed to be outlier years for both companies. If we do assume that the earnings in the past year were abnormal and dismiss them as outlier years, the observations of earnings growth are slim to none, for both companies. What this means is that in the past decade, management from both companies has not done a good job at increasing shareholder value in the earnings per share. Both of these companies should not be bought because of growth prospects.Historical Comparison of the High and Lows (Price and P/E)(Halliburton's Historical Prices, P/E)HAL's current price is trading very near their average high price in the past decade. The average low price in the past decade is 24.68. HAL's current price could still have the potential to fall 44% to reach the average low price in the past decade. Investors should note that the price may not fall to their average low price and the average low price is used to get investors to use critical thinking skills before impetuously investing.HAL's current P/E is trading near the average low P/E of the past decade. What investors should note is that if you take the average earnings per share of the past decade and plug that into the P/E formula, ((44.19/2.49)=17.74), you will get a P/E of 17.74. This P/E ratio is trading more near the average high P/E of the past decade.(Baker Hughes Historical Prices, P/E)As with HAL, BHI's current price is closer to the average high price in the past decade than the average low price. The predominant reason for this is because the merger is being accounted for in the present share price. Before the announcement of the merger, BHI was trading near 50 per share. 50 per share was more near the average low price of the past decade than the average high price. Investors who held BHI before the announcement of the merger have profited handsomely. Investors who are thinking about buying BHI now must take into account that BHI already rose 24%. The spread of profiting from the merger is slimming down.BHI's current P/E ratio is trading closer to their average low P/E ratio of the past decade. A P/E of 16.41 is moderately high though. Plugging BHI's average earnings of the past decade into the P/E formula, ((64.13/3.655)=17.54), will give a P/E ratio of 17.54. This P/E ratio trades close to their current P/E. Finally, 17.54 as a P/E is midway between the average high P/E of the past decade and the average low P/E.Using historical averages can be prevailing to investors. Averages allow investors to see what has happened in the past. The past dictates the future, and the future is what investors want to know. Historical averages should be a tool or an apparatus to be used in the investor's best interests. The more the investor knows, the more the portfolio will grow.HAL has the highest market capitalization, which means its business is bigger than BHI's. The P/Es have already been explained in the above portion of this study. Investors and readers are advised to read back if the material was skipped. With a lower P/B ratio and higher book value, BHI is more undervalued using these metrics. BHI also is trading closer to its book value (21.15 difference). HAL on the other hand has a 25.01 difference between its book value and current price.The more liquid a company, the safer the investment will be for investors. BHI currently is the safer investment in terms of liquidity. BHI has a spread between cash and debt of 2.39, while HAL's spread is 5.49. Investors should note that if an attempt of the merger fails, HAL will have to pay BHI $3.5 billion. These are the terms of the break-up fee. If this happens, BHI will have 5.24 billion in cash and 4.13 billion in debt. HAL on the other hand will have 2.35 billion in cash and 11.34 billion in debt.The final item investors should heed is the dividend. Investors should not be buying either of these companies for stable income. In the past 15 years, the dividend has increased and decreased for both companies. In fact, BHI's dividend has increased only .055 cents in the past 15 years. HAL's dividend has increased by the same amount as well, .055 cents. Investors can use the CAGR formula to find out how much the dividend has increased annually for the past 15 years.HAL - (.18/.125)^(1/15)-1=2.46%BHI - (.17/.115)^(1/15)-1=2.64%Overall, BHI has increased its dividend on an annualized basis slightly more. HAL and BHI's dividend increases have marginally outpaced the current inflation rate in the past 15 years. If inflation rises substantially in the following years, investors may lose money if there are no capital gains from BHI or HAL.What if the merger does not materialize?If the merger fails to ensue, there could be a few different outcomes. An outcome that will happen though is the $3.5 billion break-up fee that will be paid to BHI from HAL. If this should happen, BHI should record this money as a non-recurring item. This should be done because it is a one-time thing that should not be carried out to inflate future earnings in down times. HAL should also record this as a non-recurring item for the same reasons. From this non-recurring gain, BHI's stock price should be remunerated with a higher price. HAL's stock on the other hand will have the opposite effect.The second situation that could happen if the merger fails to materialize is the fall in both companies' stock price. This may happen because of short-term traders. Some traders may have bought stock in BHI and HAL only to capitalize on the merger. Once they realize that the merger is not going to happen, they will dump their shares. In the event that this happens, investors are urged to check the fundamentals of BHI or HAL to determine if they are a better buy at the discounted price. BHI will come out stronger for they will have more cash. HAL on the other hand will be feebler.Investors should note that if the merger fails, BHI will have $3.5 billion that will make the company stronger. Management has a few different options for this $3.5 billion that will benefit shareholders. A payment of debt is one option. Option two is share buybacks. Finally, option three is a special dividend. Think of the break-up fee as insurance for BHI. Also think of the break-up fee as a deterrent for HAL.Synergies that will be CreatedIf the merger is a success, shareholders from both companies will profit from a stronger company. The following points represent the benefits that may happen from the success of the merger. These potential benefits will increase shareholder value.These benefits are not limited to the eight that are listed. Investors are advised to come up with some other benefits that will increase the value of the combined entity thus increasing shareholder value. If the merger goes through and the price of oil is stabilized in the following year, where do you see the value of the business being? Will it be worth more? Will the price of the shares increase?Final RemarksThe shareholders of BHI will benefit the most from this merger. First BHI is in better financial standing, lower debt, more cash, and the potential break-up fee money. HAL on the other hand has more debt plus the break-up fee hindrance. BHI shareholders will also be rewarded with 1.12 shares of HAL stock and $19 in cash for every share they own. BHI shareholders will also profit from the spread of the merger. The final note on how BHI is currently a better investment is due to it being undervalued more than HAL. This is from the P/E discussion that was stated above.A combined entity of HAL and BHI concludes to becoming a more powerful business. Overall, this will benefit shareholders. Benefits are numerous. The more money and profit the combined entity will produce, the more money that will be rewarded to patient shareholders. The best way to profit in the short run is to buy BHI in hopes that the merger is a success. In my opinion, I believe that the merger will be a success."
2913476,60091,2015-02-13T17:50:36-05:00,Evaluation of investing in HAL to capitalize on potential merger.Hal's financial position will let it endure the energy downturn.Undervalued using current P/E ratio of 10.22.Moderately valued using average earning in past decade in P/E formula.Brief talk on why acquiring companies stock falls when merger is announced. The dilution of potential value for HAL shareholders from this merger.,"Part one of this three piece article, evaluated the Baker Hughes (BHI) side of this incipient merger of two prodigious energy players. From the BHI side of the deal we came across many benefits such as the $3.5 billion dollar break-up fee that acts as a type of insurance for investors. Part one of this three piece article can be found here. Part two will discuss the Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) side of the deal for investors who wish to become invested in HAL or are already invested in HAL. Finally part three will delve into a cost benefit analysis conferring upon the opportunity cost of investing in HAL vs BHI. Part three will also discourse over the synergies that the two companies will give each other when merged.In the early days of 1919, HAL's predecessor, formed as a company. By 1924, HAL became an incorporated company. The days of 2015 are filled with pessimism towards energy related stocks. Most investors have become traders only thinking of the short term potential losses that could fill their portfolio if they invest in the energy sector. Value investors on the other hand see potential for long terms gains.Business SegmentsHAL's business segments consist of completion and production, and drilling and evaluation. These two segments make up the majority of HAL's business operations.Completion and Production: This segment of HAL's business consists of cementing, stimulation, intervention, pressure controls, specialty chemicals, artificial lift, completion services, production enhancement, completion tools, Halliburton Boots and Coots, Multi-Chem, and Halliburton Artificial lift.Drilling and Evaluation: This side of the business provides field and reservoir modeling, drilling, evaluation, precise wellbore placement solutions, baroid, Sperry drilling, wireline and perforating, drill bits and services, landmark software and services, testing and subsea, and consulting and project management.Effects of a MergerIn the late 1980s the majority of mergers were paid for entirely in cash. 10 years later or in the late 1990s, the majority of mergers were paid for entirely in stock. Both of these ways of acquiring companies and competitors has different implications for shareholders on both sides of the deal. An all cash deal is a simple way of exchanging rights and knowing who the buyer is and who the seller is. In an exchange for stock, it is a lot harder to tell who the buyer is and who the seller is. The acquired company could end up owning a good amount of shares of the acquiring company (BHI will own 36% of HAL if the merger goes through). Research of over 1200 deals has found that at the time of the announcement, companies that use stock to acquire a company fare worse than companies that would have used cash to acquire a company. The difference between an all cash deal and all stock deal becomes much greater over time.An all cash deal allows the shareholders of the acquiring company to take on all of the risk associated with the premium paid for the expected synergy of the two companies' combined. On the other hand if there is an all-stock deal, the risk of the expected synergy will be shared. In HAL's and BHI's case, BHI shareholders will take on 36% of the risk of the expected synergy. Shareholder Value Added (NASDAQ:SVA) is the difference between the value of the synergy created from the two companies merging and the acquisition premium.A negative effect of using shares to finance a merger is in the effect of the dilution of ownership for the acquiring company. Thus the SVA for the existing shareholders of the acquiring company will drop in a share transfer deal. Since BHI will take on 36% ownership of the newly merged company, the ownership of existing HAL shareholders will drop by 36%.Thoughts on the Drop in HAL's Share PriceHistory has shown us that two-thirds of all acquisitions have seen a drop in the acquirers share price immediately after the announcement. This drop is due to the market's reaction and investor skepticism on the results of the acquiring company being able to maintain the original value of the business plus if it will be able to achieve the synergies that rationalize the premium paid. Thus in theory, the larger the premium paid, the harder the drop in the share price.There are four problems that stand in front of acquiring companies. The first problem is in the effects of setting the performance bar too high. For an example acquiring companies may say that the expected value of a business combined with another business will give shareholders and extra $2 billion per year. These are expected improvements that may not materialize. Another problem is that the acquiring companies may need to divert some of their business resources to allow this merger to happen. This is happening in the case of HAL acquiring BHI. HAL is selling $7.5 billion of its business to allow the expected synergy (that may not materialize) of $2 billion in the future.A second problem is that the benefits that the two merged companies will bring to each other, may be easily replicated by competitors. The main competitor of HAL and BHI is Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB). SLB may not stand futilely by while it watches its two competitors merge together at their expense in the future. Thus SLB may try to take the talent of BHI's or HAL's management while their businesses are integrating. HAL may have to pay a huge sum to retain important management to ward of the pilfering talent of SLB.Thirdly, acquisitions require a full payment upfront. Mergers and acquisitions are a quick direction to the growth that investors want, but it is also a very expensive ordeal. Investors will want the evidence that this growth will materialize in a timely matter. If investors do not think the growth will materialize, the acquiring company's shares will be marked down before the integration of the two companies happens.The final reason why the acquiring company's shares are usually marked down is due to effects of a merger that may not materialize. It is very difficult and very expensive to unwind a failed merger. Managers may begin to throw more money into the failed merger because their credibility is at stake. They may say more time and money will bring value to the merger only hindering shareholders even more in the failed attempt of the synergy.Evaluation of HALNow that we know the negative effects that could transpire due to a stock/cash merger, we can continue onto evaluating HAL as a business. First we will look at the earnings over the past 10 years to determine the volatility of future earnings, and how well of a job management has done to create shareholder value.The profitability of HAL is constructive. In the past ten years HAL has showed earnings in positive territory. The years of 2009-2010 were the worst performing years. This past year has been the highest in earnings from the past decade. HAL has been able to grow its earnings at a 5.90% rate annually for the past decade as well. Finally if one wanted a rough measure of what the future holds for in earnings, one may use the average of 2.49 for forecasting the future.Thoughts on CAGR of 5.90%Like BHI, HAL should not be bought because it is a growth stock. Although HAL has been able to compound their earnings at a higher rate than BHI, it is far from a growth stock. BHI's CAGR for the past decade was 4.35%. A reader may think that 1.55% difference is not that much. Using the rule of 72, we can see that it will take HAL only 12.2 years to double their earnings if they are compounded at a rate of 5.90%. BHI on the other hand will take 16.55 years. This is the difference of 4.3 years. Finally the CAGR in the past 20 years for HAL can also help the investor formulate a better understanding of the growth of HAL's earnings.CAGR 1994-2014: ((4.03/1.60)^(1/10)-1)/(100)= 9.67% annualized.9.67% annualized return in the past 20 years is lower than BHI's 15%. Finally as the company grows bigger it will be much harder to grow earning at a higher rate.Brief Look at the Highs and Lows (Price and P/E)With a current P/E of 10.22 and an average low P/E in the past 10 years of 9.99 we can determine that HAL is undervalued using this measurement, even though the current price of HAL is near the current average high price. A problem I have found though is if we take the average earnings of 2.49 and divide that into the current price of 41.94 that will equal a P/E of 16.84. If the earnings in the next 10 years equal the average earnings of the past 10 years, buying HAL at this price would be unwarranted. Thus the earning of 2014 could be called an outlier, and should not be used in any calculation for conservative investors.Operating Results(In Millions)Operations at HAL have been very healthy in the past decade. Revenue has increased steadily besides the poor operation results of 2007-2009. Net income looks to be increasing besides in the few down years of the business. Cash flow also has been growing, creating shareholder value year per year. Overall the operation results of HAL are excellent. The past usually will represent what the future holds. With that being said, the future looks bright for HAL as a business.As with BHI, investors should not be buying HAL for deep value. HAL is not trading anywhere near book value. P/E is low, but compared to average earnings per share in the past decade, P/E is trading near the average highs of the past decade. The dividend yield is also low compared to the average dividend yield of the DOW Jones Industrial Average of 2.76%. The liquidity of the company is in moderate health. The current cash position and cash flow of the company should cover all short term expenses.Thoughts on the Break-Up FeeAgreeable and desirable for the shareholders of BHI but a hindrance for shareholders of HAL. The $3.5 billion dollar break-up fee could materialize and it is a potential threat if this merger does not go through. If HAL and BHI cannot get past regulations due to antitrust issues, HAL will be forced to pay BHI $3.5 billion dollars. HAL shareholders will be punished and BHI shareholders will be rewarded. The loss of the $3.5 billion dollars will most likely be recorded as a onetime expense. This onetime expense will hinder 2015's earnings significantly. Before investing in HAL, one must be prepared for the merger to fail.Final Remarks""We delivered an excellent 2014, but it is clear that 2015 will be a challenging year for the industry. As a result of the weakening outlook, during the fourth quarter of 2014 we took a $129 million restructuring charge to temper the impact of anticipated activity declines. Halliburton has successfully weathered multiple industry cycles. We are confident that we have the right people, technology, and strategies in place to outperform throughout this cycle too, and emerge as a stronger company."" -Lesar, CEO of HALHAL is a company that is in strong financial position to weather 2015. With an ongoing merger, HAL may come out of 2015 even stronger than before. Before investing in HAL, investors must ask themselves a few questions. What if the merger does not materialize? If earnings in the upcoming years represent what the average earnings were in the past decade, would you be paying too much for HAL right now? Can you mentally endure volatility in the energy sector for the next few years? Finally should you invest in BHI or HAL right now? These questions are very imperative questions that shareholders and potential shareholders must ask themselves. The final part of this study will delve into the synergies that will be created from the merger and a cost benefit analysis of investing in HAL vs BHI."
2981326,23471,2015-03-06T16:41:29-05:00,"HAL is suitable for both the Defensive Investor and the Enterprising Investor following the ModernGraham approach.
        According to the ModernGraham valuation model, the company is undervalued at the present time.
        The market is implying a 2.65% earnings growth over the next 7-10 years, which is significantly less than the rate the company has seen in recent years.","Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) presents an intriguing investment possibility for value investors, as the company has maintained very strong earnings growth over the last few years that may not be properly priced into the market price. Benjamin Graham, the father of value investing, taught that looking at the price cannot be the sole factor in investment decisions, as the most important aspect to consider is whether the company is trading at a discount relative to its intrinsic value. It is through a thorough fundamental analysis that the investor is able to make a determination about a potential investment's merits. Here is a look at how the company fares in the ModernGraham valuation model.The model is inspired by the teachings of Benjamin Graham, and considers numerous metrics intended to help the investor reduce risk levels. The first part of the analysis is to determine whether the company is suitable for the very conservative Defensive Investor or the less conservative Enterprising Investor, who is willing to spend a greater amount of time conducting further research.In addition, Graham strongly suggested that investors avoid speculation in order to remove the subjective elements of emotion. This is best achieved by utilizing a systematic approach to analysis that will provide investors with a sense of how a specific company compares to another. By using the ModernGraham method, one can review a company's historical accomplishments and determine an intrinsic value that can be compared across industries.HAL data by YChartsDefensive Investor - Must pass at least 6 of the following 7 tests: Score = 6/7Enterprising Investor - Must pass at least 4 of the following 5 tests or be suitable for a Defensive Investor: Score = 5/5Key Data:Balance Sheet - December 2014Earnings Per ShareEarnings Per Share - ModernGrahamDividend HistoryHAL Dividend data by YChartsHalliburton Company passes the initial requirements of both the Defensive Investor and the Enterprising Investor. The only issue the Defensive Investor has with the company is the low earnings growth over the last ten years, while the Enterprising Investor has no initial concerns. As a result, all value investors should feel very comfortable proceeding to the next part of the analysis, which is a determination of the company's intrinsic value.When it comes to that valuation, it is critical to consider the company's earnings history. In this case, the company has grown its EPSmg (normalized earnings) from $2.14 in 2010 to $3.11 for 2014. This is a strong level of demonstrated growth, which is well above the market's implied estimate for earnings growth of only 2.65% annually over the next 7-10 years. In fact, the historical growth is around 9.11% per year, so the market is expecting a very significant drop in earnings growth. The ModernGraham valuation model reduces the historical growth to a more conservative figure, assuming that some slowdown will occur, but still returns an estimate of intrinsic value falling above the current price, indicating the company is undervalued at the present time.Be sure to check out previous ModernGraham valuations of Halliburton Company for a greater perspective!"
2898476,60091,2015-02-09T10:22:07-05:00,"7.8% discount from potential merger in the future creates an arbitrage opportunity.If merger fails to happen, Baker Hughes is protected from a $3.5 billion dollar break-up fee.Due to the discount from the merger, and the potential break-up fee possibility, Baker Hughes is one of the most protected companies in the oil sector.","When oil goes down, deals go up. This is how history has presented itself in the energy sector. For an example, in the 1990's there was a drop in the price of oil that led to a consolidation of major oil companies around the global economy. The trough of the price of oil, as history has supplied us, guides energy companies to mergers and acquisitions. The last major mergers and acquisitions of the energy sector in the late 1990's, early 2000's, led to the consolidation of; BP acquiring Amoco and Arco, Exxon buying Mobil, Chevron procuring Texaco, Conoco obtaining Phillips, and Total attaining Elf.On November 17th, 2014, Baker Hughes (BHI) agreed to be bought by their rival Halliburton (NYSE:HAL). The $34.6 billion dollar deal initially valued BHI at $78.62 per share. For each share that investors hold in BHI they will be paid $19 in cash and 1.12 HAL stock. The current price of BHI is $62.67 and the current price of HAL is 43.36 as of 2/7/15. Using simple math; ($43.36)(1.12)+($19) = $67.56 per share. If the deal goes through this is a 7.8% increase from the current price. This merger is estimated to be completed in the second half of 2015. This is a great arbitrage opportunity with short term capital gains in the near future.Since the price of BHI is still 7.8% lower than the buyout price, this proposes that the market is hesitant over the success of the deal. The main difficulties that will come between the mergers of these two companies are antitrust scrutiny and regulatory laws. HAL has arranged to sell certain segments of its business that generate revenue of upwards to $7.5 million to conciliate the Federal Government. What protects investors in BHI in case of a failed merger is a $3.5 billion break-up fee. This means if the deal does not get through antitrust scrutiny and regulatory laws, BHI will acquire a $3.5 billion dollars from HAL. A break-up fee is essentially an insurance policy, for the potential acquired company.The next question that comes into mind is what exactly is the investor buying when he or she buys stock in BHI? The business of BHI consists of engagement in the oilfield services industry. Thus they are a supplier of equipment to the oilfield services, products, technology and systems, to the global oil and natural gas industry. There are also segments of their business that supply products and services to downstream refining and the process of pipeline industries. Operations extend to more than 80 countries worldwide.Products and Services (oilfield operations)Completion and Production OperationsThese ten operation systems are what make up the majority of business for BHI. Understanding what a company's operations are before an investor or speculator buys shares is one of the key steps in successful asset allocation. The crucial idea to investing in a business, not a ticker symbol, is to comprehend how a business functions before making a verdict to invest or speculate.Earnings per share of BHI over the past decade can inform the investor on how BHI's management has executed business operations. Looking at the earnings over the past decade is helpful for the investor when formulating questions about the business they are evaluating. Has BHI been profitable over the past decade? How much have earnings grown on an annualized rate? What are the average earnings so one may know what the future may present? Finally since there are usually one to two recessions per decade, looking at earnings in the past ten years can tell the investor how a company can handle recessions. Below is a table that represents BHI's earnings in the past decade.BHI has been profitable over the past decade. There was not one year with negative earnings. The earnings have been higher some years and lower in the next years such as 2006-2007. BHI has been able to grow earnings at a 4.35% rate annually over the past decade. Finally if one wanted a rough measure of what the future will hold for earnings, one may use the average of 3.655 for forecasting the future.Thoughts on CAGR of 4.35%Annualized earnings of 4.35% are not the finest earnings growth for the past decade. What this means is that investors should not buy BHI like they would buy a growth stock such as Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS). A reason for the low growth of earnings in the past decade is due to the fact on how big BHI is and how long they have been operating as a company. The company was founded in 1908 and since then has completed at least 12 mergers and acquisitions. A though look on how the operating history in the past gives an investor an idea on how BHI will grow into the future. Mergers and acquisitions look like they will be present in the future. Finally finding the CAGR of the past two decades can help formulate a better understanding on the growth of BHI.CAGR 1994-2014: (3.92/.22)^(1/20)-1=15.48% annualized.A 15% annualized return in the past 20 years is not too bad for a stalwart. As the company grows bigger it will become much harder to obtain the 15% annual growth in earnings. The past decade proves this point.Current Valuation of BHI(In Millions)Operations at BHI have been healthy excluding the poor operating results of 2009. Revenue has steadily increased every year except in 2009. Net income on the other hand has been sporadic. There has always been positive net income but it is up one year and down the next. Finally cash flow has pretty much remained constant except in the year of 2009. The average cash flow ratio is 5.64.The table above presents a few different key bits of information that need to be expounded upon. First it seems as if BHI is not overvalued, but it is also not extremely undervalued. Investors should not be buying this company for deep value. Before the announcement of a merger, the price of BHI's stock was around $48 per share. This equates out to a P/E ratio of 12.24. What this means is the price of the merger is currently being accounted for in the present share price. If the merger does not go through the price of BHI might fall, but there is the 3.5 billion break-up fee that will benefit the company. The explanation and positive benefits of the break-up fee will be examined later.Another piece of information that should be looked at is the total debt and total cash that BHI is sitting on. With 1.74 billion in cash and 4.13 billion in debt, BHI is in excellent standing. Last year the operating cash flow was 2.95 billion dollars. This easily can pay off all short term debt in the following year. Of course one must account for the fall in earnings this year due to low oil prices. But with the merger that is currently happening, it creates a protective barrier for shareholders. It's a win win situation if the merger is successful or if it's not due to the break-up fee.Thoughts on the Break-up FeeA $3.5 billion break-up fee is a very agreeable gift for BHI and shareholders. If the merger goes through shareholders will be rewarded with a 7.8% gain from today's prices plus HAL which may be undervalued (HAL will be evaluated in part two). If the merger does not happen with BHI and HAL, the $3.5 billion dollars can be used for an aggregate amount of purposes. BHI has one of the biggest insurance policies from this break-up fee in the whole oil sector if the price of oil keeps falling. The following explicate on the possible uses for the potential $3.5 billion break-up fee dollars.The break-up fee monetary amount is more than two years of profit for BHI. If this happens which is a possibility, shareholders will be rewarded substantially. One final note to mention is the price of BHI before the merger was announced. In early July of 2014, the share price for BHI was around $75 per share. If the merger does not go through and the break-up fee is paid, BHI should not fall, but they should rise in price. This is if the market is rational, which most of the times it acts irrationally. Either way the $3.5 billion is a great future benefit.Final RemarksAn investment operation is one which, upon thorough analysis promises safety of principal and an adequate return. Operations not meeting these requirements are speculative-Ben GrahamThese words are very valuable and can be used in our evaluation of BHI. Safety of principle presents itself in BHI in, not being highly leveraged, not overvalued, potential of merger, and the insurance policy of the $3.5 billion break-up fee. More of an analysis could be done on the business of BHI to bring one to a higher conviction of a buy, if needed. (There will be two more parts on the series of this merger that will present supplementary information for establishing a thesis). The analysis that is presented should be suitable for most investors.The next year or two will be challenging for the energy sector as a whole. Recently BHI announced that it will lay off 7,000 workers due to the supply glut that persists to stay in our global economy. Being a cash rich company that has went through a variety of global situations (Macondo, asbestos, the Iraq War, and other supply gluts) BHI will be able to withstand this current situation. The merger that could potentially happen is presents itself as very attractive to shareholders. In the event that the merger fails, BHI will be protected by a $3.5 billion dollar break-up fee. Conclusions that arise from this study follow in the form of capital gains from a merger or monetary benefits of a $3.5 billion break-up fee insurance policy and finally the potential of acquiring HAL at a significant discount. Part two of this three part study will determine if HAL is undervalued at current prices."

This is the natural result of the sudden sharp drop in oil prices. HAL shares fell 2.1% on the news, and BHI dropped 1.3%. But the iPath S&P Crude Oil Total Return Index ETN (NYSEARCA:OIL) fell by 5% on the day, so investors in HAL may be missing something. The shares of HAL have bounced off the bottom with oil prices and other oil services firms, but they may be missing the fact that a second shoe will drop as an impact of these events on earnings this year. That's why I think investors should prepare to hedge back their investments in the leading edge of the energy complex and look to the commodity itself, and take some risk off stocks like Halliburton ahead of potential earnings pre-announcements in Q1.1-Month HAL Chart at Seeking AlphaHAL shares have risen off their lows marked on the sharp drop of oil prices, and are now up 14.5%, despite Tuesday's drop of 2.1%. The gains have been in anticipation of oil price recovery, and have come along with the entire energy complex as oil has come off the bottom. The Market Vectors Oil Services ETF (NYSEARCA:OIH) is up 12.1% off its low, and the Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSEARCA:XLE) is up 11.4% from the bottom. The iPath S&P Crude Oil Total Return Index ETN is up 19.2% from the bottom.It's wise to buy into the major oil services firms ahead of any move upward in oil prices, as these will lead the complex higher. But at some point, and I think that point is now, these firms will have to lay off employees to manage costs against lighter revenue. I suspect it will be difficult to manage costs perfectly with revenue in such a dynamic environment, and given that it's unclear how long oil prices could stay this low.On Tuesday, February 10, Halliburton said it would lay off 5K to 6.5K more jobs beyond its planned consolidation on the Baker Hughes acquisition. That is 6.5% to 8.0% of its global workforce of 80,000 at risk, with no layoffs yet implemented. The news drove the stock down today, but oil prices fell as well and clouded the impact. In fact, oil prices fell greater than HAL, indicating that investors in the services sector may be missing the fact that two shoes will drop.A second shoe will drop when the company eventually reports earnings results affected by the drop in energy prices. At that point, investors will not want to have stakes in the stock, in my view. Though, earnings estimates for 2015 have already been cut to $2.15 from $4.82 90 days ago. The workforce cost reductions will help to stop the bleeding, but the risk of preannouncement exists ahead of earnings reports. First-quarter earnings estimates have been cut to $0.69 from $1.09.When buying into the leading edge of the energy complex on energy appreciation expectations, investors must keep in mind that two key issues will weigh on the ride higher. Workforce reduction announcements at the company itself will impact the stock, as will announcements at the companies of the customers of the name in question. Then, around the earnings report, there remains the risk of earnings warning preannouncement if earnings estimates do not properly account for the changes that have occurred. I've got my eye on energy now, so investors may want to follow my column."

        In my opinion, after the retreat in its stock price, it is now an excellent opportunity for a long-term investment in HAL's stock at a relatively cheap price.","On November 21, 2014, I wrote an article about Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) describing the company and recommending the stock. In this article, I will give some update information about the stock.On January 20, Halliburton reported its fourth-quarter 2014 financial results, which beat EPS expectations by $0.09 (8.18%). Halliburton has shown earnings per share surprise in four of the last five quarters, as shown in the table below.Data: Yahoo Finance - Analyst EstimatesHalliburton delivered industry-leading total company revenue growth and returns in 2014. HAL finished the year with revenues of nearly $33 billion and operating income of $5 billion. Both of which are new records for the company. Furthermore, Halliburton's trailing twelve months EPS growth has been the highest among all Oilfield Equipment & Services companies, trading in U.S. markets, which have a market cap greater than $5.0 billion, as shown in the table below.Data: Portfolio123Halliburton's past revenue and earnings growth have been impressive. However, what are the future growth prospects of the company, when HAL's customers are decreasing their capital expenditure budgets by an average of 25% to 30%? In order to try to give an answer, let's first look at oil prices.In my opinion, low oil prices are not sustainable, as I explained in my article about oil prices. Examining the chart below, it seems that WTI crude oil price reached a bottom $43.58 per barrel on January 29. Oil price climbed 24.5% to $54.24 per barrel on February 03, crossing over its 20 days simple moving average, and falling back to $51.96 on February 09, but still 19.2% above the bottom. Moreover, future contract for March 2016 is already 20.2% higher at $62.45 a barrel.WTI crude oil March 2015 leading contract, daily chart from October 2014.Charts: TradeStation Group, Inc.North America accounted to 53.8% of Halliburton's $17,698 million revenue in 2014, and to 62.5% of its $5,097 operating income. The North America rig count and activity levels held up with most of the fourth quarter as customers executed against the reminder of their 2014 budgets. However, according to Baker Hughes (BHI) latest figures from February 06, the North America total rig count has fallen by 100 rigs in the last week, and by 555 rigs in the last year to a total of 1,837 rigs, as shown in the chart below. According to Halliburton, this trajectory is similar to both the 2001-2002 cycle and the 2008-2009 cycle. And in those cases, we experienced a rapid correction to the rig count going from peak to trough over a three quarter period.Source: North America Rig CountHow this declining activity will affect Halliburton's revenue and earnings in the next few quarters? It is not easy to answer. According to the company, what is creating even more uncertainty with the service industry is that many customers have continued to revise down their capital budgets to further capital reduction announcements. This makes difficult to size the business in today's U.S. market, in particular because it is such a fast moving target. Halliburton also said that while it did not experience price weakness during the fourth quarter, price discount discussions with customers did begin in the fourth quarter and have accelerated over the last past several weeks and price reductions are now occurring across all product lines. Halliburton expects pricing concessions to be less severe when compared to previous cycles. That is because its margin improvement this cycle was largely driven by its focus on gaining efficiencies and getting increased labor input cost recovered more quickly, not through net pricing increases.In my view, Halliburton has a better chance to outperform its peers in this down cycle period. Halliburton has already taken initial steps to address headcount internationally, and it plans to make similar adjustments in North America as well. During the fourth quarter, the company took a $129 million restructuring charge as a first step in preparing for these market changes. According to the company, it has historically outperformed the market in North America during downturns periods.Halliburton said that it will continue to manufacture its Frac of the Future equipment and plans to take advantage of the opportunity to accelerate the retirement of older fleets which operate at a higher cost, especially in 24-hour operations. According to the company, the value it has seen from the rollout of its Q-10 pumps has truly exceeded its original expectations. Moreover, despite the current market conditions, it feels that it is the right decision for Halliburton's shareholders to move forward with this initiative.In addition, the combination of Halliburton and Baker Hughes will bring together two highly complementary suites of products and should help to boost margins and generate stronger cash returns for shareholders. The acquisition has been unanimously approved by the boards of both firms but remains subject to shareholder votes at both HAL and BHI, regulatory approvals, and customary closing conditions. The transaction is expected close in the second half of 2015.ValuationHAL's stock performed well in 2013, gaining 46.3%. However, since the beginning of 2014 the stock is down 14.3% while the S&P 500 index has increased 11.2%, and the Nasdaq Composite Index has risen 13.6%.

2903256,50792,2015-02-10T13:15:54-05:00,"The oil services industry has experienced months of losses due to falling oil prices and will offer rebound opportunities.Halliburton will be the top stock in this industry because it enters in a strong position and will emerge even stronger.A DCF valuation of the company’s finances show it is currently undervalued, further evidence it is a top idea for this market.According to the I Know First algorithm, the company will rebound in the short term, but the real long-term opportunity will not present itself until the end of the year.","Company InformationFounded in 1919, Halliburton Company (NYSE: HAL) is one of the world's largest providers of products and services to the energy industry. Halliburton provides energy services, engineering, and construction services, as well as manufactures products for the energy industry. The company offers services and products and integrated solutions to customers in the exploration, development, and production of oil and natural gas.Recent NewsIn the company's most recent earnings report, Halliburton reported total revenue of $32.9 billion for the full year of 2014, a 12% increase over 2013. The increased revenue was driven by growth in North America, with 16% revenue growth and 23% adjusted operating income growth compared to 2013.This growth was made possible by increased unconventional drilling activity in areas such as the Permian basin. Halliburton is the world's largest provider of hydraulic fracturing, a technique that blasts water, sand and chemicals underground to free trapped oil and natural gas. The US oil-and-gas industry focused on finding ways to get the most oil out of the shale formations it had, and the US became the world's largest energy producer.The increased production of oil led to a global supply glut, causing oil to fall nearly 60% since June, hitting five-year lows. The oil market and impact it had on companies in the energy sector was further examined in the Seeking Alpha article ""Oil Forecast For 2015 Based On A Predictive Algorithm"". While many oil and gas players have not provided their capital expenditure budgets for 2015, the companies that have, such as ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP), indicate they will scale back.The oil rig count has already begun to fall, as data from Baker Hughes, Inc. (NYSE: BHI) showed that the number of rigs in use last week in the US declined by 83 to 1,140. This is the lowest oil rig total since December 2011, and is down from a peak of 1,609 hit in October 2014, about a 30% drop.Figure 1. Source: Yahoo! FinanceHalliburton's stock has decreased over 40% since it peaked in June at about $74. The stock has also reacted negatively to the news that Halliburton will be purchasing its smaller rival Baker Hughes in a stock and cash deal, which values Baker Hughes' equity at $34.6 billion. Investors are concerned that Halliburton is overpaying to acquire its rival. The deal is expected to close in the second half of the year, subject to the approval of each company's stockholders, regulatory approvals, and customary closing conditions.Potential Rebound OpportunityDue to many of the market factors listed above, Halliburton and the oil services market in general has suffered over the last few months, and opportunities for investment in the sector will be available in the future. Of all the stocks in this market, Halliburton is especially attractive compared to its peers for a variety of reasons.For one, the company is entering the downturn caused by decreased oil prices from a position of strength. The company noted in its earnings release that it set revenue records for 12 of its 13 product lines in 2014. Certainly, the company finished 2014 in a solid financial position, delivering industry-leading total company revenue growth and returns compared to its primary peers.Halliburton also remains focused on driving strong results in the long-term, even amid short-term market issues. Its merger with Baker Hughes is part of this strategy and could lead to significant cost synergies. The two companies have significant overlap in their key product segments, including pressure pumping and completions, and similar geographic footprints. Halliburton estimates that the combined entity could yield annual cost synergies of about $2 billion by pruning corporate and administrative costs, optimizing R&D programs and improving organizational efficiencies.The integration of the two companies will also help its competitive position and market power. It will result in a better, more diverse company that will give value to shareholders. The company will be stronger, have a greater geographic presence and a depth of product offerings. The merger could also help close the gap between market leader Schlumberger Limited (NYSE: SLB). On a pro forma basis, the merged entity would have greater revenues than the market leader on a yearly basis.But Schlumberger's market cap of close to $110 billion is still roughly 70% ahead of Baker Hughes and Halliburton combined. This is most likely due to its higher margins as well as a higher earnings multiple due to its scale and competitive position. Schlumberger trades at an earnings multiple of over 15, while Halliburton and Baker Hughes trade at a multiple of about 11. Halliburton is discounted greatly here, then, as the stock is being traded below its actual value.This point is further emphasized when conducting a discounted cash flow (NYSE:DCF) analysis, which calculates a present value for the company by forecasting a company's future cash flows and using a proper discount rate. This intrinsic value can then be used in comparison to its market value to see whether the company is valued properly in the stock market. The future cash flow for Halliburton was forecasted using historical data, market analysis and predictions, and industry indexes.Figure 2 DCF analysis Source: I Know FirstOur DCF analysis found the company had a market value of $45,392,000, which is much higher than its market cap of $36,873,000. This shows that the company's stock price is being traded well below its actual value, in line with the earlier analysis of its earnings ratio compared to peers in its market.Analyst opinion tends to agree with this evaluation of the company. As can be seen in the figure below, 25 of the 33 analysts who have initiated a position on Halliburton on Yahoo! Finance gave the stock a rating of either Buy or Strong Buy, while only one gave the stock a rating of sell. The mean target price is $47.33, above where the stock is currently trading.Figure 3. Source: Yahoo! FinanceAlgorithmic Analysis: Is Now The Time To Invest?While fundamentals are very important, it can be quite advantageous to also consider stocks like Halliburton from an algorithmic perspective. Though algorithms, like any other methods of analysis, are not definitive, they often contribute important information about a company, especially when viewed in combination with historical trends and fundamentals.I Know First is a financial services firm that utilizes an advanced algorithm based on artificial intelligence and machine learning to predict market performance for over 2,000 markets including stock forecasts, world indices, commodities, interest rates, ETFs, and currencies. The system follows the flow of money from one market into another.The new one-month forecast for Halliburton, generated by the I Know First algorithm and updated on February 8th, is shown below. The dark green signifies a strong bullish signal for the stock. Each compartment contains two numbers: the strength of the signal itself (represented by the number in the middle of each box, to the right), and its predictability (found in the bottom left corner, this is the approximate level of confidence our service has in the forecast).Figure 4 I Know First One Month Forecast. Source: I Know FirstIt is important to note that the signal strength is not a target price move or percentage change, but just the strength of the signal. A signal strength of 26.94 is large enough to be significant.The bullish forecast for Halliburton makes sense for the one-month time period, considering some short-term bullish conditions for oil prices in the market. Unrest in Libya, strong US growth, and US oil rig count declines caused oil prices to surge over the past few weeks, with Brent reaching a 6-week high of just under $60.The better than expected growth and declining oil rigs might paint a pretty picture, but oil is not out of the woods yet. The oversupply glut still remains in the market, and a recovery in oil prices now is far from certain. For one, the falling oil rig count in the US is taking place mostly in smaller shale fields, not the large ones where most of the production comes from. And production in places like Russia is at all time highs, while member of OPEC fight to maintain their market share.The recent surge in oil is most likely just a head fake, as the commodity is likely to remain priced below $60 for at least the first half of the year. Some, such as Citigroup, believe oil will fall much further, reaching new lows before it recovers. The one-year forecast for Halliburton is extremely bearish, signified by the dark red.Figure 5 I Know First 12 Months Forecast. Source: I Know FirstThe algorithm predicts that Halliburton's stock, with a signal of -42.31 for the year, will fall some point after the one-month time period, in which it is predicted to increase. This could be during the first-quarter earnings report, when the effects of falling oil prices might be felt in the balance sheet for the first time.CEO David Lesar was pretty open with investors during the recent earnings call that the company sees pain ahead in 2015. While activity levels were strong in the fourth quarter of 2014 to drive their results, the industry has slowed down so far in 2015. Lesar expects this slowdown to continue, as customers have reduced spending plans by 25-30% compared to last year.The slowdown and falling rig count is likely to mean decreasing margins for Halliburton. While prices remained high last quarter, discussions began about price discounts and those discussions have accelerated in the past month. These price reductions are now occurring across all of the company's product lines.Lesar also noted that the first quarter of any downturn is the hardest to predict, as pricing concessions affect results in real time. The company's customers can change rig plans almost daily making volume declines very erratic. Halliburton expects to see most of its margin degradation occurring over the first couple of quarters, and more margin stability over the second half of the year.ConclusionWith the oil services market struggling over the last few months in general, opportunities will eventually be available for investors to cash in on the subsequent rebound in prices. Halliburton is the greatest of these opportunities, as the company is entering the downturn in a position of strength and hopes to emerge fundamentally stronger through the purchase of Baker Hughes. The company is also currently undervalued, especially when compared to its peer Schlumberger. Having established the company as a strong pick to invest in for the rebound, understanding when the rebound will occur is vital. While the stock may increase in the next month because of falling rig counts, the company expects to see pain in North America, where much of its growth is driven, in 2015. I Know First's algorithmic analysis concurs with this prediction. But when the market does actually begin to recover, which should start in earnest during the end of the fiscal year, Halliburton will offer immense reward to investors.I Know First Research is the analytic branch of I Know First, a financial startup company that specializes in quantitatively predicting the stock market.

Prices may go down a bit more as Saudi Arabia presses its advantage against Iran and ISIS, which recently lost Kobane in Syria and has abandoned oil for its old business model of ransom. They might remain low for months, despite Russia's efforts to raise them with its ongoing Ukraine invasion, or the continuing disintegration of Libya and Nigeria.But fracked wells deplete fast. Wells are being completed now without being fracked, meaning that production is being held in abeyance. Gulf wells will come in, and bankers will insist that other wells be pumped to pay back loans, but U.S. production is going to roll over within months and start falling, slowly eliminating the current glut. It may not look like it, and we're all going to deny it, but Texas has joined OPEC.The world remains on a war footing, but there is going to be a break in the tension somewhere. Once that break happens, in the form of either falling production or a military victory, the people in charge of the oil business will be the tech people. That's Halliburton.Those who are speculating in Baker Hughes (BHI) instead, expecting a quick pop on its acquisition or a cash out on the failure, have a good argument. The company is wisely laying off people and calling 2015 a ""tough"" year. I just find Halliburton an easier bet - layoffs are being concentrated at BHI, which will be at a disadvantage if for some reason Halliburton backs away.I expect Halliburton stock to go nowhere fast, but I do expect it to pick up steam as the price of oil gets closer to its extraction costs. Anyone, anywhere in the world, who wants to extract oil needs the technology Halliburton supplies, so any foreign policy gains go straight to its account. This is true whether you're talking about Venezuela, Russia, Iraq or Whiting Petroleum (NYSE:WLL) in North Dakota. The merger will give Halliburton a virtual monopoly in many areas, and only the current market weakness is allowing it to go through.I am guessing that the 2015 weakness is already in the stock. At current prices, you're paying a Price/Earnings multiple of 10.3 based on last year's earnings, maybe 15 based on this year's. Unlike oil producers, Halliburton isn't going to be borrowing additional money, and its debt-to-assets ratio should remain steady at 25%. Operating cash flow should drop from last year's $4.2 billion, but with less financing and investing on the horizon overall cash flow should be a wash.Lots of people are dumping on the oil patch, and this oil services stock, right now. I'll get out when they change their tune. That might be a good time to get into Microsoft."
2857006,25791,2015-01-28T04:57:47-05:00,,"By Marjorie ChurginAmidst a sharp fall in oil prices and roiling oil markets, oil services company Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) announced strong quarterly earnings, with solid Q4 revenue of $8.8 B, up 15 percent compared to the same quarter last year. Net earnings at $900 million were also strong, an increase from $770 million Q4 2013.Despite this strong Q4 performance, oil market fundamentals have changed substantially with the recent plunge in oil prices. Halliburton, which assists drilling firms in setting up oil wells, expects operators to cut capital expenditures, resulting in lower revenue from reduced activity and pricing cuts. If the price of oil stays lower for a sustained period of time, the company will have a difficult time staying ahead of the curve by cutting costs, resulting in lower or negative revenue growth.Halliburton has announced a merger with Baker Hughes Incorporated (BHI), one of the top oil service companies in the world, which will result in a company to rival Schlumberger in size.This earnings release follows the earnings announcements from the following peers of Halliburton Company - Schlumberger NV (NYSE:SLB) and Baker Hughes Incorporated (BHI).See our analysis of Schlumberger NV (Schlumberger: Oil Services Revenues Up Not Earnings) and Baker Hughes Incorporated (Baker Hughes: Beats Estimates Despite Oil Slump).HighlightsThe table below shows the preliminary results and recent trends for key metrics such as revenues and net income growth:Market Share Versus ProfitsCompanies sometimes focus on market share at the expense of profits or earnings growth.Revenues TrendEarnings TrendCompared to the same quarter last year, Halliburton's change in revenue trailed its change in earnings, which was 16.9 percent. The company's performance this period suggests a focus on boosting bottom-line earnings. It is important to note that the quarterly change in revenue was among the highest in the peer group thus far. Also, for comparison purposes, revenue changed by 0.8 percent and earnings by -20.8 percent compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2014.Revenues vs EarningsCash Versus Earnings - Sustainable Performance?Halliburton's year-on-year change in operating cash flow of -39.5 percent trailed its change in earnings. This leads CapitalCube to question whether the earnings number might have been achieved from some unlocking of accruals. On a positive note, the increase in operating cash flow was better than the average announced thus far by its peer group.Operating Cash Flow Growth vs Earnings GrowthMarginsThe company's operating (EBIT) margins contracted from 15.5 percent to 14.8 percent. In spite of this, the company's earnings rose. This was influenced primarily by one-time items, which improved pretax margins from 13.6 percent to 14.1 percent.EBIT Margin vs Pretax Margin"
2839936,40351,2015-01-22T07:47:04-05:00,Halliburton released is first quarter results that were better than market’s expectations.The company’s revenue growth from North America was flat sequentially and operating margins in its key markets continued to improve.This was anticipated in the original article.,"On Tuesday, Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) released its fourth quarter results in which the company's revenues and net income climbed by 14.8% and 13.6% from the same quarter last year to $8.77 billion and $901 million, respectively. The company also incurred a $129 million restructuring charge and a $19 million Baker Hughes (BHI) acquisition related expense. Excluding these, the company's earnings clocked in at $1.19 a share, which was better than market's estimates of $1.10. As anticipated in the original article, Halliburton's revenues from North America were flat sequentially. The company generated 54% of its total revenues from this region. On the other hand, Halliburton's revenues increased by 2.8% in Latin America, dropped by 8.1% in EAC (Europe/Africa/CIS) and increased by 10.4% in the Middle East/Asia. Overall, Halliburton's revenues were flat sequentially.On the profitability front, the company's operating margins in North America and Middle East/Asia region came in at 18.8% and 18.9% respectively. This compares against North America's margins of 16.8% in the same quarter last year and 19.2% in the previous quarter. Although Halliburton's North America margins have dropped sequentially, this was due to the impact of one-off items. Excluding those, operating margins were 19.4%. In 2014, Halliburton has reported sequential improvements in North America margins in every quarter. Similarly, for Middle East/Asia, the company's adjusted margins in the fourth quarter came in at 20.8%, an improvement from 17.8% in the third quarter and 17.3% in the prior year. In short, as mentioned in the original article, Halliburton continues to impress with profitability in two of its biggest markets.On the other hand, while I was expecting additional details, Halliburton did not provide any specific figures on the layoffs. The issue did not take center stage. In fact, management spent less than a minute in the conference call discussing the possibility of additional job cuts. However, in a few sentences, the company's President Jeff Miller said that Halliburton has ""already taken initial steps to address headcount internationally"" - referring to the job cuts announced for the Eastern Hemisphere - and will make ""similar adjustments"" in North America as well as drilling activity begins to fall more sharply. Moreover, through the end of the fourth quarter, Miller said that the company will make ""headcount adjustments"" that will be in line with its ""primary competitors."" Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB), Halliburton's biggest competitor, has laid-off 9,000 workers while Baker Hughes has said that it plans to eliminate 7,000 jobs. Therefore, I believe Halliburton will make a similar announcement on job cuts in the next two months."
2839246,54312,2015-01-22T01:28:51-05:00,Halliburton announced strong financial results.The company's outlook is muted.Buying stock in a depressed business environment would not be a wise idea.,"Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) announced very strong financial results for the fiscal 2014. The company generated record revenue growth of 12% to $32.9B, an increase of $3.5B from the past year. In addition, the company had converted strong revenue growth into higher earnings with its cost-cutting and efficient management strategies. For the full year, the company's adjusted income was standing at $3.4B or $4.02 per diluted share compared to $2.8B or $3.15 per diluted share in the past year.In my recent articles, I recommended investors to buy Halliburton shares at any attractive entry points as the company was set to generate big profits. Its recent results affirmed my prediction that the company's innovative products and technologies along with its extensive global footprint allowed it to generate hefty profits. However, an unexpected fall in the oil prices raised a lot of concerns on its future growth. At present, oil is trading well-below $50 per barrel. At current prices, most of the U.S. oil producers are declining their future investments along with closing their existing plants.Moreover, largest oil-producing countries including Saudi Arabia, Qatar and other Middle East countries are not looking to lower their production level. This represents that the oil price are not going back to $100 in the short term. And, most of the U.S. oil producers need oil price around $80/barrel to remain profitable, and it appears that OPEC producers are not considering declining their production level to maintain a balance between supply and demand. In such circumstances, demand for the products and services of oil field services companies are likely to decline. Halliburton has also indicated muted outlook for this year.Amid all this, Halliburton's extensive global footprint would allow it to bear depressed business circumstances. The company is working on merger with Baker Hughes, which I believe will further expand its revenue base. On the negative side, this merger could adversely impact its financial performance and cash balance if the oil prices do not climb back in the range of $60-$70 per barrel. In my opinion, I am not seeing oil prices back at $70 per barrel in the coming six or eight months as Arab countries are comfortable selling oil at lower prices and keeping their monopoly in the market. I think buying Halliburton in a current situation would not be a wise idea."
2870856,22148,2015-02-01T02:23:56-05:00,The massive declines in the oil services stocks will eventually present rebound opportunities.The larger declines and valuation gap makes Halliburton a top candidate for the biggest rebound.The merger with Baker Hughes presents extra opportunities to close the valuation gap and double the stock rebound during the next bullish oil services cycle.,"The recent downturn in the oil services stocks provides some opportunity for investing in the sector for a future rebound. Besides this potential rebound, Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) and the pending merger with Baker Hughes (BHI) provides even more upside from large-scale synergy savings and value creation to match industry giant Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB).Halliburton recently supplied the market Q4 results that solidly beat analyst estimates. Along with the big beat from Baker Hughes, Halliburton appears set up for a run for the valuation multiple of Schlumberger. The market continues to sell it off harder than the sector leader due to a larger focus on North America. Does this provide Halliburton investors with the potential for a doubly rewarding rebound?North America LeaderWith the drilling slowdown centered in the U.S. shale drilling segment, it naturally doesn't help to have a business focused on the area. The previous research focused on how Halliburton generated more revenue from North America than Schlumberger during Q2. That advantage has quickly become a negative.For 2014, Halliburton saw North America revenue surge 16% while adjusted operating income in the region jumped 23%. This compared to a more modest Eastern Hemisphere growth of around 10%. For Q4, North America revenue of $4.7 billion was roughly 53% of total revenue of $8.8 billion. Operating income from North America of $888 million more than doubled the second most important region in Middle East/Asia of only $306 million.Schlumberger has a nearly opposite profile with international revenue accounting for roughly 66% of 2014 revenue. It has a relatively smaller revenue base in North America of around $16 billion in annual revenues, but the international business swamps that of Halliburton with annual revenues of $32.1 billion.Clearly, this international scale is valued by the markets along with the higher operating margins of 23.9% achieved in that sector is what drives the higher valuation for Schlumberger. Halliburton hopes the Baker Hughes transaction and related synergies helps bridge the valuation gap. The only issue is that Baker Hughes has a similar domestic profile though it does add scale outside North America.Baker Hughes SynergiesThe deal announced back in October involves the second largest oil services firm buying the third largest in order to create a giant that is competitive with Schlumberger. Without any divestitures, the deal actually makes the new Halliburton a larger company with the $32.9 billion from itself and $24.6 billion from Baker Hughes producing a company with $57.5 billion in total revenue. For 2014, Schlumberger had $48.2 billion in annual revenue.The next section will cover how the valuations for Halliburton and Baker Hughes are far below Schlumberger. This section discusses the potential $2 billion in annual synergies from the merger.A big portion of the synergies come from the U.S. where Baker Hughes has a lower operating margin than that achieved by Halliburton. In fact, the company suggests a nearly 700 basis point difference leads to an $800 million opportunity alone.A lot of the other savings will involve reducing redundant offices around the world along with support personnel no longer needed from combining offices and administrative services.To grasp the value of $2 billion in annual savings, Halliburton only generated $5.1 billion in operating income for all of 2014. Total income was only $3.4 billion so this amounts to a substantial boost to income.Valuation MismatchManagement hopes that the improved margins from $2 billion in synergy savings will help close the valuation multiple gap. As highlighted in the original article on Halliburton, a large gap already existed even prior to the recent sector crash that has hit Halliburton harder than Schlumberger.Using a standard P/S multiple, Schlumberger has kept a relatively steady multiple of roughly double of the other industry players.HAL PS Ratio (TTM) data by YChartsOutside of Baker Hughes due to the merger premium, Schlumberger is also more valued based on each dollar of forecasted earnings. Over the last year, the valuation gap based on the forward earnings estimate has been consistently larger.HAL PE Ratio (Forward 1y) data by YChartsTakeawayThe recent market crash in the oil services sector gives investors an opportunity to play sector stocks for a rebound. In the case of Halliburton, the rebound potential is doubly rewarding with not only a hopeful remand in earning, but also an increase in valuation metrics from the merger with Baker Hughes helping to close the multiple gap. Halliburton is the stock to play any rebound in the sector."

        Earnings per share beat expectations, but revenue fell just short.
        Generated $150 million in free cash flow.
        Returned $152 million to shareholders via dividends.
        The stock has reacted by rising over 2%.","Halliburton (NYSE: HAL), one of the world's leading providers of products and services to the energy industry, released fourth quarter earnings this morning, with earnings per share beating expectations and revenue falling just short, and its stock has responded by rising over 2%; let's take a closer look at the quarterly results to determine if we should consider initiating long-term positions in Halliburton today or if we should wait for a better entry point in the weeks ahead instead.Breaking Down The Quarterly ReportHere's a summary of Halliburton's fourth quarter earnings compared to what analysts had expected and its results in the fourth quarter a year ago:Halliburton's adjusted earnings per share increased 28% and its revenue increased 14.8% compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013; these results were driven by revenue increasing 29.5% to $991 million in its Completion and Production segment, but were held back by revenues declining 18.1% to $408 million in its Drilling and Evaluation segment. Here's a breakdown of the company's revenues and revenue growth by region (in millions):For the quarter, Halliburton's reported operating profit increased 13.5% to $1,299 million and its operating margin took a slight hit, contracting 20 basis points to 14.8%. However, excluding certain restructuring and acquisition-related charges, Halliburton's operating profit increased 22.3% to $1,445 million and its operating margin expanded 100 basis points to 16.5%.Lastly, Halliburton generated $1,149 million in cash flows from operating activities and invested $999 million in capital expenditures, resulting in $150 million of free cash flow; the company utilized this free cash, and the $2,029 million in cash and cash equivalents on its balance sheet to begin the quarter, to pay out a quarterly dividend of $0.18 for a total cost of approximately $152 million. Halliburton ended the quarter with $2,291 million in cash and cash equivalents, so it is well positioned to engage in share repurchase activity and raise its dividend in fiscal 2015.Should You Invest In Halliburton Today?Halliburton is one of the leading providers of products and services to the world's energy industry, and increased demand, primarily in North America, the Middle East, and Asia, led it to a very strong fourth quarter performance; the company reported double-digit year-over-year growth in earnings per share, revenue, and operating profit, while generating $150 million in free cash flow and paying out $152 million in dividends, and its stock has responded by rising over 2%.Even after this slight post-earnings pop in Halliburton's stock, I think it represents a great long-term buying opportunity, because it trades at attractive valuations, including just 10 times fiscal 2014's full year adjusted earnings per share of $4.02. Furthermore, I think the pending acquisition of Baker Hughes (NYSE: BHI) and the projected cost synergies will create one of the most efficient companies the industry has ever seen, and it will lead to immense profitability. Lastly, the company pays an annual dividend of $0.72 per share, giving its stock a respectable yield of approximately 1.8% at current levels and adding to the long-term growth potential of an investment.With all of this information in mind, I think Halliburton represents one of the best investment opportunities in the energy industry today, so long-term investors should take a closer look and consider initiating positions in the days ahead."
2827436,40351,2015-01-16T15:54:58-05:00,"Schlumberger has set the tone for the results of oilfield services companies.Halliburton will release its results on Tuesday, in which the impact of lower oil prices will take center stage.The company has already announced 1,000 layoffs and more could follow.The company will struggle with sequential revenue growth, Goldman Sachs predicted, while earnings could also come under pressure.","Oilfield services companies face significant headwinds from the weakness in oil prices. This became apparent when Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB), the world's leading oilfield services company, reported its fourth-quarter results on Wednesday. The company revealed that it has laid off 9,000 workers, slashing its total global workforce by 7% in late 2014. The company also took additional charges of $1 billion to its results, including $300 million related to the layoffs. Excluding the one-off charges, however, the company's profits clocked in at $1.50 a share as compared to $1.35 a share in the corresponding period a year earlier.In a nutshell, although the results were mixed, they also set a grim tone for the future in which energy companies are bracing for a challenging market. Focus has now shifted to Halliburton (NYSE:HAL), the second biggest player in the industry, which will release its fourth quarter results when the markets open on Tuesday, Jan. 20.Halliburton, however, has already warned its employees about the impending job cuts. The company is expected to eliminate 1,000 jobs in the Eastern Hemisphere due to the plummeting crude prices. It also said that it will book restructuring charges of around $75 million in its fourth-quarter results. This update was followed by an email from the company's CEO Dave Lesar in which he warned about the possibility of additional job cuts in 2015 due to the sharp drop in oil prices. Lesar also said that the job reductions were not related to its acquisition of Baker Hughes (BHI), the third biggest player in the industry. A couple of days ago, Halliburton also said that it has cut an unspecified number of jobs in Houston. It won't be surprising if the job cuts, and the restructuring charges related to the market conditions, take center stage when Halliburton reports its fourth-quarter results.As for top-line growth, in a recent report emailed to me, Goldman Sachs's analyst Waqar Syed predicted that Halliburton will struggle with sequential growth in its key markets. The company's revenues from North America, Middle East/Asia, and EAC (Europe/Africa/CIS) regions will be flat from the previous quarter. Together, the three regions were responsible for 88% of the company's total revenues in the first nine months of 2014. Unlike Schlumberger, which gets a majority of its revenues from outside of North America, Halliburton generated 54% of its revenues from this region. As for Latin America, which makes the smallest contribution to Halliburton's top line, revenues could grow by between 1% and 2% sequentially, Syed predicted.That said, the flat sequential revenues from North America should not be a major concern. Halliburton has a history of reporting lower revenues in the fourth quarter as compared to the third quarter, as we have seen over the last two years.For North America, the operating income will also be flat sequentially. The company's operating margin in the Middle East/Asia region could approach 20% from 17.8% in the third quarter. In other words, Halliburton will report strong margins in two of its most profitable markets. On the other hand, the EAC segment will struggle due to a poor performance from Russia, Norway, and West Africa. Consequently, EAC's the operating margin could drop to as low as 10.1%, from 14.8% in the third quarter. In Latin America, the margins will remain in the low double-digit range.Halliburton's fourth-quarter EPS could clock in at $1.09 a share, as per Goldman Sachs' estimate, which is slightly lower than analysts' consensus estimate of $1.10 a share as per data compiled by Thomson Reuters. Goldman Sachs has lowered its estimate from $1.13 a share due to the weakness in the market.It will also be interesting to see how Halliburton's $35 billion merger with Baker Hughes pans out in this low oil price environment. Halliburton expects the deal to close by mid-2015. This could make Halliburton the biggest oilfield services company, in terms of 2014 revenues, a market leader in North America and the second biggest player in the rest of the world. Analysts have said that although the deal faces significant risk of being blocked by regulators, there is still a 75% chance of success. Due to the lengthy regulatory review and integration process, however, investors won't see any meaningful benefit of the merger until the next two to three years.Bottom LineLike Schlumberger, Halliburton's quarterly results will be focused on the impact of plunging oil prices. The company's revenues from its key markets in the fourth quarter will be largely flat from the third quarter. The company will continue to post strong operating margins in North America and Middle East/Asia, but its bottom line may come under pressure due to restructuring and other one-off charges."
2835786,39551,2015-01-21T07:04:42-05:00,"Halliburton reported strong quarterly results.Unlike its peers, the company plans to keep capex flat.I continue to believe that HAL will emerge stronger from the downturn, with greater market share.","As I predicted in my last article about Halliburton (NYSE:HAL), the company reported solid quarterly results. It reported adjusted 4Q14 EPS of $1.19 beating Street estimates of $1.10 by 8%. Both EBITDA and operating income came in better than expected. On the other hand, the reported revenue of $8.8 billion was in line with consensus estimates. Similarly all regions reported in-line revenue except Middle East, which posted a solid growth of 10% in revenue and 20.8% operating margins.Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) also reported better than expected results last week but the company also cut its capex by $1.0 billion. Halliburton, on the other hand, has announced to keep its capex flat. The company intends to use the downturn to accelerate its Frac of the Future initiative, and increase its more efficient Q10 pumps from 30% of its fleet today to 50% by the end of the year. As I mentioned in my previous article, Halliburton has already established itself as a low cost North American service provider. These new efforts should further strengthen the company's position and help it to take share from the smaller players that are unable to operate profitably in downturn.Similar to its peer SLB, HAL refrained from providing detailed guidance beyond 1Q15 as both companies remain unsure about the depth and the length of the downturn. The company, nonetheless, acknowledged that 2015 will be a challenging year and booked a restructuring charge of $129 million during the last quarter.I believe we will see a more material impact on the earnings of Halliburton in 2Q15 and 3Q15, as oil prices decline has historically impacted service companies' results on a two to three quarters lag. Despite my cautious view on 2Q15 and 3Q15 earnings, I believe HAL will emerge strong from the current downturn. Halliburton, similar to previous downturns should be able to take market share from smaller players who cannot operate profitably in a downturn. The company, post downturn, should emerge stronger with a greater North American share than pre-downturn.Halliburton's merger with Baker Hughes (BHI) should also allow the company to narrow its valuation gap with Schlumberger. While I believe the merger, which will make HAL the biggest oilfield services company on sales, will face antitrust hurdles, I also think the Department of Justice's approval of the acquisition is more likely during a downturn. The downturn will push the U.S. service market from highly utilized to overcapacity and make it harder for the opponents of the deal to argue that greater market share will translate into pricing power. I maintain my bullish view on the stock."
2835486,50582,2015-01-21T04:03:43-05:00,HAL reported fiscal fourth quarter results.The results don’t help much in terms of helping you figure out the long-term future.The results were almost exactly in-line with my lowered expectations.,"In my first Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) article on Dec. 7 entitled Halliburton Analysts Must Be Crazy: Accumulate I gave HAL analysts heat for estimating at the time average EPS of $1.20 for the fourth quarter. I had stated among other things,Then in a follow-up article entitled Update: Halliburton's Fourth Quarter To Take A Bite And Not Really From Cheap Oil just three days later, I mentioned that CFO Mark McCollum gave a warning during a presentation. He stated HAL management is seeing ""a bit more weather and holiday impact"" than they thought which would weaken fourth quarter results a bit more than anticipated. I concluded, ""I no longer am excited about a fourth quarter earnings beat and am in fact concerned it could actually miss a little.""HAL earnings are now out. Analysts nearly nailed the revenue figure of $8.77 billion compared to $8.78 billion in estimates. Adjusted earnings per share were $1.19, well ahead of the $1.10 estimate, but right in line with my own expectations that HAL would ""miss a little"" of the-then $1.20 estimate. Basically analysts got the bottom line net profit margins wrong. I still say analysts were nuts to expect a drag on earnings with modestly up revenue considering all of the factors outlined in my original article.Going forward, CEO Dave Lesar had little to say about the future. He reminded everybody that HAL has successfully weathered many cycles before, and he believes HAL will emerge a stronger company once again. Other than that, he seemed just as clueless as the rest of us how long this cycle will last, where and when it will bottom, and what the next cycle might look like.How does one invest in HAL based on that? I've stated before, and I'll state it again: HAL may very well prove to be cheap at these levels for the very long term, but for those of us interested in trying to handicap 2015 it is very difficult. With HAL management vantage point of the inside of the company seeming to have no clear vision into the next year, how are we investors on the outside of the company supposed to figure it out?"
2777565,24787,2014-12-23T18:18:54-05:00,"Although Halliburton reduced its share count by 8.61% between 2012 and 2013, shareholders shouldn't expect significant buybacks going forward.Even without buybacks, Halliburton is an attractive stock after dropping from the $70s this summer to a little over $40 now.The company is growing profits 25% in its Latin American segment, and that should propel significant profit growth in the coming years.","For most of Halliburton's (NYSE:HAL) corporate existence, a stock buyback was not a part of the company's wealth-building story. Between 1998 and 2012, Halliburton's share count actually rose from 880 million shares outstanding to 929 million to dilute shareholders by 5.56% over most of the past generation.That pattern of mild share count dilution changed during the 2012-2013 period when Halliburton began a series of Dutch-auction tender offers in which it sought to remove a substantial black of the company's common stock. During the twelve-month period from 2012 through 2013, Halliburton managed to retire 80 million shares of its stock and reduce the share count from 929 million to 849 million for a reduction of 8.61% of the common stock over the course of just one year.This had an exaggerated effect on boosting the company's performance; Halliburton only grew its profits from $2.58 billion in 2012 to $2.7 billion in 2013 for a gain of 6%. However, because of the share count reduction via buybacks, Halliburton actually appeared to be delivering double-digit growth to the combination of 6% organic growth plus the 8.61% reduction in share count through the stock buybacks.There is nothing wrong with this; however, it is important to distinguish between one-time events and long-term strategies. Companies like Exxon (NYSE:XOM), IBM (NYSE:IBM), and Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) have perpetual stock buyback programs in place that constantly reduce the share count by a meaningful amount, year after year, and investors can factor that into their analysis with the companies. In the case of the Halliburton buyback, the significant 2012-2013 stock repurchase was a one-time event and your analysis of the company going forward should reflect that (i.e., Halliburton has only reduced its share count from 849 million to 847 million over the course of 2014, for a share count decline of 0.23%).Now, for the important caveat: Just because Halliburton is not continuing to buy back a significant amount of its stock does not mean that it is a bad investment here at $40 per share. In fact, with the stock having declined from the mid-summer high of $74 per share, now is a good time to investigate whether that decline offers a good opportunity for someone to make a value investment.When I begin any analysis of a company in the energy sector, the first question I ask myself is this: Does the company have a conservatively managed balance sheet? I am not interested in investment opportunities that come with significant wipeout risk. The way to guard against that in the oil industry is to avoid debt-laden companies that could go bankrupt if oil prices fell for a significant period of time or would get merged into a more solvent competitor for pennies on the dollar.What impresses me about Halliburton is that the company only carries $7.8 billion in long-term debt, with only $1.5 billion of it due in the next five years (and most of it is at interest rates below 5%). It makes about $3.4 billion in net profit per year, so to get a gauge on the company's debt picture, it amounts to only two years of net profits, which is impressive for a company operating in the production and drilling industry, which is capital intensive.The other thing to note about Halliburton's business model is that the company earns very attractive returns on its retained profits. It only pays out a dividend of $0.72 annually while making $4.05 in total profits. With the payout ratio at only 17% of profits, the dividend is safe, and also demonstrates how well Halliburton handles its retained profits. The company earns returns of 22% on retained profits, and because the company retains such a high percentage of its profits, it comes as little surprise that Halliburton has managed to grow profits by 29.5% annually over the past ten years. This impressive business performance often goes unnoticed in much financial commentary because Halliburton only raises its dividend by 5% annually, and it is easy to overlook businesses in which the profit growth rate significantly outstrips the dividend growth rate.What is very interesting about this company is that profits in the Latin American division are expected to grow at over 25% annually for the next four or five years. The current valuation of 10x profits is the cheapest Halliburton has been since the financial crisis, and the current quotation of $40 is attractive because Halliburton is expected to grow its overall profits by around 10% in the coming years (though that figure would come down to 6% if the price of oil stayed around $50 per barrel for a few years).But Halliburton is one of those examples of a company that can grow long-term profits even if the price of oil languishes, and provides a good risk-reward trade-off because of its strong balance sheet. Even though the company's stock buyback is no longer an important driver of earnings per share growth, Halliburton can still be an attractive investment because of the company's current valuation and the likelihood that profits will grow 6%-10% in coming years, depending on the vicissitudes of oil prices in the coming years."

On a per share basis, net income was announced at $4.11.Analysts are expecting $0.77 as EPS for the first quarter of 2015, with a drastic drop in EPS for the year to $2.55.","Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) reported its fourth-quarter and full-year earnings on Jan. 20, 2015. The oilfield service company was able to deliver growth in revenues on a yearly basis on the back of increase in rig activity, especially during the fourth quarter of the year ended 2014. The company also beat analyst consensus estimates for earnings per share during the quarter and the full year. However, there are concerns about how oil price volatility will weigh down the financials of the company, especially as the year progresses forward.Fourth quarter earnings reviewHalliburton reported its revenues at $8.77 billion for the fourth quarter, up 14.8% year on year from revenues of $7.64 billion reported in the year-ago quarter. Revenue growth remained flat on a sequential basis. Yearly growth in revenues took place during the quarter as rig count surged during the period. The number of wells accounted for during the quarter increased to 9,544. Sequential revenue growth remained flat mainly due to flat onshore well count in the U.S. and a 1% sequential increase in the average U.S. rig count.Given that Halliburton secures 54% of its revenues from North America, it is not surprising to see sluggish growth in revenues on a monthly basis. Revenues from other geographical segments were mixed. Latin American revenues registered a 5% year-on-year increase, with nearly 3% sequential growth. Revenues from Europe/Africa/CIS showcased a slowdown on an annual and sequential basis, declining by nearly 4% and 8%, respectively. Middle East/Asia saw growth in their revenues on an annual and sequential basis, recording growth of 15% and 10%, respectively.Total operating income of the company amounted to $1.299 billion during the quarter, which was up by 13.5% annually. Operating income declined by nearly 20% on a sequential basis. The company's income from continuing operations amounted to $1 billion. On a per share basis, this translated into income of $1.19 per share. Halliburton was able to beat analyst consensus estimates in this regard, who were expecting earnings per share at $1.09. The fourth quarter saw the company incur $129 million in restructuring charges in order to gear it up for the challenging 2015 that the company is headed into.Full-year earnings reviewRevenues in 2014 showcased exemplary growth. Halliburton was able to generate $32.87 billion in revenues during the year, which was up by 11.8% from the $29.40 billion in revenues reported during 2013. With the exception of Latin America, Halliburton's operations in all other regions recorded growth in their revenues. North America took the lead and reported a 16% rise in its revenues for 2014. Europe/Africa/CIS revenues increased by 5%, while those of Middle East/Asia increased by nearly 15%. Revenues from Latin America lacked luster down by nearly 1%.The increase in revenues trickled down to the operating income of $5.097 billion, which surged by 62% over the operating income reported the year prior to that. Halliburton was successfully able to expand its margins during the year as well. Operating margin for 2014 was 15.5%, an impressive improvement from the 10.6% margin recorded in 2013.The company was also able to increase its net income. Net income for the year was reported at $3.5 billion; up by 64.7% from the net income of $2.125 billion reported in 2013. On a per share basis, net income was announced at $4.11. This was 74% higher than the earnings per share of $2.37 reported in 2013. Moreover, Halliburton was able to beat analyst consensus who were expecting earnings per share for the year at $3.93.Challenges and opportunities in 2015As oil price volatility continues, the sequential slowdown in revenues from North America could likely continue on into 2015 as well. While Halliburton was safe from oil price declines eating into their revenues during the year, there are several negative catalysts which lead to the belief that the Halliburton could sign fewer contracts during this year.The main feature of the oil industry during 2015 is a reduction in capex expenditure. With a 30%-40% reduction in capex budgets expected in the North American region alone, it has been witnessed that oil producers are also cutting back on rig counts. Rig count in the US has declined by 74 rigs in a span of seven days, according to Baker Hughes. Such declines are expected to accelerate during the course of the year, suggesting that fewer services might be required from Halliburton during 2015. While existing contracts might not be subject to changes during the year, the current oil price environment does not bode well for new contracts that are to be signed and contracts that may have to be renewed during the year. With E&P companies now in better bargaining position to dictate rates of contracts, upside to revenue growth from new contracts may be limited.As these challenges have surfaced, analysts have also been conservative in their consensus estimates for earnings in the upcoming quarter and full year as well. Analysts are expecting $0.77 as EPS for the first quarter of 2015, with a drastic drop in EPS for the year to $2.55.While the current operating environment proves to be challenging for all companies that deal with oil, Halliburton's agreement to merge with Baker Hughes seems like an opportunity that will allow the company to pull through during the year, despite the depressed environment. Post-merger, it is estimated that cost synergies will allow the companies to save $2 billion annually in the form of cost savings. In addition to this, the merger also has the chance of increasing valuation of the company's stocks, with the possibility of a boost in the newly merged company's market share. With a competitive edge in market share, Halliburton will be able to compete with Schlumberger, while consider international expansion of its operations as an option in the near term as well. Possible revenue growth and margin improvement due to cost savings have strengthened the long term prospects of Halliburton.It is possible for investors to see Halliburton reporting lower earnings on a per share basis as the year progresses. Investors could earnings to decline by a greater degree after the second quarter of the year since the impact of the oil price volatility might lag behind before impacting earnings. Moreover, operating costs might also note an increase during the second half of the year due to the merger.ConclusionThe past three months have been challenging for the stocks of Halliburton, as they have declined by nearly 27% in value. As they now trade close to the $41 mark, analysts expect that share prices could touch $47.63 in the next 12 months. This by some standards is a slow growth in prices, and might be an accurate estimate considering the challenges that could weigh the company down during the year. Despite these challenges, the possibility of a better valuation in the future could encourage investment in Halliburton's shares, especially since it is available at nearly 10.27x its earnings at the moment. In easier words, investors could be looking at a P/E valuation close to what Schlumberger enjoys at the moment.While 2015 might be a bump in the road, it is important not to lose sight of the larger picture. For now, Halliburton's existing contracts continue to remain in place and will be a source of revenue for the company throughout the year. While growth in new contracts might be slow, it might not necessarily remain flat. Halliburton will be able to bag a few more contracts during the year, resulting in revenue increments.Moreover, Halliburton has a great chance of emerging from this crisis with stronger fundamentals in the following year. The merger could leave Halliburton in a very good position to compete against Schlumberger, especially as it may hold higher market shares in some of the key areas that Schlumberger operates in. As oil prices rebound, which they eventually will, Halliburton will find itself in a better position to boast higher revenue and earnings growth, especially with the benefits that the merger brings. I am bullish on Halliburton in the long term. 2015 may be tough, but I believe that Halliburton has what it takes to weather the storm and come out stronger from this."
2810175,72215,2015-01-09T15:42:13-05:00,"Halliburton gains 54% of its revenues from North America. As companies cut back on capex, fewer new contracts will be issued and older ones will be renewed at low rates.The Baker Hughes deal will generate $2 billion in cost savings and allow Halliburton to boost its market share in some key business segments.Moreover, the deal could be one that allows the company to increase its valuation and generate higher returns in the long term for shareholders.The company has a strong liquidity position, with growth in financial areas like revenues and earnings outpacing that of the industry.Halliburton will see less volatility due to scaling back of activities in North America. Stocks will be bullish in the future as its valuation and market share see growth.","The second largest oilfield service provider, Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) could be looking at a tough year ahead of itself as the energy sector contracts in terms of activities and spending, to battle the recent oil price declines. Oil prices have tumbled by nearly 50% in value over the past six months. As drilling costs begin to outpace the oil prices in the market exploration and production companies have started feeling the stress of these declines and they have curtailed their upstream spending to combat the challenges of the market. Given that Halliburton is the service provider to these companies, a scale back in their spending on newer contracts means less revenue generation for the company this year.Slowdown in North AmericaHalliburton's activities are mostly clustered in the North American region, which is why its financials and operations depend more on activities taking place here. Halliburton is in fact, the largest in the region in terms of Completion and Production and Drilling and Evaluation segments in North America. It generates 54% of its revenues from the region and saw its revenues from North America rise by 21.7% in the third quarter of 2014, as activity in the US oil market began to rise. The Completion and Production business saw its revenues rise by 16%, while the Drilling and Evaluation segment's revenues rose by 10%. That being said, it seems as though the year ahead will see lower activity in the oil market as oil producers have started cutting back on their rig counts. Moreover, according to a report published by Moody's, capital spending by exploration and production companies in North America could see a 30%-40% decline if oil prices sustain themselves at below $60 a barrel. Activity outside of the region is also likely to see capital spending contract by about 10%-20%. Although most companies do not publish their capital spending budgets, Chevron is known to have put its capital spending for the year on hold, while companies such as ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), Total (NYSE:TOT), Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE:RDS.A) (NYSE:RDS.B), ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) and Petronas (OTC:PNADF) have indicated that their spending could decline by about 20% for the year. With lesser capital available to spend, Halliburton could see fewer new contracts as opportunities to sign up for this year, thereby limiting their revenue growth from the region. Given that revenue contribution from the North American region saw a 2% rise in the third quarter, it could be possible to see growth remaining flat in 2015. Although this doesn't bring immediate bad news for Halliburton at the moment, since its existing contracts will continue to bring in revenue, the slowdown in activities in the future could be a cause of concern as it could mean renewal of contracts on existing rigs at lower rates. This trend could carry forward into 2016 as well, thereby impacting Halliburton's revenues and margins. Moody's remains confident that companies like Halliburton, and its rival Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB), have the capacity to survive since most of their contracts are with large and mature companies. However, the agency is less confident about smaller companies in the industry that operate alongside Halliburton. For investors, this adds a degree of certainty about Halliburton's ability to keep up with these changing market conditions, without sustaining too much damage to its financials in the process.Baker Hughes deal enhances long term growth prospectsAnother development that investors should keep an eye out for is the acquisition of Baker Hughes (BHI) by Halliburton. The deal is worth $34.6 billion and will possibly see its completion by the second half of the year. Halliburton expects the deal to cost synergies worth about $2 billion annually with and upside from the top line as well. But as any other acquisition, Halliburton could see its operating costs rise in the second half of the year as both companies begin operations following the completion of the deal. Shedding light on some of the long term gains out of this deal, besides the cost savings, the combination of this deal can lead to the creation of a more competitive company in the future. Furthermore, once the deal materializes, Halliburton could see its market share in some business segments receive a boost, bringing it closer to its competitor Schlumberger in more key areas. This boost in market share will also lay the groundwork for international expansion for the company, while also bringing about margin improvements for Halliburton, especially as revenues grow and cost synergies begin to come into play. Moreover, the deal has a return driven motive behind it, as CFO Mark McCollum pointed out at an energy conference. Halliburton expects the deal to drive better returns for its shareholders in the long term. The CFO also hinted at Baker Hughes and Halliburton having discounted multiples as opposed to their competitor Schlumberger, indicating that the real motive behind the deal could be to close in on the gap that it has with Schlumberger, and gain a premium multiple. McCollum had pointed out that the company has the ability to back this premium stance, should it be able to gain it with the acquisition of Baker Hughes, mainly because it has been posting the highest industry returns in the past. For shareholders, these statements shed light on the possibility of high returns in the future, and the ownership of stocks that are high valued going forward, should the deal pan out as planned.Financial position and strengthsHalliburton is also has some other strengths, besides the prospects of the Baker Hughes deal, that equip the company with the ability to face the challenges in the year ahead. Halliburton has been able to outpace the industry revenue growth by a high margin, as its revenues rose by 16.45%. Its net income rose by 70.2%, which was higher than the industry average of 19.75% and the S&P 500 average of 8.04%. The company has also been able to growth its EPS by a staggering 70%, outpacing the industry in this regard as well. The ratio analysis of the company shows that its debt to equity ratio of the company has grown over the previous years and now stands at 0.50, which is high and suggests that the management needs to look into its debt levels and manage it well. However, the quick ratio of 1.63 suggests that the company has a string liquidity position.ConclusionHalliburton's shares have lost nearly 45% of their value since July of last year, as the stocks now trade close to the $40 mark. Trading at 10.12x their earnings, the shares seem undervalued for the kind of returns that are offering their investors. Going forward, this valuation is likely to receive a boost following the Baker Hughes deal. Investors could see Halliburton's price-earnings ratio rise beyond that of Schlumberger, which now trades at nearly 15x its earnings. Halliburton may also see its market share improve in regions outside of North America, leading to better revenue generation, less dependence on the North American region and higher boost in earnings. Some key areas of business segments will register a market share increase, bringing the company closer to its rival, Schlumberger in these aspects. As revenues swell and the $2 billion cost synergies begin to materialize, profit margins are likely to improve as well. While the current 12 year estimate for stock prices are set at $54.58, Halliburton could see its stocks cross the $70 mark in the next few years as the oil and gas sector begins its expansion following the recovery of oil prices, and as the Baker Hughes deal begins to rake in revenues and profits."
2750675,50582,2014-12-12T00:43:03-05:00,HAL CFO Mark McCollum presented on Dec. 10.The presentation lowered my confidence in the fourth quarter.I was correct that cheap oil didn’t affect the quarter much but failed to account for other potential factors.,"In my prior Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) article entitled Halliburton Analysts Must Be Crazy: Accumulate, I made a case that analysts were underselling what I then expected to be a fantastic fourth quarter above their estimates. I made a case that since most of HAL's business is contract work, recently negotiated at higher pricing, cheap oil prices wouldn't have a material impact on the fourth quarter. Analysts were calling for a 3% sequential improvement in sales with no material improvement in adjusted EPS and I found that to be nuts at the time. I stated among other things,On Dec. 10, Halliburton CFO Mark McCollum presented at the Capital One 9th Annual Energy Conference. What I failed to account for is there are other variables well beyond oil prices. While McCollum insists North America (and fracking-related business) has seen ""no operational impact"" from crashing oil prices, he warned of other unexpected weaknesses. He stated,Unfortunately it doesn't end there. McCollum also stated,Then...Finally...Assuming that charge is excluded from the adjusted EPS number, ironically it now looks like analysts were overoptimistic on revenue (a figure I agreed with them on) but right on the money for adjusted EPS (the figure I disagreed on). As such, I no longer am excited about a fourth quarter earnings beat and am in fact concerned it could actually miss a little. As for the stock, it may be cheap long term on a value basis but I won't be buying right now. McCollum admitted management has very little clarity into 2015, so as investors on the outside how are we supposed to sort it all out?"
2817636,39551,2015-01-13T13:18:27-05:00,"HAL, similar to SLB, proved to be more defensive than the rest in the current downturn;
        The company due to its geographic diversification and superior technology is in a position to take market share from the smaller players;
        HAL’s merger with BHI should help the company narrow multiple gap with SLB.","Oilfield Services, Drilling & Equipment sector underperformed S&P500 in 2014. The sector was one of the hardest hit sectors, as oil prices fell sharply in 2H14. However, the nightmare of the sector is not over yet. Oil prices remain weak and the risk to own oil services companies' stock remains high. However, as I mentioned in my last article, Can Schlumberger Outperform In 2015?, there are still stocks which should perform relatively better. In a downturn, large cap, diversified companies, such as Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) and Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB), are able to bundle and cross-sell and take share from the smaller players. Both Schlumberger and Halliburton, due to their superior technology and geographic diversification, are in a position to take advantage of this dynamic and take share from their smaller peers.Oil services stock bottom when the oil prices bottom. While there appear to be a consensus that oil prices have further downside into the spring, I believe the sentiment on the large-cap oil services stock is unlikely to deteriorate much further. Nevertheless, I expect the companies to announce tough guidance for 2015 in their upcoming conference calls, which might have a temporary adverse impact on stock prices.Halliburton To Emerge Stronger From The DownturnMeaningful oil prices decline have historically impacted quarterly results on a 2 to 3 quarters lag, which means that most of the impact of the oil prices decline is likely to be reflected in the second and the third quarters of 2015. Despite of the cautious view among analysts and investors alike, I do not expect the 4Q14 earnings to be materially impacted.Halliburton, as a recent Barclays report (published January 8, 2015) noted, is firmly established as a low cost North American service provider. This is not a first down cycle for the industry, nor will it be the last and Halliburton with its dominant North American onshore position should emerge stronger from this downturn with a greater North American share. As a low cost operator with high quality customer base, the company's utilization should not only hold better than others but should also allow the company to expand its presence in the unconventional basin.Looking To Close Multiple GapHalliburton is also looking to close its multiple gap with Schlumberger. The potential merger of Halliburton and Baker Hughes (BHI) would make HAL the largest oilfield services company on sales and would make HAL more competitive on international integrated asset management projects through greater scale and product breadth. The merger would also increase HAL's negotiating position on large international contracts due to less competition and integrating BHI's artificial lift products within HAL's mature asset portfolio.Historically, SLB has traded at a 40-60% EV/EBITDA premium to both HAL and BHI. A number of factors have contributed to this premium, including Schlumberger's greater exposure to less cyclical and low tax international markets, its dominant share in most product lines, Integrated Asset Management [IPM] capability, international margin premium of 700-900 bps, and more than 1$ billion R&D budget, matching that of HAL and BHI combined.HAL's valuation gap with SLB should narrow post HAL's merger with BHI, as the combined R&D budget of HAL and BHI would rival that of SLB. HAL is also looking to triple its mature field revenue to $9 billion and its merger with BHI is critical to providing the company with the global scale and integrated portfolio solutions to compete with SLB for the large IPM projects expected over the next several years. The valuation gap could also narrow as HAL lifts BHI's margins to HAL's levels through operational improvements and removing as much as $500 million in redundant costs. Finally, the more dominant market share of the combined company (HAL/BHI) should also improve market's perception of the company.Low ValuationHalliburton, similar to Schlumberger, is also trading well below its historical price/sales and price/book ratios. HAL is trading at a price/sales ratio of 1.1, more than 20% below its historical average of 1.4. Similarly, its price/book ratio of 2.2 is also meaningfully lower than its historical average of 2.7. Halliburton is trading at a price/earnings ratio of 10.3, compared to its historical average of 15.3. Finally, it is trading at a forward P/E of 9.0, compared to 17.2 of S&P500.As I said earlier, while there appears to be a consensus that oil prices could deteriorate further, I believe the sentiment around large-cap oil services companies, particularly HAL and SLB, is unlikely to deteriorate much further. The negative and/or cautious commentary in the upcoming earnings call might have an adverse impact on stocks temporarily; the meaningful downside appears to be limited.ConclusionThese are difficult times for the oil services sector. The sector drastically underperformed S&P500 in 2014. While the large cap services names proved to be more defensive than the others, no sector was left untouched. However, I believe the sentiment is near trough and large-cap services companies, including HAL, offer a compelling risk/reward.As Halliburton closes its Baker Hughes acquisition is 2015, I believe the dominant player in the North American onshore market will come out stronger from the current downturn. The company, similar to past downturns, is likely to take advantage of the weakness in the oil markets and gain share from the smaller players. Additionally, its merger with BHI should help the company to narrow the valuation gap with SLB."

Halliburton focuses on the upstream sector of Petroleum, leaving the North American midstream sector up to Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, and the downstream sector to North America's Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM). In the past six months, Halliburton's PPS has slid 44.28% following a simultaneous 73.75% drop in the PPS of Ultra Bloomberg Crude Oil ETF (NYSEARCA:UCO). Since third quarter in 2013 to third quarter 2014, Halliburton has seen an increase in operating costs and expenses by 11.04% while total revenue has risen by a greater 16.45% leading to an increase in basic income per share attributable to company shareholders of 79.7% from .79 per share third quarter 2013 to 1.42 per share third quarter 2014. There was growth with the gross rig count increasing moderately, where Halliburton cites an increase in horizontal rig developments in the Permian Basin of West Texas and the Southwestern United States. Internationally the rig count grew 4% in the third quarter of 2014 compared to the third quarter of 2013. Halliburton's total revenue and operating costs and expenses will increase in the second half of 2015 upon Halliburton's $34.6 Billion acquisition of Baker Hughes (BHI) although cost synergies should prove beneficial to Halliburton Company and its shareholders.Companywide Highlights 2014:Geographic Strength's of Halliburton on the Global Stage vs. Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB):Halliburton saw a 16% increase in total revenue in North America, while its operating income rose 47% compared to third quarter of 2013 largely due to higher stimulation activity in the U.S. land market. The 20% increase in revenue from the Completion and Production segment led the 16% increase in total revenue in North America over the lesser 10% increase in revenue in the Drilling and Evaluation Segment. Revenue in North America made up 54% of Q3 2014 revenue compared to 52% of Q3 2013 revenue increasing Halliburton's revenue in the region by 2%.Schlumberger in North America saw a 18% increase in total revenue in North America among a 9% increase in total revenue of Schlumberger and a 5% increase in revenue of Schlumberger's International Areas. In Schlumberger's 3rd quarter report, offshore revenue was down 1% while land revenue was up 25% due to an increase in market share gains in pressure pumping, artificial lift and drilling services. The 1% decrease in offshore revenue is correlated to lower multiclient seismic sales. Drilling and Measurement services were in greater demand which is cited as a dominant reason for the increase in revenue of 11% vs. third quarter last year in North America, Latin America, and the Middle East and Asia.Halliburton in Europe/CIS/Africa had higher activity in their product service lines in the United Kingdom, Nigeria, and Angola along with higher stimulation activity and well intervention services in the Netherlands, which were partially offset by Norway's decrease in pressure pumping activity leading to a 10% increase in total revenue in the region.Schlumberger in Europe/CIS/Africa saw a 4% increase in total revenue, led by Central West Africa and Angola's strong development and exploration activities.Halliburton in the Middle East and Asia had increased revenue of 10% in Q3 2014 compared to Q3 2013, which was credited to completion tools sales and pressure pumping activity in Saudi Arabia and higher well intervention services in Indonesia.Schlumberger in the Middle East and Asia led all of its other international markets in terms of growth in revenue. Revenue grew 6% due to ""robust results"" in Saudi Arabia, Australia, and the United Arab Emirates (U.A.E.).Comparing the Behemoths (Wait to compare the two companies until finished with the Geographical analysis and stock charts analysis):SourceGlobal Regional News in Oil:Notable Company Shareholders:Conclusion:In conclusion, HAL remains the largest player in the Completion and Production, and Drilling and Evaluation segments of Oil production in North America generating $4.72 Billion in revenue compared to SLB who generated $4.25 Billion in revenue in the same region. Although SLB increased their revenue by 3% over HAL's 2% increase in revenue, HAL still leverages a stronger foothold in a growing North American market for oil. SLB remains having a stronger foothold in the Middle East/Asia, Europe/CIS/Africa, and Latin America regions. Halliburton had greater revenue growth than Schlumberger in Q3 2014 compared to Q3 2013 in every region except for Latin America and saw a 17.53% growth in revenue from the Middle East/Asia region while Schlumberger grew 6.29% in the same region in the comparative quarters. It is important to take the volatility of the global oil market into account as well as the regions where oil services companies are growing the fastest, what regions they hold the largest stake in, and where their revenue is generated from, along with general data, media reports, and news from officials whether from governments or cartels who control the quantity of barrels produced as well as the reasons for the change or maintenance of the level of production. Thus if you are looking for value and can incorporate potential volatility from the prisoner's dilemma regions and cartels are playing to bring prices up while fighting for market shares, then this may be an area to buy into. Keep in mind regional stakes that companies have when choosing to invest in any company in the oil services industry."

        BHI trades at a 15% discount to the merger with Halliburton's price, but I expect the deal to go through.
        Investors are essentially buying HAL at an 18% discount, which will insulate you from further oil price declines.","On Monday, oil prices stabilized after dropping 10% on Friday. However, it is still unclear whether oil prices have bottomed or if this was merely a ""dead cat bounce."" Anyone who claims to know for certain where this commodity will trade in a few months is either fooling you or fooling themselves. There are too many variables that make predicting oil with consistent precision possible. OPEC could decide to cut production in a few months, how US shale plays respond remains unclear, global growth could speed up (or slow down), or an increase in geopolitical tensions could strain supply. Put simply, one could construct an argument for oil going to $45 or bottoming around $65. The near term is very uncertain.In the longer term, I do believe oil has a place in your portfolio because demand for the fuel isn't going away. The transition to renewable energy is very slow, and emerging economies continue to demand more energy today. Every day, there is less oil in the world than on the previous day with remaining reserves becoming more costly, which keeps supply controlled over the longer term. Given these factors, I believe long term investors should be looking to the energy space at this moment. However with the near term uncertainty, it is imperative to invest in a name that offers an adequate margin of safety to avoid severe near term losses. That is why I recommend investors buy Baker Hughes (BHI).On November 17, Baker Hughes agreed to sell itself for $19 and 1.12 shares of Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) with closing targeted for mid-2015 (details available here). On Monday, Halliburton closed at $41.19, which implies a deal value of $65.13; however, Baker Hughes is only trading at $56.52. Baker Hughes can rally 15% before hitting the deal price. At BHI's current share price, Halliburton stock would have to fall to $33.49 (a drop of 18.7%) for BHI shareholders to start losing money.As oil service firms, Baker Hughes and Halliburton are levered to the cap-ex cycle, which is in part determined by the price of oil. Traditionally, oil service revenue is more volatile than the price of oil as small movements in oil can have larger impacts on cap-ex spending as E&P companies try to retain cash. However, these companies also provide a lot of services aimed at increasing the efficiencies of existing wells, which is even more important when oil prices are falling. In an environment where oil hovers between $50 and $70, I believe the new Halliburton (the one that includes Baker Hughes) can still earn at least $3.80 in 2015. By purchasing Baker Hughes now, investors are essentially purchasing the new Halliburton at 8.8x earnings. That is a very attractive valuation, considering that 2015 may represent a cyclical low in oil prices.Given the steep discount BHI is trading to HAL, it is a wonder to me that investors would buy HAL instead of BHI, and it is important to explain why the discount is so large. No merger has a 100% certainty of being completed as the buyer may try to back out or the government may try to block it. As such, the acquired company tends to trade at a discount to the implied merger price to reflect the risk that the deal falls through. As shares can rally 15% before hitting the deal price, investors are saying there is a sizable chance the deal is not approved. I believe this is a mistake.Yes, the new Halliburton will be the biggest oil service company; in fact, this is one reason I like the deal. The new entity should have more pricing power, which should boost margins. BHI and HAL have product overlap and should be able to generate $2 billion in savings once combined. While Halliburton will be the biggest service name, it will only be 5-10% bigger than Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB), and SLB will still be generating more profits. Between these two players, there will still be plenty of competition. Governments also tend to be slightly more lenient in mergers when corporations rather than consumers (who get to vote) are your customer.While Halliburton and Schlumberger will likely be roughly the same size, HAL may end up being a bit bigger in select product categories. However, HAL has pledged its willingness to divest businesses that generate $7.5 billion in sales. If this full amount is reached, Halliburton would likely end up being slightly smaller than Schlumberger. There has been no suggestion that Schlumberger is too big, so Halliburton should not face anti-trust issues after these divestitures. It is also worth noting that Halliburton has a history of influence in Washington, which will prove invaluable through this process.Finally, Halliburton has agreed to pay Baker Hughes $3.5 billion if regulators block the deal. This is a significant insurance policy and ensures Halliburton will do everything possible to close the merger as writing a $3.5 billion check is not anyone's idea of fun. This payout would amount to $8 per share. As a stand-alone entity, I believe Baker Hughes would be able to earn $4.20 assuming oil stays above $50. At 10x earnings and with the cash receipt from Halliburton, Baker Hughes would be worth $50. This implies that Baker Hughes has an 11% downside but 15% upside if the merger is completed. I believe there is at least an 80% probability the deal goes through, making this an attractive wager.If I am right about the merger being completed, investors basically can buy Halliburton at an 18% discount by purchasing Baker Hughes. This provides investors with a very sizable margin of safety in case oil stocks continue to fall. Upon completion of the deal, Halliburton will be the leading oil services firm, with room for margin expansion, and a single-A credit rating to ride out any volatility. With its discount to the deal, Baker Hughes is a good way to add exposure to oil while maintaining a robust margin of safety."

But I am. Halliburton is like the malignant cancer of corporations. It keeps growing and there seems like nothing will stop it. Its reach is global and its destruction is vast. We can thank Halliburton for the undrinkable water and corrosive environmental damage. We can even thank them in part for the Iraq war.But there comes a point in every liberal's life when even he or she realizes the absurdity of the market and takes advantage of it. For example, Uber was recently valued at $41 billion, making the ride sharing app more valuable than Halliburton currently valued at $34.21 billion and $40.37 a share. Perhaps that says something about our current perception of the future of oil. Part of the thesis for Uber's high valuation is that it will reduce the number of drivers because more people will be using ride sharing.Or maybe this is just some sick joke to make environmental activists think they are winning. I hope oil losing is more than just a passing fad. I like my money, but I prefer my earth. But let's be real. An iPhone app has more value than the Death Star of corporations. Is it because people really believe that an smartphone application will ostensibly reduce the world's reliance on oil?I think the reality is that Halliburton has been heavily discounted by market fear and is therefore an excellent contrarian opportunity. Insiders apparently agree. On Friday, 10 different Halliburton insiders reported buying collectively 281K shares for $11 million.In the short term oil might continue to fall, which will be rough for the retail investor who can't bear seeing the red. But my guess is that hedge funds and institutional investors are cheering for the recent downturn and hoping the sell-off continues. What better way to deliver double-digit returns than buying the bottom?I do hope that we end our dependence on oil and start investing in energy-efficient technologies. Climate change is real and man-made. But the reality is that the recent downturn in oil prices will have an impact on our perception of global warming. Let's face it: The majority of people still don't believe in global warming and only care about energy efficient technology as a way to save some money at the pump.Regular people tend to think only in the short term. And right now, gas is cheap and energy stocks are tanking. So an energy sell-off is expected. But even in the short term, Halliburton is insulated from cheap oil prices as argued by Seeking Alpha contributor The Specialist.Insider buying suggests that we might be nearing the bottom. But it could fall further as people's perceptions continue to worsen. Assuming that the Baker Hughes (BHI) acquisition goes smoothly and its more highly leveraged competitors go bankrupt, I think Halliburton at $100 a share will be very likely in 2016 as oil prices stabilize due to market forces reducing production output."

Benjamin Graham, the father of value investing, taught that looking at the price cannot be the sole factor in investment decisions as the most important aspect to consider is whether the company is trading at a discount relative to its intrinsic value. It is through a thorough fundamental analysis that the investor is able to make a determination about a potential investment's merits. Here is a look at how Halliburton fares in the ModernGraham valuation model.The model is inspired by the teachings of Benjamin Graham and considers numerous metrics intended to help the investor reduce risk levels. The first part of the analysis is to determine whether the company is suitable for the very conservative Defensive Investor or the less conservative Enterprising Investor, who is willing to spend a greater amount of time conducting further research.In addition, Graham strongly suggested that investors avoid speculation in order to remove the subjective elements of emotion. This is best achieved by utilizing a systematic approach to analysis that will provide investors with a sense of how a specific company compares to another company. By using the ModernGraham method one can review a company's historical accomplishments and determine an intrinsic value that can be compared across industries.HAL data by YChartsDefensive Investor - must pass at least 6 of the following 7 tests: Score = 6/7Enterprising Investor - must pass at least 4 of the following 5 tests or be suitable for a defensive investor: Score = 5/5Valuation SummaryKey Data:Balance Sheet - September 2014Earnings Per ShareEarnings Per Share - ModernGrahamDividend HistoryHAL Dividend data by YChartsConclusion:Halliburton passes the initial requirements of both the Defensive Investor and the Enterprising Investor. The Defensive Investor's only concern is the low level of earnings growth over the last ten years, while the Enterprising Investor has no initial concerns. As a result, value investors should feel very comfortable proceeding to the next part of the analysis, which is a determination of the company's intrinsic value.When it comes to that valuation, it is critical to consider the company's earnings history. In this case, the company has grown its EPSmg (normalized earnings) from $2.14 in 2010 to an estimated $3.07 for 2014. This is a fairly strong level of demonstrated growth which is well above the market's implied estimate for earnings growth of only 2.35% over the next 7-10 years. In fact, the historical growth is around 8.71% per year, so the market is expecting a very significant drop in earnings growth. The ModernGraham valuation model reduces the historical growth to a more conservative figure, assuming that some slowdown will occur, and therefore returns an estimate of intrinsic value falling above the current price, indicating the company is undervalued at the present time."

Halliburton was the second largest company in the sector behind Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) and Baker Hughes was the third largest - this acquisition will create a combined company that will be able to give Schlumberger better competition. There are a lot of factors to consider while looking at the acquisition. However, let's first take a look at the details of the transaction.According to the agreement, Baker Hughes shareholders will get 1.12 Halliburton shares and $19 in cash for each share of Baker Hughes they own. The transaction values Baker Hughes at $78.62 and offers about 40% premium to the Baker Hughes shareholders. On standalone basis, the premium looks extremely attractive; however, it should be kept in mind that Baker Hughes had lost over 32% during the weeks before the deal. Halliburton will pay $34.6 billion for Baker Hughes. The overall weak condition of the oil and gas sector has resulted in a considerable fall in the stock prices.The fall in the crude prices is also cited as a reason for this deal - there have been rumors that the deal only happened because the overall weak position of the commodity prices will create problems for the oilfield services companies, and a larger scale will result in a cost advantage for the company. I do not agree with this notion - the commodity prices have been in decline for about four months - but deals like this do not happen in short periods; Halliburton must have been planning this deal for over a year. Also, the need for consolidation increases once the industry settles at lower prices, where the companies operating in the sector cannot grow their market shares or grow without merging - crude prices have been falling for only four months now, which is a very short period to declare that the trend will not change. If the prices remain low for an extended period of time, then we might see some activity in the sector and the larger players might try to buy some smaller players. However, I believe it is too early to be thinking about consolidation at the moment.Another reason, which I believe has more foundation, is that Halliburton decided to acquire Baker Hughes because of its research and development. The oil and gas sector spends a lot on research and development and the technology to extract resources is extremely important for the oilfield services companies - these companies sometimes do almost all the fieldwork for the E&P companies. Especially, after the shale revolution, the technology for horizontal drilling has become extremely important - it is understandable that Halliburton wants to buy the research and development of Baker Hughes. This deal will serve a dual purpose for the company: acquisition of the research and development, and the expansion of operations, which should also give the company a cost advantage in case the prices of the commodities remain low.The next step for Halliburton is the regulatory approval - the company has announced that it will divest assets worth $7.5 billion revenues. According to Bloomberg, National Oilwell Varco (NYSE:NOV) and Weatherford International (WFT) will be the companies picking up these assets. The regulatory approval should not be a big issue for the company as these sales should make the new entity compliant with the anti-trust regulations - most of these assets are the overlapping operations, which will not be needed in the future. Furthermore, Halliburton will have to pay $3.5 billion in termination fees if the acquisition does not go through. So, the company has another factor that will push it towards the completion of the acquisition.We need to analyze both the scenarios in order to understand the importance of this deal - consolidation usually happens when the commodity prices remain low for the extended period. However, I believe this deal will be good for Halliburton in both scenarios: sustained low commodity prices, and recovering crude prices. Let's assume the prices remain low for an extended period of time - this will result in lower investment on exploration from the E&P companies. As a result, these companies will look for the best price. Larger size will allow Halliburton to offer lower prices as the company will have a cost advantage. So, even in the low prices environment, the company will be able to have better profitability. On the other hand, if the crude prices rebound, the E&P companies will start to spend more on the exploration efforts, which will result in increased demand for oilfield services equipment as well as services. This will allow the oilfield services companies to expand their margins by charging higher rates - low cost plus high rates will have a double impact on the margins for Halliburton, and the combined company will be able to have better profitability than both companies on stand-alone basis. The deal will give Halliburton a wider economic moat and increased bargaining power. However, the true benefit will come from the rising commodity prices. So, the company should be hoping for a rebound in commodity prices along with the regulatory approval of the deal.The Bottom LineThe bottom line is that the deal is good for the shareholders as well as the company - increased scale will allow the company to compete better and boost profitability if the crude prices rebound. The shareholders are getting a good premium, which is more than the value lost over the last few weeks. Going forward, the acquisition makes the combined entity a much better prospect for future growth - long-term shareholders should benefit further by holding onto their holdings - the cash payment is an added bonus."

Since my theses always have long-term focus, my earliest articles about each company include the most information and the best explanations of my theses (regardless of publish dates). So, this article is primarily to update my valuations and price target for HAL, as well as to recap my investment thesis with my opinions on directly related new developments.From an October 14, 2013 article with brief overviews of several companies, here is the bottom line of my initial published opinion about HAL:From a January 8, 2014 article with brief updates on all companies I cover, here is my HAL opinion while the stock was $48-49 (the prior low for 2014):From my July 13, 2014 full-thesis HAL article, here is my share-price opinion that was published most recently prior to this article:Clearly, I raised my target too soon, but I openly admit that I didn't foresee the precipitous decline in oil prices or the geopolitical issues that are affecting the entire oil and gas sector. Even so, I added to my HAL holdings during the mid-October dip to $50, and again at $42 last Friday (11/28). I try to include information for everyone within the wide range of investors who read Seeking Alpha, so the pro types may want to skip the next paragraph, but for the sake of the less-experienced investors, I think I should explain why I waited for $50 and $42 before buying more HAL shares, even though I said back in July that ""I won't add to my position unless HAL dips to at least a $60-64 range.""Major factors in when I buy are the manner in which a stock approaches my previously-established buy range, and the company/sector/market conditions at the time. In other words, if HAL seemed strong as it approached $60-64, I would've waited until that decline appeared to be ending, and bought as close as possible to the bottom of the $60-64 range. However, that's not at all what happened. In the few days from the end of September to the start of October, HAL dropped from $66 to $61 (7% in a few days). The fact that HAL hovered at almost exactly the midpoint of my $60-64 downside range for a week prior to the mid-October correction implies that would've been the bottom for HAL, if both a market-wide correction and severe oil-price declines hadn't occurred simultaneously. That's a good example of why I emphasize with downside-risk estimates that unpredictable events can cause downside beyond any estimate.Among my favorite tools to determine when it's time to buy any stock is the Moving Average Convergence Divergence [MACD]. My opinion is that anyone who buys individual securities should utilize both fundamentals and technicals.Business Drivers (Including Potential Baker Hughes Deal)Halliburton's planned acquisition [pdf] of Baker Hughes (BHI) is clearly top-of-mind for HAL shareholders right now, but the potential deal is not yet certain and isn't expected to close until the second half of 2015. So, I'll cover the subject primarily in the context of the factors that I believe are the most important business drivers for HAL, and how I believe BHI could contribute to each factor. At the same time, as you'll see in the Valuation Updates section, my HAL thesis is not contingent on a BHI deal at this time, for reasons given.HAL management often describes its business strategy with the more granular focus of the industry operational distinctions: unconventionals, deepwater and mature fields. Those are indeed the key markets from which HAL derives all of the company's earnings, but I focus on the underlying tactics that are allowing HAL to grow in those markets. I think about them in three broad categories:I'll cover the first two topics together, since technology is the primary driver of increasing integration across products and services, so it's near impossible to discuss the move toward more integration without veering into a discussion of technologies. My prior article discusses some HAL technologies and integration initiatives in detail, but this article must also stand on its own. So, I'll attempt a balance between being redundant and being unclear, by detailing how some technologies and integration initiatives contribute to the aforementioned three growth drivers, and just listing others with lots of links to more information.Technology Innovations / Integrated Products & ServicesThe premise here is that continual and significant technological innovations from HAL, along with the company's continual move toward more integrated products and services, will allow the company to grow market share, margins and profitability. I believe that will be the result of helping customers save tremendous amounts of money without sacrificing production levels or quality.My last article goes into detail about some specific HAL technologies, as well as integration initiatives, so I'll just touch how BHI can potentially contribute. The following table details how the combination with BHI would immediately boost the HAL market share in some key business segments.sources: Spears & Associates / Cowen & Co. / ReutersAs you can see, the increases would bring the HAL market share closer to the SLB market share, but in most cases, HAL would still only control an equal or lesser market share. And, the estimates don't account for any divestitures so, while HAL would jump into the lead in some key areas, there wouldn't be an extreme imbalance overall to create insurmountable issues on the antitrust regulatory front. With that said, I'll comment on a few specific segments.Artificial LiftIt's a given that boosting market share in the Artificial Lift segment from next to nothing, to slightly above SLB, is one of the main things that is drawing HAL to a deal with BHI. Artificial Lift is the primary business involved in increasing production at mature-field wells. That's a very important area for HAL because it relates to all of the goals that are driving the company's growth -- upselling customers to more vertically-integrated suites of products and services, doing more high-margin work, and accelerating international expansion.Mature fields are one of the primary areas of opportunity to increase margins, since customers are increasingly moving toward turning over the entire fields for a services company like HAL to manage the assets, so that more customer resources can be dedicated to newer fields. That not only means a need for a wider range of integrated products and services from HAL, but it also means more of the generally higher-margin work from services-based contracts.Mature fields also tend to be prevalent in less developed nations, which gives HAL a perfect entry point to establish new relationships as part of its efforts to expand its global operations. Optimizing mature fields also presents significant technological and logistical challenges for which less developed nations simply don't have the expertise, and there are few companies in the world that do.An update related to the mature-fields topic is that HAL announced in 2014Q2 that it acquired Europump Systems Inc., a Canada-based leader in the design, fabrication, distribution, and service of progressive cavity pump systems [pdf], progressive cavity wellhead drives, and surface drive units. Those are all key technology products for enhancing recovery rates at mature-field wells.Inflow Control Devices are another set of key technologies for mature fields.Hydraulic FracturingAs noted in the Company Overview section at the end of the article, HAL is the pioneer of hydraulic fracturing and has always been the leader in that industry segment. Through its Frac of the Future initiative announced at the company's 2013 Analyst Day, HAL has been working on securing its leadership position in the industry segment that drove the U.S. shale boom. HAL boosting its market share from 26% to 39% in one fell swoop via the BHI deal would obviously go a long way, and BHI is considered to have strong fracking technologies.An important aspect of the fracking part of the HAL story is that most of the rest of the world is still years behind North America in terms of locating and developing shale deposits, but many other places in the world also have very significant shale resources. In many cases, those resources haven't yet been tapped because they're in nations that simply don't have a company like HAL based in their country, and don't have the complex technologies necessary to develop shale basins. This is one of HAL's best opportunities for global growth.One example of a leading (and pretty impressive) HAL technology for fracking is the SandCastle vertical storage system [video].Other Technology & Integration UpdatesIn July, the Halliburton Landmark Software subsidiary acquired the U.K.-based Neftex Petroleum Consultants Ltd., pioneer of the Neftex Earth Model, which is a consistent 4D digital model of the entire earth subsurface. By integrating the Neftex Earth Model with Landmark's DecisionSpace® platform, HAL expects to help its customers explore more prospects faster and obtain subsurface insight to better predict the probability of drilling success. Neftex Earth Model allows operators to compare basin data with other basins across the globe during the same time period and identify potential exploration prospects based not just in the basin of interest, but also within global contexts. This ""allows geoscientists for the first time to use a single global platform to search, discover, analyze and integrate geoscience data and interpretations essential to understanding and managing subsurface risk"" and, thereby, allows a greatly improved ability to predict outcomes based on the performance of proven basins.The CYPHER Seismic-To-Stimulation system integrates engineering disciplines to better predict and produce unconventional reserves, which decline at faster rates than traditional wells. Halliburton President, Jeff Miller, offered a helpful update on this key HAL technology during the recent conference call:Again, for the reason touched on, I believe that increased market share in this case would also lead to increased margins and profitability. As the slide below shows, expanding the margin of the BHI assets to the level of HAL businesses in just one would region would be an $800M per year increase in profitability.source: company presentationGlobal Expansion Supplements North America LeadershipThe premise here is that, in combination with the innovation and integration initiatives discussed above, expanding the company's global presence will help HAL continually grow market share and profitability over the long term. I think that will be the result of a greater HAL presence in regions that are recovering from the global economic crisis of 2009 even more slowly than North America, and that are also years behind the U.S in accessing their shale resources.My last article goes into detail about the global expansion plans and progress from HAL in recent years, so I'll just cover how BHI would contribute. The next table details how the combination with BHI would immediately boost revenues for HAL in some key international markets.sources: Spears & Associates / Cowen & Co. / Reuters / Schlumberger*combined by author for illustrative purposes, no combined revenues exist yet**Commonwealth of Independent StatesAs you can see, HAL has the most North America presence of the ""big three,"" in terms of percentage of total revenues. That worked out especially well for the initial few years after the global financial crisis since, even though the U.S. struggled too, it was still in better shape than most of the rest of the world. At the same time, operations that are more concentrated in one region than the industry leader would not position HAL well enough for the future.Over the last three years, HAL invested aggressively in its global expansion by spending over $1B to open fifty new facilities in thirty of the eighty nations in which the company operates. Even with so much investment, it's not possible to organically achieve the level of global expansion that an acquisition adds in a relatively short time period. As the slide below shows, BHI has a significant international presence and HAL expects to achieve via fixed cost savings half of the projected $2B in annual cost savings the BHI deal is expected to bring.While these examples don't account for any divestitures, as the table shows, the BHI operations would nearly double HAL revenue in all regions except for Latin America, where BHI has its smallest operational presence by revenue.Perhaps more important, BHI has a large presence in some of the key major oil-producing nations like Canada and Russia, which would help HAL grow its adjacent operations in those nations and contribute significantly to the move to more vertically integrated offerings, as discussed above. The Canadian oil sands have the world's third-largest crude reserves (after Saudi Arabia and Venezuela), so it's important for HAL to have an adequate presence for the long term opportunities in Canada. Similarly, Russia also has huge reserves, such as the Bazhenov shale. In February, HAL signed [pdf] a new partnership agreement with Gubkin Russian State University of Oil & Gas to help develop unconventional resources for Russia, which doesn't have the expertise alone.While the ongoing geopolitical issues causing disruptions and activity declines in Libya, Iraq and Russia didn't prevent HAL from reporting a strong 2014Q3, the issues could impact a larger portion of the current or subsequent quarters in the short term. However, HAL management seemed reasonably confident about the region in the following excerpts from the recent conference call:In any case, as an investor who is primarily interested in the long term, I like the timing with which HAL stepped up its global expansion (2011), and I think that will result in excellent positioning as world economies continue improving, albeit in fits and starts. The BHI assets would accelerate HAL's global growth.Independent of the potential BHI acquisition, a couple of international locales where HAL is seeing positive developments are in Latin America. This October, HAL won multi-billion dollar contracts from the Ecuador state-run oil company, Petroamazonas. The contracts are for long-term asset management across nine mature fields, as detailed in a comment from the recent conference call:source: company presentationValuation Updates (Upside Potential & Downside Risk)More important than the fact that I already began adjusting my valuation for HAL before any news of a potential BHI acquisition, three interrelated reasons prevent me from basing my HAL valuation on the deal yet: [1] I think the deal will close, but that's far from the case right now, so all details regarding which earnings-generating assets HAL will retain are unknown; [2] I think the deal will ultimately increase HAL's valuation substantially, but a potential late-2015 close doesn't change HAL earnings for the timeframe of my price target; and [3] I consider it too speculative to value an acquirer with the pre-acquisition market position, margins and earnings of the company that may be acquired.The first two points are self-explanatory, so I'll just expand on the last one. It may seem the same as the first point, but it is not. The first point is about the high likelihood that the deal would include divestitures of earnings-generating assets, while the third point refers to the idea that it is pure conjecture that an acquirer will generate earnings from acquired assets that are only equal to the pre-acquisition earnings of those assets. Consider the core reason a company is acquired in the first place: the acquirer believes it can extract substantially more value from the assets than the acquired company was able to generate.With HAL and BHI, the historical performance of each company implies that is indeed the likely outcome. BHI is widely considered a high-quality provider of oil and gas [O&G] services, but it's also common knowledge that BHI has been consistently unable to reach market share, margins or profitability comparable to HAL. For example, market share for BHI in two of the critical areas of O&G services (hydraulic fracturing and cementing) are less than half of HAL market share. BHI margins in some areas are also about half of HAL margins. Clearly, the whole point of the deal is to bring the high-quality products and services of BHI into the higher-profitability operations of HAL, and better compete with Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB). So, projecting that HAL will only generate earnings from acquired assets at the BHI historical levels is a hasty assumption at best.My HAL price target is based partially on the company's trailing and forward Price-To-Earnings ratios [P/E], both independent and relative to peers. I also factor in the PEGY ratio, which is the yield-adjusted Price-To-Earnings-Growth ratio [PEG]. I also ran numerous Discounted Cash Flow [DCF] calculations to estimate how HAL might fare in various earnings scenarios going forward.source: Yahoo FinanceDCF ValuationsAs the chart above shows, HAL earnings are expected to grow at an average annual rate of 20.20% over the next five years (it was 21.85% at the time of my July article). The next-year earnings growth rate is projected at 16.60%, which is nearly half of the 29.10% during my July article. Even so, the lower estimates actually have a muted impact on my valuation calculations since, as stated in that July article: ""To make my DCF calculations very conservative, I reduced the 21.85% five-year projected growth rate to 20% and only applied it for the next three years, rather than the actual projected five years.""As also stated in that July article: ""I used a conservative 3% terminal growth rate, a conservative 12% discount rate (instead of the far more forgiving and more common 10%), and reduced the $5.15 next-year EPS projection to only $5.00."" The next-year EPS estimate is now $4.70, which I believe is a bit low.Even so, I used the new EPS estimate with the same conservative parameters described above, except I applied the projections to two years (versus three), in order to make the calculations even more conservative and align them with the approximate two-year period that it may take for the potential BHI deal to become directly accretive to HAL earnings. The result is that my current DCF calculations return a HAL share price of $72, versus the $88 result from July, which was one measure that contributed to my old $85 price target. Note that the new $72 DCF valuation does not represent current value, since it is based on the twelve-month timeline for my new price target, which I'll detail shortly.P/E Multiple ValuationsThe last four quarters of EPS for HAL were $0.93, $0.73, $0.91 and $1.19, for a $3.76 total. With a $42.20 current share price, and the $3.76 trailing-twelve EPS, the trailing-twelve P/E is 11.22x. With the $4.70 next-year EPS estimate, which I believe will prove too low, the forward P/E ratio for HAL is 8.98x. Yes, you read that right and, yes, I triple checked all of my numbers. Crazy, huh!?Even if HAL were to miss the current-quarter EPS consensus estimate of $1.20 by a penny, making the EPS flat with the just-reported quarter at $1.19, that would make the actual trailing-twelve EPS $4.02. With that, even the 11.22x trailing P/E that the market is so generously valuing HAL with right now would make the share price $45.10. I mention that only to illustrate how hard it is to find a scenario in which a $42 share price makes any sense at all. And, unlike some of the other valuation scenarios I'll offer next, that $45.10 share price is just an example of minimal value right now, not at some point in the future.According to S&P Capital IQ historical data, throughout the past ten years, the P/E multiple for HAL has remained in a 10-24x range (when the most extreme outliers on both the high and low end are discarded), and the most typical P/E ratios for HAL remain in the 16-17x range. With the $4.70 next-year earnings estimate, a 16x multiple puts the HAL share price at $75.20. Even if HAL were to miss next year's consensus estimate by an average of $0.05 every quarter, the resulting full-year EPS of $4.50 would still make the share price $72 with a 16x multiple. Note that these examples don't represent fair value today, since they're looking at future EPS for the twelve-month timeline of my price target.P/E Ratio Relative ValuationsAs this table shows, HAL is valued far more cheaply than both BHI and SLB.source: data from Yahoo Finance, calculations by authorIf the market were to grant HAL just the 12.05x forward multiple it applies to BHI, the HAL share price would be $56.40 right now. Similarly, if the market granted HAL the 16.76x trailing ratio currently allotted to BHI, the HAL share price would be $63.02 right now. Unlike some of the other examples offered, these scenarios refer to current multiples, not future estimates. Considering that HAL is a better operator, a remotely comparable valuation is reasonable.Some management comments from the 2014Q3 call sum up that point well:PEGY Ratio ValuationsThe PEG ratio is a useful valuation metric, since it's more forward-looking than most, but a drawback that it shares with most other valuation methods is that it overlooks dividends. However, there's a dividend-adjusted version known as the PEGY ratio. With either version, 1.00x implies that a stock is fairly valued, below 1.00x implies undervaluation and above 1.00x implies overvaluation.The other valuation calculations are reaffirmed by the fact that the PEGY ratio for HAL is also extremely low. With its 1.71% dividend yield, 20.20% earnings growth rate and 11.22x trailing P/E multiple, the current PEGY ratio for HAL is just 0.51x. As with every other valuation measure for HAL, that's the lowest in the peer group. The current PEGY ratios for BHI and SLB are 0.56x and 0.88x, respectively. Just as one example of how extremely undervalued HAL is based on actual earnings and yield, the HAL share price would have to increase 95% to above $82 in order for the stock's PEGY ratio to exceed 1.00x. I don't think that will happen any time soon, but it does indicate extreme undervaluation.Valuation ConclusionsBecause the consensus earnings estimate and my own earnings estimates for HAL have declined significantly in the five months since I last offered a price target, I'm reducing my target to $72 with a twelve-month timeframe. To be clear, the fact that I'm lowering my price target doesn't mean that my opinion of the company/stock is now negative. If that were the case, I wouldn't have added to my holdings twice in two months. The reduction merely reflects the fact that there is now a great deal of uncertainty surrounding how long it will take for oil prices to recover, how various geopolitical issues will play out, and details of the potential BHI deal. I expect there will be more clarity on each of those topics in the coming months, so I'll likely update my price target about midway into its twelve-month timeline, and I'll likely incorporate the potential of BHI accretion into my valuation at that time. In the meantime, the timeline should make clear that I'm not arguing that HAL will rally to $72 immediately.My new $72 price target is 71% above HAL's $42.20 current share price, and 47% above the $49 price from my initial HAL opinion. The estimate of upside potential doesn't include the additional returns from the 1.71% dividend yield.Downside-RiskHere are my downside-risk conclusions from July, while HAL was near $70:Clearly, I was wrong about how low HAL would go. Again, I didn't foresee the supply/demand imbalance and geopolitical issues that the oil and gas sector is getting hit by, or the resulting precipitous decline in oil prices. Forecasting oil prices is the domain of the Energy Information Administration [EIA], and the November 12 Short-Term Energy Outlook [STEO] report states the following:At least until the next report on December 9, the EIA seems to believe that a bottom for oil prices is near, if not here, even though any substantial action to put a floor under world oil prices may not happen until the next meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries [OPEC] on June 5, 2015.Rightly or wrongly, HAL trades in correlation with oil prices, so the shares will continue to suffer if oil prices do sink much further and remain extremely low for an extended period, but as my twelve-month target price implies, I believe the shares will at least find a bottom soon. That's not based on speculation for oil prices though. It's important to understand that over 90% of HAL's revenue is from contracts that are at least one year long, so revenue doesn't suddenly stop when oil prices drop. In other words, with only minor consideration of the EIA forecasts, my opinion is primarily based on a belief that such an extreme disconnect between earnings and stock price can only go so far for so long.As the chart below shows, the 200-day Exponential Moving Average [EMA] for HAL is now $59.13, the stock is already 29% below that, and it is now trading below (or even near) its 200-EMA for the first time since December of 2012.source: Yahoo FinanceBeyond oil prices, another factor that is likely contributing to the weakness in the HAL share price is investor concern over dilution that may result from the issuance of shares to BHI shareholders when that deal closes. Personally, I'm not overly concerned about that because HAL has a great track record in that area. For example, in 2013 alone, HAL bought back about 93 million shares at a total cost of about $4.4B, which represented about 10% of the outstanding shares. Looking forward, the following excerpts from the last conference call are worth considering, with a special emphasis on the last sentence.Analyst OpinionsArgus Research offers a bearish view of the potential BHI deal, but beyond the shock-value headline, the actual comments sound more bullish. Opinions from several other firms are summarized here, and most sound cautiously bullish.The most common concern is antitrust scrutiny, but I don't believe that is an insurmountable hurdle. After all, we're not talking about retail companies that sell consumer products, or that only do so in the U.S. Considering the benefits if North America can in fact achieve energy independence, an argument could be made that it's in the national interest to support HAL's efforts to fortify its competitive position. HAL has disclosed that it could divest businesses that generate up to $7.5B in revenue without the acquisition losing its value, but that the company believes far less will be required. Anything is possible, but perhaps the $1.5-3.5B in potential breakup fees indicates that the HAL team has done its homework and has good reasons to believe that it can get done whatever regulators may ask, while still retaining the deal value. By the way, if BHI were to walk away from the deal, it would owe HAL a $1B breakup fee.Four analysts rate HAL a Hold, twenty five rate it a Buy, and one analyst rates it a Strong Buy Rating. The consensus rating is Buy, and the consensus target price is $73.50. All of the analyst changes in the past month or two have been to lower price targets, but almost all analysts also reiterated their Buy ratings.Final ThoughtsThere are really only general conclusions that can be drawn regarding the BHI deal acquisition at this point, since it won't close until the second half of 2015 and no one knows yet which assets or subsidiaries may be divested. With that said, my general conclusions are where the title of the article comes into play.[1] Over the short term, the deal will be painful for existing HAL shareholders, somewhat related to potential expense and dilution, but more due to investor perceptions about those things. As I often say, stock prices are set by people, not our calculators. In other words, the short-term price of any stock is based on perceptions (emotions), not reality (fundamentals). With consideration for the ultimate payoff, I see this as a relatively minor inconvenience for those of us who own HAL as an investment, and only a potential problem for those who own HAL as a trade. In the end, the fundamentals always win, which is why …[2] Over the long term, the deal most likely will be excellent for existing HAL shareholders, due to the inherent outcomes that would have been impossible for HAL to achieve organically at a remotely comparable rate. The only reason I qualify that statement with ""most likely"" is because we don't know all of the details yet (divestitures, etc.). As long as divestitures don't get to a point that they cancel out all of the ""inherent outcomes,"" it's practically a given that the deal will be a big win for HAL investors over the long term, in my opinion.The ""inherent outcomes"" that I'm referring to are accelerated: a) increases in market share, margins and profitability, both in specific segments and overall; b) global expansion, as BHI assets help HAL to grow in its current markets, as well as expand into newer markets faster; c) transitions to broader and more vertically-integrated ranges of technologies, products and services. Those are all things that HAL has already been doing, but again, a large acquisition can accelerate such initiatives like nothing else can. Of course there are risks, but my view is that the stock market is never the domain of no-risk investments.While I believe now is actually a good time to buy HAL, as long as an investor has reasonable expectations and scales in with multiple buys to help protect against downside, I'm unlikely to add to my holdings again soon for a couple of interrelated reasons that I alluded to earlier. First, HAL was so ridiculously cheap when I bought the bulk of my holdings (high $20s) that I averaged into my position faster than I normally would, so HAL is already among my top-ten largest holdings, despite the recent declines. Second, as I mentioned up front, I've added to my holdings twice pretty recently and, in combination with the previous factor, I'm just not ready to add again so soon. The possibility that I may turn out to have missed a bottom by a point or two is less important to me than where I believe the stock is headed within my time horizon. I believe that, once investors start to get more comfortable with the BHI deal over the coming months, and pay attention to fundamentals again, HAL will do well.As an oil and gas investor, consider another of my articles that might interest you: ""Compressco Partners: More Income, More Growth.""

Best of luck with the rest of your due diligence.Company OverviewEstablished in 1919 by Erle P. Halliburton, the Halliburton Oil Well Cementing Company [HOWCO] is now Halliburton -- a Fortune 500 global oilfield-services company that provides a wide and growing range of products and services for the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas.In the late 1920s and 1930s, Halliburton began its transition into a global firm and, in the 1940s, the firm expanded to Latin America and the Middle East. In that same time frame, Halliburton began doing work for the Arabian-American Oil Company (predecessor of Saudi Aramco, the world's largest oil company).In 1949, the first license for hydraulic fracturing was granted to HAL. In the 1950s, Halliburton expanded its operations to Italy, Germany, Argentina and England. In the 1980s, Halliburton was the first U.S. firm to perform oilfield service work in China and, in the 1990s, Halliburton opened offices in Russia.While Halliburton is known for its leadership in North American operations, its divisions are organized in four geographic regions comprised of approximately eighty individual countries: North America, Latin America, Europe/Africa/CIS and Middle East/Asia. In 2007, Halliburton established a second headquarters in Dubai, United Arab Emirates to help build its Eastern Hemisphere presence.Halliburton has thirteen product service lines [PSLs] in two divisions: Drilling & Evaluation, and Completion & Production. The PSLs in the Drilling & Evaluation division are: Baroid, Drill Bits & Services, Landmark Software, Sperry Drilling, Testing & Subsea, and Wireline & Perforating. The Completion & Production division PSLs are: Artificial Lift, Boots & Coots, Cementing, Completion Tools, Multi-Chem, and Production Enhancement. As the spearhead of Halliburton's integrated-services strategy, the Consulting & Project Management PSL works across both divisions, but its financials are included with Drilling & Evaluation.In addition to those that include the Halliburton name, some Halliburton units operate under distinct brands for various reasons. Perhaps the most common reason is when an acquired business has a brand that is known in the industry and worth retaining. The following are Halliburton businesses: Kellogg Energy Services, SensorTran and Oilfield Telecommunications.Businesses that Halliburton acquired recently are discussed within the body of this article, such as Europump Systems and Neftex Petroleum Consultants.Halliburton also owns stakes in numerous joint ventures [JVs] throughout the world such as: Arabian Rockbits & Drilling Tools [ARDT], with Trinidad Drilling (OTCPK:TDGCF); a Technology Cooperation Agreement, with Gazprom Neft (OTCQX:GZPFY); and a JV with SPT Energy Group that was announced in April [pdf]. I wasn't able to confirm whether HAL still owns a stake in EnventureGT, which it started as a JV with Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE:RDS.A), (NYSE:RDS.B).For more information about Halliburton Company, see the corporate website.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

2747385,55632,2014-12-11T05:51:00-05:00,"Halliburton indicates that the immediate impact of the lower price environment has fallen in the international camp, but North America is next.The company reminds investors about conventional oil production and mature fields as a source of revenue growth moving forward, restating this opportunity again from the 2013 Analyst Day.National oil companies own approximately 73% of the world's reserves, and the power has shifted back to these producers, as witnessed by steeply declining oil prices.In a low-price environment, ""there is nowhere to hide."" Halliburton offers investors a window into the industry's tectonic shifts.","On the front line of collapsing oil prices, major oilfield services firm Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) offers some insight into how the industry is adjusting. Since the OPEC announcement to keep production quotas intact, as made on November 27th, the consolidation in oilfield services reveals another significant turning point as the industry moves toward greater efficiency. On November 17th, Halliburton announced a $34.6 billion transaction to acquire Baker Hughes (BHI), the third-largest oilfield service company, mirroring this new order.A sign of the times, the mega oilfield services firm sees opportunity in the area of mature fields. As noted in an earlier article, ""Halliburton Exemplifies Unconventional and Conventional Oil and Gas Trends,"" mature fields globally are on the decline, but the right technology solutions can help recovery factors. Halliburton cited, ""on average, 60% of IOCs' (international oil firms) portfolio fields are in decline, with the average decline rates being more than 8% per annum."" Think Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), Eni (NYSE:E), Chevron (NYSE:CVX), BP plc (NYSE:BP), Statoil (STO). National oil companies have the same issue with declining fields, but they also lack the organizational capacity and expertise to sustain production, among other factors.Conventional-Unconventional DanceOne year ago, all eyes were focused on unconventional oil and gas production. Today, Halliburton reminds us of serving conventional markets through national oil companies (NOCs) and majors. The pendulum has seemingly swung back to an equilibrium of emphasis between unconventional and conventional production, at least in the mind of an oil services heavyweight. From a December 10 conference, EVP and CFO McCollum offered a little insight into new opportunities:Why mature fields? Mature fields' production and reserves from an Analyst Day 2013 presentation offer a perspective. While mature fields production increases over time, reserves decline slowly over time. (And this also is the dilemma that markets are short-sighted about, that a Deloitte executive alluded to in this article of mine, on the decline curves.)The services intensity for mature fields continues to grow, which is positive for oilfield services firms. This chart of 2013 may look different for the 2014-15 era, but it is also an indication as to why prices will rise again, eventually.For Halliburton, the Middle East will be of renewed focus. Notes the executive:Another plus for Halliburton with its Baker Hughes acquisition is the area of consolidated spending on R&D. ""We're out there spending both, an equivalent to about $700 million, $800 million a piece, all doing the same R&D efforts around sensing technologies and drilling, other drilling in Wireline and reservoir characterization,"" notes the EVP in the conference. This will essentially cut combined R&D redundancy in the industry. He notes that other areas in need of development will be addressed as a combined entity.Overall, McCollum suggests the company is ""on track to basically deliver sequential revenue growth in the high single digits and margins that are approaching to 20% level... a very, very good outlook.""Other headwindsThe EVP cited headwinds in Europe, Africa and the Caspian regions, and of course, Russia. He notes, ""The Russian activity has been down either for the sanctions or the fact that the ruble is significantly under pressure and we're not immune to the fact that the ruble has been weakening."" The company also observes deepwater basin activity in West Africa and in the North Sea beginning to curtail.The following chart depicts the state of mature fields by firm. Norway's Statoil, with a high proportion of mature fields in decline, is noted by Halliburton as ""curtailing (activity) for a while and they've continued to curtail through this quarter."" The executive also says the company is ""beginning to see rigs lay down in the West Africa area. And we're also continuing to see delays in the North Africa area and Algeria and other as projects get pushed off."" British Petroleum recently announced across-the-board spending reductions in the company, a downsizing of the firm.McCollum surmises that ""some of the initial impact has been more in the international area than it has been in North America."" But he concludes that ""in the lower oil price environment, there is nowhere to hide."" All markets will be equally affected, he suggests, with North America likely ""adjusting as we go into 2015""; rigs will be laid down overall. However, Halliburton counters the cons with utilizing its assets and finding the opportunities in the apparent problems. The company plans to be aggressive in growing its footprint. The Baker Hughes transaction offers a major step toward that aim.Finally, a reminder of the breakdown in ownership and production of oil and gas reserves reveals just who holds the power of the reserve. NOCs own the majority of the world's resources, though large independents like Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY), Marathon (NYSE:MRO), Pioneer (NYSE:PXD) and Apache (NASDAQ:APA) are in the second place.Outside of supply and demand fundamentals, owning vast amounts of the world's oil reserves counts for something. The trick now is figuring out how to re-assess the horizon that changed in the last few months.Other Sources:HAL IR page"
2737045,50582,2014-12-07T18:16:44-05:00,HAL is growing sequentially across all areas.HAL’s margins are growing sequentially across all areas.HAL’s overhead and taxes are barely growing yet put all together analysts have basically flat EPS for estimates. They’re wrong in my opinion.,"For Halliburton's (NYSE:HAL) fourth quarter, the average analyst EPS estimate is $1.20. I believe analysts are being far too conservative, and I'll tell you why. The short version - the same analysts expect a sequential improvement in revenue, yet basically no sequential improvement in EPS. That's nuts.Now, the longer version ... First: According to a presentation by Halliburton CFO Mark McCollum in September (access the Seeking Alpha transcript here), around 92 to 93% of the company's business is contracted. Most (if not all) of which are under long-term fixed pricing. Unless the contracts get blatantly violated, no matter what the price of oil is doing, HAL's revenue and earnings are secure and predictable in the short term.Second: Around 60 to 65% of the contracts were up for renewal in the third and fourth quarters. And, according to Halliburton CEO Dave Lesar during the company's most recent conference call,""In to"" 2015 implies some positive impact in the fourth quarter. Pricing in ""future"" inflation means higher prices now without costs yet.Third: Lesar noted,This means higher gross profits there. Analysts are calling for a 3% improvement in sequential revenue or nearly $300 million, yet almost no sequential improvement in net income. Margins for additional work should be consistent if not better than the past, plus higher pricing should flow directly to HAL's pretax bottom line. HAL's analysts don't seem to reflect this.Fourth: From Lesar again:Next: All major global regions are forecast to show sequential higher sales and profit margins. Since, again, between 92% and 93% of HAL's business is contract work, forecasting the short-term tends to be relatively easy and reliable for HAL.Finally: But what about overhead? According to McCollum in the call, it will rise from $83 million to $90 million. That extra $7 million is almost a rounding error for a behemoth like HAL. Again, consider analysts are calling for nearly $300 million in sequential improvement in sales, and there is no reason to expect profit margins to decline (in fact, they should improve materially, up to 200 basis points of improvement).The only negative I can see is a slightly higher tax rate from 25% to 28-29%. HAL is targeting up to 2% gross profit margin improvement. Two hundred basis points of margin improvement might not sound like a lot, but that 2% on the $9 billion revenue estimate is an extra $180 million in pretax income and something in the neighborhood of over $120 million in after-tax income. If achieved, it would offset the higher taxes by a large amount. I estimate maybe an extra $50 million in taxes tops from the higher tax rate.Putting it all together: Higher sales and higher profit margins on those sales with little overhead and modest tax increases suggest EPS for the fourth quarter should be materially higher than the third quarter. Yet analysts are only calling for EPS of $1.20 compared to $1.19 in the third quarter, which seems to ignore the seemingly flat cost structure. 2015 is another story, but I believe analysts are underselling the fourth quarter, and HAL is going to have a large EPS beat. I will consider going long sometime between now and the earnings report as analysts appear asleep at the wheel and paying too much attention to headline fear."
2705835,24663,2014-11-25T04:56:18-05:00,"There are a lot of questions surrounding whether or not HAL will win regulatory approval to acquire BHI.
        If HAL does acquire BHI, what's the best investment?
        If the deal falls through, is there any investment value?
        Here's how I am hedging the many scenarios.","Since Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) announced its $34.6 billion acquisition of Baker Hughes (BHI), both stocks have been very volatile. Naturally, there is a lot of regulatory risk involved in combining the second and third largest oil field services companies, which might explain the fickleness of investors related to these two stocks. That said, when you look at valuations, the buyout offer, and the competitive advantages, the most logical investment option is quite clear. That is to buy both stocks, and hold long-term.If the deal falls throughHalliburton has already said that it will divest assets equivalent to $7.5 billion in annual revenue to make the Baker Hughes deal more appealing to regulators. Halliburton has also vowed to pay Baker Hughes a $3.5 billion breakup fee if the deal falls through.Clearly, Halliburton is confident that its divestment plan will lead to a successful acquisition, but in the event that regulators deem the acquisition a risk to consumers, both stocks would still be a buy.Specifically, Baker Hughes has added about $7 billion in market capitalization since the deal was announced. If it falls through, half of those gains will be supported with the cash payment from Halliburton. That said, even at Baker Hughes current stock price of $65.83, the stock is still 13% off its 52-week high. While the decline in oil prices have created this loss, oil prices are historically volatile, and as explained in a recent article, have always risen after periods of loss. Therefore, even if the deal falls through, Baker Hughes remains a good investment opportunity at its current price, trading at just 14 times next year's earnings.As for Halliburton, its stock fell 8% last week, thereby making its three month loss more than 25%. Granted, even with lower oil prices, Halliburton has performed better than its peers in North America with 16% sales growth during its last quarter, and has a strong global presence to complement its North American success. At just 10.7 times next year's earnings, Halliburton remains a great investment opportunity regardless of what happens with Baker Hughes.If the deal succeedsAll things considered, the most likely outcome is that Halliburton's $7.5 billion asset sale plan will be enough to please regulators, and the company will digest Baker Hughes to create a $50 billion a year powerhouse in the oil and natural gas industry. In fact, Reuters recently reported that the combined company will control more than half of the cementing market with a leading fracking position in North Dakota. In other words, Halliburton plus Baker Hughes will create a combined company that is bigger, stronger, and more dominant than standalone companies.Not to mention, the combined company will create cost synergies of $2 billion annually, or 4% of their combined revenue. Also, Halliburton will be able to use the proceeds from divestments to create shareholder value, whether it's paying off debt or buying back stock. As a result, the deal would obviously be good for Halliburton, increasing its sales and boosting its margins, making its stock a good long-term buying opportunity.As for Baker Hughes, it's currently trading about 15% below the buyout price. Hence, if the deal is approved, Baker Hughes' stock still has 15% of upside.How I'm hedging the dealRegardless the outcome, both Baker Hughes and Halliburton are presenting a good investment opportunity right now. Personally, I am buying more Baker Hughes stock, as it still has 15% of easy upside and the $3.5 billion breakup fee serves as good downside protection. Not to mention, once acquired, Baker Hughes investors will receive Halliburton stock, meaning investors can then profit long-term from the fundamental gains of the combined companies.However, the key takeaway is that both Halliburton and Baker Hughes are companies presenting value at current prices that should appreciate long-term. The acquisition should be viewed as a bonus, although likely. If it occurs, shareholders will be rewarded even more. Hence, the best hedge is owning both stocks, regardless of what happens."

The goal of this article is to briefly outline the principal benefits of the transaction, and analyze when and if the deal will be accretive to EPS.The strategic and financial benefits:Leverages complementary strengths to create a company with an unsurpassed breadth and depth of products and services. The companies are highly complementary from the standpoint of product lines, global presence and cutting-edge technology in the worldwide oil and natural gas industry. The resulting company will provide a comprehensive suite of products and services to customers in virtually every oil and natural gas producing market in the world. This strategic combination will create an oilfield services supplier with the ability to serve customers through strong positions in key business lines, a fully integrated product and services platform, increased capabilities in the unconventional, deepwater and mature asset sectors, substantial and improved growth opportunities and continued high returns on capital.Generates significant opportunities for synergies.In addition to the compelling and immediate premium BHI stockholders will receive, the transaction will also yield significant synergies. The combination will provide substantial efficienciesof scale and geographic scope, particularly in the Eastern Hemisphere, which will enhance fixed cost absorption. Once fully integrated, HAL expects the combination will yield annual cost synergies of nearly $2 billion. These synergies are expected to come primarily from operational improvements, especially North American margin improvement, personnel reorganization, real estate, corporate costs, R&D optimization and other administrative and organizational efficiencies.Enables increased cash returns to stockholders.HAL expects the transaction to be accretive to cash flow by the end of the first year after closing and to earnings per share by the end of the second year. Halliburton expects that the combined company will maintain a strong investment grade credit profile and substantial financial flexibility. In addition, the combined company will generate significant free cash flow, allowing the return of cash to the combined investor base through dividends, share repurchases and similar actions.Accretion/Dilution AnalysisBelow you will find my basic, yet illustrative accretion/dilution analysis on the merger. The deal is expected to generate 8.4% accretion in 2016E, which is driven by the large cost savings through strategic synergies, as well growth in gross profit margins, among other things. The goal of this analysis is to put the numbers on paper, at their most basic level, so that investors on both sides of the fence can see, at a high level, the potential for accretion in this deal.Source: S&P Capital IQ and SEC FilingsI believe that the decline in HAL's stock price is unwarranted based on its already dismal year, as well as the strong financial prospects that the merger brings to the table. The recent stock decline reflects investor concerns around merger integration risk. I hope that this analysis is illustrative for involved investors, as well as potential ones, and I encourage a broad range of commentary on the analysis and on the deal in general."

In addition, Halliburton is generating strong cash flows, and it returns value to its shareholders by stock buyback and increasing dividend payments.The CompanyCorporate Profile from Halliburton website:Valuation MetricsThe table below presents the valuation metrics of HAL; the data were taken from Yahoo Finance and finviz.com.Halliburton's valuation metrics are excellent; the enterprise value-to-EBITDA ratio is very low at 6.87, and the average annual earnings growth estimates for the next five years is very high at 20.20%. The forward P/E is very low at 10.18 and the PEG ratio is extremely low at 0.57. The PEG Ratio - price/earnings to growth ratio is a widely used indicator of a stock's potential value. It is favored by many investors over the P/E ratio because it also accounts for growth. A lower PEG means that the stock is more undervalued.Latest Quarter ResultsOn October 20, Halliburton reported its third-quarter 2014 financial results, which beat EPS expectations by $0.09 (8.18%) and beat Street's consensus on revenues.The company announced that income from continuing operations for the third quarter of 2014 was $1.0 billion, or $1.19 per diluted share, excluding Macondo-related items. This compares to income from continuing operations for the second quarter of 2014 of $776 million, or $0.91 per diluted share. Reported income from continuing operations for the third quarter of 2014 was $1.1 billion, or $1.33 per diluted share.Halliburton's total revenue in the third quarter of 2014 was a record $8.7 billion, an 8% improvement compared to $8.1 billion in the second quarter of 2014, and a 16% improvement compared to $7.5 billion in the third quarter of 2013. Adjusted operating income was $1.4 billion in the third quarter of 2014, a 21% improvement compared to operating income of $1.2 billion in the second quarter of 2014 and a 24% improvement compared to adjusted operating income of $1.2 billion in the third quarter of 2013. Reported operating income was $1.6 billion in the third quarter of 2014 and $1.1 billion in the third quarter of 2013.In the report, Dave Lesar, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented:Dividend and Share RepurchaseOn October 20, Halliburton announced that its board of directors has approved a 20% increase in its quarterly dividend. The 2014 fourth quarter dividend of eighteen cents ($0.18) a share on the company's common stock is payable on December 26, 2014, to shareholders of record at the close of business on December 5, 2014.Halliburton has been paying uninterrupted dividends since 1972, the forward annual dividend yield is at 1.48% and the payout ratio is only 15%. The annual rate of dividend growth over the past three years was high at 13.4%, over the past five years was at 7.8%, and over the past 10 years was at 7.7%.HAL Dividend data by YChartsSince the company generates lots of cash and the payout ratio is very low, there is a good chance that the company will continue to raise its dividend payment.The company repurchased an additional $300 million in stock during the third quarter.Mr. Lesar commented in the earnings report on October 20:CompetitorsA comparison of key fundamental data between Halliburton and its main competitors is shown in the table below.Halliburton has the lowest P/E ratios and the lowest EV/EBITDA among the stocks in the group. However, its gross margin is the lowest.HAL's Return on Capital parameters have been much better than its industry median, its sector median and the S&P 500 median, as shown in the table below.Source: Portfolio123Technical AnalysisThe charts below give some technical analysis information.Chart: finviz.comThe HAL stock price is 9.61% below its 20-day simple moving average, 16.71% below its 50-day simple moving average and 21.83% below its 200-day simple moving average. That indicates a short-term, mid-term and long-term downtrend.Chart: TradeStation Group, Inc.The weekly MACD histogram, a particularly valuable indicator by technicians, is negative at -1.96 and flat, which is a neutral signal (a rising MACD histogram and crossing the zero line from below is considered an extremely bullish signal). The RSI oscillator is at 28.48 which indicates oversold conditions.Analyst OpinionMany Analysts are covering the company and almost all of them recommend the stock. Among the 33 analysts, 11 rate it as a Strong Buy, 18 rate it as a Buy, and only four analysts rate it as a Hold.TipRanks is a website that ranks experts (analysts and bloggers) according to their performance. According to TipRanks, among the analysts covering HAL stock, there are only four analysts who have the four or five star rating, three of them recommend the stock.Source: TipRanksIs HAL's stock undervalued?Since there is no magic formula that will give us an absolute answer to this question, I have tried to reach a conclusion by comparing five relevant trailing 12 months valuation ratios to their eight-year averages, and calculating a target price in accordance to the eight-year averages. All the data and the tables were taken from Portfolio123.The table below shows the trailing 12 months values of five valuation multiples, their eight-year average, and the target stock price according to the eight-year average, which calls for HAL's stock price target of $66.31, a 36.6% above its last price of $48.54. Of course, no one guarantees that the stock will return to its historical valuation multiples' averages. However, the result demonstrates that, in accordance to its historical valuation ratios, HAL's stock is extremely undervalued.Oil PriceWTI crude oil last price of $74.90 per barrel is down 19.2% year-to-date. Strong dollar, declining demand and increase in US oil production are the main reasons for the drop in the price of oil. However, further significant decline in the price of oil is not expected, since the global economic activity is improving, and because of supply disruption in countries like Syria, Iraq, and Libya.WTI crude oil December 2014 leading contractChart: TradeStation Group, Inc.In order to find out how the price of oil affects the price of Halliburton stock, I have put together on the chart below, the end-of-the-month price of HAL's stock and the price of WTI crude oil in U.S. dollars per barrel.The chart clearly shows that HAL's stock price is following the price of oil. In fact, there is a good correlation between the prices; the coefficient of correlation was at 0.80, much higher than the critical value of 0.19 for 1% significance level (a sample of 180 points).Major DevelopmentsOn November 17, Halliburton and Baker Hughes announced a definitive agreement under which Halliburton will acquire all the outstanding shares of Baker Hughes in a stock and cash transaction. The transaction is valued at $78.62 per Baker Hughes share, representing an equity value of $34.6 billion and enterprise value of $38.0 billion, based on Halliburton's closing price on November 12, 2014, the day prior to public confirmation by Baker Hughes that it was in talks with Halliburton regarding a transaction. Upon the completion of the transaction, Baker Hughes stockholders will own approximately 36% of the combined company. The agreement has been unanimously approved by both companies' boards of directors.Although Halliburton is paying a 31% premium over BHI's October 14 closing price of $59.89, in my view, the acquisition will benefit the company in the long run. Halliburton expects about $2 billion of annual cost synergies with upside from revenue and tax synergies. Furthermore, the combination of the two companies will create a larger, more diverse, and more competitive global company. The combined company will continue to benefit from a bonanza in U.S. drilling, which they helped to support through the development of technology used to extract oil and gas from shale and deep waters. Halliburton is a leader in hydraulic fracturing services, and Baker Hughes has developed some key technology that would help Halliburton expand its offerings in U.S. shale plays.According to thehydrocarbon.com press release from October 20, drilling activity is actually going up in the U.S. despite the crush in oil price. U.S. rig count climb continues despite oil drop. In Q3 2014, the average U.S. onshore rig count added 46 rigs (3%) to make for a total of 1,842 rigs. When matched up with last year's Q3, the total is up 133 rigs or 8%. In fact, in the latest week before the announcement, as oil prices have slumped, the count has still increased by another 18 rigs. A $20 drop in the price of oil has not lowered activity at all.Halliburton has shown earnings per share surprise in three of the last four quarters, as shown in the table below.Data: Yahoo Finance - Analyst EstimatesIn my opinion, the fact that the company has succeeded to beat analyst expectations in three of the last four quarters by a considerable margin demonstrates the strength of its business. Hence, there is a good chance that Halliburton will continue to surprise by reporting better-than-estimate results also in the future.HAL's stock has underperformed the market in the last few years. Since the beginning of the year, HAL's stock has declined 4.4%, while the S&P 500 Index has increased 11.0%, and the NASDAQ Composite Index has risen 12.6%. Moreover, since the start of 2012 HAL's stock has gained only 40.7%, while the S&P 500 Index has increased 63.2%, and the NASDAQ Composite Index has risen 80.5%. However, considering its compelling valuation metrics and strong earnings growth prospects, in my opinion, the stock has plenty of room to move up.ConclusionHalliburton will continue to benefit from the climb in U.S. rig count. Halliburton has compelling valuation metrics and strong earnings growth prospects; its enterprise value-to-EBITDA ratio is very low at 6.87, and its PEG ratio is extremely low at 0.57. The company has shown earnings per share surprise in three of its last four quarters, and according to its historical valuation multiples, the stock is extremely undervalued. In addition, Halliburton is generating strong cash flows, and it returns value to its shareholders by stock buyback and increasing dividend payments. All these factors bring me to the conclusion that HAL stock is a smart long-term investment."
2681495,24627,2014-11-14T02:03:06-05:00,"Potential Halliburton And Baker Hughes Deal Indicates Oil Stocks Are Probably Too Cheap.Oil stocks are cheap and investors should be using this opportunity to add to their portfolios.The drop in oil prices has not even been for a sustained period of time yet, and do not warrant such a large pullback in many oil stocks.A potential deal for Halliburton to buy Baker Hughes shows that industry executives see value and buying opportunities in this sector.","For many investors the daily focus is on the price of oil these days. Oil has declined for a few reasons and some believe it is a deflationary sign that shows economic weakness in Europe and China. Others believe it is a supply issue with U.S. shale producers continuing to expand output. There is also Saudi Arabia which appears to be acting like they will do nothing to reduce production in order to get the upper hand in negotiations when OPEC meets on November 27. Others believe that Saudi Arabia could really be trying to push oil lower in order to put economic pressure on Iran and on Russia which would help the U.S. punish these countries. The Obama Administration has been trying to get Iran to sign a deal on its nuclear program and the deadline for that is coming soon: November 24. The U.S. is also trying to put economic pressure on Russia with sanctions due to its incursion into Ukraine. Both Iran and Russia are facing serious economic pressure due to the recent decline in oil prices and those governments will have trouble meeting their financial obligations if oil prices don't rise. The reality is that it is possible that all of these issues have put pressure on the price of oil.Oil has dropped by about 20% off of recent highs, but it is still trading where it was about 3 to 4 years ago. That doesn't sound like a big crisis to me because back in 2011, oil companies were more than happy to maintain or increase capital expenditures and investors did not seem so obsessively focused on the daily fluctuations of oil. However, today there seems to be near panic and lots of fear (and shorting) of the oil sector. Many small cap oil stocks are down 40 to 50% in just the past few weeks which shows the carnage this sector has seen. For me, this appears to be a huge long term buying opportunity because there is no real crisis with oil being priced where it was in 2011. Companies in the oil sector did fine in 2011, and will do the same today. Furthermore, oil demand is only likely to rise as the population increases globally and as emerging market countries consume more energy. With all the negative headlines and predictions that oil is heading much lower, this seems to be a great time to buy. Oil stocks are downright cheap compared to just a couple months ago and oil has not even had a sustained price drop yet. If oil goes to $70 per barrel or less and actually stays there for several months, then I could see the reason for more caution, but investors have bailed out of this sector as if it were nearly toxic. There is simply too much short-term thinking in the oil market today and this is giving long-term investors a great opportunity to buy cheap. The long term demand for oil was recently detailed in a Seeking Alpha post which stated:The daily volatility in oil prices shows that this market is trading on emotion and fear, and not enough on fundamentals. You can see even more volatility, emotion and fear in small cap oil stocks. I have been watching a number of stocks in this sector and it is not unusual to see a small cap oil stock drop 4-8% on a day when oil is down just 1-2%. This is just plain silly because the value of a company does not change by several percent in just a single day. This shows that too much fear, emotion and short-term thinking is being used to determine the value of oil stocks these days. When you buy a stock, you buy ownership in a business. Many investors are dumping their oil stocks for 40% to 50% less than what these shares were going for just about two months ago. I believe this is a big mistake and totally irrational. If you had a family business, would you take 50% less than what you were offered two months ago or would you wait for a better offer or a better time to sell your business? Personally, I would wait and in fact start buying other businesses that were foolishly being sold for half price. It appears that oil industry executives are doing just that. On November 13, news came out that Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) was in talks to buy rival oilfield services firm Baker Hughes (BHI). Baker Hughes has a market capitalization of more than $20 billion, so this would not be a small deal. Baker Hughes shares jumped by about 15% when this news came out. All of this means that industry executives are seeing value and buying opportunities in this sector and retail investors should start thinking the same way. As the saying goes, ""you can have good news or cheap stock prices, but you can't have both"". It is just a matter of time before oil goes up again, so now is the time to buy cheap.In just a few weeks, I will be writing about beaten down stocks that could be poised for big gains as tax loss selling fades towards the end of the year. Many of these picks are likely to be oil stocks which I believe are poised to rally into January.

2689055,25120,2014-11-18T15:01:00-05:00,"Halliburton announces the major acquisition of Baker Hughes.The multi-billion deal is marked by a big premium, potential regulatory hurdles and a huge break-up fee, worrying investors.The resulting sell-off actually offers opportunities in my eyes at current levels.","Merger Monday starts with another huge deal. After rumors about a deal broke out last week, Halliburton (HAL) announced that it will acquire Baker Hughes (BHI) in a staggering $38 billion deal.The landmark deal results in major consolidation in the oil service field sector which is seeing troubles lately amidst falling oil prices on fears of cuts in capital budgets from oil majors. The larger operations and anticipated economies of scale drive appeal, although Halliburton is paying a price in terms of a steep premium, a huge potential break-up fee and an ambitious divestiture target to achieve its $2 billion in anticipated synergies.Given the disappointing reaction of the market to Halliburton's deal, the market is clearly not as enthusiastic about the transaction which actually offers opportunities in this uncertain environment for energy related stocks.Terms Of The DealHalliburton announced that it has reached a definitive agreement to acquire Baker Hughes, valuing the business at $78.62 per share in cash. Based on those prices, Baker Hughes' equity is valued at $34.6 billion in a deal which including debt values the firm at $38.0 billion.Underlying this deal valuation is the value of Halliburton's share price on November 12, the day before rumors about a deal hit the news wires. The proposed deal has been approved by the board of directors of both the companies. If all goes to plan, Halliburton aims to close the deal in the second half of 2015.Strategic RationaleCombined Halliburton and Baker Hughes offer complementary products and services to its oil and natural gas customers. Combined, the companies employ about 136,000 workers across 80 countries around the world.Halliburton's CEO Dave Lesar is pleased with the deal, stressing benefits for all stakeholders of both companies. Lesar stresses that the companies have complementary technologies which combined create stronger positions and increased capabilities in unconventionals, deepwater and mature segments. Of course combining these operations gives the combination a lot of room to cut costs in terms of real estate, R&D and organizational efforts. Halliburton reckons that combined this could save the company up to $2 billion a year.This move should allow the business to improve its margins substantially going forwards, driving the returns on capital employed by the firm.Financial ImplicationsUnder terms of the deal investors in Baker Hughes stand to receive 1.12 shares of Halliburton as well as $19 in cash for every share in Baker Hughes they currently own. Based on the resulting $38 billion enterprise valuation, Baker Hughes is valued at 8.1 times 2014's consensus EBITDA and at a 7.2 times multiple for the anticipated EBITDA seen in 2015. Following the large stock component in the financing of the deal, shareholders of Baker Hughes will combined own some 36% of the new company.Halliburton stresses the steep 40.8% premium which the company is willing to pay to acquire Baker Hughes based on its unaffected share price. Halliburton justifies the steep premium by pointing out that the deal will be accretive to cash flows in year one, and accretive to earnings per share in year two following closure of the deal. Halliburton sees annual synergies total some $2 billion per year, and the good news is that the realization of these anticipated synergies results in one-time costs of ""just"" $500 million.Baker Hughes has posted trailing sales of around $23.8 billion at this moment, EBITDA of $4.1 billion and net earnings of some $1.3 billion. The $38 billion valuation values the company at 1.6 times sales, as the equity portion of the deal values the company at a steep 26-27 times earnings multiple.Big Concessions To Be MadeOf course mega-deals face a few big hurdles and this deal is no exception. Advisors of both companies have carefully focused on the regulatory approval process of the deal, and as a result Halliburton has announced that it is willing to divest businesses which combined generate $7.5 billion in sales!The company is very serious about this deal, and this is not only witnessed in the concessions which the business is willing to make. Halliburton is furthermore willing to pay Baker Hughes a huge $3.5 billion termination fee (close to 10% of the deal value) if the deal fails to get anti-trust approval, underlying its confidence that the deal will get done.Pro-Forma ValuationAs noted above, the $38 billion deal values Baker Hughes at roughly 1.6 times sales, 9 times trailing EBITDA and 26-27 times earnings. Halliburton in its turn was valued around $52 billion before the deal has been announced. This values the company at 1.6 times trailing sales of $31.7 billion, little over 7 times trailing EBITDA of $7 billion and equity at around 14 times earnings of $3.4 billion.Combined both firms have posted trailing sales of roughly $55 billion, EBITDA of $11 billion and net earnings of close to $5 billion.Baker Hughes has some 438 million shares outstanding which will result in some 490 million new Halliburton shares to be issued to finance the stock portion of the deal. Add to that the 854 million shares of Halliburton which are already outstanding, and the company will have some 1.34 billion shares outstanding.The $19 per share cash component translates into a cash sum of $8.3 billion to be paid as well. Add to that the net debt position of Baker Hughes of $3.4 billion as can be read from the deal announcement, and Halliburton's own net debt position of $5.8 billion, and the company will operate with a net debt position of some $17-$18 billion. The 1.34 billion shares values Halliburton's pro-forma equity at roughly $68 billion with shares trading at around $51 per share. Consequently, the enterprise valuation of the ""new"" Halliburton comes in around $85 billionConsequently, the pro-forma business is valued at around 1.5 times sales and nearly 8 times EBITDA of around $11 billion. Factoring in synergies of $2 billion, which could push EBITDA to $13 billion and the EBITDA multiple drops towards 6.5 times.Net earnings of some $5 billion on a combined basis will take a short term hit as a result of increased financing costs and one-time expenses. Anticipated synergies will in all likelihood grow earnings going forwards to some $6 billion in a year or two. This results in appealing earnings multiples with equity in the business valued around $68 billion.Final ThoughtsThe deal is large, complicated and there are a lot of hurdles along the way including a long timeframe for the anticipated closure as well as many (regulatory) hurdles. That being said, Halliburton is very upbeat about the ability to get approval, given its major gesture which the company has made regarding potential divestitures. The fact of the matter is that the company needs the deal to close, as the break-up fee is enormous.Given the large stock component in the deal, the estimated net debt position of $17-$18 billion going forwards seems manageable, especially in relation to the solid net earnings and EBITDA of the firm. Despite the solid earnings being posted currently, an unexpected further drop in oil prices could push leverage ratio's upwards.That being said, Halliburton has committed itself to divest businesses with sales of up to $7.5 billion a year, a move which could allow the company to free up $10 billion in cash or more. Consequently, the leverage position following the deal remains very much manageable.The combined market valuation of both firm's has risen by just $5-$6 billion following initial rumors about the deal broke out. This increase in value is very small compared to anticipated synergies of some $2 billion per year. As a result the disappointing reaction to the deal offers opportunities for investors, making me quite upbeat at current levels."
2688185,39551,2014-11-17T11:10:34-05:00,"HAL agreed to buy BHI for $34.6 billion;
        If approved, a potential merger would significantly increase HAL’s negotiating power;
        The deal is also positive for the broader oil services sector.","Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) has agreed to buy Baker Hughes (BHI) for about $34.6 billion in a friendly cash and stock deal. While the deal is still subject to regulatory approval, a potential merger would create the largest oilfield services company on sales that would rival Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) and in certain markets these two oilfield majors (HAL/BHI and SLB) would have a de-facto duopoly. Halliburton has said that if required it is willing to divest assets worth $7.5 billion in revenue, although the company believes the regulators would ask for significantly less.Both Halliburton and Baker Hughes have exposure to a number of similar businesses where their market share often ranks at number two or number three to Schlumberger's number one. These business segments include Drillbits, Drilling/Completion Fluids and Wireline. There are also few exceptions, such as Artificial Lift and Specialty Chemicals, where Baker Hughes is the leader while Halliburton is a minor player.What It Means for Halliburton and Rest of the Oil Services Industry?With a potential merger HAL will be able to include BHI's average North American pumping business onto its premium platform. This will improve HAL's negotiating position on large international contracts due to less competition. Integrating Baker's artificial lift products business within Halliburton's mature asset portfolio will also create value for HAL. Baker Hughes' under-levered balance sheet and cheap financing costs also aid the potential deal economics.Due to increased competitive behavior by all of the big three oil services players: Schlumberger, Halliburton, and Baker Hughes, international margins in the most recent cycle remained below prior cycle peak of 2006-08. However, higher prices on major international tenders due to less competition (post HAL-BHI merger) combined with the recent industry wide focus on cost efficiency by oil services majors could help expand margins to rival prior highs in the next up-cycle. At the same time reduced competitiveness could also mitigate some of the likely near-term pressures as activity contracts during a period of lower oil prices. A potential HAL-BHI merger would allow the oil services industry to emerge stronger following the current oil-price driven slump.An Effective DuopolyIn certain markets, such as deepwater, where historically Schlumberger, Halliburton, and Baker Hughes have been the three key players, a potential merger between Halliburton and Baker Hughes would effectively create a de-factor duopoly. However, a combined HAL and BHI would surpass SLB in key technology driven products lines and would also have a dominant share in more commoditized pressure pumping services. Having said that, a deal would still be positive for Schlumberger as the company could benefit from reduced competition for integrated projects and technical services offshore. Weatherford (WFT) could also benefit from less competition in integrated projects, but a potential HAL-BHI merger takes out the possibility of HAL pursuing WFT.Antitrust Scrutiny Apparently The Biggest ChallengeBoth HAL and BHI have exposure to a number of similar businesses globally and one of the biggest challenges to combing the world's second and the third largest oilfield services companies would be scrutiny from antitrust regulators. As you can see from the chart below, post-merger there can be significant levels of concentration in several markets. While some markets, such as LWD (Logging While Drilling) and completion equipment, are particularly noticeable, nearly all markets would be considered moderately or high concentrated post-merger. Moreover, a combined HAL and BHI would have particularly high market share in North America so it's expected that the proposed merger would face the highest scrutiny in North America.Halliburton Willing To Sell AssetsAt first the proposed merger looks challenging and Halliburton might have to sell some assets (which the company is willing to) in order to secure approval for the deal. As Simmons' analyst, Bill Herbert, pointed out fracking overlap could invite some serious scrutiny. Herbert said, ""The fracking overlap is going to invite some scrutiny. It's safe to say the Justice Department scrutiny of this deal is going to be pretty deep."" According to oilfield consultant Spears & Associates, HAL and BHI could together control 39% of the market share post-merger vs. 20% of the closet rival SLB. But it's worth mentioning here that hydraulic fracturing has low barriers to entry and there is still one top competitor [SLB], so it's not like one player will have a long-run pricing power.Moreover, in other big markets such as Drilling & Completions Fluids the combined market share of HAL and BHI (34%) would still be less than SLB (36%). Similarly in Directional Drilling business, combined market share of HAL and BHI (34%) would be close to SLB (31%). There are also businesses, such as Artificial Lift and Specialty Chemicals, where BHI is a major player while HAL's market share is relatively small. Both Artificial Lift and Specialty Chemicals businesses are used in maintaining production in mature basins and HAL has previously stated that it wants to increase its exposure to these businesses.While it is not an attempt to predict the likelihood of the antitrust outcome, Morgan Stanley in its report (published November 14, 2014) said that ""the sophisticated customer base and business-to-business nature of the oilfield services industry - along with potentially other factors - has typically meant mergers face fewer antitrust issues than other industries."" The firm further notes that, ""SLB was not required to divest any of Smith's assets, contrary to expectations that divestiture would be required due to a significant overlap in directional drilling.""Source: Spears & Associates and Goldman SachsConclusionA potential merger with Baker Hughes would make Halliburton the largest oilfield services company and HAL would be able to unseat SLB from the top in several key lines of business. The deal could also be positive for the broader oil services sector, which faces near-term challenges driven by oil price weakness but could re-emerge stronger. The sector has faced increasing competition among the leading players, which resulted in lower international margins. But a potential HAL-BHI merger could strengthen prices and drive up margins. A potential merger is a win-win for both HAL and BHI shareholders, as the transaction values Baker Hughes at $78.62 per share as of November 12, 2014 (BHI closed at $51 on November 12, 2014).I have a bullish view on Halliburton. I believe the company's dominant position in North America, given superior logistics and exposure to the right customers makes it more defensive relative to other North American peers. In weak oil prices world I believe Halliburton, compared to its peers, is better positioned to weather the storm."
2682335,24276,2014-11-15T10:04:47-05:00,"Halliburton's rumored bid shows oil players recognize the oil recession.
        This should be the first deal of many, as strong balance sheets take out weak ones.
        Since these deals are done out of weakness wait for the smoke to clear before getting in.","The oil patch is finally convinced that good times are not coming back any time soon.That's the lesson in Halliburton's (NYSE:HAL) reported move to buy Baker Hughes (BHI).Halliburton is going to have to use mostly stock to buy BHI, assuming a bid emerges from the current talks. It has just $14 billion in current assets, and its debt-to-assets ratio of 25% -- $7.8 billion in debt on $31.6 billion in assets -- makes further borrowings unwise. Baker Hughes, which was worth $22 billion when the talks were leaked, is now worth almost $27 billion, but it's unlikely that Halliburton would find the deal worthwhile at that price.Instead, a stock deal on the order of $25-26 billion should be anticipated, if a deal is there to be made at all. What Halliburton would be seeking would be a stronger balance sheet. Baker Hughes carries about $5 billion in debt on $28.6 billion in assets. The combined company would have about $13 billion in debt on combined equity value of about $73 billion, but expect that value to decline through the spring as interest in oil services stocks recedes.Combining the balance sheets, laying off redundant personnel, and ""rationalizing"" operations (laying off more people) would give the combined companies enough financial strength to get through a couple of years of a U.S. fracking recession, replacing some of that work with international contracts Halliburton still has in abundance.Shares of Weatherford International (WFT) also rose in anticipation that it could also get a bid, but that's unlikely at this point. Weatherford's balance sheet is in even worse shape than Halliburton's, with $7 billion in long term debt riding on $21 billion in assets back in March. Weatherford's market cap is just $12.6 billion, a reflection of that weak balance sheet. While some on Wall Street might see Weatherford as ""cheap"" given its absolute value, what companies in the sector are looking for right now is financial strength, not potential.Whether or not a deal gets done this is probably going to be the first shot in a wealth of merger activity throughout the oil patch, as companies with strong balance sheets look to take on assets cheap, and those with weak balance sheets look for an exit strategy in a shrinking equity market. Should oil prices recover next spring - they're not expected to right now - the buyers in this case will look exceedingly strong. Should prices fail to recover, it's only those with the strongest balance sheets that will survive.For the oilpatch, in other words, it's going to be a long, cold winter. If you're not in Halliburton right now, wait for a deal to get done before getting in. After the anticipated fall in value following a deal, Halliburton shares should be a bargain. Oil isn't dead yet - it probably has one more run left in it - but the best days of the fracking boom are behind the industry."
2681485,53262,2014-11-14T01:55:43-05:00,News that HAL plans to buy BHI gave a strong late day boost to XLE.HAL could be on the road to becoming an unstoppable super power.SLB is the stronger play off the October low.,"Investors were ready and waiting to dive into big energy names this afternoon. Spurred by the news Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) is moving to acquire competitor Baker Hughes (BHI), big price spikes and huge volume were seen across a sector that has struggled with the recent sell-off in oil. As Seeking Alpha's own Carl Surran pointed out earlier this evening, this move could give HAL the leg up over Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) but there are bound to be some growing pains.It is funny, since early October I have been bullish on SLB as well as many other energy names. However, I was not so keen on HAL nor BHI. Nothing personal to the CEO of HAL and potential future Emperor of Earth, its chart just did not seem as strong. As I have mentioned in previous articles, I use chart patterns to identify trends and turning points in sentiment and then look for fundamentals that can explain to me what I am seeing.I mentioned above that investors were ready and waiting, almost too ready. In the last 30 minutes of trading Thursday 23.3M shares of HAL, 9.8M of BHI, 6.7M of SLB, and 11.6M of XLE traded in huge blocks with big fat green bars (not to mention pops throughout the rest of the sector including RIG and DO, see my other recent article on them here). At 55, 55*, 95 and 85 respectively that is $3.44 billion! I had to put an asterisk by 55 for BHI, because its share price rocketed from 50 to 60 in that same 30 minutes. Not exactly throw-away money, especially when many are just now starting to panic about the drop in oil.One of the reasons why I started combing through the charts for companies set to report earnings is that often the sentiment has changed but investors are waiting for some catalyst to assure them. Thursday both SLB and XLE were stretching the limits of retracement tolerances (and my patience) from the move off the October low and dipping into alternate support. Tension was palpable in the ""Trading Room"" among StockWaves subscribers as I updated charts and discussed support levels. So as a chartist and Elliottician I maintain that the setup was there and that investors acted on this HAL news as the catalyst they were ready and waiting for. But that deviant closet fundamentalist in me wanted more of a ""reason"" to share with you readers.Looking at fresh charts of HAL and BHI (although now clouded by the news) up against those of SLB and XLE a new narrative began to unfold that fits very well with the potential ramifications of this merger. HAL gobbling up one of the other big three may give it a stomach ache for a while letting SLB take the lead now in performance off the October lows. I fully expect SLB and XLE to make new highs in the coming year. BHI and HAL while they have the potential to achieve new highs this deal may slow them down into ""resistance"". The engagement may even get pretty rocky for BHI shareholders and a move under 43 could be difficult to overcome. The part of the story I really like is how they line up potentially for AFTER SLB and XLE make those new highs.Both XLE and SLB are set for the final push up in larger corrective patterns off the 2009 lows, inline with USO. That means that when this move up over the next year completes SLB and XLE like likely begin large downturns. If HAL does not break out to new highs with SLB now but rather meanders around the 60s and 70s like someone following the Grateful Dead, it can come down gently into this same 40-50 support region in 2016. HAL could be putting its last few ""ducks in a row"" from this merger while the then high flying SLB has an Icarus-esque fall from grace. This could set up HAL for the i-ii punch to deal the knockout blow to SLB essentially making HAL the only show in town and launching them to the Moon (179 may just be considered low Earth orbit). While the merger may draw scrutiny from regulators now as Surran points out, no politician could ever hope to stand up to Mega-Burton. Well played future Emperor Lesar, well played.Low 50s are not a bad support region to pick up some longer term shares on HAL now if you can tolerate a stop just under the October low. But I would watch the pattern carefully over 60 for signs of a move back down to retest support under 50. I think SLB has a much clearer bottom at 86 and while it too has some resistance to break past in the 110 region it has a clearer path to new highs.The first time I looked at an SLB chart was before their earnings report July 18th 2013, when one of my StockWaves members asked me to take a look. I saw a nice setup pattern off of the June 2012 low that would take them a good deal higher, at the time I think my long term projection was 102 (the 161.8% extension off 67). The Next time was August 14th 2014 as it was coming down into the 106s off a 118.76 high (I do not recall if it was the same member that asked). I noted that SLB was then coming into support for at least a bounce but then possibly lower toward 100. We started looking for a bottom in SLB in early October, and while the extension down from September in oil weighed heavily on many XLE components, SLB and the index held lower supports and made strong statement off the lows. I am projecting SLB and XLE to complete v-th-waves to new highs in the coming year, XLE targets 117 off 77 and SLB targets 149 to 172 off 86.Emperor Lesar... has a nice ring to it actually."

Baker Hughes has a reputation for an outstanding product line-up and a strong culture of innovation and high-quality engineering. However, the company has struggled to convert its product offering into competitive operating margins company-wide. The graph below shows that despite many corporate initiatives aimed at increasing the company's financial results and preserving market share (including the $5.5 billion acquisition of BJ Services in 2010), Baker Hughes has failed - throughout the two most recent industry up-cycles - to keep pace with its large-cap peers. Baker Hughes' stock, alongside another lagging integrated oil service provider Weatherford International (WFT), has fallen further and further behind Schlumberger and Halliburton.(Source: Yahoo Finance)While many sell-side analysts have continuously, year after year, predicted that Baker Hughes' operating margins would soon bridge the gap to Halliburton, the forecast did not materialize to the degree expected. From this perspective, merging with a stronger competitor at a high premium and preserving the upside through the stock exchange is, arguably, a more certain outcome for Baker Hughes shareholders than a ""go it alone and keep promising a turnaround"" strategy.Benefits to Halliburton's shareholders are somewhat less obvious. A case can be made that despite paying a high premium, Halliburton would be able to recover its upfront investment by turning around the financial performance of what is, in essence, a strong suite of products and a quality service franchise. However, that is precisely what Baker Hughes has attempted to do all the way along, and it remains to be seen if Halliburton has a silver bullet.Notwithstanding all the arguments presented this morning by Halliburton defending the merits of the acquisition, the transaction raises a significant number of questions.(Source: Halliburton, November 2014)With all these considerations in mind, there are many risks to value that, in combination with a hefty premium to Baker Hughes' current stock price being paid, draw against the potential benefits of this strategic move to Halliburton.I would argue that indirectly but very significantly benefiting from this announcement is Schlumberger. The transaction is effectively eliminating the weaker of its two major competitors, particularly in the international area where service contracts can be very lumpy and are bid in highly competitive auctions. While Schlumberger may not win any significant market share from the Halliburton/Baker Hughes consolidation, it will likely win from the ensuing stronger margins and more predictable pricing. It may also receive better client response during the time when the Baker Hughes and Halliburton organizations will go through transition period uncertainties.Disclaimer: Opinions expressed herein by the author are not an investment recommendation and are not meant to be relied upon in investment decisions.

2638355,30811,2014-11-04T15:50:58-05:00,"Halliburton can continue to sustain the 20% annual dividend growth over the next few years with both free cash flow and earnings payout trends being steady.The current stock valuation implies a dividend growth rate of only around 10%.If the 20% dividend growth continues into 2015 and 2016, an incremental share value of about $5, or 10% from the current level could be realized.","At $55, the stock price of Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) now trades at almost 26% off from its 52-week high achieved in July 2014 thanks to the oil price pullback in the past few months. From a dividend investing perspective, I believe the stock is undervalued at $55 as the company's strong dividend growth potential is underappreciated by the current valuation. In this article, I will present my cash flow and dividend forecast analyses that are supportive of the opinion.To get a sense of Halliburton's capacity for near-term future dividend growth, I have built a model that projects free cash flows between 2014 and 2016. My analysis relies on current consensus revenue estimates, which predict the sales to increase by 6.9% CAGR from $33.0B in 2014 to $37.7B in 2016 (see the chart below).The company's operating cash flow margin trended between 12.3% and 16.4% in the past 5 years with an average of 14.3%. To be fair, I used the historical average as the cash margin for 2015. After 2015, I assumed the margin to expand by 150 bps and reach 15.8% by 2016 (see the first chart). This is conservative relative to current consensus expectation of an almost 300 bps EBITDA margin expansion over the period. My lower cash margin expansion assumption essentially implies a declining EBITDA to operating cash flow conversion rate.In terms of capital expenditure, I used management's guidance of $3.0B for 2015. The spending was then assumed to reach $3.8B by 2016, which is consistent with consensus estimates. Based on the above assumptions, free cash flow was projected to increase by 12.0% from $1.7B in 2014 to $2.2B in 2016, and the growth is primarily driven by the sales growth and higher margin (see the first chart).Halliburton paid a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share in the past 3 quarters of 2014. The quarterly dividend was recently raised by 20% to $0.18 per share, which is expected to be paid out in the next 4 consecutive quarters. Hence, the annual dividend for 2014 should be $0.63 per share.To get to the $0.63 annual dividend per share, I calculated the total dividend payment would be approximately $534M in 2014 based on my average share count estimate (discussed later). This represents a 14.9% growth from the prior year. Compared to my free cash flow forecast for the year, the implied free cash flow payout ratio is 31%, which is in line with the prior year level (see the first chart).Given that Halliburton's free cash flow will be considerably higher than annual dividend payment and the company recently announced a $6B share repurchase authorization, I assumed 100% of excess free cash flow (i.e., free cash flow after dividend payment) to be spent on share buybacks. As a result, the share buyback value was estimated to increase from $1.2B in 2014 to $1.4B in 2016 (see the first chart).As my estimated share repurchase value in 2014 is only marginally higher than the year-to-date amount of $1.0B as at September 30, 2014, I assumed September 2014 year-to-date average share account to be the annual average share count for 2014. Based on an average buyback price assumption of $62.5 for 2014, an annual price growth of 12%, and a 25% haircut on estimated share count reduction to account for dilution impact from potential equity issuance, the average share count will be reduced to 820M by 2016 (see the first chart).Now, the cash flow and dividend forecast model is complete. To test Halliburton's dividend growth capacity, I assumed a 20% annual growth in dividend per share for 2015 and 2016, meaning that the annual dividend will reach $0.91 by 2016 (see the first chart).Based on the calculation, annual dividend payment would need to grow by 18% per annum in order to support the 20% per share dividend growth (see the first chart). There are a few indicators suggesting that the company can comfortably support the level of dividend per share growth over the forecast period:Based on Gordon Growth Dividend Discount Model with a forward annualized dividend of $0.72 per share and a 12% cost of equity (calculated by CAPM by using 2.5% risk-free rate, 6.0% equity risk premium, and the stock's 5-year beta of 1.57), the current share price of $55 implies a dividend growth rate of about 10.6%, which is substantially below what I believe the growth to be over a medium term and the market's long-term EPS growth expectation (see chart below).I then used a 2-stage dividend discount valuation model to quantify the incremental stock value resulted from the difference between the implied dividend growth and the medium-term dividend growth potential. The first stage incorporates my view that the 20% annual dividend per share growth can persist through 2016 and the second stage represents a perpetual growth state with the 10.6% implied dividend growth rate. Based on the 12% cost of equity, I arrived at a share value of $60.52, which is $5, or 10%, above the current share price (see chart below).In summary, long-term income investors should seriously consider buying Halliburton at $55 given that the robust dividend growth potential is not fully captured by the current valuation. Based on my dividend growth forecast, dividend yield on cost ($55) would reach 2.0% by Q4 2016, which is a significant bump from 1.3% as of now.All charts are created by the author, and historical data used in the article and the charts is sourced from S&P Capital IQ, unless otherwise specified."
2688125,22148,2014-11-18T10:52:49-05:00,"Halliburton buys Baker Hughes for a significant premium.The stock remains a solid buy based on value.The original investment thesis was somewhat compromised based on the lower oil prices, but the ultimate value in Halliburton is further enhanced by this deal.","Prior to the open, Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) announced an agreement to acquire Baker Hughes (BHI) to create a global leader in the oilfield services sector. Depending on the amount of required divestitures, the combined entity will have a revenue base in excess of current leader Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB). The surprising deal agreement follows a climatic week where it appeared the merger had stalled and now provides a value proposition to the premium value the market assigns to Schlumberger. As well, the deal counters the headwinds in the oilfield services sector following a few months of declining oil prices with Halliburton paying all-time highs for Baker Hughes. With the transaction roughly 76% based on the value of Halliburton shares, Baker Hughes is having a muted reaction in early market action due to the decline in Halliburton.The deal values Baker Hughes at $78.62 per share, or a 31% premium to the closing price on Friday. The transaction consideration includes $19.00 in cash and 1.12 Halliburton shares for each share of Baker Hughes. The deal values Baker Hughes at roughly 8.1x consensus 2014 EBITDA estimates. The new entity has roughly $57.5 billion in estimated 2014 revenues and a market cap of only a little over $70 billion based on the initial market trades. Halliburton estimates that cost synergies of up to $2 billion can be achieved helping make the deal accretive to shareholders in the second year after closing. A prime reason for the deal is the premium valuation assigned to Schlumberger. Based on the initial flat trading, Schlumberger has a equity value of nearly $123 billion with a 2014 forecasted revenue base of only $49 billion. Not accounting for any divestitures, the new Halliburton has a revenue base of roughly $8.5 billion, or 17%, more than Schlumberger with a market equity value $50 billion lower. The vast differences in the valuation multiples is a prime reason for Halliburton paying a huge premium for Baker Hughes.The original investment thesis in the article ""Halliburton: North America Advantage"" found Halliburton attractive due to a large valuation gap. While it appears clear that Baker Hughes investors are the big beneficiaries with the large premium buyout, Halliburton investors will benefit significantly if the market eventually awards a market multiple to its earning stream similar to the one assigned to Schlumberger. The companies face a potentially declining oilfield services industry, but the valuation creation from this deal could easily offset those headwinds. Investors should use any market weakness to snap up shares at a cheap market multiple."
2523725,70005,2014-09-26T13:06:13-04:00,"Eying business growth Halliburton (HAL) has been focused on three main oil service market sections. Mature fields, conventional plays and deepwater were responsible for almost 60% of the firm’s revenue.
        Recorded a CAGR of nearly 31% in the past two years. The company expects that the business will continue to outperform the market by almost 25% in the following years.
        The company recently announced that it has reached a settlement deal with plaintiffs, worth almost $1.1 billion. The settlement is for the Gulf of Mexico oil spill in 2010.","Eying business growth Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) has been focused on three main oil service market sections. Mature fields, conventional plays and deepwater were responsible for almost 60% of the firm's revenue in the ongoing year. The company's focus on deepwater exploration has been owing to a plunge in accessible reserves of oil and gas - both onshore and shallow water.With a CAGR of nearly 31% in the past 24 months, HAL's deepwater exploration and business has been faring significantly better when juxtaposed with the market. As we move forward, the firm expects the business to continue outperforming the market by nearly 25% in the coming years.This prediction is despite the predicted sluggish growth in the oil market since more oil reserves have been discovered after various exploration efforts. Furthermore, oil companies have shifted their focus towards boosting returns for the capital invested in the business. This is another factor that could hinder HAL's deepwater business.Most of HAL's deepwater business growth is from Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa regions. Offshore rigging activity in countries like Nigeria is on the rise. HAL is also carrying out subsea testing and wire line services in Angola. Although Brazil seems to be in a tight spot lately, due to reduction in drilling activities by Petrobras, long term growth in the activity of deepwater exploration is expected. There are expectations that Petrobras may spend more than $150 billion on upstream capex during the next five years.Following the largest offshore oil spills in U.S. history - the Gulf of Mexico spill - the company recently announced that it has reached a settlement deal with plaintiffs, worth almost $1.1 billion. The payment for damages is to be made in three installments in order to compensate for those commercial fisheries and property holders who suffered as a result of the oil spill. The company was liable for accountability since BP lay the blame for the well's defective construction on HAL.The latest development has reduced the uncertainty about the HAL's legal reserves. Previously the company had voluntarily set aside $1.3 billion for costs related to the oil spill. The settlement of the individual plaintiffs does not allow Halliburton to breathe a sigh of relief since it still has a number of other lawsuits pending.HAL recently announced its second quarter income from operations that amounted to $776 million. This was higher than the income from the Q1, which was $623 million. Earnings per share have also increased in Q2 and stood at 91 cents per share. In the quarter prior to this, earnings per share amounted to 73 cents per share.Total revenue was reported at $8.1 billion for Q2, while revenues in Q1 stood at $7.3 billion. Operating income increased by 23% from the previous quarter and was recorded at $1.2 billion.In North America HAL's Q2 revenue increased 11% with the operating income being up 31% as compared to Q1 of ongoing year. This has outpaced a 4% hike in the U.S. rig count. Levels of service intensity are expanding with volumes per well witnessing an increase of more than 35% as compared to Q2 of last year.HAL's recent robust financial performance has allowed the company to enhance shareholder distributions without compromising on robust liquidity for the funding of future growth. The company's board has recently approved $4.8 million for stock purchase authorization. This would take the total repurchase capacity of Hal to $6 billion.It showcases the company's confidence as far as the business outlook, shareholder distribution and returns are concerned.Moody's recently changed the negative outlook of the company and rated it stable, while also affirming the A2 rating and Prime 1 rating for its commercial paper.HAL has undoubtedly been doing pretty well. Its shares have received a consensus 'buy' recommendation from analysts with the average target price set for the share is at $77.10. HAL is already outperforming the market and further maintains a 25% growth margin relative to the market, which serves as an encouragement for investors to invest in a company that expects growth despite the challenges in its segment.Financially, the company is sound. Its reported results indicate improvements in increasing revenues and earnings for the company. With share buybacks on the agenda, earnings per share are expected to rise in the future as well. An improvement in rating by Moody's is also a factor that impacts shareholder confidence and boost demand for the company's shares, further raising prices.Now that the company has finally reached a settlement in the oil spill case that it was facing, shareholders and investors will find that the lack of uncertainty will no longer be one of the issues that could cause the company's share value to decline in the future.With growth prospects looking good, and the financial position looking healthy and stable, we agree with the consensus rating of 'buy' for HAL."
2485665,66813,2014-09-10T16:16:39-04:00,"The oil well services industry is benefiting from the energy revolution in America.
        Halliburton has the largest percentage of revenue from North American production compared to Schlumberger (SLB) and Baker Hughes (BHI).
        U.S. rig count increasing in Q3 after strong growth in Q2.","Four companies in the oil well service industry reported strong Q2 results, but the stocks are down 11-12%: Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB), Halliburton , Baker Hughes (BHI), and FMC Technologies (NYSE:FTI). In this article, I articulate why the stocks are down and evaluate which is the most attractive investment opportunity.All 4 companies reported strong Q2 results with revenue up an average of 10.6% y-o-y and operating margins up an average of 250 bps y-o-y. Schlumberger sited strength in their international operations, but also noted a rebound in U.S. land activity. The strongest revenue growth Schlumberger was in the U.S. at 15.8% y-o-y. The Middle East & Asia Area had revenue growth of 11.7%. The strongest margin expansion during the quarter was also in the Middle East & Asia Area with 320 bps of improvement. The product breakdown shows strong revenue growth in the Production Group and the Drilling Group with Q2 y-o-y growth of 10.6% and 9.8%. Margin expansion was strongest in the Drilling Group with 220 bps of improvement.Baker Hughes noted strength in onshore and offshore activity in the U.S. The Middle East & Asia Pacific Region had the strongest y-o-y revenue growth of 18.3% in Q2. Revenue in the U.S. growth 6.2% and operating margins expanded 410 bps.Halliburton also reported strong growth in the U.S. with revenue at 14.3% and operating margin expansion of 70 bps. The Middle East and Asia region posted revenue growth of 12.3% and margin expansion of 130 bps. Halliburton's business is skewed more toward production with their Completion and Production unit gathering 61.4% of revenue compared to 35.4% at Schlumberger. Schlumberger is stronger in characterization and drilling.FMC Technologies specializes mainly in subsea technology solutions for energy production. The subsea unit garners 66.9% of revenue. FMC Technologies offers subsea well planning and development services to shorten time to first oil and to increase uptime and recovery. FMC Technologies does not offer the full range of well services offered by Schlumberger, Halliburton and Baker Hughes. FMC Technologies also does not breakout Russian exposure and mainly operates in the Gulf of Mexico. The stock has taking a beating on cautious guidance from the CEO, John Gremp, at the Barclays CEO Energy - Power Conference last week.In the U.S., the Q2 average rig count was up 4.0% sequentially and up 5.2% y-o-y. The increase in U.S. rigs has continued in Q3 up 2.3% sequentially and up 7.1% y-o-y. This growth in rig count reverses the decline of -8.2% in 2013. Growth in the U.S. rig count has come entirely in the horizontal drill trajectory. Horizontal drilling is mainly used to increase production of existing wells rather than exploration to find new oil plays. This completely jives with the increase in U.S. oil production and the recent focus on production rather than exploration by the E&P companies.The graph above clearly shows the dramatic increase in U.S. production, which corresponds to the increased utilization of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing.The first reason these stocks are down is because energy prices are down, particularly oil. The June 19 YTD high price on Brent was $115.19, and the June 20 YTD high on WTI was $107.95. Brent is down -13.0% to $100.20, and WTI is down -14.2% to $92.66. Both Brent and WTI are at their YTD low. Two reasons oil prices are down: increased U.S. production, and a strong U.S. dollar (NYSEARCA:USD).Global commodities priced in USD will exhibit price weakness if the USD strengthens. The USD has had a big run up since July on strength in U.S. economy and the potential for earlier Fed tightening. The USD appears that it might now be at a resistance level.If the USD halts its recent parabolic ascent, then oil should have better support. The price of oil appears that it might be at a support level. The price of oil is an important backdrop when investing the energy sector.Lower oil reduces earnings estimates and earnings multiples for the oil service stocks. If oil stabilized or rebounds from here, this would become a tailwind to the stocks.The second reason oil well service stocks are down is the Russia sanctions. Many oil well service stocks do business in Russia, including Schlumberger, Halliburton and Baker Hughes. If these companies can no longer export products containing U.S. technology, then this could hamper their revenue and profits in the region.The Russian sanctions are a definite risk to Q3 results. Both Schlumberger and Halliburton have given estimates of the impact of Russian sanctions on Q3 earnings, 3 cents and 2 cents per share. Certainly if the sanctions drag on for some time or are expanded in scope, this would introduce further downside and uncertainty to earnings in Q4, 2015 and beyond.The sanction impact estimates, 3 cents and 2 cents in Q3, both represent a 2% hit to earnings for both Schlumberger and Halliburton. Applying this 2% haircut to all future earnings and a constant earnings multiple, equates to a 2% reduction in the stock price. In addition, the multiple should actually be reduced due to the reduction in earnings growth.Both the lower price of oil and the Russian sanctions have a similar effect on oil well service stocks. Earnings estimates are lowered and earnings multiples are also lower. The result is a fairly uniform selloff of 11-12%. Multiples on earnings are down 1.5x - 2x turns. Is this reduction in the multiple enough to account for the lower earnings growth and increased uncertainty?Look at the valuation of these stocks:Schlumberger is probably the best operator followed by Halliburton then Baker Hughes. This is represented in their operating margins: Schlumberger is highest at 19.5%, Halliburton at 14.8%, and Baker Hughes at 11.9%. Schlumberger has a higher valuation; 1.8x turns (enterprise value to EBITDA) higher than Halliburton, 9.4x versus 7.6x.The secular trend in the oil service sector is the energy revolution in the U.S. Schlumberger has less exposure to North America, 32.3% of revenue, than Halliburton, 54.0%, and Baker Hughes, 48.6%. Schlumberger is also not as heavily weighted in production, which is the currently strongest part of the U.S. oil well service business. Halliburton has a multiple 1.4x turns (EV/EBITDA) higher than Baker Hughes, 7.6x versus 6.2x.All 4 of these companies are attractive investment right now, particularly if you think the price of oil is bottoming and the effect of the sanctions is at its peak. FMC Technologies is a bit of a one off case due to the CEO's caution. Of the 4, Halliburton is the most attractive stock to buy on the strong U.S. energy theme, because of its higher exposure to North America and its large production business. Halliburton's business is performing great, and Q3 is likely to continue this strength. The sanctions and oil price are a risk, but these are already in the price, making Halliburton the best buy."

Analysts have anticipated significant growth in revenues, although they anticipated sales to increase to just $8.53 billion.Net earnings saw significant growth as margins rose on the back of sales growth. Net earnings of $1.20 billion were up by 70.2% compared to last year as earnings jumped by 55.5% on a sequential basis.Amidst a reduction in the outstanding share base Halliburton managed to increase earnings on a per share basis even quicker. Net earnings of $1.41 per share rose by 78.5% compared to last year.Some incidental items have aided reported earnings in a big way over the past quarter. Adjusted earnings for the quarter came in at $1.19 per share, coming in eight cents ahead of expectations.A Look Into The QuarterCEO Dave Lesar was happy with the results driven by the strong revenue growth which outpaced industry growth. Strong earnings growth has been driven by some one-time items including a $100 million reduction in the loss contingency for the Macando well incident, as well as a $95 million increase in the insurance recovery for the settlement. Combined, this added some $195 million in operating earnings.Completion and production revenues were up by 20.4% to $5.42 billion on an annual basis. The unit improved operating margins to 19.8% of sales, a 280 basis points improvement compared to the year before. Strong sales growth as well as increased stimulation services, which carry higher margins, were the drivers behind the higher margins.Drilling and evaluation revenues were up by 10.4% to $1.07 billion as operating margins improved by just a million to $451 million. Reported operating margins of 13.7% of sales have been down some 140 basis points compared to the year before on the back of lower activity levels in the Gulf of Mexico, among others.In terms of geographies it was North America which drove growth with sales being up by 21.7% to $4.72 billion, making up 54% of total revenues. The activities in the Middle-East and Africa posted sales of $1.47 billion, a 17.5% increase on an annual basis. In Europe and Africa sales came in at $1.46 billion, a 9.3% increase as sales in Latin America rose by just 4.3% to $1.04 billion.As discussed, the company saw some one-times items significantly adding to reported earnings this quarter. As discussed, the Macondo well incident added $195 million in pre-tax earnings while a settlement with KBR added $63 million in pre-tax earnings as well. Given that these are no structural items, it is important to correct for them and not relay on the headline results of the earnings report.ValuationAt the end of the quarter, Halliburton held some $2.0 billion in cash and equivalents as the total debt position of $7.8 billion results in a net debt position of around $5.8 billion. Besides the regular debt, the company furthermore has $1.2 billion in loss contingencies for the Macando well incident being apparent on the balance sheet. On top of that are some post-retirement liabilities which make that Halliburton carries quite some leverage, in an industry which traditionally shuns significant leverage positions.At the same time the company has some 854 million shares outstanding which at $55 per share values equity in the business at around $47 billion.On a trailing basis, Halliburton has posted revenues of $31.7 billion with net earnings having increased to $3.4 billion. Based on these metrics, equity in the business is valued at 1.5 times annual revenues and 13-14 times annual earnings.History Of Solid GrowthSince 2005 the company has grown from roughly $10 billion in sales to some $32 billion on a trailing basis. Net earnings from continuing operations have been volatile in terms of margins, ranging anywhere between 7 and 20% of reported sales, with after tax margins currently seen around 10-11% of sales. The company has repurchased nearly 20% of its outstanding share base over this time period, adding to growth on a per share basis.Shares have been very volatile falling from levels of $50 in 2008 to levels around $15 within the time frame of just a few months later. This was amidst the plunge in oil prices resulting from the economic crisis and the disaster of BP's (NYSE:BP) Deepwater Horizon in which the company was a subcontractor.Ever since shares have steadily risen, although the performance of the stock has been volatile. Shares reached highs of $74 per share in July as they have fallen some 30% to current levels at $53 per share.A Focus On Growth, But What About Superior Margin Claims?At the second quarter earnings presentation, Halliburton made the investment case for the business. The company cited the increasing demand for liquids across the globe in the coming years, which goes hand in hand with higher spending especially as projects become more complex. Recently the International Energy Agency lowered the outlook for demand growth this year, although growth is expected to continue at a modest pace in the coming years.To benefit and gain share in this growing market, Halliburton focuses on key strategic markets such as the deepwater, mature fields and unconventional plays. New technologies have a lot more benefits for these mature fields, being able to lengthen their economic and producing lives. At the same time, the relative intensity of equipment and services provided by Halliburton increases with deepwater and especially unconventional plays, leveraging the company's strong position in North America.Halliburton frequently cites the long term growth which the company has seen as it outperformed the growth rates reported by competitors, while the company claims superior margins.Those claims might be overextended to some degree with industry leader Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) posting sales of $48 billion per annum at the moment, roughly 1.5 times the sales posted by Halliburton. Earnings of nearly $7 billion posted by the company are roughly double those of Halliburton as net margins of close to 14% on an after-tax basis are much better than those of Halliburton. It should be noted that Halliburton's leverage position is relatively higher, depressing earnings with higher interest payments.This has resulted in a premium valuation of Schlumberger's shares which trade at a roughly 20% premium in terms of the equity valuation, given the superior margins and the lower relative leverage.Final ThoughtsBesides the results, the most important message in the earnings report was undoubtedly the comment from CEO Dave Lesor that he believes lower oil prices are not sustainable, and that a balance in the market will return shortly. This expectation for a quick rebound in oil prices is similar to the comments made from executives like Schlumberger and Baker Hughes (BHI) which released their earnings a few days earlier.To reflect on this optimism, the company furthermore hiked its dividend by twenty percent to $0.18 per share on a quarterly basis, for a still modest dividend yield of 1.3%. These payout are however accompanied by share repurchases, currently being executed at a rate of $1.2 billion per year, or about 2.5% of the current market capitalization.It was in July when I last checked out the prospects following the second quarter earnings release. At the time I noted the many controversies in which the business has been involved in over the past decades including the Deepwater Horizon, controversies regarding contracts in Iraq and the close ties to former Vice President Dick Cheney. Despite that, the company has shown impressive sales growth although margins have not been too impressive recently, currently coming in at 10-11% of sales.These margins trail those of industry leaders and the historical peak performance. At the same time, the company continues to forecast years of consecutive growth to come, as it continues to anticipate to achieve market share gains.At the time when I checked out the prospects, shares still traded at around $71 per share as I concluded that I was blown away by the significant momentum, with shares having gained some 40% at that point year to date. At current levels, shares offer a much greater opportunity as the company has seen a big correction ever since with the company not anticipating a great impact from falling oil prices on the business."
2577605,39551,2014-10-21T05:16:57-04:00,"HAL reported exceptional quarterly results.The company reported highest sales growth among peers and 19.2% North American margins.HAL, after two years of strategic initiatives including realigning its customer base and implementation of Battle Red, is better positioned than most to effectively weather a downturn.","Halliburton (NYSE:HAL), the world's second largest oil services company, reported exceptional quarterly results. The company reported adjusted 3Q14 EPS of $1.19 vs. consensus estimates of $1.10. The Houston, Texas based company reported highest sales growth among peers and 19.2% North American margins. It was a very impressive quarter for Halliburton, setting revenue and income records in the entire Eastern Hemisphere and North America with the laggard of Latin America seeing a strong recovery with revenues up 16% sequentially and operating income doubling.On Track To Achieve North American TargetsHalliburton registered sales growth of 8% Q/Q and 16% Y/Y, beating peers by 300bps Q/Q and 800bps Y/Y. Loop currents, Russia, Iraq, Libya, and Norway were all drags on results, implying significant upside from an end to unrest and return to peace in these regions. Halliburton is on track to reach its North American goals, as the company's North American business is positioned to outperform in an environment of supply chain constraints and oil price risk.The company's North American revenues increased 9% sequentially as service intensity complemented growth in horizontal rig count. Halliburton's President, Jeff Miller, noted during the call that stage counts are up 30% Y/Y and sand usage is up 50% Y/Y. Halliburton has benefited the most from recovery in North America. The company has outpaced peers in Y/Y revenue growth, achieving a 21.7% increase since 3Q13 vs. Baker Hughes' (BHI) 10.5% and Schlumberger's (NYSE:SLB) 18.1%.Pressure Pumping Continues To ImproveLike its peers, Halliburton was also impacted by rigs being idle from loop current issue with management stating that the loop current issue likely cost them about a penny in the quarter. In the Gulf of Mexico, HAL has a very large drilling fluids business that was impacted, a strong completions business that will ramp up next year as completion activity in the Lower Tertiary picks up, and a strong drilling business as well.The pressure pumping market has tightened and the company is beginning to realize pricing improvements and more favorable cost-inflation concessions. Halliburton is putting new equipment to work with margins that meet or surpass the exit margin of 20%+. HAL has no idle equipment at all and is adding approx. 200,000 horsepower to the U.S. fleet through Q1. The company had considered adding as much as a million horsepower to the existing industry fleet of about 19 million horsepower through 2015. However, oil prices could change that.Better Positioned Than Others To Weather A StormWhile 2015 activity could decline or at least slow its growth, it is unlikely that the industry will see any significant price or margin erosion especially at the higher end of capability. In fact in the weaker markets, HAL typically gains market share as its ability to bundle, discount, and provide more economic technologies increases.The declining oil prices continue to pose a number of questions, including when will prices bottom and what will be the impact of the price decline on North American activity? While it's difficult to answer these questions with certainty, even in a worst case scenario of a low activity environment, investors should be confident of Halliburton's ability to operate successfully. The company, after two years of strategic initiatives including realigning its customer base and implementation of Battle Red, is better positioned than most to effectively weather a downturn.More Cash For ShareholdersHalliburton also increased its quarterly dividend by 20% to $0.18 per share and the stock is now yielding 1.4%. This increased the payout ratio to 14% of 2015 consensus estimates vs. the company's 15-20% target range. I believe the company will increase its dividend again in 2015. The company also repurchased $300 million (4.4 million at $68 per share) worth of shares during the third quarter and I will not be surprised to see larger opportunistic buybacks at the current share price.ConclusionHalliburton's dominant position in North America, given superior logistics and exposure to the right customers makes it more defensive relative to other North American peers. U.S. is no longer the marginal oil producer and Halliburton due to its dominant position in North America should further benefit from relative spending economics in the U.S. I'm not saying oil prices have reached a trough but I believe Halliburton, compared to its peers, is better positioned to weather the storm. Halliburton's exposure to the better operators allows it to benefit from higher utilization and cushioning risk around cash running dry for less efficient E&Ps in lower oil price environment."
2573915,74855,2014-10-20T04:16:26-04:00,"As the third quarter results of Halliburton are expected to come in within the next few days, analysts are hopeful of a strong showing by the company.
        Analysts expect that the company will be able to book earnings at $1.11 per share. They also expect revenues to be reported at $8.53 billion for the quarter.
        The North American rig count continues to experience growth at a fast pace, which means that Halliburton could gain from this as well.
        Oil price volatility is expected to continue, and oil prices should remain depressed in the future as well. Halliburton should remain immune to this volatility in the near term.
        The 52-week range for Halliburton’s stocks has been noted at $47.60-$74.33. The one year price target for the share has been set at $78.41.","Optimism sets in as Halliburton (NYSE:HAL), the world's second largest oilfield services company, gears up to announce its third quarter results for 2014.The earlier announcement of the second quarter results for the company reported total revenue for the quarter at $8.1 billion. This was nearly 11% higher than the revenues that were reported in the first quarter of the year. Operating income for the company spiked by 23% over the first quarter and was reported at $12 billion. This jump was a result of the improvement in activities of the company in the Eastern Hemisphere, and more importantly, in North America. When highlighting the exceptional performance in North America, the company laid emphasis on the 11% increase in revenues from North America, which surpassed the 4% growth in the US rig count.Income from operations were reported at $776 million; 24.6% higher than the income that was reported in the third quarter. The second quarter income translated into an earnings per share of 91 cents, which had also increased by the same percentage.Moving forward into the third quarter, the company expects that the margins in the North American region are likely to continue improving and could be expected at almost 20%. The company is also executing growth strategies in the Eastern Hemisphere and expects full year revenue growth from this region to come in at low double digit figures.Analysts expect that the company will be able to book earnings at $1.11 per share, which is higher than the 83 cent earnings per share that it reported in the previous year. Moreover, analysts also expect revenues to be reported at $8.53 billion for the quarter, registering a 14% increase over the revenues that were reported in the prior year's third quarter.For the full fiscal year, earnings projections per share are at $3.99. Revenues for the year are projected at $32.76 billion.During the announcement of the second quarter results, the company indicated that they expected North American growth to continue, which will lead to better results coming in for Halliburton as well. After analyzing the oil and gas sector of the region, it was discovered that the rig count in the country has registered explosive growth. Taking into consideration the month of September 2014 alone, about 26 additional rigs were added in United States, pushing the total rig count to 1930 rigs in the country. This number is 170 rigs higher than the rig count that was reported in September 2013, which stood at 1760.Canada was not far behind in this growth as 7 new rigs were added in the month of September 2014 alone pushing the total rig count of the country up to 406 rigs. This number was 19 rigs higher than the 387 rig count that came in last year during September.Over the course of the past year, oil prices have tumbled significantly. For the future it seems as though oil prices are not likely to receive any respite from their downward trend as news of the IEA cutting oil demand forecasts for the future come in. The agency has stated that it has reduced its oil demand forecast by 22% and expects that oil demand will only register a growth of 700,000 barrels for the year. Their previous forecast was 200,000 barrels higher than the restated forecast.For the following year, demand forecasts were cut by 300,000 barrels, due to weak economic conditions of global economies. Moreover, the IEA also threw light on the oversupply of oil that is being faced by the market and stated that this is likely to exert more downward pressure on oil prices. This comes in as terrible news for oil companies mainly because they continue their expenditures on new oil well discoveries. Should oil prices refuse to pick up in the future, these companies are likely to face lower top lines due to depressed prices for the commodity, and even lower top lines as they continue to incur expenditure on drilling and exploration of new wells.This news by the IEA left oil prices taking a downward dip of almost $3 per barrel. However, the main question arising out of oil price volatility is how it impacts Halliburton and its growth prospects in the future. For now, in the short term, Halliburton remains shielded against this downward oil price trend as it operates based on contracts with oil and gas asset owners and operators.Oil prices have impacted stock prices in the capital markets. This is also an indication of the fact that should oil prices continue to remain depressed, oil and gas companies might be forced to cut back on exploration expenditures and scale down activities to a great extent. Halliburton is likely to suffer from declining top and bottom lines as a result of these cuts since fewer of their services will be demanded by these asset operators.Halliburton has expressed its interest to participate in the Romanian oil and gas sector as the country opens industry up for oil and gas companies to explore the regions rich reserves. As the government prepares to auction more licenses in the future for onshore and offshore activities in the country, Halliburton gears up to provide services to companies that gain exploration rights in the country and begin development of reserves. The impact of this interest in the economy is not a newfound one, as the company is already known to have supplied equipment to oil and gas giant ExxonMobil to conduct activities. This step is lucrative for Halliburton as it raises the prospects of earning revenues from its operations in Europe in the future as well.As investors eagerly wait for the company to announce its third quarter results, analysts are hopeful that this quarter will prove to be a successful one for the company and those who have held on to Halliburton's stocks.The trend for stock prices during these past six months has remained fairly stable for a major part of this period. However, some drastic dips have been witnessed in share prices on some occasions. The 52 week range for Halliburton's stocks has been noted at $47.60-$74.33. The one year price target for the share has been set at $78.41. The share currently trades close to its lower range, making it a good bargain for shareholders to consider, especially as results are expected in the next few days. Share prices are likely to remain bearish in the short run, as the company has stable growth prospects and is shielded from oil price volatility for the time being. Instead, it is likely to be able to grow its top lines, as rigs continue to grow and as activity for oil drilling and exploration continues to expand fiercely in the global economy. Investors should definitely consider investment in Halliburton."
2514785,24018,2014-09-23T09:35:02-04:00,"Over the past year, Halliburton has been at the top of its class; the stock has outperformed its peers.Recently, the shares have eased 10%, apparently upon a drop in crude oil prices and energy overproduction concerns.Is this an opportunity or a threat for investors?","Patient investors are like patient baseball batters: often content to wait for the fat pitch before swinging. Investors waiting for months to accumulate Halliburton (NYSE: HAL) stock at a reasonable price, likewise may finally be seeing something at which to take a swing.Since reaching a July 23 closing high of $73.86, the shares have backtracked 10% and settled recently ~$66.50. The mainstream reason for the decline is the price of crude oil has dipped, thereby dragging down many energy sector stocks with it.Halliburton Co Price and Volume -- YTDcourtesy of bigcharts.marketwatch.comBut has the underlying investment thesis changed?Oil Prices Are Not a Great Proxy for HalliburtonFirst of all, the following 5-year chart illustrates how HAL stock has performed when plotted as a function of WTI spot crude prices.Here we see the correlation between spot crude and Halliburton price certainly isn't in lockstep. Indeed, it's plausible that falling crude prices may cause producers to curtail business activities, thereby reducing Halliburton's business, too.However, there just doesn't seem to be enough evidence, in isolation, to ditch HAL stock on a crude price drop from $106 to $93.What's Company Management Got to Say?Halliburton management remained pretty upbeat at the September 18 UBS Houston Energy Tour. A summary slide from the pack suggested the business is looking fine:During the presentation, risks and threats were addressed, too. Management cautioned investors about a ""moderating"" deepwater outlook, and ""challenged"" markets in Libya, Iraq and Russia. However, none of these were startling new revelations versus the July 2014 2Q earnings release.North AmericaHalliburton has focused heavily upon its U.S. and Canadian business. North American contracts, the bread and butter of the region, begin ""rolling"" in the third and fourth quarters of this year. HAL has most of its work under contract, and the bulk of them are up for renewal. CEO Mark McCollum reinforced an upbeat view at the aforementioned UBS conference:One of the qualities I seek in an investment are companies with strong franchises. By this I mean, the good business moats and therefore the freedom to price.Latin AmericaManagement reported Latin America is building a head of steam heading into 2015, too. Mexican national oil company Pemex is panning out as predicted, scoring some big wins for the Hallibuton. In addition, HAL re-tendered its Brazilian work successfully. Argentina is enjoying 20% growth. Good business in Ecuador and Columbia have also added gloss to the LA portfolio.Eastern HemisphereHalliburton's Eastern Hemisphere, which includes Europe, the Middle East, Asia and Africa is more of a mixed bag. Strong growth in Saudi Arabia, United Kingdom, Asia and Africa is being somewhat offset by weakness in Libya, Iraq and Russia. The problems tend to center around geo-political instability. CEO McCollum asserted:Revenues, Margins and Cash FlowFor the past several years, total revenues have been rising smartly. Since 2009, the top line has grown an average 10% per annum. 2014 is shaping up in a similar fashion. Second quarter year-over-year sales improved 11%.Based upon management guidance, I project full-year revenues to be $32 billion, up 9% versus last year.Halliburton management focuses upon operating margins. Those margins have been expanding: 14.1% in the second quarter versus 13.2% in the prior quarter and 13.4% a year earlier. Continued improvement is expected, particularly in Latin America. I expect 2014 margins to come in about ~17%, buoyed by strong second half improvement in Latin America and Europe.Lastly, I favor companies that generate their profits in cash. Halliburton does just that. Through the first half of 2014, the company earned $1.64 per share, while operating cash flow was $2.43. This equates to a CCR (cash conversion rate) of 148%.Macondo IncidentWhile the BP Macondo affair will take years to wind its way through the courts, Halliburton is effectively out of the cross hairs. The company reached a $1.1 billion settlement with various litigants, and was assigned only 3% simple negligence / fault for the incident. The settlement figure is pre-tax, and includes legal fees. BP was found to be grossly negligent.Still Shareholder-FriendlyHalliburton management has long had a penchant for being shareholder-friendly. Nothing has transpired to change that. In the last quarter, the board of directors authorized a additional $6 billion increase to the share repurchase plan. Of late, investors have cheered recent share buybacks that have ""moved the needle."" Here's a table summarizing the total shares outstanding at the end of the following periods:Notice the 9.4% decrease in diluted shares outstanding between YE 2012 and 2013. When a corporation generates 1.5x its earnings in cash, there are funds available to reduce shares meaningfully.Furthermore, Halliburton management has a stated policy whereas 35% of its operating cash flow is targeted for shareholder dividends. While the current dividend yield is a modest 0.9%, the payout growth rate is accelerating.2014/2015 Earnings ForecastAs usual, corporate management has provided clean 2014 guidance. Here's how I handicap year-end results:The $4.12 estimate is towards the higher end of Wall Street projections. Notably, Street analysts are split: some raising 2014 estimates, and others are lowering it.In any event, the consensus indicates 2015 earnings will increase significantly. Estimates range between $5.29 and $5.35 a share, or 28% YoY growth. What's more, next years' consensus EPS trends are holding steady or creeping up.ValuationF.A.S.T. Graphs provide a graphic example how price and earnings correlate. Please find below a 12-year chart highlighting operating earnings. Over this period, EPS grew by 21.7% per annum, and the average normalized P/E ratio was ~19x.The black line is price. The green shaded area is earnings. Average normalized P/E is represented by the blue line.Looking forward, I've plugged in my 2014 EPS estimate, and $5.30 EPS for FY 2015. The long-term estimated earnings growth rate is 22%. The subsequent F.A.S.T. Graph (Estimated Earnings and Returns Calculator) illustrates this:The pink line represents forecast EPS as a function of a 19x price/earning ratio. As such, a $106 target share price results.Performing a similar exercise using operating cash flow per share offers a comparable valuation result. Currently, the stock appears slightly below fair value. The historic price-to-cash flow multiple is 12.7x. Wall Street expects 2015 OCF/share to be $8.15 a share, aligned with next year's consensus EPS and a 148% CCR.A $103 per share price target is obtained.Conclusion: Ownership Thesis IntactI submit the answer is, ""Yes."" Since the 2Q earnings release and subsequent management presentations, there appear to be few changes to the forward-looking story line. Perhaps the company is a little less sanguine about GoM deepwater prospects, and geo-political tensions are roiling several markets. These items may knock earnings back 3 or 4 cents per share.On the other hand, the Macondo incident is effectively behind Halliburton. Litigation and settlement costs have been adequately reserved, and will be paid out over several years.Valuation appears to offer considerable upside. The shares, trading about $66.50 today, may be worth up to $103 on historical multiples of 2015 earnings or cash flow. Since past and forward EPS growth rates are approximately the same, premising similar P/E and P/CF ratios on earnings and operational cash per share appears reasonable.While share prices have drifted down over the past 2 months, trading volumes have remained average. I see no reason to abandon the stock, and would use the weakness to accumulate more, especially below $65.Please do your own careful due diligence before making any investment. This article is not a recommendation to buy or sell any stock. Good luck with all your 2014 investments."
2503655,24580,2014-09-18T04:20:55-04:00,"U.S. rotary rig count is up 9.2% year-to-date to 1931 rigs; Canadian rig count increased 6.6% year-to-date to 405 rigs, while international rig count has grown 6.6% to 3,642 rigs.Halliburton will renegotiate 60% of its North-American pressure pumping contracts this year, helping the company triple its mature-field business from $3 billion in 2013 to $9 billion in FY 2014.Shares are trading at $67.29, or 13 times 2015 expected earnings of $5.18 per share. That’s well below the company’s five-year average price-to-earnings multiple of 15.5.","Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) shares have been on a tear this year, easily outperforming the market by a wide margin. The oil field services giant's shares have tucked on 34% year-to-date, compared to 7.5% for the S&P 500. Halliburton is benefiting from various positive trends including fast growth in its deep-water business, increased fracking demand, and productivity gains. Given these and other factors, Halliburton looks well-positioned to continue outperforming the market.Increased Drilling ActivityDrilling activity in the U.S. and across the world has increased significantly during the current year. According to WTRG Economics, U.S. rotary rig count is up 9.2% year-to-date to 1931 rigs; Canadian rig count increased 6.6% year-to-date to 405 rigs, while international rig count has grown 6.6% to 3,642 rigs.Source: WTRG EconomicsSource: WTRG EconomicsThe increased drilling activity is being bolstered by growing upstream capital spending and portends a reasonably positive outlook for oil and gas companies.Increasing Fracking DemandConventional hydrocarbon wells are usually drilled using vertical rigs. For unique formations such as shale, however, horizontal drilling is usually employed. Horizontal drilling technique is more expensive than vertical drilling since it requires more sophisticated equipment and a lot of water has to be pumped into the wells to free up trapped oil and gas. Pressure pumping has been gradually recovering from a two-year slump that was orchestrated by oversupply of equipment and low gas prices.Pressure pumping accounts for about 30% of Halliburton's hydrocarbon production. Increase in pressure pumping therefore bodes well for the company. The large increase in use of horizontal rigs is being partly fueled by drilling in the Permian basin. The Permian basin is one of the oldest and most prolific oil sources in the U.S. Many wells in the Permian basin are in their mature stages and require procedures such as carbon dioxide flooding to access oil and gas trapped in rocks and deep reserves. Advances in modern technology have made it possible for oil operators to tap into previously inaccessible shale oil reserves. The shift from vertical to horizontal rigs is happening fast: almost 60% of rigs drilling in the Permian basin are currently horizontally directed compared to around 20% 3 years ago. Shale wells have the added advantage of high productivity than many conventional oil wells. As unconventional drilling continues to dominate, oil companies such as Halliburton with extensive technological know-how in this area will continue to benefit. It's estimated that some production zones on the Permian are about 5 times as thick as zones in Bakken shale and Eagle Ford.Halliburton will renegotiate 60% of its North-American pressure pumping contracts this year. This will help the company triple its mature-field business from $3 billion in 2013 to $9 billion in the current fiscal year. Halliburton has more than doubled its mature field business over the last two years.Rapid Growth in Deepwater BusinessHalliburton's deepwater business has been growing much faster than the broader market. The company's deep-water business grew at 30% CAGR over the last 2 years, compared to 13% for the industry. Halliburton predicts that it will continue to outgrow the industry by at least 25% going forward.Deep-water plays are attractive to oilfield service companies because deep-water oil wells have a higher service intensity than traditional onshore wells and shallow water wells. Additionally, deep-water contracts last longer than land contracts (8 years on average). Deep-water contracts allow oil companies to cross-sell different services and products to operators. It's highly likely that deep-water margins are better than land contract margins since only a few players with the requisite technical expertise and deep-enough pockets are able to play here.There are plausible explanations why Halliburton's deep-water business is doing so well. Demand for deep-water services is highest for development and production services. Halliburton is strong in this area. Additionally, Halliburton has a leading position in geosciences, high-temperature, and high-pressure drilling solutions.Expansion into International MarketsA lot of Halliburton's growth is likely to come from international markets such as Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa. Angola and Nigeria have been receiving a lot of offshore drilling activity lately. Halliburton has been performing sub-sea testing and wireline services off the coast of Angola. Brazil is another country where Halliburton could do more drilling in th near-future. Brazil's recoverable oil and gas reserves from its pre-salt region. Previously, Petrobras (NYSE: PBR), Brazil's state-owned oil company, scaled back drilling activity in the lucrative pre-salt region mainly due to funding issues. But, the company plans to spend more than $150 billion in capex over the next five years. Halliburton has won major contracts from Petrobras in the past, and stands to benefit as acitivity picks up.Boosting EfficiencyHalliburton introduced a new technology called Frac of the Future in 2013. The new technology helps the company save millions of gallons of diesel fuel annually by using natural gas to power drilling equipment. The company also introduced the Q10 pump which provides greater power and reliability than existing pumps, and Cypher service, a system that delivers real-time seismic and well data to help better target fracking areas. Halliburton said in June that Cypher had helped it increase production by 35% in several North American shale projects. Halliburton is also working on ways to recycle water used in fracking and aims to reduce fresh water usage by about 25% this year.ConclusionHalliburton shares are yet to catch up with all these developments, which does not come as surprise given the company's role in the Deepwater oil spill fiasco of 2010.HAL data by YChartsThe shares are trading at $67.29, or 13 times 2015 expected earnings of $5.18 per share. That's well below the company's five-year average price-to-earnings multiple of 15.5. The company's EV/EBITDA runs at a 30% discount to Schlumberger (NYSE: SLB). Halliburton is the leader in well completions in the North American region while Schlumberger leads in exploration.Assuming a conservative PE multiple of 14.5 achievable in fiscal 2015 suggests an upside of 11.5%. Given the company's strong position in fracking and mature well services, however, I believe the company will achieve its 5-year average PE multiple next year, suggesting an upside of 19%."

This is straight up Halliburton’s alley.Unconventional reserves’ exploration is Halliburton’s forte.Halliburton’s Cypher reservoir modeling software helps highlight the ‘sweet spots’ in the shale formation, and could help enhance production.","China has been forced into lowering its domestic shale gas forecast for 2020 to 30 billion cubic meters annually. This is a significant plunge from the previous target of 60-100 billion cubic meters. The change in forecast is because China's shale gas isn't particularly easy to extract. And China's conundrum is straight up Halliburton's (NYSE:HAL) alley.Importance of Shale GasThe U.S. was expected to be among the world's leading natural gas importers not too long ago, with the country recently emerging as one of the largest fossil fuel exporters owing to its shale gas production. China is eying to do the same and is planning to cash in on more than 30 trillion cubic meters worth of shale gas reserves - the largest in the world.Even so, the biggest hurdle en route to the realization of China's shale dream is the lack of technical, technological, topological and geological expertise.Sichuan, China's most lucrative shale basin lies in a region that is deeply faulted. This significantly limits horizontal drilling, with the prospects of earthquakes also meaning that top-drawer shale extraction experience is needed to extract gas from Sichuan.Despite Sinopec developing equipment and personnel to develop shale gas, it's still light years behind the technical expertise that the U.S. firms can offer - most notably Halliburton.Halliburton's OpportunityHalliburton has already made inroads into the Chinese market through its partnership with STP Energy Group. Halliburton would own 49% of the entity that has been formed by the Halliburton-STP merger, which would be vying to explore oil in the desert of Xinjiang. The region possesses around one-thirds of China's unconventional reserves. And of course unconventional reserves' exploration is Halliburton's forte.These reserves need high level expertise in hydraulic fracturing. Halliburton's is the leader of the pack when it comes to that, especially when one factors in water conservation. And when your work place is a desert, it would obviously be immensely critical.Halliburton has pressure pumps that are designed to fracture amidst water shortage. The firm has also mastered the technology of water-recycling, which helps develop and sustain its assets.Even though hydraulic fracturing has received environmental backlash and bans in the U.S., China wants to reduce its thick air pollution. Shale could produce cleaner gas as an environmentally apt replace for coal in Chinese power plants.While Halliburton's partnership with STP itself isn't a groundbreaking deal, the fact that China is now eying to up the ante on shale gas exploration to answer its energy questions, means that the oil giant would be leading the queue when China looks towards foreign firms to provide technical expertise. China wants experience in digging out shale from difficult formations, while Halliburton, like any other firm, is looking for opportunities to enhance production and revenue. This should whet the appetite of the company's shareholders, and those who are planning on investing in Halliburton in the future.Struggles of foreign firmsChina, of course, isn't new to working in tandem with foreign oil and gas companies. Royal Dutch/Shell (NYSE:RDS.A) (NYSE:RDS.B) signed a product-sharing agreement with China National Petroleum Corp., for the Fushun-Yongchuan block, while Shell spent a billion dollars in the Sichuan basin last year. Shell would take a year working on drilling and the region's geology before finalizing the product-sharing contract and if the deal were to collapse, it wouldn't be a new experience for China.Foreign oil giants haven't exactly had much to write home about during their Chinese expeditions. Chevron's (NYSE:CVX) struggles in the $6.4 billion worth Chuandongbei project that is supposed to conjure 12 billion cubic meters of gas annually is a prime example.However, China is trying to reverse that trend by offering more profitability for the foreign oil firms especially in the shale gas sector. The government is including waivers on exploration equipment's import tariffs, value-added refunds, subsidies and even resource tax waivers. Most notably, China is offering complete deregulation of prices, to make it completely independent of the government's control, thus making projects in the country more profitable for foreign companies.The prospectsHalliburton is expecting Q4 profits to touch 20% in the Eastern hemisphere. Even though the current Chinese projects wouldn't factor in much in the overall $5 billion worth business in Asia and Middle East, but if the company manages to enter the shale gas arena, it could open a massive revenue enhancing opportunity for it.Shale basins in China have gas which is trapped in formations that are more than 10,000 feet deep. There is more pressure, more temperate, more depth and more complexity when you juxtapose this with typical shale gas plays in the U.S. Halliburton's Cypher reservoir modeling software helps highlight the 'sweet spots' in the shale formation, and could help enhance production.Halliburton has been banking on technology to increase the lure of its margins, which should increase by around 5%. The earnings are set to rise 25% touching the $4 mark, with a double digit revenue growth. All this is regardless of what happens in China. However, if banking on technology does work wonders for Halliburton, China will prove itself to be a land of opportunity - an opportunity to multiply, production and revenues, an opportunity to augments its cash flow."

With over 50,000 employees in approximately 70 countries, the company, based in Houston, Texas, serves the upstream oil and gas industry throughout the life cycle of the reservoir -from locating hydrocarbons and managing geological data to drilling and formation evaluation, well construction and completion, and optimizing production through the life of the field.The company is truly ""global"", and well diversified.Source: Halliburton.com 2Q updateHalliburton recently presented a favorable growth picture, looking out 1 to 2 years at the ""demand"" forecasts as reported in their Q2 earnings statement. This suggests that there is plenty of runway left for the growth story to continue in the oilfield services sector.Management's commentary from their recent Q2 conference call also indicated continued strength in their primary market, North America, as they see further tightening of the pressure pumping market there.On July 21st, Halliburton announced that income from continuing operations for the second quarter of 2014 was $776 million, or $0.91 per diluted share. This compares to income from continuing operations for the first quarter of 2014 of $623 million, or $0.73 per diluted share.Halliburton's total revenue in the second quarter of 2014 was a record $8.1 billion, compared to $7.3 billion in the first quarter of 2014. Operating income was $1.2 billion in the second quarter of 2014, 23% higher than operating income of $970 million in the first quarter of 2014 resulting from significant activity improvements in North America and the Eastern Hemisphere.These impressive operating results were highlighted by CEO Dave Lesar on the company 's latest conference callThe chart below, complete with notes from the management team, portrays a positive environment in ""key"" areas of the business.Source: Halliburton.com 2Q updateNow, there may be a new opportunity that is on the horizon for Halliburton to take advantage of, the ""Offshore"" fracking boom.Offshore fracking is a part of a broader industry wide strategy to make billion-dollar deep-sea developments pay off. Because of their nature, those expensive drilling projects will be a boon for oil service providers such as Halliburton.Technical Picture:Just as we have seen the price of oil come down, shares of Halliburton have also seen weakness dropping from a high of $74 to a recent price of $67, where it appears to be finding support and stabilizing as indicated by the ""daily"" chart presented below.Valuation:Analysts estimates indicate that HAL is on target to earn $4.05 per share in 2014 and with the continued double digit growth, the company is expected to post earnings of $5.35 for 2015. Given these estimates the shares are selling at a PE of 17 today, with a forward PE of 13, which is well below the current market multiple. I will also suggest that one could easily add a 'premium"" to this company given its proven industry leadership. All of this is suggesting that the shares are presently selling at an attractive level.It would appear that a number of analysts agree as many raised EPS estimates and price targets for the company the day after the company reported earnings.Another plus, Halliburton has consistently made an effort to return cash to shareholders and continued that process this past quarter. The company's board authorized the purchase of $6 billion worth of currently outstanding common stock, up from the remaining $1.2 billion left on the prior authorization. This value represents approximately 10% of Halliburton's market cap and signifies a considerable conversion of excess cash to shareholder value.While it is difficult to know how long the external pressures such as the price of crude oil will persist, what we do know is that the long-term global demand for energy is on an uptrend. With shares now selling at $67, investors with a long-term view on the equity market would be wise to add to their watchlist and look to start to build a position at these levels.Best of Luck to all!"

With the numbers for Europe expected to improve after the firm partners with other companies in Romania.","Halliburton (NYSE: HAL) is interested in upping its activity in Romania. The interest is the most conspicuous in two particular areas: oil field production and deep water project developments in the Black Sea.Victor Ponta, Romanian prime minister, met Joe Rainey HAL's Eastern Hemisphere president who expressed the firm's interest in investing in Romania's energy sector. HAL's representatives were inquisitive about various investment prospects, while the premier hinted at the involvement of local subcontractors in future activities.HAL is already a household name in the Romanian energy sector, especially because of the fact that it has already supplied $9.76 million worth of equipment to Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) for its Black Sea exploration program. XOM's project is being carried out in collaboration with OMV Petrom.Romanian IndustryRomania's shale gas reserves are the third highest in the EU. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration's estimates shale gas reserves in Romania are around 1,444 billion cubic meters - enough to cater to domestic gas consumption for the next century. Romania holds a multitude of petroleum reserves, both onshore and offshore, that are awaiting exploration.Liberalization of the economy has been on the Romanian government's agenda. The government is also implementing European Union Regulation and is carving open the country's energy sector to make it more conducive for investment by foreign companies. The energy sector is one of the top five economic priorities for the country, as indicated in the National Plan for Strategic Investment.OMV Petrom has a substantial hold of the oil and gas sector in the country, and is responsible for about 40% of the oil and gas supplies. It has investments worth Euro 9 billion in the country. Its oil and gas reserves stand at 750 million barrels of oil equivalent.The Eurobank has prognosticated GDP growth for the country at 3% for the current year. This is a jump from the previous growth rate that was estimated at 2.7%. This highlights that there would be an augmentation in industrial activity, which could spur oil and gas consumption.A number of oil and gas exploration projects have been initiated in the country by foreign oil and gas firms, including Chevron (NYSE:CVX) and Exxon Mobil. New oil reserves were discovered earlier this year by OMV Petrom, which are estimated to have a capacity to produce almost 1,500-2,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, after being developed.As things stand, Romania's oil and gas industry is staring at two major challenges. First the fact that its developed oil and gas fields are approaching maturity; and secondly technological challenges in developing the new oil and gas fields in the country.Having said that, Romania would gain from the HAL's activities, especially as far as developing new oil and gas fields of the country in concerned. HAL's interest in the Romanian energy sector is a sign of future investment pouring in.What's in it for HAL?Following the settlement of claims worth $1.1 billion, linked to the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico - the biggest in U.S. history HAL would now keeping its eyes open for new opportunities for the expansion of its business and augment its international footprint. Romania presents one of these opportunities, especially when one factors in the opulence of undiscovered oil and gas reserves. The increase in GDP growth of the country, and the government's interest in developing the oil and gas sector is an opportunity for HAL to make inroads into volume of activity in the country.Even so, HAL's interest in Romanian oil fields could face a daunting Russian challenge in the Black Sea. Black Sea's oil and gas resources could be open to Russian interference. Also, investment risks in the offshore oil sector of Romania are high due to military presence.It's important to realize that 12 months ago, Russia was around 500 miles away from Romania. The distance has been reduced to 200 miles following Moscow's Crimean annexation.Even so, Romania has a lot of potential that HAL can make the most of. The country is expected to produce more gas that it would be consuming in the next six years. But it needs to start investing in infrastructure.As things stand, Romania's priority is increasing production of indigenous resources, which is precisely what HAL can get involved in.The Romanian energy minister has stated that he indicated that they mean to auction more licenses, stimulate partnerships between foreign companies and local ones to enhance production of mature oil fields, while encouraging partnerships between oil license owners and large companies that can participate in exploring offshore oilfields at large depth. 36 new onshore and offshore areas will be up for tender next year so that they can be explored.Furthermore, Romania has introduced tax rule changes to facilitate exploration and production. Tax on construction has decreased for energy firms with offshore construction being excluded as well. This is a massive opportunity for HAL since the company is now facing the opportunity to not merely participate in the exploration projects, but pay less taxes once licenses are given out.EpilogueHAL announced its Q2 results for the current year with augmentation in its operations income. Q2 income was reported at $776 million (EPS of 91 cents) compared to Q1 income of $623 million (73 cents). Revenue for the quarter was $8.1 billion, a rise from the $7.3 billion revenue reported in Q1. Operating income registered a 23% quarter on quarter increase.Considering the company's financial showing and its interest in Romanian energy sector, HAL would witness increase in its revenues in Europe. This would hence result in sharp increases in the firm's earning potential, especially since Romania is keen on opening its oil and gas sector by issuing more licenses, which would speed up development and exploration activities. HAL is betting on the possibility of catching a large slice of the cake, especially with the recent tax reduction.With HAL set to gain from future partnerships in Romania's oil and gas sector exploration, investors can gain in terms of higher earnings."

The shares have sold off some 10% from recent highs. With the S&P 500 at all-time highs, Halliburton offers solid value at its current price, and should be accumulated here by long-term value and growth investors for myriad reasons.Growth & Valuation:Halliburton continues to churn out low-double digit revenue growth, as it is a primary beneficiary of the continued domestic energy boom and the associated demand for the company's various ""fracking services"". This revenue growth is translating to an even steeper projected earnings trajectory.The S&P 500 is currently tracking to an 8% to 10% year-over-year earnings gain in 2014, on the back of a 3% to 4% sales increase. Halliburton's projected growth rate for earnings and revenue is roughly triple that of the S&P 500 currently. Despite this, Halliburton is going for 13 times next year's projected earnings, a discount to the overall market multiple of 10% to 15%.Positive Analyst Commentary:No fewer than five analyst firms raised their price targets and/or ratings on Halliburton, after the company posted strong second-quarter results in late July. These included Cowen, who raised their price target on Halliburton to $89 a share from $76 a share previously, and UBS moved their price target from $80 a share to $87.Other Factors:Halliburton gets just over 50% of its overall revenue from geopolitically stable North America, leaving it less vulnerable to troubles overseas than its larger brethren like Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB). In addition, the company, along with other large oil services concerns, should benefit greatly as Mexico opens up its energy industry to foreign investment for the first time since the 1930s. Halliburton's fracking technology should be much in demand down south. This fracking technology is already starting to make its way into offshore fields for the first time, particularly in the Gulf of Mexico. This is another potential stream of revenue and demand.Summary:The recent 10% pullback in Halliburton looks like a solid entry point to add a few shares in this preeminent energy services play. The company has solid growth prospects, and is selling at a discount to the overall market. It is not the screaming buy it was back in 2012, when I was pounding the table on the stock when it was trading in the low $30s. However, it is a good solid pick in what I consider a slightly overvalued market. ACCUMULATE"
2431455,70005,2014-08-18T09:37:37-04:00,"The horizontal rig count has been increasing for eight consecutive weeks.HAL has the most to gain from the increase in horizontal rigs owing to its expertise in unconventional energy and its technology repertoire.With the company incorporating environment friendly technology, there’s an aura of productivity and reliability surrounding HAL.","The U.S. has witnessed a constant increase in drilling activity over the past year or so. A lot of this is owing to the oil and gas companies' enhanced upstream capital spending and oil prices' positive outlook despite the global political crises.By the end of week before last, August 8 to be precise, the rotator rig count in the country increased to 1,908 rigs according to Baker Hughes data. This showcased a 7% year-over-year increase. Vertical rigs increased from the last week's count of 373 to 378 this week, highlighting the second consecutive week where vertical rigs had showcased an increase.Escalating horizontal rig countThe vanguard of this growth in the rig count was the augmentation in horizontal rigs which rose to 1,317, showcasing an increase of 19 rigs from the previous week. This in turn highlighted a 23% year-over-year increase.Incidentally the 1,298 rigs recorded on August 1 had a record number of horizontal rigs. The record was broken on Friday, in what was the eighth consecutive week where horizontal rigs manifested an increase.One company that is set to capitalize from this data is Halliburton (NYSE: HAL), considering the fact that horizontal rig count highlights the demand of well services that are unconventional. An example of this is hydraulic fracturing which is HAL's specialty. And with the precipitously rising horizontal rig count, expect the demand of fracking to escalate.Horizontal wellsWhen a well is drilled vertically, the drilling is done straight down to the formation point. A horizontal well, meanwhile, is a directional well where the well isn't perpendicularly on top of the targeted reservoir. If there is an inclination of more than 80 degrees from the vertical, or if the well's lower section runs along the reservoir, the well is called a horizontal well. These wells are drilled for the purpose of augmenting the well's length that is exposed to the reservoir. This in turn helps enhance the production.The hike in horizontal rig count is owing to discoveries of oil and gas in shale formation. And the quantities involved in the discoveries are absolutely massive. This drilling in tandem with hydraulic fracturing of unconventional formations has resulted in recent oil and gas production in the U.S.With the pressure pumping markets making a comeback from a 24-month decline, which was orchestrated by a decrease in gas prices and an overkill of equipment supply, the hike in the number of horizontal rigs hints at an increase in pumping demand. HAL, meanwhile, with alternative energies and the latest technology being the vanguards of its recent success and future outlook, looks like a shoo-in to cash in on this recent trend. The fact that around 30% of HAL's revenues are courtesy of pressure pumping further vindicates optimism.Permian BasinPermian Basin is the leader in oil rig growth in recent times. The basin is among the most lucrative regions of oil production in the U.S. Even though Permian Basin is still dominated by conventional methods, which are responsible for a large chunk of the basin's oil production, a lot of the wells are now in the mature stage and need procedures that are expensive for production. An example of these procedures is carbon dioxide flooding.Owing to the expenses involved in mature wells, which have resulted in production declines, operators have been vying to extricate shale oil reserves that have hitherto been considered inaccessible. Horizontal drilling and fracking have been crucial to serve this purpose. And the shift from conventional methods to these new techniques, that need the latest technology, has been rather swift.According to last week's count, 560 rigs were functioning in the Permian Basin. More than half of them were directed horizontally - 56% to be exact. Conversely, 36 months ago, this percentage was a mere 19%. Moving to the latest, unconventional techniques to extricate oil would yield positive results for whoever operates in the basin. This is because shale flow rates are pretty good from the get go, which in turn ensure that companies augment their returns rather quickly.With the horizontal rig numbers in the Permian Basin expected to continue rising, the need for unconventional techniques and the latest technology would hike up in synchrony. This would make HAL a key player, with its repertoire of unconventional energy prowess and a wide gamut of technology.Right up HAL's alleyGrowth from unconventional energy segment has been critical in driving HAL northward in the last two years taking the stock from $29 to around $67 as of Thursday. Permian, along with Marcellus and DH basins have collectively propelled HAL's production and revenues.As far as revenue generated from rig services is concerned, HAL has managed to increase it from $17.97 billion in 2010 to $31.94 billion as things stand. This number is expected to reach around the $42 billion mark by 2017, and is predicted to be as high as $57 billion by the year 2021. And of the total revenue generated through rig services, North American operations are responsible for around 54.6% of the earnings.HAL's revenue per rig is estimated to be around $7.63 million for the ongoing calendar year. By the year 2017 this number is expected to touch $9.70 million. Similarly HAL's annual average rig count for 2014 is predicted to be 218,000, with the number expected to increase to 234,000 by the end of the year 2017.The rising rig count - especially through horizontal wells - is expected to result in significantly higher revenues as elaborated by the rising revenue per rig. This in turn would increase HAL's free cash flow through rig services to around $4.26 billion from the current $3.04 billion. These numbers reward investors as much as they would be beneficial for the company. And now with the company incorporating environment friendly technology, there's an aura of productivity and reliability surrounding HAL.With the oil prices seemingly secure, an imminent hike in horizontal oil rigs and the capital appreciation and value creation through share buyback and dividends offered by the company, HAL is increasingly looking like a lucrative buy both in the short and long run.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Year-to-date, shares of the three major oilfield services companies, Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL), Schlumberger Limited (NYSE:SLB) and Baker Hughes Incorporated (BHI) have posted significant gains. This was after all three stocks outperformed the S&P 500 in 2013. The gains have come as oilfield services companies continue to post strong operating and financial results. The strong performance has been driven this year by growth in the Middle East and Asia. Up until recently though, weakness in North America was a major concern for oilfield services companies. However, the North American market seems to be finally recovering. This is especially good news for Halliburton, which is the most exposed among the three top oilfield services firms to the North American market. In fact, this makes Halliburton the best bet among the three major U.S. oilfield services companies.Shares continue to surgeIn 2013, shares of Halliburton, Schlumberger and Baker Hughes outperformed the S&P 500, gaining 49.21%, 32.59% and 38.39%, respectively. All three stocks have continued to surge this year as well. As of August 4, Halliburton shares have gained more than 39%, Schlumberger shares have gained nearly 23%, and Baker Hughes shares have gained more than 26%. This compares to a gain of just over 5% for the S&P 500.The rally in shares of oilfield services companies was driven by strong operating and financial performance, which in turn was boosted by higher capital spending from major oil and gas companies in the U.S. and Europe. While oil and gas majors have been reducing capex this year, this has so far not had a negative impact on oilfield services companies. This is because all three major U.S. oilfield services companies have been benefiting from growth in the Middle East and Asia as evidenced by the results in the first half of 2014.The first quarter of this year saw Halliburton, Schlumberger and Baker Hughes register strong performance in Middle East and Asia. The trend continued in the second quarter as well. Halliburton's revenue from Middle East and Asia rose 11% on a sequential basis. The company's operating income from the region rose 25% on a sequential basis. Baker Hughes's second-quarter revenue from Middle East and Asia was $1.15 billion, compared to $971 million reported for the same period in the previous year. Schlumberger's revenue from Middle East and Asia rose 12% on a year-over-year basis, while the company's margins improved by 323 basis points.While Middle East and Asia is expected to be a key growth driver going forward as well, up until recently, North America had been a worry. However, North America is finally showing signs of recovery.North American recoveryOilfield services firms witnessed weakness in the North American market for two years due to a decline in drilling activity as gas prices weakened. A decline in drilling activity led to an oversupply of equipment, pushing prices lower and hurting margins of oilfield services companies. But after two years, the North American market is getting back on track.Dave Lesar, CEO of Halliburton, had said in a conference call following the first-quarter results that he was beginning to feel the turn in North America. Following the second-quarter results, Lesar believes that this feeling was dead on target. In the second quarter, Halliburton saw its North American revenue increase 11% on a sequential basis. The company's operating income from North America rose 31% on a sequential basis. More importantly, Halliburton expects North America activity levels to continue to improve, with margins likely to reach 20% in the third quarter. The company is even accelerating additions to its hydraulic fracturing fleet and logistics capabilities in the wake of a recovery.While Baker Hughes believes that there is still 20% overcapacity in North American markets, the company is seeing increased activity in onshore rigs, wells and horizontal drilling.Bullish on HalliburtonWhile the recovery in the North American market has further improved the outlook for all three U.S. oilfield services firms, I am particularly bullish on Halliburton, given that the company is the most exposed to North America.In the second quarter of 2014, North America accounted for more than 50% of Halliburton's total revenue. On the other hand, Schlumberger generated a third of its revenue from North America. While Baker Hughes depends a little more on North America than Schlumberger, the region accounted for less than 50% of its total revenue in the first half of 2014.Given this scenario, Halliburton looks like the best bet among the three oilfield services providers although the outlook for the sector overall is bullish.The major risk faced by Halliburton and the other two companies right now is Russia. Following the tragic MH 17 plane crash in Ukraine, the U.S. and Europe have stepped up pressure on Russia. The U.S. and Europe have also imposed tough sanctions on Russia, which could have some impact on companies in the oil and gas sector. Halliburton noted in its conference call that the Russia sanctions have not had any material impact on its activity levels so far, however, there is some risk related to certain projects that are being tendered later this year.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2424695,47521,2014-08-14T16:56:38-04:00,"Mexico's lack of expertise, technology and capital has resulted in major energy reforms, which Halliburton will benefit from.With natural gas supply in the country under pressure, Halliburton has a chance to move fairly quickly in this area of expertise it serves in.Risks are always abound in Mexico, but a new commission should help to mitigate that risk and provide consistency and transparency.","There are a lot of reasons to like Halliburton (NYSE:HAL), including its exposure in what appears to be a recovering North American energy market, and its growth in unconventional markets like Russia and China.Another major factor is its investment in technology, which has helped increase production by over 70%. Most of us know this, although it's worth taking note of.So with exposure in the U.S. helping to mitigate risk and provide a predictable base to work from, and the willingness of Halliburton to attempt to expand operations in potentially higher growth markets, it has a good strategy which should result in a balanced performance going forward.In this article I want to focus on a new opportunity for the company in Mexico, which has recently made changes which should provide some opportunities in the Gulf of Mexico for Halliburton. source: StockCharts.comNew Mexican LawsThe new laws passed by Mexico will allow, for the first time in many years, foreign companies to significantly compete in the country, which has seen its production shrink for almost ten years.That isn't to say Halliburton hasn't been working in Mexico, because it has. What this does is provide potential for a larger presence and possibility of generating some serious revenue and earnings in comparison to the limited exposure it has had the past.Passing and implementing the new laws were in response to the lack of expertise in Mexico in regard to unconventional and deepwater drilling. For the most part Mexico has been drilling on land or shallow areas.Pemex will still have the first choice on which projects it want to keep working on and which projects competitors will get a shot at. This is why I make the assumption it's likely to be unconventional and deepwater locations that will be opened to foreign companies.Pemex's NeedNationalized industries are always underperformers for a variety of reasons, but the lack of competition is among one of the main negative catalysts there, since there is little incentive to improve production and technology as long as the company or country has its needs and goals met. Mexico is starting to go backward in that regard; struggling to reverse the decline in production and proven reserves.Now that the oil fields in particular are maturing, Pemex has run into a wall as to its expertise and technology and has had to ask for help by changing the laws and opening the Mexican market up to profit-seeking competitors.At this time Mexico has approximately 13.5 billion barrels in proven oil reserves, and probably has a lot more when adding the deepwater areas yet to be explored in the Gulf. The impetus behind all of this isn't domestic supply, as Pemex is still able to supply that. It's falling exports that are the immediate concern, as oil exports accounted for about 13% of all export earnings last year (2013).Along with the lack of expertise and technology, has also been the lack of investment capital, which also is part of the challenge countries that nationalize industries face. As most of the easier drilling areas are in decline, it has forced Mexico's hand if it wants to maintain a robust energy sector.With proven reserves falling by 3% in 2013 because of lack of capital, expertise and technology, exploration has been at a minimum, with little in the way of new reserves being discovered.Where the Opportunity isIn the past Halliburton and some of its peers have been allowed to work, for the most part, as a subcontractor to Pemex, with revenue coming for contracts with various incentives, or for a fixed fee.Under the new laws, Halliburton and its competitors will be given permission to operate under a profit structure, which of course creates the possibility of a lot more upside for the companies.On the other hand, Mexico is notorious for corruption and risk, and once a country nationalizes an industry, it is at risk to do so again; although in the near term that isn't likely because of the needs of the country. There is risk longer term if corrupt officials decide the country has enough knowledge and technology to once again go it alone after foreign companies do the heavy lifting.While that's a possibility, it's not a strong probability. Where more of the risks are is in regard to typical kickbacks and the types of deals some within the Mexican energy industry are notorious for, where a company could lose contract or have them changed in response to deals and arrangements made under the table.To help mitigate that risk and keep things more transparent, the new laws include a national oil commission that takes on the responsibility of decisions associated with contracts.Assuming this is done honestly and transparently, it will go a long way towards making companies like Halliburton feel comfortable with allocating capital into Mexico. How effectively this is done is a key to the depth of the positive impact it would have on companies doing business in Mexico.Halliburton's PlayWhile Halliburton could benefit in a number of ways under the new laws, the most profitable ventures it would generate revenue from are probably in unconventional plays. This is most likely be related to unconventional natural gas services.The dismal performance of Mexico in shale gas is a major trend the country wants to reverse. Many investors don't know that Mexico has the fourth-largest shale natural gas reserves in the world (as far as we know). That plays into the strength of Halliburton nicely, as it is one of the top companies in this market segment.It's also a strong need in Mexico, which is experiencing a major shortage of natural gas, and needs to have that need met quickly. Halliburton is likely to be a key player in that market, and because of the natural gas shortage, should be able to generate some revenue and earnings sooner rather than later.ConclusionHalliburton has a number of markets it serves in that provides it with stability and growth.Growing its exposure to Mexico could add an additional growth market to complement its other international efforts.We'll have to wait to see the contracts it's awarded and if possible, how they're structured. But this is definitely something energy investors need to watch as this is something that could move quickly; especially in the natural gas sector, which Mexico desperately needs to expand.It's just one more reason to like the company, which is up over 48% over the last 12 months.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2386885,70005,2014-08-06T04:55:55-04:00,Growth in unconventional energy segment has been crucial in driving the stock northwards.HAL is making inroads into the bigger unconventional energy markets in China and Russia.Investment in new technologies has allowed HAL to enhance its oil and gas production by more than 70%.HAL has the edge among its peers in mature field extraction owing to its technological advancement.The company would soon be offering the best cash flow among its competitors.,"Halliburton (NYSE: HAL) is a stock that is known for its long-term value. Over the past 24 months HAL has witnessed a 138% surge, jumping up to the current $69 mark from $29. Unconventional energy sources have been the vanguard of the company's growth over this two-year period, and with the company incorporating new technologies to facilitate both customers and investors, HAL increasingly seems like the stock to back, if you're eying long-term returns.Unconventional SegmentUnconventional energy segment - tight gas and complex gas, shale gas and oil, heavy oil and coal bed methane - would be pivotal for the company. Growth from the unconventional segment and the use of HAL's services in Permian, Marcellus and DH basins, among other places, has been crucial in driving the stock northwards. Now with the latest technology ensuring environmental friendliness, HAL's customers are experiencing wells that excel both in productivity and reliability.There are 7,400 bcf of tight gas, 7,500 of coal bed, 6,662 tcf of shale gas and 429.4 bbo of oil reserves in the world according to recent estimates. And as tapping into unconventional sources continues to rise, HAL would continue to have a major role to play with regards to providing the needed technology and expertise to unearth these resources.Inroads into Bigger MarketsThe company has been reaping the rewards of domestic growth in unconventional energy, and is now making inroads into global markets, which would be crucial for the company's growth in the long run. HAL has recently signed an agreement with SPT Energy Group for a joint hydraulic fracturing venture in Xinjiang. Xinjiang HDTD Oilfield Services would deal with fracturing stimulation services. And with China being earmarked as a lucrative zone for unconventional energy in the next 10 years, HAL is making the right moves to ensure robust growth.Russia is another massive market for the unconventional energy segment with an estimated 680 tcf worth of unconventional resources. And so HAL's partnership with Gubkin Russian State University for unconventional resource development would ensure the company makes the most of Moscow's rich resources, which include the opulent Bazhenov shale.Deepwater Oil and GasThe company has been witnessing high growth in the deepwater oil and gas segment as well. HAL has grown at a robust CAGR of 31% between 2010 and 2013, compared to the deep water service industry's average growth of 13% in said period. This vindicates the fact that HAL has managed to attract significantly more customers than its peers, which is owing to the technological edge that it possesses.The prognosticated CAGR for the deep water market till the year 2018 is around 11%. Considering how HAL has been ruling the roost in this segment, expect at least a growth of around 25%, making deep water a lucrative zone for the company.Difficult NegotiationsHAL might have settled the criminal charges against the company from last year's Deepwater Horizon spill, but the incident is still in the memory of many. It goes without saying that the company can ill-afford similar incidents as it vies to establish its hegemony over deepwater. Even so, the negotiations pertaining to criminal charges aren't the only thing that the company has had to negotiate of late.HAL had to negotiate bad weather in the first quarter which affected its performance in North America. Similarly, since a lot of the company's deepwater expeditions are in difficult-to-negotiate areas, and the company is aiming to grow 25% faster than its peers, its performance in deepwater markets is going to be critical. This is where its technology repertoire comes into play to reduce the deepwater risks.New TechnologiesMassive investment in new technologies has allowed HAL to enhance its oil and gas production by more than 70%. This in turn has meant that the company is spending around 11% of its revenue - which happened to be $3.2 billion last year - on capital expenditure and R&D. The company now boosts 'cutting edge' tools, like for instance joysticks that allow customers to drill offshore while sitting in their offices. The most crucial factor, however, has been HAL bolstering both its production and efficiency with regards to domestic onshore shale activity. This is despite the fact that in most cases fracking extracts merely a tenth of the rock's oil.HAL leads the pack in the use of technologies, and is a 'one-stop shop' in oilfield and logistics services. This has catapulted the company's overall production by around 30%. And now experts see HAL's stock increasing by over 20% in the next 12 months or so, on 20% earnings growth.The ExpansionHalliburton clearly has Schlumberger in mind, and is banking on technology to make its margins more attractive. If things go according to the HAL script, margins should increase by around five percent in the next 36 months. Operating earnings look set to rise 25% this year, to $3.99 per share, with the revenue growth almost touching double digits, growing to $32 billion.The expansion has worked wonders for HAL with the company looking to hike up cash flows for the shareholders. The Q1 cash flows for the year 2014 ($954 million) have more than doubled compared to Q1 from 2013. The company has said that it aspires to increase the percentage of available cash for the shareholders by around 35% of the operating cash flow. This would double HAL's historic average and would surpass its peers' numbers as well. And most of this is down to the company upping the ante on technology, which in turn has improved the company's production and efficiency.Mature Field StrategyIn addition to the exploitation of new resources the near future would be crucial for all oil and gas companies, as they formulate their individual mature field strategies to enhance production. And this is precisely why HAL has the edge among its competitors.As of last year Statoil's (STO) production was on a slide in 81.2% of the company's fields. Even big guns like Total (TO) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX) have witnessed production decline in 71.5% and 67.5% of their fields respectively. With all oilfield big names having mature fields that haven't been unearthed successfully, HAL's technology gives it a clear head start - the chasing pack would have to emulate HAL's tech prowess to boost their production.Wait on UkraineWhile HAL proves to be a tempting buy, it's best to ride the Ukrainian storm before taking a plunge in the stock. The escalating political tension in the country and the ensuing Russian sanctions have meant that energy stocks have been slipping of late, as Washington continues its political tug of war with Moscow - HAL, along with Noble Crop, slid by more than 2.4 percent on Tuesday.While Moscow relies on US oil behemoths like Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE:XOM), BP Plc (BP/), HAL and Schlumberger Ltd. (NYSE:SLB), the fact of the matter is that these companies rely on Russia as well, as far as their future outlook is concerned. HAL especially might be crucial for Russia, since Moscow can certainly do with the latest technology and expertise to unearth its massive resources. But if the Ukraine crisis lingers on, one might have to rethink investments in the energy sector. Hence, it's best to wait till the Ukraine crisis eases out, and then you can maximize your gains through HAL.Still a Solid Long-term InvestmentWith everything said and done, new technologies and unconventional energy sources together make HAL a very tempting long-term investment. The oil prices would remain high as global energy demand escalates, and as the world's political tensions take their toll.As far as the shareholder's viewpoint is concerned, HAL offers appreciation of capital and creation of value via share buyback and dividends. The company would soon be offering the best cash flow among its peers. If you're looking for a long-term investment, look no further than Halliburton.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Compared to global oilfield services leader Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB), Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) is more focused on North American drilling services and should greatly benefit.Halliburton will have to compete against more aggressive domestic oilfield service suppliers including the recently announced combination of C&J Energy Services (CJES) and the drilling division of Nabors Industries (NYSE:NBR). The new C&J Energy hopes to successfully take market share in the suddenly positive market outlook for North American demand.With C&J Energy Services busy with closing the deal and integration issues, Halliburton is free to continue enjoying the market leadership.North American LeaderFor the longest time, Schlumberger benefited from a much larger focus outside of North America leading the company to a commanding size difference over Halliburton. Lately though, the domestic turnaround in the oil patch is providing Halliburton with an unexpected advantage even back a few years ago.For the second quarter, Halliburton generated $4.3 billion of revenue from North America compared to only $3.9 billion for Schlumberger. More importantly Halliburton generated 11% sequential gains in revenue versus only 6% for Schlumberger. The best part for investors wanting a more focused play on the domestic energy rebound, Halliburton generated 53.9% of revenue from North America while Schlumberger only saw 32.2% in that region. The later remains a relatively equal play on the Europe and Middle East regions.The C&J Energy Services play to purchase the Nabors Industries oil services group should hit the radar of investors wanting a real domestic shale focused play. The combined entity will have revenue of over $3.1 billion that is mostly focused on domestic oilfield services. The numbers still pale in comparison to the scope and resources of Halliburton.Spare Horsepower Capacity Under 10%One of the more alarming discoveries on the Halliburton earnings call was the identification that the excess horsepower in the hydraulic fracturing equipment segment is now less than 10%. In fact, the decline in spare capacity has led Halliburton to immediately accelerate additions to the fleet by the fourth quarter and throughout 2015. The lack of spare capacity should help with increased pricing.This places C&J Energy Services in a prime position with an existing plan to add horsepower expecting the market to turn. In addition, the move to buy the Nabors unit sets the company up for a strong market position within the suddenly hot sector.Attractive ValuationsWhile most of the market appears fairly valued, the oilfield services stocks and specifically Halliburton trade at attractive multiples.HAL PE Ratio (Forward 1y) data by YChartsBottom LineIn the global race to supply the increasing demand for oilfield services, Schlumberger is the leader. For investors wanting exposure directly to the domestic rebound, Halliburton is not only the more focused play, but also the cheaper play. At only 12.8x forward earnings, the stock is cheap despite the big rebound this year. Investors should use the recent drop to add to the stock."

Headlines are filled with death and destruction occurring in Iraq, Syria, Egypt, and/or Ukraine. Regional conflicts between terrorist groups and rebels have many parts of the globe looking like the worst vacation destinations ever. There's no way bombs going off in city streets can be good for business, right? Well for a coffee shop probably not, but if you're a company like Halliburton (NYSE:HAL), business is booming. The chart below shows Halliburton's stock price since the invasion of Iraq and Afghanistan. (Notice the increase since mid 2013 when tension started rising)MorningstarHalliburton Company is a Houston, Texas based oil service company focused on North American unconventional, deep-water exploration and development, and mature oilfield management markets. The company's main source of income is its highly integrated set of services. These services include your standard drilling and pressure pumping oil collection that characterize any other oil company, but what makes HAL different is the unique contracting services that they bring to the table. Halliburton manages a vast logistics and security infrastructure wherever they go. This started out as a typical support system for their oil rigs, but they soon learned they could turn a profit on this support network. During the 2003 Iraq invasion, the number of private contractors was one for every 2.4 uniformed soldiers. By 2006, contractors outnumbered soldiers in Iraq, and many remain there today. These contracts became such a large part of Halliburton's business that they had to create a separate company, KBR, to manage everything. After several contracting scandals, CEO David Lesar moved to Dubai in 2007 in order to strengthen the firm's relationships with their key customers in the Middle East. This move appears to have worked as HAL's annual revenue in the Middle East and Asia has risen from $1.2 billion in 2007 to $5 billion in 2013.Halliburton reported a profit of $39 billion from the Iraq war, and this is largely due to the government contracts they were awarded to perform everything from transporting supplies to providing private security. Halliburton has become an expert in adapting and operating in unstable environments overseas. The rule is, where there is oil there is corruption and conflict, and Halliburton has learned to cash in on both sides of the coin. HAL benefits from both increased oil prices during oil related conflicts and the profit generated from the conflict itself thanks to their contracts supporting military operations.NasdaqThe above chart shows the fluctuation of oil prices since the start of war in the middle east. As you have probably noticed at your local pump, when tensions rise in the middle east, so does the price of gas. Not surprisingly, this chart and Halliburton's earnings almost mirror each other. For oilfield services, these are very prosperous times. The industry is seeing 25-year-highs in international drilling, and near record highs in U.S. drilling.""Oil prices have risen this year well above expectations, increasing yearly growth in global capital expenditures by exploration and production companies to 6% to 8% from an anticipated 5% to 6%,"" says James Wicklund, who covers the industry at Credit Suisse Group. Halliburton is Wicklund's top pick because HAL leads in pressure pumping for fracking domestically and is No. 1 in well completions in North America.Halliburton does not plan to stop there. HAL predicts that oil and gas producers are going to increase spending this year by 5 to 9 percent, with most of this increase coming from the Middle East. Halliburton is expanding in other parts of the world as well. In Asia, Halliburton recently announced a fracking joint venture in China.In Europe, ""Operations in Russia, the North Sea, and Angola stood out in the quarter as Halliburton gained more contracts for drilling, evaluation and other work, including deals with Statoil in the North Sea,"" said the chief operating officer for Halliburton, Jeffrey Miller.The New York Times reported that Halliburton has also started fracking for natural gas in Poland. In addition, Halliburton is gearing up to get in on the ground floor with bankrupt Ukraine, which is the second largest recipient of gas from the Russian state-run gas giant, Gazprom, showing again that Halliburton is at home in unstable environments. In fact, there has already been controversy over some of the commercial deals concluded by Ukraine during the presidency of Viktor Yanukovich. In less than two weeks since he was deposed, these lucrative gas projects involving Western companies are coming under scrutiny.CONCLUSIONHalliburton has been on a steady climb the last few months with no indication of slowing down. With aggression escalating overseas, there is no end in sight to the middle eastern or Ukrainian turmoil and that spells good news for Halliburton. Their international holdings as well as their foothold here in North America creates a stable portfolio even in the most unstable environments. Morningstar lists 9 analysts with Buy ratings for Halliburton, and I agree.

2400535,54312,2014-08-08T04:25:05-04:00,"Oil field services companies are on momentum.Halliburton’s strategy to expand its market share in mature fields, deepwater, and unconventional, is generating massive profits for the company.Halliburton offers an attractive entry point with the market correction.","Oil field services companies are gaining momentum with the increase in capital spending from the entire energy sector. Most of the production and exploration companies have been shifting their focus towards oil and liquid plays which substantially increased their capital spending over the past two years. Additionally, these companies are making significant transitions to multi-well pad activity, which is further enhancing drilling and completion services. Moving forward, long-term fundamentals of the oil field services companies look strong with the increasing demand for energy resources. International unconventional oil and natural gas, deepwater projects, and mature field will add to activity improvements.Halliburton Corporation (NYSE:HAL) is one of the best companies operating in the oil field services industry. It has been generating massive growth in revenues and earnings over the past few years. The company has been capitalizing on the growing demand with its innovative products and technologies. In the past three years, Halliburton has generated 17% growth in revenues and around 10% growth in earnings. Recently, the company announced second-quarter results with record quarterly revenue of $8.1B and a substantial 23% increase in operating income. The company has generated strong growth all over the world. In North America, its revenue growth was at 11%, in the Eastern Hemisphere by 9%, in the Middle East/Asia by 11%, in Europe/Africa/CIS by 6% and in Latin America by 4%.On top of strong revenue growth, its margins have been improving with the increasing demand for its services and efficiencies in its cost structure led by the application of key technologies and strategic initiatives. Halliburton is anticipating strong growth activities for the remainder part of this year with a strong demand for consulting and software and increased integrated project activity. To continue to capitalize on the demand, Halliburton is focusing on mature fields, unconventional plays, and deepwater markets by leveraging its broad technology. The company is also looking for acquisitions which align with its business structure and further enhance its product and services portfolio. Recently, it acquired U.K. based Neftex Petroleum Consultants specializing in consulting for subsurface risk reduction and sequence stratigraphy-based products.Furthermore, the company's business plan includes investments on producing and enhancing technologies and its infrastructure to ensure future growth. Halliburton intends to expand its international market share along with margin expansion in North America. To do that, it is investing a substantial amount in international regions and leveraging technology and reducing cost with efficient management. That is the reason the company has increased its capital budget for 2014 by $300M to $3.3B. Its cash generating potential is very strong to support potential investments. With the strong growth in its earnings, its operating cash flows also increased by 18% compared to the past quarter. Its operating cash flows are strong enough to cover capital investments and dividends for investors.In the past quarter, its operating cash flows were at $2B when capital expenditure was at $1.3B and dividend payments at only $254M. Its operating cash flows are offering a lot of room for dividend increase in the coming days and Halliburton has recently announced that it will distribute around 35% of operating cash flow to share holders, which is double than previous level. With its strong cash generating potential, it has also recently announced a $4.8B of new buyback program which will positively impact its share price and dividends.The company's cash position shows that it has no risk of liquidity and its dividend is sustainable. Let's take a look at its business outlook to reveal any other risk associated with the company. HAL is operating in the oil field services industry which is on momentum with the healing of economy. Most of the Exploration & Production and Integrated Oil and Gas companies are moving towards liquid and oil plays which are forcing them to accelerate investments. This in turn enhances the demand for oilfield services providers. Further, long-term fundamentals are also strong as the demand for energy resources are growing both in developed and developing economies.In ConclusionHalliburton's strategy to expand its market share in mature fields, deepwater, and unconventional, is generating massive profits for the company. This strategy allowed it to post record revenue in its production enhancement, cementing, baroid, wireline, artificial lift product lines and production chemicals. With the record growth in the first half of this year, the company is set make record results for the full year. With the present market correction, Halliburton's share price only lost 4% which offers an opportunity to initiate a position in the company. Further, with its new strategy of distributing 35% cash to share holder, I am expecting a hefty dividend increase from the company and steady price appreciation over the coming days.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

It was a well-timed piece, given that Halliburton reported earnings this morning. This author has been a long-term bull on this oil services firm for some time, especially in November 2012, when the shares of this energy shares were going for just $30 a share during a lull in North American drilling activity.What I liked about the article is that it provided some fresh insight on the current industry fundamentals, as well as several well-articulated arguments on why the company will continue to deliver very solid results.Global drilling activity is at its highest level in 25 years, and North American activity in near all-time highs. Credit Suisse recently raised its estimate of global drilling activity growth this year to 6% to 8%, from 5% to 6% previously. The earnings this morning from Halliburton, as well as the results last week from Baker Hughes (BHI) show North American demand is very strong. Both these companies get over 50% of their revenues from North America, even as they experience significant growth in overseas sales.Specifically to Halliburton, the company's $1B investment in its internal deepwater infrastructure has allowed it to expand that specialty to 30 countries, and the company aims to grow its revenue from this business 25% faster than the growth of the overall space.Halliburton is a one-stop shop for exploration and production plays in North America, where it can supply the technology, expertise and materials to significantly expand production right down to 6,000 rail cars to supply the sand used in ""fracking"".This success in expanding production is starting to allow Halliburton to raise prices and expand margins. It also should eventually have a huge opportunity to expand this knowledge overseas as more countries get on the fracking revolution train. This includes China, which has just started to ""frack"" in its first major commercial field. Revenue rose 50% last year from Saudi Arabia as well.The company is also becoming much more shareholder-friendly. The company has raised its dividend 67% since the end of 2012. Halliburton also added $1 billion to an existing $5 billion stock buyback authorization.Halliburton is the market leader in the domestic pressure pumping market. 60% of the contracts should be renegotiated by the end of the year. Given the current strength in this market, Halliburton should be able get solid price increases on these contracts.This morning, the company reported earnings that met bottom line expectations with a 20% year-over-year gain. The company beat the consensus on revenue by over $200 million. Earnings in the S&P 500 are projected to gain approximately 5% to 6% year-over-year in 2014 on a 3% to 4% increase in revenue. In contrast, Halliburton is tracking towards a ~25% gain in earnings in 2014, on the back of a ~10% increase in sales.Both the market and Halliburton are trading at 16-17 forward earnings, despite Halliburton's superior growth. The company also trades at about a 15% discount to competitor Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB), even though their earnings and revenue trajectories are almost exactly the same. Given Halliburton's long-term growth drivers and the current valuation of the stock, I believe this growth story will continue to deliver in the immediate future.

Had I finished this one just two days sooner, it would've (again) been the first opinion with the highest price target by far. As detailed below, my prior target was reached, as have most of my targets that were the highest when offered.However, just as I was finishing it up late last week, Goldman Sachs raised their HAL price target by $15. I mention that not because I think I'm in the same league with the venerable Goldman Sachs, but to make clear that my target decision and timing is unrelated to the GS target increase.Similarly, my first official HAL call was in an October 2013 article with cursory opinions on several stocks, which got lost in the shuffle. It included:That was exactly the outcome, as summarized in a July 2013 comment:I didn't know the outcome a year before it happened from a crystal ball. I just did my due diligence and read far beyond the shock-value headlines, including various reports [pdf] and statements from individuals present at the accident.I mention that because the Macondo incident made HAL very undervalued and created opportunities to open a new position, whereas the subsequent dips are great chances to add to HAL holdings. In other words, my call is for building a long-term investing position over time, not for short-term trading.Call PerformanceBecause no stock goes up in a straight line, it's deceiving to only evaluate call performance on the day a follow-up article like this one is posted. Therefore, in order to contextualize the to-date performance of my initial published call, I've also included peak performance from that call, as well as to-date performance from my unofficial call/buy. My October 14, 2013 initial published call was:In an update article written during the first week of this year and published on January 9 (while HAL was trading around $48-49, which is its low for 2014); I increased my price target with the following:The performance of my call has been:[+41% to-date from published call / +45% peak / +142% from $29 call/buy]At the time of my early-January update, the vast majority of firms had been reducing both their ratings and price targets for HAL. In fact, a number of the price targets sank to the low $50s (where HAL had already been for a month) and most firms didn't raise their ratings or price targets until after the April 21, 2014 Q1 earnings report (HAL had already reached the low $60s by that time).Source: Yahoo FinanceCall Update (Upside Potential, Time Frame & Downside Risk)I'm again raising my 9-12 month price target for HAL. My new target is $85, which is 195% above the $29 price of my initial buy call, 74% above the $49 price at the time of my official calls, and 23% above the $69 current price. To be clear, I'm not suggesting that HAL shares will immediately rally to my 9-12 month price target following the next earnings report or other news event. As always, the timeline is just as important to the call as the price target.My price target is based partially on the trailing and forward P/E ratios for HAL, both in absolute terms with current and historical valuations, as well as from a relative valuation perspective comparing HAL to competitors. Similarly, I also factored in the PEG ratio, both in absolute terms and relative to competitors. And, yet another basis for my price target is numerous Discounted Cash Flow calculations to estimate how HAL might fare in various earnings scenarios.Discounted-Cash-Flow ValuationsAs the chart below shows, HAL's earnings are expected to grow at an average rate of 21.85% over the next five years. Even though the next-year growth rate is projected at 29.10% and the growth rate for the past five years was 22.39%, I reduced the next-five 21.85% projected growth rate to only 20% in order to make my DCF calculations very conservative.For the same reason, I applied the 20% reduced growth rate to only the next three years, rather than the projected and more typical five years. I also used a conservative 3% terminal growth rate and reduced the $5.15 next-year EPS projection to only $5.00. I also used a conservative 12% discount rate, instead of the far more forgiving and more common 10%. These calculations result in a share price of $88, and are one basis for my 9-12 month price target of $85.Price-To-Earnings Ratio ValuationsI've calculated the P/E ratios using the EPS data shown in the chart below. The last four quarters of adjusted diluted EPS from HAL were $0.73, $0.83, $0.93 and $0.73 (total $3.22). With the current $69 share price, the trailing-twelve P/E for HAL is 21.43x (not the 22.08x shown on Yahoo Finance). The $5.15 next-year EPS projection for HAL makes the forward P/E 13.40x.According to ten-year historical data from S&P Capital IQ, the past P/E range for HAL is 10-24x, with the most typical range being about 16-17x. Obviously, investors are most interested in future value and, more specifically, I'm most interested in value 9-12 months from now since that's my target timeline.Applying a 16.50x forward P/E to the $5.15 next-year earnings projection for HAL results in a share price of $85 and that is one basis for my price target. If 2015FY estimates continue to trend upward and eventually surpass $5.50 over the next 9-12 months, as I believe they will, the forward P/E would only need to approach 15.50x in order for the share price to reach $85.Source: Yahoo FinancePeer Group P/E Relative ValuationsI'm actually not a big fan of relative valuation since I believe that there are far too many differences among companies for anything even remotely close to an apples-to-apples comparison. At the same time, I also understand that many investors value all companies based solely on relative valuations, which makes such valuations relevant since investors collectively set share prices.Thus, while I never base my price targets solely on relative valuations, they do help confirm that a valuation is reasonable. The fact that my price target falls within the valuation ranges already granted to competitors is encouraging.As the table below shows, HAL is currently valued more cheaply than all major competitors except WFT, which I do not really consider comparable to HAL, or any of the other major oilfield-services companies, for that matter.Source: data from Yahoo Finance, calculations by authorIf HAL were to trade up to the 24.48x trailing P/E currently allotted to BHI, the HAL share price would be $78.83, and that's with trailing earnings significantly lower than current earnings. Similarly, if HAL traded up to the 16.84x forward P/E currently allotted to SLB, the HAL share price would be $86.73. I believe similar multiples are achievable for HAL, but I'm not necessarily arguing that they should apply on a sustainable basis. Again, my opinion is not only that the current multiples are too low, but also that 2015FY earnings will surpass $5.50. If that happens, the aforementioned multiples won't really need to be reached, as the earnings would drive the shares to $85 at lower multiples.Price-To-Earnings Growth ValuationsThe other valuation methods are also supported by the fact that the 0.98x PEG ratio for HAL is also the lowest in the peer group. WFT has been losing money (negative EPS is why there is no trailing-twelve P/E ratio in the above chart) and doesn't pay dividends, so only the PEG ratios for BHI and SLB are relevant to HAL. The PEG ratios for BHI and SLB are 1.39x and 1.30x, respectively.I like the PEG ratio as a valuation metric since it's more forward looking than a trailing P/E ratio, but a drawback to both is that they disregard dividends. As a result, stocks with dividends typically have a higher PEG ratio than the general target of 1.00x or below. The higher dividend yield of SLB (plus other factors) explains why SLB is valued with a notably higher PEG ratio, but I contend that HAL should be valued at least comparably to BHI, if not better.Downside Risk EstimationIt's always possible that HAL could drop back to, or below, its current 200-SMA of $57, but I think that's unlikely since the fundamentals have been so strong and improving over the past couple of years. In fact, HAL has not traded below its 200-SMA in almost two years.Especially in absence of a market-wide correction that is more severe than the possible 10% I expect, or some other extreme event, I think HAL is unlikely to dip lower than about 5% above its 200-SMA. I don't plan to add to my position unless HAL dips to at least a $60-64 range, though I'm not predicting that will happen. Your situation, preferences and risk tolerance may vary.Company Growth DriversIn addition to the stock valuation factors just covered, there are actually many components of my HAL investment thesis that collectively lead me to believe the company has additional growth in its future. With that said, in attempt to keep the article from being even longer, I'll stick to the following three factors: [1] market-leading products and services, continual technology advances and focus on integrated services; [2] global expansion is following North America leadership with particularly good timing; [3] short-term weaknesses subsiding.Some specific events that support each of the three factors seemed to best fit in the chronological Company Updates section below, so it's important to take all of the information offered throughout the article as part of a single thesis.Also, before getting into HAL's extremely strong and growing market position, I must first set a foundation to address the inevitable question of what makes HAL better than BHI or SLB. I'm not a fan of oversimplifying everything into zero-sum, Highlander-type ""there can be only one"" false choices; so I simply don't subscribe to the thinking that only one company in any industry can be very successful and, thus, a great investment. The fact that HAL is a great investment does not mean that BHI or SLB are not.For example, I consider why the customer lists are practically identical for all of the oil services ""big three"" (BHI, HAL and SLB). Perhaps it's because they don't all have exactly the same products, services or technologies, and each company has specific strengths that can be more or less important in any of many scenarios within a very complex industry. After all, the companies are not manufacturing clothes that are exactly the same except for a brand.[1] Market-leading products/services, technologies and integrated servicesIn addition to the discovery of huge deposits like the Eagle Ford and Bakken shale formations, as well as a push for U.S. energy independence, the North American oil and gas boom is largely driven by process advancements such as fracking. As noted in the Company Overview section above, HAL is the pioneer of fracking and has always been an industry leader in technologies. Especially for mature traditional wells already past their peaks, unconventional wells that decline faster, and wells in deepwater or otherwise environmentally sensitive locales; continually improving technology is key to oil and gas development.I contend that HAL's penchant for technological advancements will allow the company to gradually increase prices, margins and profitability over the long term as customers are able to do the same with the help of HAL technologies.Similarly, I contend that HAL's move toward more integrated services offerings will perpetuate the trend toward gradually increasing profitability over the long term since consulting-oriented work offers particularly high margins.I combined those two sub topics into one section because it's hard to separate services integration from technology since it occurs largely via technology. The bottom line is that, whether it's by turning over management of mature fields to HAL to get more out of them, or by taking a similar approach to developing new wells, customers like the increased integration that HAL is offering since it simplifies their workflow and increases their profits. Not only will that increase profits for HAL directly, but I believe it will lead to more industry consolidation since only the ""big three"" have the breadth to service entire projects.Source: company presentationIn 2013, HAL introduced [pdf] CYPHER Seismic-to-Stimulation service. The CYPHER service is a collaborative workflow that integrates various engineering disciplines to better predict and produce unconventional reserves. The service is supported by a breakthrough technology suite that uses an iterative process to incorporate deposit data from the past, present and future into a continually updated modeling environment. This allows customers to accurately identify the best well placement and stimulation designs, which leads to increased total production in less time and with fewer resources, thus increased profitability.CYPHER is unique to the industry in that it is capable of updating dynamically and iteratively with the seismic and well data required to model the structure, rock and fluid properties. In June of 2014, HAL announced the release of the CYPHER 2.0 service. Jim Brown, HAL Western Hemisphere President, said:The use of water for fracking is another area where HAL has made significant technological advancements and can offer customers more integrated services, lessening their need to rely on as many suppliers. I believe this will become an increasingly important competitive advantage as fresh water scarcity becomes more pronounced over the long term, and as increased global presence puts HAL on more projects in locales where water scarcity is an even bigger issue.HAL pioneered the H2OForward water treatment service to use non-freshwater sources (including some forms of waste water) and recycle frac water for reuse in frac fluids and other production processes. With its CleanWave, UniStim and other custom-chemistry technologies, HAL reduces the overall amounts of water that well operators consume, thereby also reducing customer costs for water procurement and disposal.Speaking of water, offshore drilling will clearly play a major role in the future of oil and gas production as new deposits are discovered in deepwater areas that were previously inaccessible, and new technologies make developing such resources feasible. One of those new technologies from HAL is the company's ESTMZ (Enhanced Single-Trip Multizone) completion system. Because wells with deposits on multiple layers usually require drilling each layer separately, the ESTMZ system has the potential to save as much as forty two days of rig time for a five-zone well completion. A five-zone well with a $1 million spread rate (total daily cost to drill the well) would result in up to $42 million savings to the operator on a single well. Obviously, this technology has tremendous implications for HAL customers, and for HAL. See a Chevron case study [pdf].[2] Global expansion following North America leadership with good timingAccording to the U.S. Energy Information Administration [EIA], U.S. crude oil production will have increased by nearly 60% between 2008 and the end of 2014, and the 2015 forecast represents the highest annual average level of oil production in the more than four decades since 1972.HAL has the greatest exposure to North America of the ""big three"" and, as the company's financial performance has indicated over the past couple of years, that has worked out quite nicely. Clearly, North America has been a good place to be the oil services market leader in recent years.At the same time, as noted in the Company Overview, HAL also has operations in eighty countries and has been active internationally for many decades. The table below shows that HAL has been shifting to an even more balanced mix between North America and the company's other three geographic regions. So far in 2014, the mix nudged back up to 53% of revenue from North America due to the three reasons shown on the slide below, but the trend remains.Source: data from company annual reports, compiled into table by authorSource: company presentationHaving spent over $1 billion in the past three years to open fifty new facilities in thirty of the eighty nations in which the company operates, HAL is investing aggressively to build its global infrastructure and develop new opportunities. I think HAL is making this transition with perfect timing that will drive long-term growth for the company since it aligns with the global landscape.Most of the rest of the world started recovering from the global economic crisis of 2009 even more slowly than North America, so it was actually beneficial to HAL not to have as much exposure to weaker markets. Perhaps because of the economic conditions, most other regions seem to be a few years behind North America regarding the shale boom. It also seems that many nations are just starting to make progress in accepting the need for outside expertise in order to optimize mature fields, as well as to develop unconventional deposits.Most other markets throughout the world (including many developed nations) simply don't have a comparable combination of large unconventional deposits, the technological know-how to locate and develop the deposits they do have, and the infrastructure to handle the output once they develop deposits. Both optimizing mature fields and developing unconventional deposits present very significant technological and logistical challenges, which represent opportunity for HAL in the Middle East/Asia, Latin America, Europe/Africa/CIS regions.For example, even though both Mexico and Brazil have been weak points for HAL in recent quarters, I don't believe that changes the long-term story and there are signs that both are improving already. As Mexico opens up its oil and gas industry to foreign investment for the first time in 76 years, it may to turn into the leader in the Latin America region. As Mexico and other Latin America nations adjust, Brazil will have to follow suit if it is ever going to smooth out its very bumpy road to becoming the sixth largest crude oil producer in the world (see recent encouraging news from Brazil in the Company Updates section).Source: company presentation[3] Various short-term factors that led to undervaluation are each subsidingAs detailed in the earnings results comments in the Company Updates section, the extreme weather of this past winter in North America had a major impact on oil and gas activity throughout the industry. Especially as a Florida resident, it seems strange to talk about that in July, but the upcoming 2014 Q2 earnings report is actually the first one for a period that wasn't fully blanketed by winter months. As CEO David Lesar mentioned during the 2014 Q1 earnings call, HAL expects a strong rebound in the 2014 second half, not just the second quarter:In the article introduction, I touched on the fact that concerns about the 2010 Macondo accident (a.k.a, Deepwater Horizon) wrongly caused HAL to become extremely undervalued for a period of time. Granted, this doesn't really apply to the types of investors who read SA, but there are many investors out there who don't read or fully understand information about the industries they don't work in and still fear investing in HAL because of Macondo. So, there is likely still some degree of overhang on the stock even at this point and that kind of thing only gradually becomes less of a drag on share prices with time.There are other short-term factors that affected recent periods, such as excess fracking capacity in some areas, but the point is that each of these temporary headwinds have been getting resolved and transforming into tailwinds for HAL.Company UpdatesThe following list of updates is not intended to be exhaustive. It is a collection of noteworthy events that directly relate to my thesis, and that I believe many investors will find helpful to have referenced in one place.January 8: HAL opened a new Unconventional & Reservoir Productivity Technology Center in Saudi Arabia. I believe this venture will strengthen the relationship between HAL and Saudi Aramco, leading to future opportunities.January 14: HAL announced [pdf] its plans for a new Integrated Completions Center in Louisiana. The new facility will expand HAL resources and capabilities for deepwater completion tools while improving service alignment, equipment maintenance, preparation and job execution for Gulf of Mexico customers.January 20: Bloomberg reported that HAL may again be interested in acquiring England oilfield-services company Expro International Group, which HAL had previously bid to acquire in 2008. I could find no new developments on this.January 21: HAL reported [pdf] 2013 Q4/FY earnings results, beating both the revenue and EPS consensus estimates. North America growth was modest due to disruptions from extreme winter weather, but strong international growth more than made up the difference. Even so, the shares sold off for two weeks, presenting the best buying opportunity this year. The selloff was likely due to market weakness combined with management comments about challenges the Latin America business faced. The conference call transcript is here.February 3: HAL announced [pdf] the signing of a partnership agreement with Gubkin Russian State University of Oil & Gas to help develop unconventional resources in Russia, including the Bazhenov shale. HAL plans to provide senior technical and management staff to serve on Gubkin's Industry Advisory Board, as well as the foundation material for the university unconventional resources curriculum that will become the basis for student and industry training.April 17: Petrotech Xinjiang Engineering, a subsidiary of SPT Energy Group, which is one of the leading non-state-owned oil field service providers in China, entered into a joint venture [JV] with HAL [pdf]. The JV will focus on hydraulic fracturing and production enhancement services in Xinjiang, China.April 21: HAL reported [pdf] 2014 Q1 earnings results, again beating both the revenue and EPS consensus estimates. North America performance improved, but only modestly as the impact of extreme winter weather lingered. However, 2014 Q2 North America operations are expected to be robust due to pent-up demand from weather issues. As forecasted on the prior call, Latin America revenue dropped off significantly due to reduced activity in Brazil and Mexico, but margins improved and HAL expects full-year performance in the region to be in line with 2013 levels. The conference call transcript is here.May 5: HAL won the Offshore Technology Conference Spotlight on Technology Award for its TDReam Tool.May 21: HAL held its 2014 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.May 21: Bloomberg reported that Petroleos de Venezuela, the state-owned oil company, signed a financing deal with HAL worth $600 million.June 15: HAL presented at the World Petroleum Congress in Moscow, Russia.June 30: Bloomberg reported that HAL is likely to participate when Petrobras (NYSE: PBR) reissues more than $2 billion of its drilling-service contracts ""after a reduction in the company's rig fleet eroded supplier margins."" During the earnings call in January, David Lesar, CEO of HAL, made comments that seemed to foreshadow some improvement in the company's Brazil situation:July 10: HAL Baroid drilling fluids and waste management service line received American Petroleum Institute [API] Specification Q2 Certification, which is an advanced industry certification standard for oil and nat gas service companies.July 11: HAL announced additional details about the JV it entered into in April for hydraulic fracturing and production enhancement services in China. HAL has worked on conventional projects in China for over three decades and has worked with China's SPT Energy Group since 2004, but this new deal is HAL's first fracking JV in China. HAL will hold 49% and SPT will hold 51% of the new company called Xinjiang HDTD Oilfield Services Company Limited. The JV is focused on the Xinjiang province, which is among the most geographically complicated regions of China and is rich in tight oil and gas. This is especially significant considering two directly related factors. First, China's stated goal to double oil and gas production by 2030, primarily via unconventional sources (HAL excels in unconventionals). Second, there are plans for a new $30 billion pipeline through Xinjiang, which will be the most expensive oil pipeline in the world. David Zeng, HAL vice president for China commented about the JV:July 21: HAL is expected to report 2014 Q2 earnings results before the market open and hold the corresponding conference call shortly thereafter.August 13: HAL will present at the Annual Deepwater Intervention Forum.Company OverviewEstablished in 1919 by Erle P. Halliburton in Oklahoma, the Halliburton Oil Well Cementing Company [HOWCO] is now called Halliburton - Fortune 500 global oilfield-services company that provides a wide range of products and services related to the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas.In the late 1920s and 1930s, Halliburton began its transition into a global firm and, in the 1940s, Halliburton expanded into Latin America and the Middle East; and also started providing services to the Arabian-American Oil Company (predecessor of Saudi Aramco, the largest oil company in the world). In 1949, the first commercial license for hydraulic fracturing was granted to HAL. In the 1950s, Halliburton expanded its operations to Italy, Germany, Argentina and England. In the 1980s, Halliburton was the first U.S. firm to perform oilfield service work in China and, in the 1990s, Halliburton opened offices in Russia.While Halliburton is known for its leadership in North American operations, its divisions are organized in four geographic regions comprised of approximately eighty individual countries: North America, Latin America, Europe/Africa/CIS and Middle East/Asia. In 2007, Halliburton established a second headquarters in Dubai, United Arab Emirates to strengthen its Eastern Hemisphere presence and ""provide new manufacturing capacity, move closer to key markets, and help reduce the costs of moving materials, products, tools and people.""In addition to wholly-owned segments that include the Halliburton name, some are widely known by distinct brands since they had strong industry recognition prior to being acquired by Halliburton. Those include: Baroid Industrial Drilling Products, Boots & Coots, Landmark Software, SensorTran and Sperry Drilling.Halliburton also owns stakes in numerous joint ventures [JVs] throughout the world including: Arabian Rockbits & Drilling Tools [ARDT]; a JV with Trinidad Drilling (OTCPK:TDGCF), which SA contributor Jeff Williams wrote an article about; a Gazprom Neft (OTCQX:GZPFY) Technology Cooperation Agreement; and a SPT Energy Group JV announced in April [pdf]. I wasn't able to confirm whether HAL still owns a stake in Enventure Global Technologies, which it started as a JV with Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE:RDS.A), (NYSE:RDS.B).Halliburton comprises thirteen product service lines [PSLs], which operate in two divisions: Drilling & Evaluation, and Completion & Production. Because the Consulting & Project Management PSL is the single spearhead of Halliburton's integrated-services strategy, it works across both operating divisions, though its financial results are included within the Drilling & Evaluation division.For more details about Halliburton, see the company website.Analyst OpinionsTwo analysts now rate HAL a Strong Buy, nineteen rate it a Buy, seven rate it a Hold and zero rate it a Sell. The consensus rating is Buy and the consensus price target is $68.83. Here are the most recent analyst changes:Final ThoughtsI obviously like HAL a lot and believe that it has very strong company-specific, industry-specific and macro-economic growth trends in its favor. However, no stock goes up in a straight line, so perhaps writing about HAL while the price is a little higher than I'm willing to pay helps reaffirm that my opinions are from a long-term investing perspective. Even though my HAL position is already at a pretty low cost basis, I get more conservative with every new grey hair, so I only add at prices that offer both upside potential and downside protection.Plus, I think this is a time to be cautious in the market in general. I'm far from among those who've been predicting a deep market correction every day since 2009, but for only the second time in two years, I do believe that a correction has become more likely in the coming weeks or months. That is still within the context of a secular bull market that I believe will continue for at least another year or three, but the recent market dip probably wasn't all for the year either.Therefore, my opinion is that scaling into positions is as important as always, if not more, and that applies to HAL just like any other stock. Or, as Peter Lynch puts it, ""The best stock to buy is the one you already own.""I have one final thought that's somewhat off topic. Articles on stocks like HAL that everyone knows get ten or twenty times as many readers, but many of my best money-making calls are about sparsely-covered companies that I had never even heard of until I started researching them for investment suitability.Whether mine or those of other SA contributors, articles about under-covered stocks are often where the real money is at, so perhaps consider looking at my recent Standex International article and/or Raymond James Financial article. I have many others on under-the-radar companies that've been successful calls, but those are probably the only two still within the free-access thirty days.Thanks for reading and best of luck. I wrote this article 5/26-7/13. I apologize in advance that I can no longer spend time on comments beyond the opinions that I offer in my articles. As always, every reader is free to dismiss any or all of my opinions. Or, as SA puts it, ""Read. Decide. Invest.""Disclosure: The author is long HAL, CVX, RJF.

2326085,25120,2014-07-21T09:50:19-04:00,"Halliburton is benefiting from the recovery in the oilfield service market.The strong US exposure boost the growth profile and reduces geo-political risks.I like the stock, the valuation and opportunities for margin expansion. Yet after 40% returns so far this year, I am only buying on significant pullbacks.","Investors in Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) were pleased with the solid second quarter earnings report that was accompanied by a billion dollar hike to its share repurchase program, which now totals $6 billion.The company's strong presence in the US actually reduces political risks and increases its growth profile in this environment. I like the stock on a significant pullback but won't rush in at current highs after this year's strong momentum.Second Quarter HighlightsHalliburton posted second quarter sales of $8.05 billion, up 10.0% on the year before. Sales rose by a strong 9.6% on a sequential basis as well driven by the relatively weaker first quarter, a time when Halliburton's operations are challenged due to winter weather in many geographical areas. Revenues comfortably beat consensus estimates at $7.88 billion.The company posted earnings of $774 million for the quarter, up 20.2% compared to last year. Earnings per share grew even quicker thanks to sizable share repurchases over the past year.Earnings came in at $0.91 per share, up nearly 32% on the year and came in line with consensus estimates.Looking Into The PerformanceRevenue growth was largely driven by the company's largest completion and production segment. Sales came in at $4.94 billion, up 11.0% compared to last year. Operating earnings were up by 21.2% boosting margins to very healthy levels of nearly 18.0%. Of course the strong performance in the US, Saudi Arabia as well as beneficial weather in Europe and Russia aided the topline.Drilling and evaluation sales rose by 5.2% to $3.11 billion. Despite the increase in topline sales, operating earnings dropped by a million to $414 million. As such, margins fell towards 13.3% of sales.All of this boosted sales, while earnings per share saw an additional boost from sizable share repurchases. The total share count dropped by little over 8% over the past year.Just like its competitor Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) reported, Halliburton's sales growth was driven by North America amidst the energy revolution. Sales rose by 14.2% which is very important given that the company generated 54% of total revenues in that area over the past quarter.Europe and Africa, as well as the Middle-East and Asia showed healthy revenue growth was well, while sales in Latin America were down.ValuationAt the end of the quarter, Halliburton held nearly $2.4 billion in cash and equivalents. Its total debt stands at $7.8 billion, resulting in a $5.4 billion total net debt position. Note that the company has made $1.3 billion in contingency reserves related to the Macondo well incident.On a trailing basis, Halliburton has posted sales of $30.5 billion on which it posted earnings which are approaching $3 billion.At $71 per share, equity in the business is valued at $60 billion. This values the company's equity at roughly 2 times annual sales and 20 times trailing earnings.Difficult Past, Positioned For GrowthHalliburton had a somewhat troubled past. It has seen many controversies including the 1998 purchase of Dresser Industries which it renamed as KBR and has been involved in numerous scandals. This led the company to try to sell the business in 2005, while it took until 2007 until the business has been spun off.Other issues were of course the close ties to former Vice President Dick Cheney, controversies surrounding contracts in Iraq, and the involvement in the 2010 disaster with BP's (NYSE:BP) Deepwater Horizon explosion.That being said, the company has still benefited from the strong growth in the industry. From a base of revenues of $10 billion by 2005, it has grown sales to $30 billion on a trailing basis. The trouble is that earnings have been lagging significantly, and hardly moved up in this time frame. The company has repurchased 15-20% of this shares since 2005, especially in recent years. This has aided earnings per share quite a bit.At its first quarter earnings presentation, Halliburton furthermore commented on the favorable long term growth outlook. Between 2012 and 2020 the company sees 11% compounded annual growth in the deepwater well service market anticipated to increase towards roughly $100 billion by 2020. This combined with the fracking operations in the US onshore should boost the future top and bottom line going forwards.The clear focus for the company should be to boost margins which have been slipping over the past decade. Net margins of about 10%, trail that of industry leader Schlumberger by a wide margin, after it has reported trailing margins of about 14%.Final TakeawayDespite the troubled past, the controversies and real lack of earnings growth, shares of Halliburton have been on the rise over the past decade. Shares peaked at nearly $50 in 2007, but fell to lows of just $15 during the financial crisis.Excluding the volatility in 2011 and 2012, shares have steadily risen to current highs in the low $70s. Shares currently trade at 20 times trailing earnings which implies a small premium compared to the overall market. This comes after shares have risen 40% already in 2014.While the premium might be warranted given the strong historical growth, and margin expansion opportunities ahead, don't forget that Halliburton remains a cyclical business. The strong US exposure might actually be a big pro in this geo-political uncertain environment. An added benefit are the strong growth prospects for production in the US.For now management continues to return a lot of cash, with Halliburton currently allowed to repurchase $6 billion worth of shares, or 10% of the outstanding share base.I must say that I really like the shares, but am blown away by the very steep momentum so far this year. I am a buyer if hopefully a nice correction would occur, hoping for a entry point in the low sixties in order to acquire a strong player at general market level multiples.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2283143,54312,2014-06-24T05:08:12-04:00,"Oilfield Services companies are gaining momentum.Halliburton is set to generate a double-digit growth in earnings.Halliburton has the ability to return a significant amount of cash to investors.Schlumberger looks a bit undervalued compared to Halliburton, but both are good long-term investments.","Oilfield services companies have been gaining momentum over the past three years with the increased investments from the entire energy sector. Some of the big companies like Halliburton (NYSE:HAL), Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB), National Oilwell Varco (NYSE:NOV), and Baker Hughes (BHI) are launching innovative technologies and are providing well-organized services to grab onto the demand and extend their market share. Thus, these companies have been generating strong growth in revenue and earnings over the past three years. Last year remains the strongest year for these companies because they generated record growth and most have been able to produce double-digit growth in earnings. By generating a double-digit growth in earnings, their cash-generating potential also enhanced, and thus, most of them have announced massive increases in dividends and have extended their buyback programs.Halliburton is one of the strongest companies that is operating in the oilfield services industry. It is operating in two segments: completion and production and drilling and evaluation. Both of its business segments are generating record growth for the company. On a consolidated basis, HAL has generated 17% revenue growth over the past three years. A strong demand for its products like perforating and testing, completion tools, Multi-Chem service, and wireline technology led to record revenues. Its Multi-Chem service, perforating, and testing product lines; Boots & Coots activity; and software sales set new landmarks for its sales and operating income. In 2013, HAL produced record results in 6 out of 13 products. It has experienced very strong growth in the international regions, particularly in the Asian region and the Middle East. Its business strategy is simple; it is to expand its share within the deepwater market, leading in global unconventional development and helping its customers maximize recovery from mature fields.Source: Morningstar.comHowever, one red flag for the company is its ability to convert record revenue growth to big profits. Over the past three years, it has been consistently generating growth in revenues, but their earnings per share is decreasing. This is due to the charges related to the Macondo incident. In the last year, it paid $1.0 billion to the Macondo-related loss, which contingency impacted its operating income. Nevertheless, the company has generated 11% growth in operating margins, excluding Macondo-related losses. Furthermore, HAL is looking to sustain its momentum this year. Recently, it announced its first-quarter results of 2014, which illustrates that it is right on track. HAL has again posted a record revenue of $7.3 billion, and its operating income increased by 8% compared to the first quarter of 2013. Going forward, HAL is expecting to increase its growth in earnings per share by 25% in the second quarter of this year in comparison to the first quarter, specifically in North America.All the positive developments have increased investors' confidence in HAL. Consequently, its share price surged more than 67% in the past year alone. Its share price gained more the 11% in the past month, which moved its share price to an all-time high of $70.62 per share. In addition to the strong financial performance, the company has also increased investors' confidence by returning a significant amount of cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks. The company has recently announced a dividend increase of 20%, which is the second dividend increase in 2013, representing a collective 67%, and I am expecting a similar increase in dividends at the end of this year. It has very strong cash-generating potential. In the last quarter, its cash flow from operations was $954 million and its capital expenditure was $643 million, resulting in free cash flow of $311 million, which is two times their dividend payment of $127 million. It is also working on reducing outstanding shares, and since the past year, it has reduced its outstanding share by 11%.Where Do the Other Player Stand?Schlumberger is one of the closest peers of HAL. Schlumberger is the biggest giant in the oilfield services industry based on market capitalization and sales. Schlumberger, with its innovative product and technologies, has been generating strong growth in both revenues and earnings. In the past year and in the last quarter, it has generated double-digit growth in earnings. Its SIS software and WesternGeco multiclient sales have been adding considerable growth to the revenue. Furthermore, the company is looking to generate a double-digit growth in earnings again this year. In addition, Schlumberger's cash-generating potential is stronger than HAL as the company has been generating massive free cash flows. In 2013, Schlumberger generated free cash flows of $5.8 billion when dividend payments were only at $1.6 billion. Thus, it has also been aggressively working on buybacks and making huge increases in dividends. Since July of 2013, it has repurchased $2.6 billion in shares. With an ability to generate a massive amount of free cash flows, the company is now expecting to complete the buyback program of $10 billion in two and half years, which was initially planned to be completed in five years. On the back of strong financial performance, hefty order backlog, ability to win new contracts for its innovative technologies, and massive returns for investors, its stock gained 50.86% in the past year alone and reached a 52-week high $109.75 per share within the last week.In ConclusionSource:Morningstar.comHAL is heading in the right direction. The company has made footprints for future growth. Its margins are expected to rebound in North America in the second half of the year while generating very strong growth in international regions. I believe it will make a double-digit growth in earnings this year. Moreover, HAL will also increase dividends as they have in the past year. However, it looks more expensive than Schlumberger. Its high price to earnings and sales ratio and low forward price to earnings ratio make it a bit pricy compared to Schlumberger. Furthermore, Schlumberger offers high dividend yield compared to HAL. Schlumberger is also set to generate double-digit growth in earnings. I think having both Schlumberger and Halliburton in one's portfolio wouldn't be a bad idea. Amid this, I think it would be wise to wait for market correction before making a position in Halliburton. On the other hand, analysts have recently upgraded their price targets to $119 per share. At the moment, both companies' share price reached their 52-week high, and overall, both companies are long-term investments for defensive investors.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2319465,56732,2014-07-17T05:03:55-04:00,"Halliburton reported better than expected quarterly results and is expected to continue to perform well in the future.
        Increased drilling and exploration activity in deep-water will further strengthen the revenue base of the company.
        The strong drilling activity in the Eastern hemisphere was the prime reason for the performance that beat the market expectation.
        According to the Barclays bank report, companies are expected to spend about US$723 billion on exploration and production (E&P) in 2014. Halliburton stands to benefit from the trend.","Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) reported strong first quarter results. Halliburton reported a net income from continuing operations of $623 million after a loss of $13 million in the first quarter of last year. However, excluding the $637 million in charges related to the Macondo litigation recorded in the prior year, the company's earnings were flat. On the other hand, its revenue increased by 5.4% during the first quarter to record levels of $7.35 billion. The better than expected results were primarily driven by the strong drilling activity in the Eastern hemisphere. Similarly, higher offshore activity and operating efficiency also contributed to the company's profitability. It shall be desirable to discuss the company's recent results in detail and investigate whether the company is worth investing.The company divides its operations into two business segments: the Completion and Production segment and Drilling and Evaluation segment. The Completion and Production segment contributes more than 51% of the revenues while the remaining 49% is contributed by the Drilling and Evaluation segment.The Completion and Production segment offers cementing, stimulation, intervention, pressure control, and completion services. The segment consists of production enhancement services, completion tools and services. Similarly, the Drilling and Evaluation segment provides field and reservoir modeling, drilling, evaluation, and precise well bore placement solutions that enable customers to model, measure, and optimize their well construction activities.Much of the margin improvement is derived from the company's Completion and Production segment which includes the company's pressure pumping operations. The improvement in the margins of this segment is primarily driven by the company's initiatives like""Frac of the Future"".The ""Frac of the Future"" program allows the company to save millions of gallons of diesel each year by using natural gas to fuel drilling equipment. Natural gas is not only cheaper but its emissions are 90 percent lower than those of diesel.The company has been fitting its fracking fleet with new equipment such as efficient pumps that can operate on natural gas. Up until now, the company has only converted around 10 percent of its fleet to this program and expects to convert around 20 percent by the end of this year. Going forward, the company is determined to achieve a goal of around 50 percent by the end of 2015. Halliburton is leading the way by innovating the fracking process to ensure efficient operations, which will then be translated into higher margins.North America Will be the Driving ForceThe future outlook of the company largely depends upon the increasing E&P spending. In anticipation of higher natural gas prices, E&P companies are increasing their spending. According to research conducted by Barclays Bank, oil and gas companies are expected to spend about US$723 billion on exploration and production (E&P) in 2014which reflects an increase of 6.1% from 2013.The growth is primarily driven by North America as the region is expected to experience an increase of more than 7% in E&P spending in 2014, compared with a 2% increase in 2013 based on a survey of more than 300 oil and gas companies.The Gulf of Mexico is also witnessing an increase in drilling activity. It has seen the average rig count increase 23.5% last year to 58. The higher drilling activities create a bigger market for the company to operate. Going forward, the company is expecting to start drilling and evaluation services for an additional 14 to 16 deep water rigs. In addition, it is also optimistic about the higher levels of completion sales during 2014. Another key trend to look for in the North American region will be the increasing shift towards horizontal drilling in the Permian basin, which operates almost a third of oil directed rigs in the US, Halliburton stands out as one of the companies that will benefit the most from increasing E&P spending. The company is deriving nearly 50 percent of its revenues from the North American region.Deep-water GrowthDeep-water contracts are lucrative to oilfield service companies as they have long contract lives and have high service intensity. The margins in the industry are also relatively healthy. The company's new technology deployments could help the company to capture more market share. Going forward, Halliburton expects to outgrow its market by around 25 percent. The growth will primarily be driven by West Africa and the Gulf of Mexico.Concluding RemarksWith the recently enacted initiatives, Halliburton stands to benefit in two aspects. Firstly, the company will be able to ensure higher margins, supported by lower operating costs. Secondly, by switching to natural gas and clean sources of energy, the company is all set to go green. The coal to gas conversion will be much appreciated by long-term investors especially in a scenario when the U.S government is no longer supportive of coal-powered projects. Similarly, the company is well positioned to capitalize on the growth of deep-water drilling and exploration.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Halliburton has outperformed the Market Vectors Oil Services ETF (NYSEARCA:OIH) year-to-date; the former rose 39.6% while the ETF's value increased 19.6%.Barclays Plc (ADR) (NYSE:BCS) forecasts that spending by firms on exploration & production (E&P) activity this year will touch $723 billion, reflecting a 6.1% increase from $628 billion in 2013. Since E&P is a major revenue-driver for oil companies, Halliburton, along with others, looks to benefit from the increased investment. Halliburton has also increased its drilling activity, continuing its momentum in the Eastern hemisphere.Halliburton is currently in a transition phase, as it looks to turn toward cleaner sources of energy for its drilling activity. The company has initiated a program called ""Frac of the Future,"" whereby it has decided to power its drilling equipment through natural gas instead of diesel. Halliburton expects to run almost 50% of its drilling equipment on gas by the end of next year. This shift is bound to end up lowering operational costs, thereby boosting earnings going forward. According to reports, the company has converted almost 10% of its drilling equipment to natural gas.Bidness Etc believes the company will post robust revenue and earnings figures. Its closest competitors - Schlumberger Limited (NYSE:SLB) and Baker Hughes Incorporated (BHI) - also posted healthy earnings last week.Wall Street ExpectationsAnalysts expect Halliburton to post revenues of $7.9 billion year-over-year (YoY) - a 12.9% increase from $7 billion in 2QFY13. The quarter's revenues are expected to fall between $7.7 billion and $8 billion. The company has only missed analysts' revenue estimates once in the last six quarters. Halliburton announced revenues of $7.35 billion in 1QFY14 and analysts anticipate an increase of 7.5% from the last quarter.The net income for the quarter is forecasted to come in at $777.7 million - a 14.9% increase from $677 million in 2QFY13. Earnings per share (EPS) are estimated to be 91 cents, compared to 73 cents in 2QFY13. Having beaten earnings expectations for the last 23 quarters, Halliburton's EPS is expected to fall between 87 and 94 cents.Historical Price MovementsFor the last 10 quarters, Halliburton's one-day price has increased 1.42% on average, following its earnings announcement. Moreover, a three-day price-average for the last 10 quarters shows that the stock has increased approximately 2.3% within three days of the earnings announcement.Sell-Side Expectations & ValuationOut of 34 analysts covering the stock, 26 have given it a 'Buy' rating while six have recommended a 'Hold'. The stock has been assigned a 12-month average price of $76.75, indicating an upside potential of 9.1% over its last closing price of $70.35.Currently, Halliburton is trading at 15.2 times its estimated earnings for 2014, a 1% discount to the industry's average. However, on a 3-year forward earnings estimate, the stock is trading at an even higher discount of 13.4% to the industry.Bidness Etc believes that Halliburton will exceed estimates owing to two major reasons: 1) the company's strong performance from the last quarter has continued into the second quarter 2) An overall increase in E&P activity, which has benefitted oil services companies.Disclosure: No positions."

        Halliburton is benefiting from positive cues in the end market such as energy reforms in Mexico.
        Halliburton's focus on technology should help it gain more customers.
        Halliburton's attractive valuation and recent project wins make the stock an enticing pick.","Oilfield services company Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) is on a tearing run this year. Its shares have comprehensively outperformed the market, gaining more than 35% so far in 2014. Halliburton is seeing tremendous growth in the business, and reported record revenue in the recently reported second quarter. The company is benefiting from productivity gains in North America and the Eastern Hemisphere. Looking ahead, the company's performance can improve further, driven by the positive moves that it is making. Let's see why.Fleet upgrades and improving prospectsHalliburton is upgrading its fleet to Q10s to drive home the competitive advantage of its Frac of the Future plan. The incremental fleets will arrive in the fourth quarter and throughout 2015. Halliburton recognizes the fact that now is the appropriate time to accelerate its Q10 build schedule, and also ramp its logistics capability. With these moves, the company should be able to serve a larger number of customers.In fact, Halliburton is already gaining solid traction. The company's Eastern Hemisphere operations are expanding at a steady rate, in line with its own expectations. This steady rate of expansion illustrates that the company is well-positioned and scoped correctly to deliver industry-leading revenue growth and steadily increasing margins.There are encouraging prospects from energy reforms in Mexico. As a result, Halliburton believes that service activity will gain traction as the market becomes more certain regarding the direction of reform. In Brazil, one of Halliburton's customers decided to re-tender the deepwater drilling contract, which is expected to help the company in right-sizing its footprint there.Moreover, Halliburton's strong business in North America will allow it to benefit from an expansion of the oil and gas industry in the U.S. Management is deeply focused on steady execution, generating better financial performance, and providing industry-leading returns to shareholders.Smart strategies and innovationHalliburton's sharp focus on the deepwater, mature fields, and unconventionals have helped it deliver solid revenue. The company is seeing growth in production enhancement, baroid, cementing, wireline, production chemicals, and artificial lift product lines. The strategy of Halliburton is to deliver the lowest cost per barrel of oil equivalent through surface efficiency, custom chemistry, and subsurface insight. As a result of these characteristics, its services have gained traction.Also, the company has seen record sales of its drill well plugs for plug-and-perf operations, in addition to record installations of its RapidSuite sliding sleeve technology.Halliburton's subsurface segment is getting better with its CYPHER platform, which optimizes where to drill, how to drill, where to frac, and how to frac to make better wells. CYPHER applications are being adopted by customers at a solid rate, with more than 50 projects spread across more than a dozen basins globally. Also, the recent release of CYPHER 2.0, which modifies earth-modeling capability, raises the simulation accuracy and enables for real-time adjustments during frac treatments.Halliburton's Custom Chemistry solutions are helping deliver better wells. The AccessFrac diversion technology, clean breaking PermStim, and RockPerm formation analysis of Halliburton have all demonstrated better production and proved efficient for its clients.Landing more projectsNo doubt, Halliburton's innovation appears to be on the right track. As a result, the company is seeing solid progress in large IPM (Integrated Project Management) and asset management projects in the mature field space. Recently, Halliburton has either been rewarded or has started mobilizing on large integrated projects in India, Kuwait, UAE, and Indonesia.For instance, its 93 well integrated project with Cairn India is the first IPM project in the country that employs tier 1 land rigs. These projects provide a robust platform for growth, coupled with a pipeline of over 30 billion in project management opportunities that the company is currently evaluating.Halliburton has also started work on the multi-decade Humapa incentivized asset management project in Mexico. It expects to dig new wells in this asset during the second half of 2014, completing two rigs by the end of the year. Further, in Mexico, Halliburton has dug the first well in the Mesozoic project in late June, and expects its second well to be dug in late July. The Mesozoic project represents a $1 billion opportunity over the next few years.Terrific valuationClearly, Halliburton has got solid prospects. But, what makes the stock even more impressive is the fact that it trades at an enticing valuation. Halliburton has a trailing P/E of 23.50, while its forward P/E stands at 13.77. Moreover, its PEG ratio of 0.86, better than the industry's average of 1.09, indicates that Halliburton is undervalued. Then again, Halliburton is expected to grow its earnings at a CAGR of 20.80% for the next 5 years, above the industry's average of 18.35%.It won't be surprising if Halliburton continues to outperform going forward and sustain its terrific run as the company has solid prospects, and it is still valued attractively.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2335145,24580,2014-07-23T17:49:46-04:00,"The world’s second largest provider of oilfield services showcased a 10% revenue increase, reporting $8.1 billion in total revenue.Operating income increased 31% from Q1 as completion volumes for each well increased by more than a third, (35%) year over year.Halliburton takes on issues in the Middle East, Russia and in Regions of South America.","Earlier this week Halliburton Co. (NYSE:HAL) reported Q2 EPS of $0.91, which is precisely what the analysts had estimated for the oilfield giant. The quarter's revenue trumped the $7.88 billion consensus estimate as Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) posted an impressive $8.1 billion on the top line. The world's second largest provider of oilfield services showcased a 11% revenue increase, which exceeded expectations.Halliburton's business has been on a rampage of late, with activity and revenue shattering records. The company's strong showing has heralded the recovery of the industry following a two-year slide. And experts believe that Halliburton's growth would be on the up with a prognosticated CAGR of 12% in the next five years.North American hegemonyThe primary reason for the company's growth of course has been its business in North America, which possesses more than half (52%) of the global oilfield services' share, and looks set for a continuous upsurge in demand. Even though each of the Big Four of the North American oil realm - Halliburton, Schlumberger (NYSE: SLB) Weatherford (NYSE: WFT) and Baker Hughes (NYSE: BHI) - would be reaping the rewards of their presence in the region, it's Halliburton that is leading the pack. This is owing to the company integrating technologies and capabilities masterfully, executing its drills with precision and enhancing its efficiency by manifold in recent times. Halliburton's programs of efficiency are maneuvered by a culture focusing on ROIC, and all these factors should continue to come together and result in impressive growth in rig counts and revenue.Halliburton's revenue for the second quarter in North America was up 11% with the operating income rising by 31% as compared to the year's first quarter, which reflects the company outdoing the American land rig count increase of 4%. The service intensity levels have been expanding in the region, with completion volumes for each well increasing by more than a third (35%), as compared to the same quarter last year.Halliburton's hierarchy expects its North American activity to continue to grow, with margins expected to touch down on the 20% mark in the next quarter. These expectations are further bolstered by the company enhancing its logistics prowess and augmenting the hydraulic fracturing fleet.Halliburton's North American hegemony is also rubber stamped when one juxtaposes its margins with the other big names. SLB stands at 18.2% as far as margins in North America are concerned, while BHI is at 12%.Global RiseHalliburton's growth in the Eastern Hemisphere has been pretty impressive as well. Compared to the previous quarter, there has been an increase in regional revenue of 9% with operating income jumping up 26%. Experts predict the year's revenue growth in the Eastern Hemisphere for Halliburton to be in the lower double digits with the average calendar year margins moving toward the 20% mark.As far as the Middle East/Asia region is concerned, the regional revenue has jumped up 11% with the operating income increasing 25%. As expected it was Saudi Arabia that was the vanguard of the growth, and the experts expect the region to have the highest rate of growth this calendar year. This is despite the ongoing crisis in Iraq.The Europe/Africa/CIS region saw increases of 6% and 27% in sequential revenue and operating income respectively. Most of the growth owes itself to the Russian recovery in the North Sea coupled with the sub-Saharan gains.Contrasting Fortunes in Latin AmericaWhile revenue rose 4% in Latin America, the operating income took a 39% nosedive. Even though the prospects of Mexican Energy Reform were touted as being encouraging, the rig count almost touched an all-time low during the second quarter. This is primarily owing to the delay in the receipt for the blanket order for the company's consultation and project management work, and the high expenditure in Mexican integrated projects. However, experts are of the opinion that these issues would be turned around before the end of the year, eventually mirroring last year's numbers for Latin America. This opinion is further bolstered by the expected approval of the Mexican projects' billing and the resolution of the stalled Brazilian drilling contract. The general consensus is Halliburton's Latin American worries are temporary and that the company would post solid numbers in coming years.Russia, Recovery and ResurgenceHalliburton has echoed Baker Hughes sentiments by reiterating that sanctions against Russia have not had any negative impact on the company's revenue. Even so, there's a chance that the projects that would be tendered this year might be impacted by the Russian sanctions. If the tensions surge and in case more sanctions are enforced, the business of the company would obviously be affected.Russian sanctions definitely haven't impacted the resurgence of Halliburton and other oil companies, with a surge in fracking demand being witnessed after a decline of a couple of years. The prices look set to increase by 2% this year with a 4% hike expected next year.Halliburton's decision on adding fracking crew and equipment on board for the North American expedition has led the recovery and resurgence of the oil industry in the region. That the demand has seen a massive increase is testament to investor confidence in Halliburton, which has led the oil resurgence in the region. Halliburton has also enhanced the share buyback authorization to $6.0 billion, from $4.8 billion. This is proof enough that the company is optimistic about its ability to generate cash flow in the near future.Enhanced IntegrationWith virtually everyone talking about Halliburton's integration in the oilfield services industry, it is important to mention the contrasting relationship between oil companies and services providers compared to years gone by. In the past oil companies asked services providers to decrease prices to enhance their bottom line.Things have changed now, with oil companies being cost-focused and requiring an improvement in their returns as far as the cost per barrel is concerned. This in turn propels the oil companies into reducing the suppliers and having them integrate their services to enhance efficiency and returns. This is one service provider-oil company symbiosis that has worked wonders for Halliburton's revenue and dividends of late.Investor InterestHalliburton's global strategy is on the right track and should see the company witness sustainable growth in deepwater, mature field and unconventional market, with North America being its most opulent zone. The strong financial showing has helped the company augment its shareholder distribution without negatively impacting its liquidity, which would bolster future growth.Halliburton's board has sanctioned $4.8 billion worth of stock repurchase authorization to the new buyback capacity of $6 billion, reflecting the company's buoyancy and commitment to the distribution of its shareholders. It goes without saying that Hallibuton's numbers are only headed in one direction in the near future.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2261263,20411,2014-06-10T10:48:21-04:00,HAL is growing modestly.The company has decent prospects.But the stock may have downside pressure.,"Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) is scheduled to release earnings in a couple days, but prior to that release, we found it important to review the fundamental and trading-related factors important to the stock price and investors accordingly.Looking at the latest result, modest growth was realized. Revenue grew by about 5.4% Y/Y, ""mainly due to increased activity in the Eastern Hemisphere and higher production enhancement activity in the United States land market, partially offset by lower activity levels in Latin America"" (p. 18). At the same time, net income of $622 million was up significantly from last year's loss of $18 million, but there is a reason for that.This huge increase is primarily attributable to the company's 1,090% increase in operating revenue during that time period. We see that this increase is a result of a $1 billion loss contingency related to the Macondo Well incident - popularly known as the BP oil spill - which was recorded in the first quarter of 2013. Looking past this loss contingency, operating income would have been $902 million for Q1 2013. This would have implied operating income growth of about 7.5% for the past year, which shows that Halliburton has achieved growth in operating income beyond what resulted from the recording of its $1 billion loss contingency.Lower oil and natural gas prices typically lead to lower cash flows for Halliburton as a result of decreased exploration and production budgets from its customers. Compared to the first quarter of last year, WTI crude oil's price is up $5 per barrel, to $99 per barrel, while Brent crude is down $4, to $108 per barrel. This implies mixed prospects, as WTI's price increase is nearly offset by Brent's price decrease. In contrast, the price of Henry Hub natural gas has experienced a significant increase of 49%, taking its price to $5.20 per MMBtu. This increase was driven by a harsh winter, and as such, the price of natural gas is expected to fall to $4.40 MMBtu as the weather normalizes in the coming months. On net, we should expect a similar level of revenue to be generated through services related to oil and a significant increase in services related to natural gas, assuming Halliburton's assumption about consumer behavior and natural gas prices holds true.Halliburton lists some major pending cash flows, such as delays in receivables from its primary customer in Venezuela and a dispute over a tax sharing agreement with engineering company KBR (NYSE:KBR). Halliburton states that its Venezuela-based customer has not been an issue in the past with respect to defaulting on its payments, but has yet to settle the $577 million owed to Halliburton. Additionally, in October of 2013, Halliburton was awarded $105 million plus interest by an arbitrator in a dispute with KBR. This decision is being contested by KBR; however, the arbitrator issued a report that reaffirmed the original decision. In each case, it seems somewhat likely that Halliburton will receive the payment, but the timing of such payments remains uncertain.Halliburton's overall, long-term strategy is to grow its operations outside of North America, as evidenced by approximately 47% of consolidated revenue coming from outside of this region during the first quarters of 2013 and 2014. This coincides well with the outlook for energy demand, which is expected to increase in the long run due to economic growth in developing countries. Halliburton will be investing capital in equipment for international operations, with an overall expected capital spending of $3 billion for 2014, an amount equal to that of its 2013 estimated capital spending. It is reasonable to expect operating costs to rise as Halliburton further pursues its international expansion; however, once that expansion is complete, Halliburton should be poised to generate greater profits. We will see how this plays out when the next EPS release comes later this month.Technical Analysis for Halliburton by Thomas H. Kee Jr.According to our real-time trading report for HAL, the stock is close to longer-term resistance, but it has not tested longer-term resistance yet. Our report does not offer sell signals, because resistance was not tested yet, but resistance is within striking distance and sell signals could come at any time. By rule, we should also expect these channels to hold, so if resistance holds after it is tested, HAL may also be a decent short from resistance back to support as that is offered in our report, but there will be no short signals until resistance is tested.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: By Quentin Whyte for Stock Traders Daily and neither receives compensation from the publicly traded companies mentioned herein for writing this article."
2161533,27361,2014-04-24T12:50:26-04:00,North American revenue driving stock price appreciation.How Halliburton looks regarding valuation.What is next for the stock.,"Over the past three months Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) has been on a very extensive run. Since the recent low in early February, the price has increased ~34.83%. So, this poses the question, at this point in the market is Halliburton a buy?Over the next couple of years natural gas prices within North America are expected to increase. The increase in price is in turn expected to increase E&P onshore capex spending. As onshore capex spending within North America is expected to increase in 2014 and through 2015, Halliburton is a company that is expected to outperform.North American Demand and Well CountDriven by the potential for an increase in natural gas prices and energy demand, the amount of oil and gas wells are expected to increase significantly over next couple of years. Recently, RBC Capital stated that it predicts the 2014 horizontal well counts within the United States to increase to 20,061.This is a significant increase over 2013's well count. Total well count during 2013 in the United States was estimated at ~18,580. Looking forward, 2015 looks to be a stronger year for well counts. Within the United States, well counts are expected to reach 21,551.If these estimates come to fruition, well counts within the United States will increase by ~15.99% over 2013 numbers. Well counts within the Permian, Eagle Ford, Bakken and Marcellus are expected be the dominant plays, as analysts expect an increase of ~25.57% over 2013's numbers.As expectations are that well counts within in the United States are on a significant upward trend, this bodes well for oil and gas service companies that create a bulk of their revenue within the U.S.As the chart below indicates, Halliburton receives the bulk of their revenue from sources within North America.Sourced from (Stockresearching)Also driving Halliburton's growth is the global outlook for oil and gas service companies.Global GrowthThe expected increase in global onshore spending is not limited to the U.S. or North America. In 2014, E&P spending is expected to increase by 14% in the Middle East, 13% in Latin and South America and 11% in Russia. So, looking forward, Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) has a strong reason to be very optimistic.Source: (Barclay's)Why Does Halliburton have more upside?In an article published on the Wall Street Journal, author Barbara Kollmeyer cited four reasons why to remain bullish on oil service companies:So, as the macro picture for horizontal drilling looks positive globally, which companies will be able to capitalize from this increased demand?It is expected that some of the best companies positioned to capitalize on this trend are major integrated service companies, such as Halliburton, Baker Hughes (BHI) and Schlumberger NV, as well as smaller companies that have a specific niche.ValuationsAfter a very strong run since the beginning of the year, where, on a valuation basis, does Halliburton stand right now? In the section below, I will use the EV/EBITDA to estimate where Halliburton is regarding its valuation.EV/EBITDA = Enterprise Value / Earnings before interest, Taxes, Depreciation and AmortizationIn the next section, I will use the EBITDA to calculate the EV/EBITDA. The EV/EBITDA ratio is one of the most commonly used valuation metrics, as EBITDA is commonly used as a proxy for cash flow available to the firm.Enterprise Value or EV = Market Capitalization + Total Debt - Cash and Cash EquivalentsAs the oil and gas service stocks trade in the 8.63x trading range, an EV/EBITDA ratio of 14.14 states at current levels, the stock is trading over fair value.What's NextSo, after an excellent run, I believe we will be entering a period of consolidation for the stock. As the EV/EBITDA ratio has revealed, the valuation may have ""outpaced itself,"" or is at least fully valued, so a period of consolidation is not out of the question.StrategyAt this point in the market, I would not be surprised if there was a 5-10% correction over the next few months. If such a correction were to occur, this could present an excellent opportunity to add positions in a company with excellent growth prospects. Currently, I believe there is further upside to equity markets, as major world economies are either recovering or on the verge of recovering. As interest rates continue to remain near zero, this should favor equities.ConclusionAs Halliburton's stock price has had a solid increase thus far in 2014, I believe I am going against many analysts and think we will be entering a period of consolidation. Having stated that, I also think any pullback in the market would provide an excellent opportunity to add a position or add to your position.Driven by the increase in global onshore spending, Halliburton has had an extensive price run thus far in 2014. As global onshore capex spending is expected to continue for the foreseeable future, I believe Halliburton is a strong long-term candidate for your portfolio. Currently, I own the stock and have no intentions of selling it.Disclosure: I am long HAL, SLB. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

2200333,56732,2014-05-07T18:00:21-04:00,"The Completion and Production segment is largely responsible for the growth realized by the company, with the segment’s revenues edging up by approximately 7.8% YoY.In the U.S. region Halliburton has been facing challenges lately related to weather conditions, increasing competition, high logistics costs, and oversupply of hydraulic fracturing equipment.The U.S. revenues are expected to remain flattish for FY2014 owing to limited activity in GoM and Brazil.","Halliburton Co. (NYSE:HAL) is one of the leading global organizations that provide products and services to the energy sector. The company just released its earnings for the first quarter of FY2014 which led to a 3.3% rise in the stock price of the company. The stock price has risen by 24% since the start of the year.Revenue DistributionThe revenues of the company are distributed among two reportable segments, namely Completion and Production and Drilling and Evaluation, wherein 60% of the revenues are attributable to the former segment. Geographically, North America is the major region for the company since more than half the revenues are attributable to said region. The remaining half of the revenues is distributed amongst the Middle East, Asia, Europe, Africa, and Latin America. Contribution of each region is indicated in the pie chart below according to the numbers reported in the 2013 annual report.Source: Annual Report, 2013Earnings and EstimatesAs per the earnings release for the first quarter of FY2014, the company has outperformed the analysts' estimates for its top and bottom lines. Total revenues of the company were $7.3 billion compared to Thomson Reuters' consensus of $7.24 billion. For the three months ended, the top line of the company grew approximately 5.40% compared to the same period last year.Of the $7.3 billion reported revenues the net profit of the company was reported to be $622 million and per share earnings stood at $0.73beating analysts' estimates by 2 cents. Compared to the performance in the first quarter of fiscal year 2013 the company's EPS grew by approximately 9%. Last year, the bottom line was heavily impacted due to a litigation charge of $1 billion (pre-tax) in reference to the Deepwater Horizon incidence that occurred back in 2010 where Halliburton was one of the parties involved. Eleven people died as a consequence of the explosion in the GoM region in 2010 which caused the worst oil spill in history. This is the major reason for the reduced activity in the Gulf of Mexico.Growth Or Lack ThereofAnalyzing the revenues by segment, it becomes apparent that the completion and production segment is largely responsible for the inherent growth realized by the company. The segment's revenue has increased by about 7.8% YoY. Although drilling and evaluation showed positive results as well, the revenue increase of 1.90% in this segment was not as significant. Again, the reduced performance of the segment is due to reduced drilling operations in Brazil and Mexico among other reasons. Geographically, the European, Middle Eastern, and African regions have shown the highest growth. Revenues from these regions increased 11% whereas the operating income across these locations grew 16%. Saudi Arabia, Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia also showed strong performance.With regards to the U.S. region, the company has been facing challenges lately related to weather conditions, increasing competition, high logistics costs, and oversupply of hydraulic fracturing equipment. The rise in competition and oversupply has led to a downward pressure on prices, hurting the aggregate U.S. revenues. But since Halliburton is a long standing and large organization it has certain cost advantages compared to smaller competitors in the market. The company is taking immediate steps to haul in costs to bolster its margin performance. However, owing to limited activity in the Gulf of Mexico and Brazil, revenue from the region is expected to remain flattish for FY2014.Financial StandingFurther scrutiny of the earnings report indicates that the company's long term debt remained constant compared to the same quarter last year, whereas the company's cash flow from operations position improved by 173% YoY. The company maintains a better current and quick ratio compared to its peers hovering around 2.73 and 2.04 respectively, whereas the industry average for said ratios is around 1.65 and 0.68 respectively. The company also maintains higher than industry average operating and net profit margins.Concluding RemarksIn the second quarter of FY2014, Halliburton hopes its EPS increases at the rate of 25% owing to strong profit growth expected from the company's offshore operations and rebound expected in the North American operations. Halliburton's forecast meets with the general analyst consensus for the quarter. Furthermore, Halliburton distributes profits among shareholders through cash dividend payments and share repurchases. The company has repurchased shares worth $500 million in the first quarter of the year, reducing the share count by about nine million common shares. The company hopes to bring down the share count to 850 million by the end of the second quarter of 2014.The cash payments have risen at a CAGR of 15.2% over the past three years. The fact that the company's top and bottom lines are anticipated to rise in the foreseeable future and the fact that it rewards its shareholders well means Halliburton looks like a sound investment to me.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2181403,44001,2014-05-01T09:25:19-04:00,"The company is extremely inexpensive, based on 2015 earnings estimates.The company has excellent earnings growth estimates.The dividend is too small to just park money into if you're looking for some place to hide out versus the market turbulence.","Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) is an oilfield services company which provides services and products to the energy industry related to the exploration, development, and production of oil and natural gas. On April 21, 2014, the company reported first-quarter earnings of $0.73 per share, which beat the consensus analysts' estimates by $0.01. During the past year, the company's stock price is up 55.46% excluding dividends (up 56.56% including dividends) and is beating the S&P 500 (NYSEARCA:SPY), which has gained 19.07% in the same time frame. I've already purchased a batch of the stock for my growth portfolio, and am down 1.3% on the batch. With all this in mind, I'd like to take a moment to evaluate the stock on a fundamental, financial, and technical basis to see if right now is a good time to purchase more of the stock for my portfolio.FundamentalsThe company currently trades at a trailing 12-month P/E ratio of 20.21, which is fairly priced, but I mainly like to purchase a stock based on where the company is going in the future, as opposed to what it has done in the past. On that note, the 1-year forward-looking P/E ratio of 12.44 is currently inexpensively priced for the future in terms of the right here, right now. Next year's estimated earnings are $5.07 per share, and I'd consider the stock inexpensive until about $76. The 1-year PEG ratio (0.72), which measures the ratio of the price you're currently paying for the trailing 12-month earnings on the stock while dividing it by the earnings growth of the company for a specified amount of time (I like looking at a 1-year horizon), tells me that the company is inexpensively priced based on a 1-year EPS growth rate of 27.88%. The company has great near-term future earnings growth potential, with a projected EPS growth rate of 27.88%. In addition, the company has great long-term future earnings growth potential, with a projected EPS growth rate of 22.89%.FinancialsOn a financial basis, the things I look for are the dividend payouts, return on assets, equity, and investment. The company pays a dividend of 0.95% with a payout ratio of 19% of trailing 12-month earnings, while sporting return on assets, equity, and investment values of 9.7%, 20%, and 11.6%, respectively, which are all respectable values. Because I believe the market may get a bit choppy here and would like a safety play, I don't believe the 0.95% yield of this company is good enough for me to take shelter in for the time being.TechnicalsLooking first at the relative strength index chart [RSI] at the top, I see the stock in overbought territory, with a current value of 72.34. I will look at the moving average convergence-divergence [MACD] chart next. I see that the black line is above the red line, with the divergence bars flattening in height, indicating the bullish momentum is getting tired. As for the stock price itself ($63.07), I'm looking at $68.14 to act as resistance and $59.07 to act as support for a risk/reward ratio which plays out to be -6.34% to 8.04%.Recent NewsConclusionThe resurgence of the domestic oil and gas discoveries in the U.S. is an investing theme which should continue to make major dollars for investors. Fundamentally, the company is indeed inexpensively priced, based on future earnings estimates and based on next year's earnings growth potential. Financially, the dividend is safe and secure, albeit miniscule. On a technical basis, I believe the stock is topping out here and may be due for a pullback. Due to the toppy technicals, low dividend yield, and the ""Sell in May"" attitude among investors, I will not be pulling the trigger here right now. But I do believe the time to purchase some more shares is approaching, quite possibly in the middle or end of May.Disclaimer: This article is meant to serve as a journal for myself as to the rationale of why I bought/sold this stock when I look back on it in the future.

2175843,64723,2014-04-30T03:31:55-04:00,"Halliburton is trading at a valuation nearly in-line with its peers, even though it may have to pay tens of billions of dollars of fines for the Gulf oil spill.A presidential commission indicated that Halliburton could well have been guilty of gross negligence that led to the Gulf oil spill.If a judge agrees that the company was guilty of gross negligence, he could easily rule that the company must pay tens of billions in punitive damages.The judge has already shown that he is very eager to ensure that victims of the Gulf oil spill get a great deal of compensation.","Investors seem to believe that Halliburton's (NYSE:HAL) liability for the 2011 Gulf oil spill will be limited to $1 billion or $2 billion at most, as the stock is trading at a multiple that is only slightly below the level of its peers. Doubtlessly, the company has contributed to this optimism by taking a reserve of only about $1.3 billion to cover its liability for the oil spill.But Halliburton itself has admitted that it cannot be sure what its ultimate liability for the tragedy will be, and there are indications that its final bill could be much, much higher. There are several reasons why investors should be more worried about Halliburton's liability for the Gulf oil spill and should avoid the stock until the company's legal situation becomes clearer. Risk tolerant investors may want to consider shorting the name.Halliburton could be held liable for punitive damages stemming from lawsuits filed against it over the oil spill. Total punitive damages against the remaining defendants in the case could be at least equal to the amount of compensatory damages awarded. In the 2008 Exxon Valdez case, the Supreme Court ruled that punitive damages could not exceed compensatory damages, according to Reuters. The news service, however, did not indicate that the court's decision limited punitive damages in any other manner.Moreover, a legal expert with whom I spoke said that the total amount of punitive damages could potentially be several times the compensatory damages. The amount of punitive damages for each defendant is determined based on the extent of their misconduct, said the source, who did not want to be identified because he has not been following the trial.Although it's difficult to find sources that describe the amount of compensatory damages that the defendants are seeking in the case, BP has said that Louisiana and Alabama are seeking a total of at least $34 billion in damages, Bloomberg reported in February 2013. In addition to those two states, the federal government and private parties, including financial institutions, casinos, other businesses and residents, are also plaintiffs in the case, according to Bloomberg.Hypothetically and conservatively speaking, if $60 billion in total compensatory damages are awarded, at least $60 billion in punitive damages could also be assessed. If Halliburton is found liable for just one-third of those punitive damages, the company would be on the hook for $20 billion. As of March 31, the company had just $2.12 billion in cash and equivalents, it reported last week.Moreover, there are some indications that Halliburton could indeed be hit with punitive damages. A defendant can be assessed punitive damages if it is found to have been guilty of gross negligence. According to Law.com, gross negligence is ""carelessness which is in reckless disregard for the safety or lives of others, and is so great it appears to be a conscious violation of other people's rights to safety.""A presidential commission that investigated the oil spill found that Halliburton, BP, and Transocean had ""ignored critical warning signs and failed to take precautions that…might have averted the environmental disaster,"" The Washington Post reported. More specifically, the commission stated that the cement Halliburton had used to seal the well was shown to be unstable by tests the company performed before the disaster.Although I'm not a lawyer, if a company uses cement it knows to be unstable, and the cement directly contributes to a huge disaster, it seems to me that the company did exhibit carelessness which involved reckless disregard for the safety or lives of others and violated people's rights to safety.Additionally, Halliburton pleaded guilty to destroying important evidence last year. The plea could indicate that the company's case in the civil trial is weak, Reuters quoted a Tulane University law professor as saying last year.And Carl Barbier, the judge who will decide the key civil case in which Halliburton is a defendant, has been very eager to ensure that victims of the Gulf oil spill get a great deal of compensation. Barbier decided that BP must pay hundreds of millions of dollars in compensation to businesses that do not have proof that their losses were directly caused by the Gulf oil spill. Also ominously for Halliburton, a three judge panel of the Fifth Federal Circuit Court of Appeals earlier this year upheld Barbier's decision. The Fifth Circuit would likely hear any appeal by Halliburton of Judge Barbier's assessment of punitive damages against it.In addition, investors (and analysts) should wonder why, despite trying for years, Halliburton has been unable to settle the civil lawsuits against it.Another ominous sign for Halliburton is the wave of insider selling that has hit the stock this year. In the six months ended April 25, insiders have sold over 400,000 shares, equivalent to nearly 15% of their total holdings, according to Yahoo Finance.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

All these shares were sold pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan.SEC Rule 10b5-1 is a regulation enacted by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 2000. The SEC states that Rule 10b5-1 was enacted in order to resolve an unsettled issue over the definition of insider trading, which is prohibited by SEC Rule 10b-5. After Rule 10b5-1 was enacted, the SEC staff publicly took the position that canceling a planned trade made under the safe harbor does not constitute insider trading, even if the person was aware of the inside information when canceling the trade. This staff interpretation raises the possibility that executives can exploit this safe harbor by entering into 10b5-1 trading plans before they have inside information while retaining the option to later cancel those plans based on inside information.For example, a CEO of a company could call a broker on January 1 and enter into a plan to sell a particular quantity of shares of his company's stock on March 1, find out terrible news about his company on February 1 that will not become public until April 1, and then go forward with the March 1 sale anyway, saving himself from losing money when the bad news becomes public. Under the terms of Rule 10b5-1(b) this is insider trading because the CEO ""was aware"" of the inside information when he made the trade. But he can assert an affirmative defense under Rule 10b5-1(c), because he planned the trade before he learned the inside information.In general, it is a safer way for an insider to sell shares pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan than without it.Insider selling by calendar monthHere is a table of Halliburton's insider activity by calendar month.There have been 1,817,208 shares sold, and there have been zero shares purchased by insiders since January 2013.

Three of these eight insiders decreased their holdings by more than 10%. Halliburton has an insider ownership of 0.27%.Before going short Halliburton, I would like to get a bearish confirmation from the Point & Figure chart.

1991631,56922,2014-02-04T11:13:47-05:00,,"The world we live in is highly energy dependent and because of this dependency the demand for energy doesn't necessarily depend on its price, but rather on its market supply. However, this does not hold true for energy sources like coal, which is being replaced by natural gas (a clean and abundant resource) due to the fact that many countries were not overly concerned about the environment until a decade ago.Even though the price of natural gas is increasing, so is its demand. Qatar has been playing an increasingly important role in the export of LNG to many countries in Asia and Europe, thereby influencing its price. It is expected that demand will increase in the future as countries like China, India, Turkey and the U.S. continue to switch from coal to natural gas. This has made natural gas a rapidly growing industry that is capturing the market of coal and other energy resources due to its cost efficiency.IntroductionHalliburton Company (NYSE:HAL), a U.S. energy services giant, is operational in three divisions - Drilling & Exploration, Completion & Production, and Support. The company is conducting its business in 80 countries worldwide, encompassing the four primary regions of North America, Latin America, Europe/Africa/CIS, and Middle East/Asia. In 2011, the company acquired Multi-Chem Group LLC and in 2012 its Landmark Software and Services acquired Petris Technology Inc. Halliburton was able to land in the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices in 2013 for the 4th consecutive year and also received 14 awards on 7 different platforms during the year.FundamentalsHalliburton has been showing impressive performance and promising results in the past. The company earned a net income of $1.8 billion, $2.8 billion and $2.6 billion respectively in the last three years and closed the third quarter of 2013 with $706 million in net income. This solid financial performance is one of the reasons why Halliburton's shares are in demand and have been experiencing a persistent increase in valuations. The company's share price has increased by 42% (YTD), indicating that it has outperformed the market as the industry average growth was around only 22%.HAL data by YChartsHalliburton has a diversified presence in both natural gas and oil. This gives it the strength to recover losses in either segment due to the high demand in both markets. Our main focus will be on natural gas due to its increasing demand and stable price.Halliburton has been performing exceptionally and paid out dividends with an increment of 39% in the first quarter of 2013. Its yield is lower than the industry average, but it has announced a 20% increase in quarterly dividends, which increased the total payout to $0.15/share for the fourth quarter of 2013. The aim behind this increment is to give back 35% of its operating cash flow to the shareholders. Dave Lesar, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Halliburton said:The company's quick and current ratios are higher than the industry average, showing that it has outperformed the market and has stayed on green pastures in terms of its liquidity. Though the cash changes during the year (for nine months ending 30 September 2013) were 26.6% less than that of 2012, this was due to repurchase of stocks worth $4.4 billion.CYPHER(SM) Seismic-to-Simulation ServiceThe company announced its CYPHER(SM) Seismic-to-Simulation service back in September 2013, which is aimed at increasing the production efficiency of wells through a combination of geoscience and reservoir understanding. The high costs associated with drilling can damage the financials of a company if the well is not situated on a location that gives the desired production. CYPHER(SM) allows drillers to gain a better understanding of the basin and reservoir and delivers all the insights required for optimum well paths and effective drilling. This increases the value of the reservoir and keeps the drilling costs to a minimum. CYPHER(SM) can also be utilized during any stage of a field's lifecycle, making it attractive to both new and existing drilling projects.This is a breakthrough technology that will allow operators to better identify and develop unconventional reserves, specially shale and other tight reservoirs. The demarcation of the right drilling spot and the avoidance of expensive wells can greatly reduce costs and increase production efficiencies. This will impact the company's financial statements through increased operating margins and revenues generated from the sale of this service to other drilling companies, which will in turn affect the dividends and cause an increase in the share price.CYPHER(SM) is another addition to the Halliburton's differentiated technology and it continues to provide technological services to other oil producers as well. James Painter, Cobalt's Executive Vice President, Execution and Appraisal, stated:This statement was made regarding the services provided by Halliburton to Cobalt International Energy for two deepwater pre-salt exploration wells in West Africa.Other DevelopmentsArab-U.S. ties have deteriorated somewhat over the last few months. It all started with President Obama's slow reaction over the Syrian chemical weapons crisis, prompting some Arab states to start reviewing their relations with the U.S. The U.S., in the past, has been greatly dependent on the Arab states for its energy requirements and with the economy slowly recovering it cannot afford any energy crisis. However, the recent discovery of vast amounts of natural gas in the United States has slightly changed the American attitude towards Middle Eastern politics. The U.S. has estimated potential reserves of 2,170 trillion cubic feet of natural gas which is sufficient to meet the annual demand of 24 trillion cubic feet for 95 years. Such vast reserves ease U.S. energy's dependency on the Arab world.At present the main focus of big oil and gas producers is on the Golden Triangle - Brazil, West Africa and Gulf of Mexico. Halliburton's market share in off-shore drilling is around 50% which means that deep water drilling will continue to play an important role in the company's future growth, as it has been doing in the past years. The company's revenue growth from deep water drilling was 31% last year, whereas the industry had only a 13% growth. Furthermore, Halliburton expects its revenues to grow by 25% in the next three years and the estimated industry growth is 11%. This shows that the company is outperforming the industry and has better future prospects.Due to a growth in production, the U.S. has started entering international markets as well. The demand for natural gas is increasing in Mexico and the country does not have enough resources to satisfy it. This gap will be filled by U.S. gas export which is expected to double by 2016. The high demand will not only create market for U.S. firms, it will also increase the price of natural gas, leading to higher revenues and providing an opportunity for Halliburton to flex its muscles on yet another platform.ValuationThe company's Enterprise Value is $47.3 billion and it has outstanding shares totaling around 848 million. From these valuations an EV per share of $55.78 can be calculated. At present Halliburton's shares are priced at around $48/share indicating a huge gap between the estimated and current share price. This shows that there is potential for growth in the share as it is currently undervalued.ConclusionEven though there has been a sudden decrease in the oil and gas index at the start of 2014 (expected to have been caused by large trading of put options for 2015 and 2016 at $85 which has affected the U.S. market), the increasing demand of natural gas and the continuing demand for oil points to a very promising future for the oil and gas industry. Many companies are choosing to go green by switching to natural gas and other clean energy sources due to the backing out of the U.S. government on coal powered projects. This has created a sliding effect from coal towards gas and eroded the revenues of coal miners. Our estimates also agree with the growth expected for the players in the industry, especially Halliburton which has been outperforming the industry in growth and liquidity and proving that it is one of the best buys that can give the investors great returns.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

The stock is currently trading at $56.90 so JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s target price suggests a handsome upside potential for the company's stock. You can see from the following chart that the company's stock price is up 39.70% since the previous year.Source: YChartsTherefore, I will analyze the factors that will drive the company's stock price in FY 2014 and onwards.The company is a supplier of services and products to the energy industry to support the exploration, development, and production of oil and natural gas. The company operates through two divisions: the completion and production segment and the drilling and evaluation segment. Therefore, let's begin the article by discussing the outlook of spending in the energy sector.The company generated 49% of its total revenue from the U.S. in FY 2013 and the remaining portion from rest for the world. Hence I will analyze the global energy sector's spending outlook along with projections for the North America energy sector's spending for the coming year.Energy Sector Spending OutlookThe Barclays Capital 2014 oil and gas exploration and production (E&P) spending survey projects growth in energy sector spending around the globe. The oil and gas companies around the globe expect E&P spending to rise by 6% worldwide as a result of 7% growth in North America and 6% growth outside of North America. The survey for the outlook is based on the spending intentions of more than 300 oil and gas companies for 2014. The following table shows the forecast of North American E&P capital spending for 2014.Source: OGRAfter recording 2 years of barely earnest growth North America is positioned to see a spurt of exploration and production spending in 2014 as US operator will attempt full scale development of unconventional resource plays. The increase in North American spending is expected to come from growth in service-intensive, multi-well horizontal drilling as well as production growth. Barclays stated that many US producers are inactive and holding years, and in some cases decades, worth of drilling inventory. As a result, the bank expects the explorers and producers to cater to the growing inventory of undrilled wells in the estate by allotting additional capital to the US land market.The highest spending growth is anticipated in the legacy Permian basin that according to the Baker Hughes represented 28% of US land drilling activity in December. Barclays's survey discovered that various big operators such as Apache Corp and Devon Energy Corp are likely to considerably increase Permian basin spending in 2014. This has led Barclays to forecast that the region could record net demand growth for horizontal rigs up to 50-70 units, an approximately 35% increase from 2013's levels.As a consequence of the development of new energy resources and a rise in complexity for development, the demand for service intensity will enhance further. Additionally, various companies are also switching to multi-well pads that will also trigger strong drilling activities and allow Halliburton company to capitalize on its operational scale and expertise.A significant portion of the company's completion and production segment delivers hydraulic fracturing services to clients developing shale natural gas and shale oil. Therefore, I will discuss the outlook of the U.S. hydraulic fracturing market in the following paragraphs. The company's completion and production segment drove around 60% of the company's total revenue in FY 2013.North America and Global Hydraulic Fracturing Market OutlookNorth America has a major market share in the global hydraulic fracturing market. Research and development initiatives by the U.S. government and encouraging regulatory conditions have helped the U.S. market to grow to this level.PacWest Consulting Partners forecasts improvements in conditions in the North American market for hydraulic fracturing services along with the rise in pricing in many regions by early 2015.The demand for fracturing services in the U.S. land market is anticipated to increase by 5% in 2014 and 3% in 2015. The rise is driven by momentous growth in the number of horizontal wells and fracturing stages that are forecasted to increase to more than 400,000 record stages in the year 2014 reflecting an increase from 375,000 in 2013.The major drivers behind the growth in the hydraulic fracturing market are the improvement in technology that has resulted in a rise in production rate enhancing recoverable reserves allowing energy strategy shifts to natural gas and energy retreat by domestic supply.As a result, the fracturing assemblers and component manufacturers reported a rise in new build orders but, the destinations for a majority of those new build orders are for places outside of North America. Therefore, I will also analyze the growth prospects for the company in regions other than North America.Overall, the global hydraulic fracturing market will grow from $40 billion in 2012 to $64 billion by 2017.Growth from the International MarketThe hydraulic fracturing of shale in search of oil and gas has barely started outside the U.S. but activity is expected to augment in 2014. A record 400 shale wells are likely to be drilled outside of U.S. borders in 2014. China and Russia will lead the majority of the activity according to energy consultants Wood Mackenzie. On the other hand, thousands of shale wells will be drilled in the U.S. in 2014. China has the biggest shale gas reserves valued to be the equivalent of 212 billion barrels of oil. In shale oil Russia leads the list with around 75 billion barrels according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Australia, Poland, and Algeria, also have big reserves.Moreover, the number of rigs used onshore in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region has grown by 10% over the past year with most of those rigs intended for shale according to the data compiled by oil services company Baker Hughes (BHI)The prospects of fracking activity outside the U.S. is reflected in the activities of major oil players such as Royal Dutch Shell (RDS/A) that joined hands with China National Petroleum Corp. in the current year, to explore in Sichuan, the province that has 40% of China's shale reserves. YPF (NYSE:YPF), the Argentine oil company, has teamed up with Chevron (NYSE:CVX) to bring out deposits in Argentina's vast Vaca Muerta formation. According to Edward Morse, head of commodities research at Citigroup (NYSE:C), there should be enormous growth in worldwide drilling, as there was in the U.S., in the next three to five years.Now let us take a brief look at the expectations for the company's bottom line, cash flows, and return to investors.Expectations for Bottom Line, Cash Flows, and ReturnsSource: Bloomberg BusinessweekThe chart above shows the forecasts of the year-over-year rise in the company's profits along with a similar pattern followed by the company's peers.During FY 2013 the company's net income declined by $1 billion due to the charges associated with the Macondo well blowout. The company is expecting low, double-digit growth in its international business with a 20% margin expansion in 2014. Accordingly, on a consolidated basis, the company has projected it would generate double-digit growth in its EPS for the full year of 2014.The company has a strong cash generating potential. Despite the negative impact on its income the company's operating cash flow rose by 22% to $4.4 billion by the end of FY 2013.The company repurchased about $4.4 billion of its stock in FY 2013 reflecting 10% of its outstanding shares in FY 2013. The company also plans to keep reducing its outstanding shares in FY 2014 and had around $1.7 billion of share purchase authorization available under the stock repurchase program by 31 December 2013.Furthermore, Halliburton Company increased its dividend twice in FY 2013 to 0.15/share and that seems totally safe and in line with the company's ability to generate considerable cash flows. The company plans to uphold a 25% payout ratio based on income for FY 2014. Currently, the company's payout ratio, based on income, is around 21%. The company is anticipating it will record double-digit growth in its income in FY 2014 so a dividend increase can be expected likewise.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: The article has been written by a Gemstone Equity Research research analyst.

1981411,57571,2014-01-30T14:07:29-05:00,,"In January 2014, Halliburton (HAL) successfully provided wireline services to Cobalt International Energy (CIE) for exploring the characteristics of two deepwater exploration wells in the pre-salt formation in offshore Angola. Oil and natural gas companies use wireline services to gather information on the petrophysical properties of a rock formation and determine hydrocarbon prospects. Halliburton used an advanced tool called the Reservoir Description Tool, or RDT, tools to collect the reservoir formation pressure and samples. Previously, Halliburton's RDT system successfully provided results on reservoir characteristics with fewer data points, 20 instead of 80 data points, and within 24 hours. Quick analysis helps save around one to two days of rig drilling time, resulting in cost savings. This tool helped one oil and natural gas company save around $25 million in operation costs in offshore Angola. The success of this service will further strengthen Halliburton's position in West Africa's oil services market.Between the two exploratory wells, Cobalt drilled one of the exploratory wells named Bicuar #1A located in the syn-rift reservoir at a depth of around 5,739 meters with a net pay zone of around 56 meters of oil and condensate. The syn-rift reservoir is located in Block 21 offshore Angola in which Cobalt has a 40% stake. Cobalt mainly focuses on the subsalt and pre-salt reservoirs in offshore West Africa with assets in Gabon and Angola and is taking a lead role to develop the pre-salt formation. Subsalt and pre-salt are geological formations that could contain hydrocarbon deposits. The association of Halliburton and Cobalt in drilling the pre-salt reserves in offshore Angola will increase exploration capabilities for both of the companies. Halliburton's RDT system was used in the exploration of the Bicuar #1A well and could be one of the reasons for the short drilling and completion time. Bicuar #1A well is Cobalt's fourth pre-salt discovery in offshore Angola. It drilled this Bicuar well in 59 days, 63 days ahead of schedule.The pre-salt region of Angola bears resemblance in structure to the pre-salt formation in Brazil, thus enticing oil and natural gas companies to explore the region. Certain estimates indicate the total pre-salt hydrocarbon reserve could be around 50 billion barrels of oil equivalent, or bboe. The pre-salt formation of West Africa could have a potential reserve between 10 to 15 billion barrels.Bringing oil expertise to Saudi ArabiaSaudi Arabia is one of the largest producers of oil with production of around 10 million barrels per day since the start of 2011. The country plans to increase production further by increasing the number of rigs from around 160 in 2013 to 210 by the end of 2014. This initiative to increase oil production is creating demand for oil service companies.The increase in oil drilling activity in Saudi Arabia allows Halliburton to expand its revenue from the region to offset the declining revenue in the North American drilling market. The revenue from the North American drilling market fell from around $4.16 billion during the first quarter of 2012 to $3.82 billion in the fourth quarter of 2013. During the same period, the revenue from the Middle East grew from $908 million to $1.4 billion. The growing drilling activity in Saudi Arabia could help Halliburton diversify its revenue base and grow it as well. In November 2009, Halliburton received the rights to drill the South Ghawar field for five years with an option to extend the drilling contract for another five years. If this contract in the Saudi Arabian oil and natural gas fields is extended for five years after 2014, it will provide further revenue growth for Halliburton in the coming quarters.Growing in the salts and the sandsHalliburton's exploration in the pre-salt formation in offshore Angola provides the company with expertise about the exploration techniques of the rock formation in the region. In addition, the company's operational expertise resulted in cost savings for oil companies. Halliburton's services are likely to gain momentum in the coming quarters as pre-salt exploration gains traction with multiple companies investing in the same.Halliburton's Saudi Arabia initiatives should help the company develop technology localized to the Saudi Arabian condition and develop a skilled personnel base to carry out drilling operations in the region. Further, increasing expenditure for oil exploration in Saudi Arabia will provide a tailwind for the company in the coming quarters.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2079873,54312,2014-03-11T04:09:57-04:00,"Increased investment from energy companies.Capitalizing on the demand for products, services and technology.Completely safe returns with strong, cash generating potential.","Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) is a top-rated company operating in the oilfield services industry that has gotten momentum from increased spending in the entire energy sector. Halliburton offers products and services to the energy industry related to the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas. The company looks very strong as the demand for energy is on the rise with the current economic growth, despite supply uncertainties in the Middle East and North Africa due to geopolitical tensions that serve as a risk to the industry.However, the development of new energy resources is predicted to advance in complexity, which will further enhance the demand for service intensity. As a result of strong development activities by energy companies, most service and product providers like Halliburton Company, National Oilwell Varco (NYSE:NOV) and Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) have been generating massive profits over the past two years and are predicted to keep that pace in the coming years.Now, let's take a look at Halliburton to see how it is operating worldwide. I looked at the company's strategy and growth prospects to see how it continues to strengthen its financial situation, while maintaining its ability to pay dividends and work on buybacks.Business strategyHalliburton is looking to maintain itself in a distinct and sustainable, competitive position in the oilfield services industry by providing innovative products and services that extract proven reserves to maximize recovery for customers. To do this, the company is working on creating a portfolio that meets the needs of its customers. Halliburton is investing in technology and products, which ensure better results for both the company and its customers. By doing this, it is further looking to reduce costs and create value. In order to produce top-notch services and products, Halliburton is seeking to preserve a dynamic workforce.Future growth prospectsIn North America, the continuous shift from natural gas is due to the sluggish prices that have forced companies to shift their focus on liquid-rich basins. This shift is generating strong demand for the services in which Halliburton serves to provide. Based on recent moderations in the outlook of liquids pricing this year, Halliburton is expecting U.S. spending to grow by a mid- to high-single digit. Many companies are also switching to multi-well pads, which is resulting in strong drilling activities that enable the company to reach its desired operational scale and expertise. Also, the U.S. land rig count will increase further with the continued move to horizontals in the Permian basin. However, challenges are still expected in the Latin America region, particularly in Mexico and Brazil, as both areas are going through a transitional phase.Halliburton has significant global exposure and the company has been generating massive growth from its international business. In 2013, both its revenue and operating income increased from international business. This was a result of strategic investments, innovative new technologies, increased pricing and cost cutting measures. Halliburton's completion tools, wireline technology, Multi-Chem service and perforating and testing product lines led to record revenues. In particular, the Multi-Chem service and the company's perforating and testing product lines set new landmarks of sales and operating income. Further, Boots & Coots activity in Algeria and software sales, not only in Russia, but all over Continental Europe, led the company to make massive sales.Halliburton has the ability to generate consistent growth from its international business with its continued improvement in the market, recent contract wins and new projects. The company is looking to capitalize on the demand from international unconventional oil and natural gas, deepwater projects and mature fields, which account for over 70 percent of the world's oil and gas production. The company is expecting drilling and completion spending to further increase by the mid- to upper-single digit percentages. The company is expecting much better growth and margin expansion in the hemisphere with the contracts in hand.Financial position and ability to sustain returnsRecently, Halliburton announced results from the entire year with a record revenue growth. Its consolidated revenue increased 3 percent to $29.4 billion. However, net income decreased by $1 billion due to the charges associated with the Macondo well blowout. In 2013, the company generated record revenue from its international regions. The company is expecting low, double-digit growth in its international business with 20 percent margin expansion in 2014. In North America, though, the company's revenue declined by 1 percent and its operating income declined by 6 percent in the fourth quarter of last year. However, with increase in the U.S. land rig count, Halliburton is expecting mid, single-digit growth with the increased horizontal service intensity and increased usage of pad drilling. Consequently, on a consolidated basis, it is expecting to generate double-digit growth in earnings per share for the full year of 2014.Though the company's top line growth was strong in the year 2013, the Macondo incident caused it to get to the bottom line. However, the reduced income has not impacted its cash generating potential. The company's operating cash flow increased by 22 percent to $4.4 billion by the end of 2013. It also generated cash of around $1.3 billion for stock buyback with the new debt that was issued last year. Halliburton has repurchased around $4.4 billion of stock, which is 10 percent of its outstanding share in 2013. The company is looking to keep working on reducing its outstanding share in this year. Further, Halliburton increased its dividend twice last year to 0.15/share, which looks completely safe with the ability to generate massive cash flows. The company is looking to maintain a payout ratio based on an income of around 25 percent. At the moment, its payout ratio based on income is standing at around 21 percent. As the company is expecting to generate a double-digit growth in its income, we can expect a dividend increase in the coming days.In conclusionAlthough the company's Latin American and North American growth has been struggling, its international business has been offsetting the losses in those regions. The growth in drilling activities in North America and the company's move toward liquid-rich resources is generating demand for the oil services industry, and Halliburton is well-set to capitalize on the demand with its superior products and services. In addition, the company is in a strong financial position, generating strong growth in revenues. I consider its share buyback a key for both its dividend and price, as reduced share count enhances both dividends and earnings per share. It also strongly impacts the share price in a positive way.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2161273,54312,2014-04-24T11:33:56-04:00,"Strong investment from the entire energy sector is generating demand for oilfield services companies.Halliburton, Baker Hughes and Schlumberger all are well-set to capitalize on demand.Schlumberger looks to be a good buy.","Energy exploration companies have made significant investments over the past two years in response to the improving economy. Unstable gas prices forced many companies to find liquid plays. That shift in the energy sector forced companies to invest heavily, and as a result, business increased for the oilfield service companies. Oilfield services companies provide the engineering, products and services that are needed to complete complicated drilling and exploration activities and extract and transport natural gas and oil.With steady growth in the economy, oilfield services companies have generated record growth over the past two years. The entire energy sector is making massive investments to find new energy sources, while enhancing existing assets. This, in turn, increases the demand for oilfield services companies like Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL), Baker Hughes Inc. (BHI) and Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB).Where Does Halliburton Stand?Halliburton is one of the top-rated companies in the oilfield services industry. It offers products and services for the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas to the entire energy industry. It has earnings momentum because of the growth in the economic environment and increases in the search for energy resources. Further, demand for Halliburton's products and services is gearing up because locating and extracting energy resources is turning out to be more complex.The good news for Halliburton is that it has seen increasing demand for its products in the international markets. In the first quarter of this year, it generated 13% revenue growth in the Middle East and Asian region. In Europe, Africa and CIS, revenue growth was higher by 7% and operating income was higher by 21%. In North America, the company grew revenues by 5%, and it has significantly more growth potential; its growth in North America was slowed by a harsh winter season during the first quarter. However, it is expecting much better growth in coming months. The weakest area for Halliburton was in Latin America, where the company is having a tough time, as the entire region is going through a transition phase.Overall, its innovative new technologies, strategic investments, operational efficiencies and increased pricing were the catalysts that resulted in Halliburton reporting record growth in both its top and bottom line in 2013 and in the first quarter of 2014. Strong demand for its products like perforating and testing, completion tools, Multi-Chem service and wireline technology led to record revenues. Particularly its Multi-Chem service, perforating and testing product lines, Boots & Coots activity and software sales set new landmarks for sales and operating income.With the strategy of creating a portfolio of innovative products and services that meet customer demand, the company is set to grow even further during this year. After record revenue growth in 2013, the company is set for another year of strong performance in 2014, with single-digit growth in revenues and a more than 20% expansion in margins. Halliburton's cash generating potential will allow it to continue investing in the company and increase dividends for investors. In the latest quarter, its cash flow from operations was $954 million and its capital expenditures were $643 million, resulting in free cash flow of $311 million. Its free cash flow will allow for dividend payments of $127 million. I believe that Halliburton will increase its dividends in the second half of 2014, just as it did in 2013. We can expect additional increases in the free cash flow in 2014, as the company is expecting much better growth in the second half of the year.Where Do the Other Players Stand?Baker Hughes offers products and drilling services for the exploration, completion and production of gas and oil wells, reservoir technology and fluids and chemicals. Its high-technology products and services like logging-while-drilling services, remote monitoring to highly complex deepwater wells, dynamic kill drilling fluid systems, and wireline-conveyed cased hole logging are generating strong sales for the company throughout the world.Its revenue growth is high, at more than 15% in the past three years. It saw 10% growth in revenues in the first quarter of this year and nearly 29% growth to its net income. The company has growing momentum and expects strong 2014 results, as it has won multiple contracts in the Middle East, Australia, North Africa and Russia. Looking forward, Baker Hughes' free cash flow will ensure that it can continue to make capital investments and pay dividends.Schlumberger is also one of the strongest company's in the oil services industry. Its revenue growth in the past three years is very high, at 17%, with a net margin of 14.5%. It offers technology, integrated project management and information solutions to the global oil and gas industry. Its software and multi-client license sales in Australia, Ecuador, North America, the Middle East, Asia and Argentina are very strong. The company generated strong growth in the first quarter of 2014, when revenues increased to $11.24 billion, compared to $10.57 billion in the first quarter of 2013. Schlumberger's cash position is also very strong. In 2013, its free cash flow was $5.8 billion, with dividend payments of only $1.6 billion.In Conclusion(Source: Morningstar.com)HAL data by YChartsAs you can see from the above table and chart, all three companies have strong momentum. Further, they are on track to generate big profits in this year as well. However, in terms of returns for investors, Schlumberger looks to be a winner. The company's return on equity (19.6%) is higher than its two competitors. Its dividend yield (1.6%) and dividend growth are also higher than its competitors. In addition, it has a strong stock buyback program. Finally, its cash generating potential is very strong, and there is plenty of free cash with which to continue or increase dividend payments.It is difficult to pick the best out of these three companies, each of them has a strong history, and I am expecting price appreciation and a dividend increases from all three of them. However, if I had to recommend one, it would be Schlumberger. I like Schlumberger because it is undervalued, with a low PE (19.2), a high forward PE (15.2), strong revenue and cash flow growth, the ability to make consistent increases in its dividends and the potential for steady price appreciation.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2126053,23762,2014-04-04T09:13:49-04:00,Halliburton has posted huge gains over the past year and hit an all-time in trading yesterday.The shares are still going for a lower valuation than the overall market.The stock could have future upside due to catalysts and earnings growth.,"Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) broached the $60 a share level yesterday to hit all-time highs. I have been long the shares since the high $30s and been advocated for these undervalued shares for over a year. Although the stock has posted huge gains over the past twelve months, they still have upside.Comparative Valuation:The S&P 500 is going for roughly 16x forward earnings and the companies within the index are expected to produce a 4% overall Y/Y gain in revenues in 2014. Halliburton in contrast is priced at just 15x forward earnings with revenue gains that should be at least twice the average of the S&P 500 in each of the next two years.The largest oil services concern Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) goes for over 17x forward earnings even though it has the almost exact same projected revenue and earnings growth as Halliburton over the next two fiscal years.U.S. Exposure:One of the other things I like about Halliburton over Schlumberger besides valuation is that it is more exposed to the geopolitical stable North American land market. Halliburton has a bigger percentage of revenues coming from the U.S. land market than any of the other major oil services concern. It gets just over 50% of its overall revenues from North America.Halliburton is also likely to benefit from increases in prices for pressure pumping as demand for fracking services rises in the wake of the recent increases in natural gas prices. Raymond James recently upgraded its rating on Halliburton primarily on this factor. Halliburton currently holds the market-leading position in the pressure pumping industry. The analyst firm upped its EPS projection for FY2014 & FY2015 on the better outlook for natural gas production services and has a ""Strong Buy"" rating on the shares.Earnings Growth:An investor has to like Halliburton's earning trajectory. The company earned $3.15 in FY2013 and the consensus EPS projection for FY2014 is just under $4 a share. FY2015's projected earnings call for just over $5 a share in profits. The stock has a five year projected PEG of under 1 (.68).Outlook:By the end of the year I think Halliburton will be valued around the same 14-15x forward earnings it is currently. Given the consensus EPS for 2015 of ~$5 a share, this gives us a year end target of $70 to $75 a share; implying 15% to 20% upside from here.Disclosure: I am long HAL.

From a valuation perspective, the company has risen its EPSmg (normalized earnings) from $1.98 in 2009 to $2.52 for 2013, a level of demonstrated historical growth that does not provide enough support for the market's current implied estimate of earnings growth of 7.05%. The low earnings growth results in the ModernGraham valuation model providing an estimate of intrinsic value that is below the market's current price, indicating the company may be overvalued currently.Disclaimer: The author did not hold a position in Halliburton Company or any of the other companies listed in this article at the time of publication and had no intention of changing that position within the next 72 hours."
2014961,27361,2014-02-12T13:12:54-05:00,,"Over the next couple of years Nat Gas prices within North America are expected to increase. The increase in price is in turn expected to increase E&P onshore capex spending. As onshore capex spending within N.A. is expected to increase in 2014, Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) is an undervalued, large-cap, oil and gas service company that will greatly benefit from this trend.Company DescriptionFounded in 1919, Halliburton is one of the world's largest providers of products and services to the energy industry. With more than 75,000 employees, representing 140 nationalities in approximately 80 countries, the company serves the upstream oil and gas industry throughout the lifecycle of the reservoir - from locating hydrocarbons and managing geological data, to drilling and formation evaluation, well construction and completion, and optimizing production through the life of the field.In the section below, I will analyze aspects of Halliburton's past performance. From this evaluation, we will be able to see how Halliburton has fared over the past five years regarding their profitability, debt and capital, and operating efficiency. Based on this information, we will look for strengths and weaknesses in the company's fundamentals. This should give us an understanding of how the company has fared over the past few years and will give us an idea of what to expect in the future.ProfitabilityProfitability is a class of financial metrics used to assess a business's ability to generate earnings compared with expenses and other relevant costs incurred during a specific period of time. In this section, we will look at four tests of profitability. They are: net income, operating cash flow, return on assets and quality of earnings. From these four metrics, we will establish if the company is making money and gauge the quality of the reported profits.Over the past three years Halliburton's net profits have increased from $1.835 billion in 2010, to $2.125 million in 2013. This represents a 15.80% increase.Operating income is the cash generated from the operations of a company, generally defined as revenue less all operating expenses, but calculated through a series of adjustments to net income.Over the past three years Halliburton's operating income has increased from $3.009 billion to $3.138 billion in 2013. This represents an increase of 4.29%.ROA - Return On Assets = Net Income/Total AssetsROA is an indicator of how profitable a company is relative to its total assets. ROA gives an idea as to how efficient management is at using its assets to generate earnings. Calculated by dividing a company's net income by its total assets, ROA is displayed as a percentage.Over the past four years Halliburton's ROA has decreased from 10.02% in 2010 to 7.27% in 2013. This indicates that the company is generating less income off its assets than it did in 2010.Debt And CapitalThe Debt and Capital section establishes if the company is sinking into debt or digging its way out. It will also determine if the company is growing organically or raising cash by selling off stock.Total Liabilities To Total Assets, Or TL/A ratioTL/A ratio is a metric used to measure a company's financial risk by determining how much of the company's assets have been financed by debt.Over the past four years, Halliburton's total assets have increased by $10.926 billion, while the total liabilities have increased by $7.718 billion. This indicates that the company's assets have increased more than the liabilities thus adding shareholder value.Working CapitalWorking Capital is a general and quick measure of liquidity of a firm. It represents the margin of safety or cushion available to the creditors. It is an index of the firm's financial stability. It is also an index of technical solvency and an index of the strength of working capital.Current Ratio = Current assets / Current liabilitiesOver the past four years, Halliburton's current ratio has decreased. As the current ratio is well above 1, this indicates that Halliburton would be able to pay off its obligations if they came due at this point.Common Shares OutstandingHAL Shares Outstanding data by YChartsOver the past three and a half years, the number of company shares has decreased from 908 million to 851 million.Operating EfficiencyOperating Efficiency is a market condition that exists when participants can execute transactions and receive services at a price that equates fairly to the actual costs required to provide them. An operationally efficient market allows investors to make transactions that move the market further toward the overall goal of prudent capital allocation without being chiseled down by excessive frictional costs, which would reduce the risk/reward profile of the transaction.Gross Margin: Gross Income/SalesThe Gross Profit Margin is a measurement of a company's manufacturing and distribution efficiency during the production process. The gross profit tells an investor the percentage of revenue/sales left after subtracting the cost of goods sold. A company that boasts a higher gross profit margin than its competitors and industry is more efficient. Investors tend to pay more for businesses that have higher efficiency ratings than their competitors, as these businesses should be able to make a decent profit as long as overhead costs are controlled (overhead refers to rent, utilities, etc.).Over the past four years, Halliburton's gross margin has dropped slightly. The ratio has decreased from 17.96% in 2010 to 15.21% in 2013.Asset TurnoverThe formula for the asset turnover ratio evaluates how well a company is utilizing its assets to produce revenue. The numerator of the asset turnover ratio formula shows revenue found on a company's income statement and the denominator shows total assets, which are found on a company's balance sheet. Total assets should be averaged over the period of time that is being evaluated.Over the past four years the revenue growth has increased by 63.59% while the assets have increased by 59.71%. This is an indication that the company from a percentage point of view has been more efficient at generating revenue.Based on the information above we can see that Halliburton has produced mixed results from a fundamental point of view. Revenues over the past four years have increased by 63.59% outpacing the asset growth indicating an increase in shareholder value. The company has been very aggressive in share buybacks over the past six months. On the negative side Halliburton's gross margin has decreased, along with the ROA. Based on the results above we can see that Halliburton has shown many strengths but some weakness.Driving Growth in 2014Halliburton, which earns ~52% of its revenue within North America, is expecting a strong year in 2014. To support this statement Barclays is forecasting an increase of more than 7% in E&P spending within the continent this year. As this increase is being driven by the expectation that Natural Gas prices are on the increase, it is becoming more economical for E&P companies to focus on the onshore drilling market.E&P spending is expected to be significantly higher than last year as in 2013 E&P spending increased by ~2%. As Halliburton is one of the largest oil and gas service companies in the business and has the most exposure to N.A. compared to Baker Hughes (BHI) which earns ~50% of its revenues within N.A. and Schlumberger Limited (NYSE:SLB) which earns ~30% of its revenue within N.A., the increase in spending should have a positive effect on Halliburton's fundamentals moving forward.ValuationIn the next section, I will use the EBITDA to calculate the EV/EBITDA. The adjusted EBITDA takes into account foreign exchange and share-based payment expenses. The EV/EBITDA ratio is one of the most commonly used valuation metrics, as EBITDA is commonly used as a proxy for cash flow available to the firm. Oil and Gas service stocks typically have an EV/EBITDA ratio that trades in the 8.0x to 9.0x trading range.Enterprise Value or EV = Market Capitalization + Total Debt - Cash and Cash Equivalents.As the Oil and Gas service sector often trades in the 8.63 trading range, an EV/EBITDA ratio of 7.84 indicates at current levels the stock is trading just fair value compared to other companies in its sector.Other metrics that indicate the stock is undervalued are: Halliburton has a P/S of 1.59, which is below the industry average of 1.66 and a P/FCF of 10.53, which is above the industry average of 11.19.Forward P/E to create a targetTo create a target price for Halliburton. I will use Apache Energy's forward P/E ratios with estimated earnings to find a target. Currently, Halliburton has a forward P/E of 10.35 and FY 2017 high earnings projected at $6.46. These two metrics lead to a target price of $66.86.As of February 11th, Halliburton was trading at $51.87. Using the forward P/E model, this indicates that the stock has a 28.89% potential upside from this point.ConclusionBased on improving nat gas prices increasing onshore drilling activity within North America, Halliburton's fundamentals will benefit from this trend. As the earnings are expected to increase, this will drive the stock price. Currently based on the information presented above, Halliburton is undervalued compared to the industry average with a price target in the mid $60's for 2014.Disclosure: I am long HAL, SLB.

1961641,25120,2014-01-23T05:09:17-05:00,,"Halliburton's (NYSE:HAL) fourth quarter earnings report was not well-received by the market, despite the fact that both revenues and earnings beat consensus estimates.While the company remains a well-led premium player within the long term growing oilfield service sector, I think shares are fully valued at this point in time.Fourth Quarter ResultsHalliburton generated fourth quarter revenues of $7.64 billion, up 4.8% on the year before. Revenues were up by 2.2% compared to the third quarter and comfortably beat consensus estimates at $7.55 billion.Reported earnings rose by 18.3% to $795 million as reported earnings per share rose by fourteen cents to $0.93 per share. Earnings came in ahead of consensus estimates at $0.89 per share.Looking Into More DetailThe completion and production business reported 4.7% growth, with revenues totaling $4.54 billion. This growth was accompanied by solid margin expansion with operating margins improving by nearly 3 full percent points to 16.8% of revenues. Growth was seen in all geographic regions, with North America still making up nearly two-thirds of total revenues within the segment.The drilling and evaluation business reported revenues of $3.10 billion, up 4.2% on the year before. Margins were slightly under pressure, falling by 30 basis points to 16.1% of total revenues.Earnings saw another boost on the back of lower tax rates, with the effective tax rate falling by 840 basis points to 25.8% of operating profits. On top of that came a reduction of roughly 8% of the outstanding share base over the past year, providing an additional boost to earnings per share.2014 Should Be SolidHalliburton is upbeat about the prospects for this year. The US land rig counts is expected to increase modestly, resulting in mid-single digit growth in North American revenues. This should mostly be driven on the back of greater activity in the Gulf of Mexico. This should bode well for earnings, as Halliburton is aiming to boost margins by two full percent points, after facing pricing pressure in 2013.As a result, Halliburton should be able to report double-digit growth in earnings per share for 2014.As such, Halliburton is able to break through the $30 billion revenue mark after posting revenues of $29.4 billion last year. 2013 adjusted earnings were $2.8 billion, or $3.15 per share. This was up from reported earnings of $3.00 per share a year earlier, with earnings per share growth entirely driven by repurchases. Reported GAAP earnings fell much harder after the company took a $1 billion charge related to the BP (NYSE:BP) Macondo incident.Shareholder PaydayInvestors in Halliburton have seen very strong returns over the past year, driven by increased payments to shareholders. The company aggressively hiked its quarterly dividend to $0.15 per share, yet the current yield of 1.2% is not too attractive. Note that Halliburton complemented this by steep share repurchases in 2013.During 2013, Halliburton repurchased $4.4 billion worth of shares, which combined with the dividends cost the company nearly $5 billion. This represents cash flows to investors at a rate of 11% per annum, or nearly 2 times adjusted earnings for 2013.Clearly such a scenario is not sustainable. While Halliburton still holds $2.4 billion in cash and equivalents, its net debt position has increased towards $5.4 billion. This has mostly been the case of share repurchases over the past year.Implications For InvestorsInvestors are not too pleased with Halliburton's results. Shares have risen by about a third over the past year on higher payments to investors. This has pushed the valuation to 15-16 times adjusted earnings for 2013, based on a current price of around $49 per share.Of course these are adjusted earnings, with GAAP earnings impacted by a billion through the Macondo incident in 2013. A company with the size of Halliburton will have to take these ""one-time"" charges as a usual cost of business, making me hesitant to use ""adjusted earnings"" as a multiple. Perhaps subtracting a ""usual"" $300-$400 million in unusual expenses per year from adjusted earnings, this leaves $2.5 billion in normalized earnings. On this metric the business is valued at 18 times earnings.This is fair enough for a company with great long term growth prospects which is guiding for solid earnings growth again in 2014. While all of this seems fair, note that Halliburton stepped up payments to shareholders in the good times. Obviously historical oil downturns can be severe with great implications for shareholders. Note that shareholders lost more than 60% of their value in just a few months in 2008.While Halliburton will probably remain an outstanding pick within the oilservice sector, current levels are more than fair. I remain on the sidelines.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1957231,53552,2014-01-21T11:13:51-05:00,,"Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) reported strong quarterly results on Tuesday Morning, though shares were trading down 1.3% on Tuesday morning (press release available here). The company reported earnings of $0.93 compared to expectations of $0.89 while revenue of $7.64 billion exceeded consensus by $80 million. For all of 2013, revenue was up 3% to $29.4 billion, and adjusted income from continuing operations was up 5% to $3.15. Even though shares are up 33% over the past twelve months, this quarter suggests more upside remains.If we look at a geographic breakdown of the quarter, it is clear that Europe/Africa and the Middle East/Asia continue to be the primary drivers of growth. European revenue was up 15% year over year to $1.4 billion with strong results at both its drilling and production units. Stronger activity in the UK, Russia, and Central Africa continue to drive results higher. As the European economy continues its slow mend, demand for energy production should continue to grow, which should benefit African production and could lead some European countries to rethink their stance on fracking. I would look for Europe/Africa to be a bright spot at Halliburton again in 2014.HAL also continues to do exceptionally well in the Middle East and Asia with revenue of $1.4 billion up 12.8% year over year. The Middle East was led by a 15% gain at Halliburton's drilling and evaluation unit. Increased drilling in China and its waters were a major reason for this record performance. With strong growth in Asia, their demand for oil and gas will continue to be extremely strong over the next 3-5 years, which is positive for Halliburton.Moreover, these nations, particularly China, recognize that to be a geopolitical power it is critical to have a stable supply of energy or be energy independent. With China's demand, it will likely be a crude importer for as far as the eye can see. However, it is taking steps to de-risk its supply. It has signed deals with Russia for major oil and gas pipelines, which will require Russia to significantly increase its drilling sites. With a stronger presence in this nation, HAL will benefit from this action. China also continues to drill everywhere it can, including in the China Sea. Given Halliburton's offshore and onshore expertise, it should continue to grow sales in China. In other words, I expect 10%+ growth in the Middle East and Asia to continue in 2014 and 2015.On the other hand, Latin America is a challenged region. Simply put, many oil wells have not been nearly as productive as hoped, and many currencies have been crushed. As a consequence, revenue in the region fell by 6% to $1.02 billion. This decline was driven entirely by a major slowdown in HAL's drilling and evaluation unit, which saw revenue fall 14%. I am looking for another weak year in 2014 as Brazil faces inflation and disappointing growth while other nations like Venezuela will continue to depreciate their currencies. At some point, Latin America should grow again, but that point will not be in 2014.Last, North American revenue was a bit underwhelming at $3.82 billion. While this figure was up 2% year over year, it was down 1.5% sequentially. Now, the weather was unseasonably cold, particularly in the month of December, which had an adverse effect on drilling and production. We have seen reported weakness throughout the industry in December, and as a consequence, I expect this underperformance to be transitory. Halliburton's management is forecasting a modest increase in the North America rig count, which I think is an accurate assessment.Horizontal drilling has opened the door to previously unfeasible reserves, and I expect drilling activity in regions like the Permian Basin and Marcellus Shale to continue to expand, especially as natural gas prices have rebounded significantly. Importantly, drilling activity in the Gulf of Mexico should also improve, which will buoy HAL's performance. Mexico is opening its waters to joint ventures as companies like Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX) have capabilities it lacks. This decision should lead to significantly higher drilling activity over the next 3-5 years, which will greatly benefit Halliburton. While North American results weren't great this quarter, I am more optimistic about 2014 and beyond.Overall, this was a pretty strong quarter for HAL. Europe/Africa and Middle East/Asia delivered robust numbers while Latin America was weak and transitory factors hurt North America. I expect double digit revenue growth in Europe and Asia while Latin America should be a drag of about 5-8%. With a higher rig count and better margins, North America will also provide some solid growth in the 3-5% range.After this quarter, I continue to look for HAL to earn $4.00-$4.25 in 2014, giving shares a forward multiple of 12x. With a structurally strong drilling industry thanks to new technology, I think this is a very attractive valuation and would be a buyer on this drop. Fair value is closer to 15x earnings or $60. With 20% upside, Halliburton is a great buy here.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in HAL, over the next 72 hours.

1959341,53422,2014-01-22T08:59:29-05:00,,"Energy companies, besides financials, are my favorite cyclical sectors for 2014 and 2015. Energy companies, including exploration and service firms, profit from rising energy demand which will be driven by emerging market economies in the coming decades. Latin America and Asia, which include the largest and fastest-growing emerging market economies, will continue to rely on fossil fuels for many more decades as a transition to alternative energy sources is politically not endorsed in developing countries. At the same time, the US and Europe are still heavily dependent on either domestic (as is the case in the United States) or offshore (in the case of Europe) oil and gas exploration growth. Oilfield service companies like Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) offer oil and gas majors drilling, monitoring and evaluation services in order to optimize exploration processes. As such, Halliburton's engineering services are key in order to access commodities that are in high demand by both developed and developing countries. Consequently, Halliburton's know-how is being used around the globe and its extensive drilling experience makes the company one of the premier contractors in the oil and gas exploration sector.Q4 2013 results revisitedFor the fourth quarter of 2013 Halliburton reported income from continuing operations of $798 million ($0.93 per diluted share) compared to $745 million ($0.83 per diluted share) in the third quarter of 2013 which represents a q-o-q increase of 7.1% (12.0%). Analysts expected earnings per share of $0.89 while Halliburton delivered a 4.5% EPS outperformance. Halliburton's revenue for the fourth quarter 2013 came in at $7.6 billion vs. the $7.5 billion booked in Q3 2013. Halliburton also booked record total revenues of $29.4 billion in 2013 compared to $28.5 billion in fiscal year 2012 (up 3.2% y-o-y).Chief executive officer and Chairman Dave Lesar praised the company performance for the fiscal year 2013 and remained upbeat about 2014:12-month trailing share performanceHalliburton is the best performing oil and gas equipment and services company in the sector as shares of Halliburton have gained 31% of value since last year. Halliburton reached a new 52-week high in November and has been trading weakly since then. Shares are down nearly 2% after the company announced an earnings beat mainly because investors reacted sensitively to Halliburton's disappointing performance in Brazil.Halliburton's outperformance, over a five-year measurement period, is quite striking especially when compared to peer firms Weatherford International (WFT) and Baker Hughes (BHI). Shares of Weatherford International gained a mere 35% over the last five years and they clearly didn't turn out to be a lucrative bet for shareholders. Baker Hughes, which also delivered an earnings beat yesterday, returned 76% while Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) gained 122% and Halliburton 173% over the same time period. Halliburton has been a favorite of investors for a long time.Peer group valuationOne of the things that I really like about Halliburton is that the company trades at a reasonable valuation even though the stock price has increased more than 170% over the last five years. Halliburton is quite good value considering that the company's drilling expertise is in high demand and gaining access to deep oil and gas reservoirs is getting harder and becoming more expensive. Halliburton trades at less than 12 times forward earnings which is equivalent to an 8.4% earnings yield. With the exception of Weatherford International, other peer firms fetch higher multiples: Schlumberger, which I think is not a good bet for investors based on its low free cash flow profitability, trades at nearly 16x forward earnings whereas Baker Hughes trades at 14 times forward earnings.Investors in oil and gas equipment and services companies can expect that their total return will largely be driven by capital gains. Companies in the sector don't have a reputation for remunerating shareholders with high dividends. Income investors who look for steady, predictable income should probably take a look at the telco and utility sectors of the stock market. If investors also desire exposure to energy companies, master limited partnerships that operate a set of midstream assets might be worth a look as well.The table below summarizes the results from above and shows that Halliburton trades at an 11% discount to the average oil and gas equipment and services company in the peer group.ConclusionInvestors who share my bullish outlook for stocks and for cyclical companies in particular, could consider Halliburton to gain exposure to the energy sector. The main theme that works to the benefit of Halliburton is that the process of commodity exploration is becoming increasingly difficult, complex and expensive. Experienced contractors need to assist oil majors with feasibility studies, project management, control activities and, of course, drilling itself as those activities are oftentimes outsourced. Halliburton's strong business expertise and good standing with oil majors suggests that the company will benefit from increasingly complex deal work in the future and Halliburton seems to me to be the best value in the oil and gas service sector. I also stand by my assertion that Halliburton could trade at a multiple of 15 when the market prices energy and service companies more optimistically. Since Halliburton currently trades at a forward P/E ratio of 11.93, this implies upside potential of 26% for shares of Halliburton (not accounting for material EPS changes). Long-term BUY on performance results, record annual revenues, good chances of EPS surprises in the coming quarters and a low relative valuation.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1945141,41381,2014-01-14T14:27:50-05:00,,"Sterne Agee recently noted that it believes non-conventional and deepwater drilling will rise steadily over the course of the next few years, and as a result of these expectations a number of deepwater drillers could benefit quite nicely. These names include, but may not be limited to, Halliburton (NYSE:HAL), Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) Oceaneering (NYSE:OII) and Tetra Technologies (NYSE:TTI), and of those four names I wanted highlight a number of reasons why I'm staying long on shares of Halliburton.#1 Recent Trend BehaviorOn Friday, shares of HAL, which currently possess a market cap of $44.96 billion, a forward P/E ratio of 11.97, and a dividend yield of 1.19% ($0.60), settled at a price of $50.52/share. Based on their closing price of $50.52/share, shares of HAL are trading 0.89% above their 20-day simple moving average, 2.67% below their 50-day simple moving average and 8.40% above their 200-day simple moving average. These numbers indicate a short and long-term uptrend for the stock and a mid-term downtrend which generally signals a moderate buying mode for most near-term traders and many long-term investors.If Halliburton can demonstrate an increase in its overall production as a direct result of both its non-conventional and deepwater drilling activity, I think both traders and investors will see a long-term improvement in the stock's trend behavior.#2 Non-Conventional Drilling ExpectationsHalliburton's non-conventional drilling operations are currently aimed at lowering the cost per boe by increasing its production through more efficient operations. For example, the company recently noted several increases in its production at the Bakken (+24%), Utica Shale (+27%), Cana Woodford (+22%), Niobara (+29%), Granite Wash (+22%), Barnett Combo (+67%) and Eagle Ford Shale (+43%) plays.(Source: 2013 Analyst Day Presentation)If the company can continue to demonstrate growth at each of the above mentioned sites by at least 5.5%-to-7.5% on an annualized basis and lower the costs associated with production over at least the next 12 months, I see no reason why the company's earnings estimates would not meet or even exceed FY 2014 estimates.#3 Deepwater Drilling ExpectationsHalliburton's deepwater drilling operations are currently aimed at meeting its 2010 commitment of growing at a rate that is 25% faster than the rest of the market. According to the company's most recent Analyst Day Presentation, the Deepwater Market's CAGR is expected to increase by an average of 11% between 2013 and 2018 which translates to an expected CAGR of 13.75% for Halliburton between 2013 and 2018.(Source: 2013 Analyst Day Presentation)If the company can continue to demonstrate an average CAGR of 13.25% between 2013 and 2018, I see no reason why both the company's earnings and revenues estimates would not meet or even exceed analysts' expectations over the next several years.#4 5-Year Dividend BehaviorSince February 27, 2009, the company has increased its quarterly distribution twice in the last five years, with the most recent increase having taken place in December of 2013. The company's forward yield of 1.19% ($0.60) coupled with its ability to maintain its quarterly distribution over last five years make this particular oil and gas play a highly considerable option, especially for those who may be in the market for a moderately-yielding stream of quarterly income.Risk Factors (Most Recent 10-K)According to Halliburton's most recent 10-K, there are a number of risk factors investors should consider before establishing a position. These risk factors include but are not limited to:#1 - Trends in oil and natural gas prices affect the level of exploration, development and production activity of Halliburton's customers and the demand for its services and products which could have a material adverse effect on its business, consolidated results of operations and consolidated financial condition.#2 - Liability for cleanup costs, natural resource damages, and other damages arising as a result of environmental laws could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on the company's liquidity, consolidated results of operations and consolidated financial condition.#3 - Doing business with national oil companies exposes Halliburton to a greater risk of cost overruns, delays and project losses, as well as unsettled political conditions that can heighten these and a number of other risks.ConclusionFor those of you who may be considering a position in Halliburton, I strongly recommend keeping a close eye on the company's Non-Conventional and Deepwater drilling performance, its dividend behavior and its ability to enhance shareholder value over the next 12-24 months as each of these factors could play a role in the company's long-term performance.Disclosure: I am long HAL.

The new deepening of ""collaboration between Saudi Aramco and Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) research and development scientists,"" leveraging Halliburton's diverse unconventional expertise, ""will allow solutions to be developed locally and quickly implemented in the Kingdom's fields,"" notes a recent press release.This appears to be added insurance if anyone doubted OPEC's ability to return volley in regards to the U.S. shale revolutions, or potential ones in other countries on the way. Halliburton sees ""significant continued growth in our mature fields business as this market evolves more and more towards higher-end integrated projects."" Interpreted another way, this confirms the often-cited trend that mature fields globally are on the decline, but the right technology solutions can help recovery factors. Examples of mature field intervention methods include water flood, CO2 injection, miscible floods or maximizing reservoir contact to the use of multilaterals, well extensions or infill drilling as well as refract program, notes Halliburton executives. Their results suggest that production and ultimate recovery was increased by 7%.Halliburton cites, ""on average, 60% of IOCs' (international oil firms) portfolio fields are in decline with the average decline rates being more than 8% per annum."" Think Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), Eni, Chevron (NYSE:CVX), BP, Statoil. National oil companies or NOCs have the same issue with declining fields but they also lack the organizational capacity and expertise to sustain production, among other factors. (However those NOCs in joint ventures with U.S. independents are learning how to apply new technologies and best practices.) The ownership of oil reserves around the world by NOCs is steadily increasingly, and they also own 75% of mature fields' reserves.And the cost of incremental production is rising, or ""service intensity."" From 2001, it cost less than $3 million to increase production by 1000 boe; in 2013 it was around $10-11 million. Halliburton calculates this as 12.2% CAGR. In addition to the Saudi Arabia connection, Halliburton also supports Kuwait's national oil company.This service intensity, which bodes well for oil services firms like Halliburton and competitors Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB), Baker Hughes (BHI), Weatherford (WFT) and Fluor (NYSE:FLR), is a sign of the times ahead. In mature fields, Halliburton expects a further tripling of their mature fields revenues over the next three years to $9 billion. The deepwater sector, also with high service intensity, saw licensing activity increase 40% in 2012 over 2011.Unconventional exploration and development is the other main growth area for oilfield services firms. It is characterized by high service intensity as well, and developing shale oil resources is a key future direction for adding supply in the years ahead, especially in the U.S.In the global unconventionals space, Halliburton drilled and completed some of the first unconventional wells in most of the international plays. They operate in Australia, Argentina, China, Saudi Arabia and many others. (See article on global shales, specifically the tables with reserves by country.)Halliburton affirms the current phase and future of the shale oil plays - a focus on efficiency and maximizing capital, whether an E&P or oilfield services firm. Halliburton suggests the following increases in production from their early projects and their services approach to unconventionals: 27% in the Utica, 24% in the Bakken, 29% in the Niobrara, and on down the line of the major basins in the United States.Lastly, oilfield services firms can take a lead role in developing sustainability practices, making the entire process more resource efficient through water use and by integrating gas-fired power and solar in the processes. Halliburton has made strides in this regard. A number of E&P firms are also incorporating progressive environmental, social and governance (BATS:ESG) practices into their operating activities. In a study by the U.S. SIF Foundation, 11% of professionally-managed U.S. investments - $3.74 trillion - were selected based on environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria.With intensified efforts globally to extract hydrocarbons, leading oilfield services firms are a natural investment choice. A global firm like Halliburton provides exposure to global and domestic unconventionals development, deep water markets and mature fields, an emergent growth opportunity.(Source: SA Transcript for Analyst Day)Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Some of these concerns include what the company does, its competitive advantages, valuation, dividend payouts and sustainability, and earnings consistency.Another important thing that you need to consider is the financial condition of the company in question. You want to know if the company is able to continue paying its bills, and how much debt it carries. The balance sheet is one of the most effective tools that you can use to evaluate a company's financial condition. In this article, I will discuss the balance sheet of Halliburton (NYSE:HAL), in order to get some clues as to how well this company is doing.I will go through the balance sheet, reviewing the most important items, in order to assess Halliburton's financial condition. The information that I am using for this article comes from the company's website here. Note that this article is not a comprehensive review as to whether Halliburton should be bought or sold, but rather, just an important piece of the puzzle when doing the proper due diligence.This article might be a bit too basic for some and too long-winded for others, but I hope that some of you can derive benefit from it.BackgroundHalliburton is a provider of products and services that are used in the energy industry for exploration, development, and production of oil and natural gas. They serve major oil and natural gas companies throughout the world, operating in 80 countries.The company operates in two segments. They are Completion and Production, and Drilling and Evaluation. The Completion and Production segment offers optimization services for oil and natural gas production through pressure pumping, nitrogen services, and hydraulic fracturing. This segment also does bonding of the wells and well casing, also known as cementing. They offer numerous well completion products and services, equipment rental tools and services, as well as oilfield production and completion chemicals that address production, processing, and transportation issues. The Completion and Production segment accounted for 60% of Halliburton's revenue so far in 2013.The Drilling and Evaluation segment provides field and reservoir modeling, drilling, evaluation, and wellbore placement solutions. They provide drill bits, seismic services, analysis of dynamic reservoir information, drilling fluids, performance additives, testing equipment, and waste management for oil and natural gas drilling. This segment also offers directional and horizontal drilling services, drilling and production software, and does consulting and project management.In 2012, 53% of Halliburton's revenue came from the United States. Outside of the U.S., no other country accounted for more than 10% of the company's revenue.Cash and Cash EquivalentsThe first line in the Assets column of the balance sheet is for the amount of cash and cash equivalents that the company has in its possession. Generally speaking, the more cash the better, as a company with a lot of cash can invest more in acquisitions, repurchase stock, pay down debt, and pay out dividends. Some people also value stocks according to their cash positions. Some of the larger and more mature companies tend not to carry a lot of cash on their balance sheets, as they might be more inclined to buy back stock with it, or pay out dividends.Halliburton is one such company. As of Sept. 30, 2013, Halliburton had $1.49B in cash and cash equivalents, which can be easily converted into cash. Over the last 12 months, Halliburton repurchased $4.29B worth of stock, and paid out $420M in dividends. The dividends are well supported by the company's 12-month free cash flow of $1.16B.As of Sept. 30, 2013, the company had $1.7B remaining on its authorization to buy back stock. Halliburton recently announced a 20% increase to its dividend. This marks the second time that the company has increased its dividend payout within the last 12 months.Net ReceivablesReceivables constitute money that is owed to a company for products or services that have already been provided. Of course, the risk with having a lot of receivables is that some of your customers might end up not paying. For this reason, you usually like to see net receivables making up a relatively small percentage of the company's sales.Halliburton had a total of $6.63B in net receivables on its balance sheet, which represents 22.8% of its trailing 12-month sales of $29.1B. For fiscal 2012, 20.3% of its sales were booked as receivables, while that percentage was at 20.5% for fiscal 2011.While this figure is high in absolute terms, it has been fairly consistent, and is more than likely reflective of the nature of the company's business. I don't see anything to be alarmed about here.InventoryWith manufacturing and service companies like Halliburton, I like to keep an eye on inventory levels. I usually like to see inventory levels stable or slightly rising from one year to the next. If I see inventory levels rising, then I want to see revenues rising as well, to indicate higher demand for the company's products. I don't like to see rapidly fluctuating inventory levels that are indicative of boom and bust cycles. In some instances, if inventory ramps up without increases in volumes or revenues, then it may indicate that some of the company's products are going obsolete.As of Sept. 30, 2013, Halliburton had $3.40B worth of inventory, which amounts to 11.7% of the company's sales over the last 12 months. At the end of fiscal 2012, this level was at 11.2% of sales, while at the end of fiscal 2011, it was at 10.4% of sales. This shows that the company's inventory levels are steady relative to the revenues. I don't see anything here that would indicate boom and bust cycles or the possibility of a large number of their products going obsolete. So, I see nothing to worry about here at this time.Current RatioAnother factor that I like to look at is the current ratio. This helps to provide an idea as to whether or not the company can meet its short-term financial obligations in the event of a disruption of its operations. To calculate this ratio, you need the amount of current assets and the amount of current liabilities. Current assets are the assets of a company that are either cash or assets that can be converted into cash within the fiscal year. In addition to cash and short-term investments, some of these assets include inventory, accounts receivable, and prepaid expenses. Current liabilities are expenses that the company will have to pay within the fiscal year. These might include short-term debt and long-term debt that is maturing within the year, as well as accounts payable (money owed to suppliers and others in the normal course of business). Once you have these two figures, simply divide the amount of current assets by the amount of current liabilities to get your current ratio.If a company's operations are disrupted due to a labor strike or a natural disaster, then the current assets will need to be used to pay for the current liabilities until the company's operations can get going again. For this reason, you generally like to see a current ratio of at least 1.0, although some like to see it as high as 1.5.The current ratio of Halliburton is 2.71, which is excellent. If you strip the company's inventory levels out of the calculation, then the ratio (also known as the quick ratio) comes in at 2.00, which is very good. This means that even if the company's inventory was worthless, there would still be enough current assets available to cover the company's short-term financial obligations in the event of an unlikely disruption.Property, Plant and EquipmentEvery company, regardless of the industry in which it operates, requires a certain amount of capital expenditure. Land has to be bought, factories have to be built, machinery has to be purchased, and so on. However, less may be more when it comes to outlays for property, plant and equipment, as companies that constantly have to upgrade and change their facilities to keep up with competition may be at a bit of a disadvantage.However, another way of looking at it is that large amounts of money invested in this area may present a large barrier-to-entry for competitors. Right now, Halliburton has $10.9B worth of property, plant, and equipment on its balance sheet. This figure is inline with the $10.3B that the company reported at the end of fiscal 2012. Of these assets, 89% is tied up in machinery and equipment, while 10% is in buildings and improvements.GoodwillGoodwill is the price paid for an acquisition that's in excess of the acquired company's book value. The problem with a lot of goodwill on the balance sheet is that if the acquisition doesn't produce the value that was originally expected, then some of that goodwill might come off of the balance sheet, which could, in turn lead to the stock going downhill. Then again, acquisitions have to be judged on a case-by-case basis, as good companies are rarely purchased at or below book value.Halliburton has $2.13B worth of goodwill on its most recent balance sheet, which is inline with the $2.14B worth of goodwill that it reported 9 months prior.Usually, I don't like to see goodwill account for more than 20% of a company's total assets for the reason that I discussed at the beginning of this section. Since goodwill only accounts for 7.6% of the assets at Halliburton, I don't see much to be concerned about here, going forward.Return on AssetsThe return on assets is simply a measure of the efficiency in which management is using the company's assets. It tells you how much earnings management is generating for every dollar of assets at its disposal. For the most part, the higher, the better, although lower returns due to large asset totals can serve as effective barriers to entry for would-be competitors. The formula for calculating return on assets looks like this:Return on Assets = (Net Income) / (Total Assets).For Halliburton, the return on assets would be $2.64B in core earnings over the last 12 months, divided by $27.9B in total assets. This gives a return on assets for the trailing twelve months of 9.46%, which is decent. I also calculated Halliburton's returns on assets over fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010 for comparative purposes. This can be seen in the table below.Table 1: Decent Returns On Assets At HalliburtonThe numbers shown in the above table are decent returns on assets, and they show that management is doing a good job at making efficient use of what it has at its disposal.We see a rise during 2011, which was due to increased activity in oil and natural gas basins in North America. Then, in 2012, the return on assets dropped back to where it was in 2010 due to higher costs and pricing pressures for production enhancement services in North America. Higher costs stemmed from 900%-1000% increases in the price of guar gum, which is used as a controlling agent in oil wells to facilitate easy drilling and prevent fluid loss. These price increases were caused by Halliburton and Schlumberger building up their inventories in guar gum in fear of any shortages that might result from droughts that were occurring in India during that time.Short-Term Debt Versus Long-Term DebtIn general, you don't want to invest in a company that has a large amount of short-term debt when compared to the company's long-term debt. If the company in question has an exorbitant amount of debt due in the coming year, then there may be questions as to whether the company is prepared to handle it.At present, this is not a concern for Halliburton, as they don't have any short-term debt on their balance sheet.Long-Term DebtLong-term debt is debt that is due more than a year from now. An excessive amount of it can be crippling in some cases. For this reason, the less of it, the better. Companies that have sustainable competitive advantages in their fields usually don't need much debt in order to finance their operations. Their earnings are usually enough to take care of that. A company should generally be able to pay off its long-term debt with 3-4 years' worth of earnings.Right now, Halliburton carries $7.82B of long-term debt. This figure is well above the $4.82B that was reported just 9 months prior, as well as the $4.82B that was reported at the end of fiscal 2011. This increase was brought on by the company issuing $3B in senior notes in four tranches this past August. One tranche is $600M financed at 1.0% with a maturity of 2016. $400M was financed at 2.0% with a maturity of 2018. $1.1B was financed at 3.5% with a maturity of 2023, while $900M was financed at 4.75% with a maturity of 2043. The proceeds from this $3B debt issue were used to buy back stock.Maturities on the company's long-term debt range from 2016 to 2096, with rates ranging from 1.0% to 8.75%.In determining how many years' worth of earnings it will take to pay off the long-term debt, I use the average of the company's core earnings over the last 3 fiscal years. The average core earnings of Halliburton over this period is $2.46B. When you divide the long-term debt by the average earnings of the company, here is what we find.Years of Earnings to Pay off LT Debt = LT Debt / Average EarningsFor Halliburton, here is how it looks: $7.82B / $2.46B = 3.18 yearsThis is pretty good for Halliburton, in that the company can pay off its long-term debt with an amount that is just over three years' worth of earnings. To me, this shows that the company's debt position is manageable when considering the company's earnings power. It should be mentioned that of the $7.82B in long-term debt, only $1.4B comes due within the next 5 years.Treasury StockIn the equity portion of the balance sheet, you will find the treasury stock. This figure represents the shares that the company in question has repurchased over the years, but has yet to cancel, giving the company the opportunity to re-issue them later on if the need arises. Even though treasury stock appears as a negative on the balance sheet, you generally want to see a lot of treasury stock, as strong, fundamentally-sound companies will often use their huge cash flows to buy back their stock. For this reason, I will often exclude treasury stock from my calculations of return on equity and the debt-to-equity ratio in the case of historically-strong companies, as the negative effect of the treasury stock on the equity will make the company in question appear to be mediocre, or even severely distressed, when doing the debt-to-equity calculation, when in reality, it might be a very strong company. In this case, I will try to calculate the debt-to-equity ratio and the return on equity both ways to help give the reader an idea as to how much effect the treasury stock really has.Halliburton has $8.17B in treasury stock.Debt-To-Equity RatioThe debt-to-equity ratio, as normally calculated, is simply the total liabilities divided by the amount of shareholder equity. The lower this number, the better. Companies with sustainable competitive advantages can finance most of their operations with their earnings power rather than by debt, giving many of them a lower debt-to-equity ratio. I usually like to see companies with this ratio below 1.0, although some raise the bar (or lower the bar if you're playing limbo) with a maximum of 0.8. Let's see how Halliburton stacks up here.Debt-To-Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Shareholder EquityFor Halliburton, the debt-to-equity ratio is calculated by dividing its total liabilities of $15.1B by its shareholder equity of $12.8B. This yields a debt-to-equity ratio of 1.18.This figure is just a little bit higher than ideal. However, when you cancel out the negative effects that the treasury stock has on the equity, it gets better.In these instances, I calculate what I like to call the adjusted debt-to-equity ratio. It is calculated as follows.Adjusted Debt-To-Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / (Shareholder Equity + Treasury Stock)Using the data from the most recent balance sheet of Halliburton, this figure is calculated as: $15.1B / $21.0B = 0.72. The tables below show how both the normal and adjusted debt-to-equity ratios have changed over the last few years.Table 2: Debt-To-Equity Ratios Of HalliburtonTable 3: Adjusted Debt-To-Equity Ratios Of HalliburtonFrom these two tables, we can see that Halliburton's debt is very manageable when compared to its equity position. The main reason why we see an increase in the 2013 figures is the $3B debt issue that was mentioned earlier. Before then, the ratios were very consistent.Return On EquityLike the return on assets, the return on equity helps to give you an idea as to how efficient management is with the assets that it has at its disposal. It is calculated by using this formula.Return On Equity = Net Income / Shareholders' EquityGenerally speaking, the higher this figure, the better. However, it can be misleading, as management can juice this figure by taking on lots of debt, reducing the equity. This is why the return on equity should be used in conjunction with other metrics when determining whether a stock makes a good investment. Also, it should be mentioned that some companies are so profitable that they don't need to retain their earnings, so they buy back stock, reducing the equity, making the return on equity higher than it really should be. Some of these companies even have negative equity on account of buybacks. However, Halliburton is not one of these companies.So, the return on equity for Halliburton is as follows:$2.64B / $12.8B = 20.6%This appears to be a pretty solid return on equity. In the table below, you can see how the return on equity has fared over the past three years.Table 4: Returns On Equity At HalliburtonThis table shows that there was some variation in this figure over the last 3-4 years. The jump in 2011 was due to a 67% increase in core earnings that came from increased oil and gas activity in North America. The subsequent drop in 2012 was due to lower earnings mentioned earlier, coupled with a 20% increase in the company's equity position over the same period. It then rebounded, but this was due more than anything else to the $3B debt issue, which reduced the company's equity position, making the return on equity higher.Adjusted Return On Equity = Net Income / (Shareholders' Equity + Treasury Stock)When I strip out the negative effects of the treasury stock, here is what I come up with when using the data from the most recent balance sheet.Adjusted Return On Equity = $2.64B / $21.0B = 12.6%.This appears to be a pretty solid return on equity, although it's not much to write home about either. In the table below, you can see how the adjusted return on equity has fared over the past three years.Table 5: Adjusted Returns On Equity At HalliburtonFor the most part, the adjusted returns on equity showed the same behavior over the last few years as the normal return on equity.Retained EarningsRetained earnings are earnings that management chooses to reinvest into the company as opposed to paying it out to shareholders through dividends or buybacks. It is simply calculated as:Retained Earnings = Net Income - Dividend Payments - Stock BuybacksOn the balance sheet, retained earnings is an accumulated number, as it adds up the retained earnings from every year. Growth in this area means that the net worth of the company is growing. You generally want to see a strong growth rate in this area, especially if you're dealing with a growth stock that doesn't pay much in dividends or buybacks. More mature companies, however, tend to have lower growth rates in this area, as they are more likely to pay out higher dividends.Halliburton currently has a retained earnings figure of $18.2B. Below, you can see how the retained earnings have fared at Halliburton at the end of each of the last four fiscal years.Table 6: Retained Earnings At HalliburtonFrom the above table, you can see that Halliburton has been steadily growing its retained earnings since the end of fiscal 2009, at a cumulative rate of 67%. This has been happening as the company has been buying back stock and paying dividends. These impressive figures are a testament to the strong earnings power of Halliburton.ConclusionAfter reviewing the most recent balance sheet, it can be concluded that there are a lot of things to like about the financial condition of Halliburton. For starters, Halliburton has very good current and quick ratios, which show that the company has enough current assets on hand in order to meet its short-term obligations in the event that its operations encounter an unlikely disruption. Halliburton has solid returns on assets and equity. The company's debt is also quite manageable, as can be seen by its adjusted debt-to-equity ratio and the fact that less than four years worth of earnings could cover its long-term debt. Retained earnings growth has also been very good, leaving Halliburton with plenty of money to reinvest back into the company for more growth.While this is not a comprehensive review as to whether Halliburton should be bought or sold, I think that the company is in very good financial condition at this point in time.More information on how I analyze financial statements can be found at my website here.Thanks for reading and I look forward to your comments!Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1874321,23471,2013-12-03T14:08:48-05:00,,"Here is a look at how Haliburton (NYSE:HAL) fares in ModernGraham's opinion, based on an updated and modernized version of Benjamin Graham's requirements of defensive and enterprising investors from The Intelligent Investor:Defensive and Enterprising Investor Tests (What is the significance of these tests, and what is PEmg ratio?):Defensive Investor – must pass at least 6 of the following 7 tests: Score = 5/7Enterprising Investor – must pass at least 4 of the following 5 tests or be suitable for a defensive investor: Score = 5/5Valuation Summary (Explanation of the ModernGraham Valuation Model)Key Data: Balance Sheet – 9/30/2013  Earnings Per Share – Diluted Earnings Per Share – Modern Graham (Calculating EPSmg) Conclusion:Halliburton Company should be on the radar of both Defensive Investors and Enterprising Investors. It does not meet the requirements for the Defensive Investor at this time, but the only tests it failed were related to the PEmg ratio and the PB ratio (both are too high). As these tests are both related to the price, it is very possible the company could become suitable for Defensive Investors if the price were to drop a bit. Halliburton Company does pass all of the requirements of the Enterprising Investor, and as such this investor type should continue with further research. From a valuation standpoint, the company appears to be slightly overvalued. The EPSmg (normalized earnings) have grown from $2.20 in 2008 to an estimated $2.52 for 2013, a level of growth that does not support the market’s implied estimate of 6.21%.What do you think? Is Halliburton Company overvalued? Is the company suitable only for Enterprising Investors? Leave a comment or mention @ModernGraham on Twitter to discuss.Disclaimer: The author did not hold a position in Halliburton Company at the time of publication and had no intention of entering into a position within the next 72 hours."
1801882,38201,2013-11-04T11:10:26-05:00,,"Oil and gas producing companies are searching for methods to increase productivity of wells located in the U.S. The increasing productivity has instigated the development of a myriad of technologies for well drilling and created opportunities for oilfield services companies. Halliburton (HAL), a company providing oilfield services, has been investing in the development of engineering products and services that would enhance the understanding of complex wells and maximizes the oil and gas productivity from reservoirs. These technologies are increasingly employed in complex shale and tight reservoirs like the one located in the Niobrara basin.De-CYPHERing the oil reservoirs efficientlyIn September this year, Halliburton launched software CYPHER, which is a Seismic-to-Stimulation service to increase the productivity of oil and natural gas reservoirs. A Seismic-to-Stimulation service is used to create models of reservoirs for the understanding, prediction of, and extraction from the reservoir with collaboration across multiple functions like geoscience, reservoir drilling and well completion. Halliburton's third quarter revenue from North America declined by 1.5% year over year. This decline was due to the oversupply of pressure pumping equipment in the region. While there is a pumping equipment oversupply, it is beneficial for the company to focus on other segments like well drilling services.The CYPHER service is typically used for shale and tight reservoirs, where the reservoir characteristics vary at different locations. Reservoir characteristics are measured primarily by two parameters, porosity and permeability. Porosity is the ability of a formation to hold oil and natural gas, which means the more porous a rock structure, the better its ability to hold oil and natural gas. The other parameter, permeability, measures how easily the oil and natural gas can flow through the rocks. The greater the permeability the easier it is to extract oil and natural gas. In shale and tight reservoirs, both porosity and permeability are generally low. According to the estimates of EIA this year, the amount of shale gas technically recoverable is 7,299 trillion cubic feet, or tcf, and that for shale/tight oil is around 345 billion barrels, or bbl, within the U.S. We expect the demand for the CYPHER service to remain sustainable over the coming quarters.The CYPHER service works through the development of the Integrated Asset Model. This model works by incorporating previous databases on rock formation and new information received while drilling into a single model. Halliburton's operations in multiple locations in the U.S. will provide a huge database of the various shale and tight reservoirs. By constantly upgrading the Integrated Asset Model with new information, the service is able to create a dynamic model of the reservoir. This increases the understanding of the reservoir characteristics and increases the productivity of the reservoir by identifying the ""sweet spots."" Sweet spots are the most productive areas within a reservoir. Besides identifying these sweet spots, the service also aims to connect these sweet spots with the help of a single wellbore. CYPHER helps reduce the need for multiple wellbores to access multiple sweet spots. Data from a sample of 26 wells located in North Texas showed an increase in the production of wells by 67% due to the CYPHER service.Increasing productivity of shale and tight reservoirs is gaining momentum as oil companies focus on reducing the cost of well operations. A major competitor of Halliburton in the oilfield services is Schlumberger (SLB). In September this year, Schlumberger launched Microscope HD service. This service enables oil operators to take high definition images of the subsurface rock formations around the wellbore to help model the rock formations. This will help identify positions for effective fracturing to maximize oil output from the reservoirs. This service has been employed in 45 drilling jobs across various regions around the world and has been successful in taking high quality pictures of the rock formations.Gaining Strength in the ColoradoHalliburton has a major presence in the Niobrara basin, which is located in northeastern Colorado. As of September this year, Halliburton has participated in the stimulation of around 95% of the wells drilled and completed in the region, which resulted in a productivity increase of those wells. According to oilfield services firm Baker Hughes, the number of wells in the Niobrara basin is around 278 as of the end of the third quarter of this year. Additionally, the number of well drilling permits in the Niobrara formation as of August of this year was 1,201, which exceeded last year's well permits of 1,190. The number of well drilling permits given shows that there is significant growth for oil field services companies. Major exploration companies like Noble Energy (NBL) plan to spend around $10 billion in the Niobrara formation over the next five years, while Anadarko has earmarked a total spend of $280 million for this year.Noble Energy has a net acerage of 640,000 in the Denver-Julesburg, or DJ, basin, which is a part of the Niobrara formation. The company plans to drill around 300 wells in the region and increase its production to around 260,000 barrel of oil equivalent per day, or boepd, by the end of this year. With its huge capital spending, Noble Energy plans to increase production from the region to around 540,000 boepd and reach an annual well drilling rate of 500 by 2017. During the third quarter ending in September this year, the production from the DJ basin averaged 97 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, or mboepd, which is a 31% increase over the production of the third quarter last year.In addition to Halliburton's leading position in the Niobrara formation, the CYPHER service will provide an added advantage to the company. Since the company has been involved in 95% of the well drilling process, it has developed a huge database in the region when compared to its competitors in the oil service industry. This will thus enable Halliburton to implement its CYPHER services effectively.Though Halliburton has a major advantage in terms of oilfield services competition in the Niobrara formation, it will face operational difficulties in the short term because of floods in the Colorado area. This could increase the cost for the coming quarter. This loss in efficiency is due to road and communication damage. Oil and gas companies operating in the region shut down operations on 1,900 wells during the flood during mid-September of this year. Halliburton expects that normal operations will resume by the end of this year.U.S. onshore revenues can gain momentumHalliburton currently trades at a P/E of 24.50 while the forward P/E is around 12.74. We believe the valuation looks attractive because of the growth potential that the company has from U.S. onshore oil and natural gas exploration and production. With the CYPHER service, the company will be able to offer a better service to oil and gas producing companies. Halliburton's leading position in the Niobrara formation gives the company a head start over other oilfield services companies. We believe that Halliburton has been able to secure a position in the onshore oil and gas exploration market in order to generate significant growth in the coming quarters.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Is this an excellent time to pick up shares in this oil services company? I believe it is.Company DescriptionFounded in 1919, Halliburton is one of the world's largest providers of products and services to the energy industry. With more than 75,000 employees, representing 140 nationalities in approximately 80 countries, the company serves the upstream oil and gas industry throughout the lifecycle of the reservoir - from locating hydrocarbons and managing geological data, to drilling and formation evaluation, well construction and completion, and optimizing production through the life of the field.Why the Buying Opportunity?In a recent statement, CEO Dave Lesar implied that the North American utilization rate is currently oversupplied by 20%. CEO Dave Lesar continued by stating:As the chart below indicates, another force working against Halliburton and other companies in this sector like Schlumberger Limited (NYSE:SLB) and Baker Hughes (BHI) is the seasonal decline. However, adding to the seasonal decline Halliburton is currently having some additional transitory issues. CEO Dave Lesar stated: ""Due to the recent floods in Colorado and logistical disruptions in the Niobrara, where we have a very high market share, these will continue to impact our efficiency in cost structure in that basin. These cost inefficiencies should be fixed by the end of the year.""Moving forward the CEO has a positive outlook in 2014:SeasonalityAccording to a 20-year seasonal average supplied by equity clock, the fall months show weakness when compared to the S&P.Catalysts for Continued Growth1. Deep-water Drilling MarketHalliburton, which is a leader in the development of new technologies for deep-water drilling, has pushed the envelope with its engineering and technological advancements. Many of these advancements have opened up a greater amount of opportunities in areas such as the Pre-Salt region off the coast of Brazil, the Barents Sea in Norway and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.As more advanced technologies have created opportunities, that in turn has reduced costs and increased safety, it has become economical for companies to pursue deep-water reserves. Major E&P companies such as Exxon (NYSE:XOM), Chevron (NYSE:CVX), BP p.l.c. (NYSE:BP) and Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE:RDS.A) have increased their presence in deep-water regions. Exxon is expecting deep-water projects to account for 8% of its new source production over the next decade. Chevron is expecting deep-water projects to account for 40% of its new source production. BP p.l.c. is banking on the most as it is expecting 52% of its new source production to be from deep-water reserves over the next 10 years, while Shell is more reserved in that it expects 25% of new source production to come from deep-water projects. To support their deep-water growth, these major E&P companies along with others have significantly increased their deep-water Capex spending outlook over the next four years.Over the next four years, it is estimated that global growth in the offshore E&P sector will increase 8 to 10% YOY. Leading the way in E&P spending is Brazil, which is anticipating $250 billion to be spent on the development of its offshore reserves. Second in E&P spending is Norway, which is expecting $220 billion to be spent on the development of the North Sea, Norwegian Sea and the Barents Sea, while the U.S. is expected to spend around $190 billion over the next four years.All of these developments create significant opportunities for Halliburton.2. North American Drilling Market / Technological ImprovementsAs the U.S. is focusing on becoming self-sufficient in energy by 2030, the country is looking at tight oil and shale gas as a one of the main sources for its oil and gas production. According to the EIA the U.S. has plenty of oil and gas reserves. They estimate at current consumption rates, the U.S. alone has around 92 years of technically recoverable natural gas reserves. Technically recoverable reserves consist of ""proved reserves"" and ""unproved resources."" As the U.S. has enough oil and gas to sustain itself for many years, this will open the door for many investment opportunities. One sector that will directly benefit from U.S. becoming self-sufficient in energy is the oil and gas service sector.Halliburton's Frac of the Future is part of an initiative designed to address the current need to shrink well site footprints, improve environmental performance, cut supply chain costs and enhance the reliability of onsite equipment.An integral part of Halliburton's Frac of the Future is the use and creation of Dynamic Gas Blending. Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT), Halliburton Inc. and Apache Energy (APA) have teamed up to create and use Dynamic Gas Blending (DGB) engine technology. According to businesswire.com ""the Dynamic Gas Blending kit allows customers to reduce fuel costs and meet changing emissions regulations by utilizing a wide range of gaseous fuels in their existing diesel generator sets. The kit also recently successfully completed an extensive field test for Encana Oil & Gas Inc (ECA).""ConclusionAs Halliburton's stock price has declined by over 10% in the last couple of weeks, this provides an opportunity to invest in a solid company with many forward catalysts. With Halliburton's strong presence in North America coupled with the growing outlook for offshore deep-water development, it is my opinion this is an excellent time to purchase the stock. In an article I recently published entitled ""Halliburton offers 20% upside in 2014"" I listed a price target of $62.88 for 2014.Disclosure: I am long HAL, SLB.

1787202,56502,2013-10-30T10:58:37-04:00,,"Putting Cash Flow into Shareholder PocketsRare is a company that wants to produce shareholder return, while also having capacity to do so. Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) is putting their money where their strength resides, in its ability to grow cash flow. According to SEC financial statements, not only has HAL repurchased some 34M shares for $4.4B to date, but also have increased their dividend $337M versus 2012's $250M.Recent Q3's per share earnings for HAL was $.79, or $706M with 894M shares outstanding. Compare this with Q2's earnings of $.69/share or $644M with 928M shares and one sees not only an organic increase in earnings value, but also a $.03 /share immediate value in HAL's share buyback initiative. Dividend is at $.38/share to date versus $.36/share without the buyback.Cost of this buyback initiative has been paid by cash and a restructuring of capital. Of the $4.4B spent on buybacks, HAL assumed debt of $2.97B averaging a 3% cost. Change in capital structure shows 34M shares at $4.4B retired to treasury saving roughly 14% cost of capital on those shares. Net cash flow consequence, including strong but muted capital expenditure, shows a decline of $993M, with $1.5B in cash remaining on cash flow statement.Not a bad proposition for both company and shareholders. HAL expresses a commitment to deploy 15% to 20% of its net income to dividends. With rig counts in decline, and pressure pumping capacity looming at 20% excess, one must explore sustainability of HAL's approach to shareholder value.Halliburton's Capacity to Continue Shareholder ValueInteresting is HAL's efficiency initiatives supporting value initiatives. HAL has Battle Red and Frac for the Future (FFF), which have identified costs to cut. According to HAL's CFO in Q3 earnings call (transcript readily available thanks to Seeking Alpha), these efforts are ""having a significant impact on the support and operational headcount needs of North America as well as equipment and inventory requirements."" In Q3, adjusting for these efficiencies resulted in $38M in severance and other charges. Q4 efficiency charges look to be $29M.Nonetheless, one can see the effect of efficiencies by contrasting HAL's recent trends against Q3 results. Where revenues have increased, cost of revenue (COR) has increased at a greater pace. For example, 2012 saw revenue increase 14.79% while COR increased 21.49%. The result was a decrease in gross profit growth and ultimately EBITDA. In 2011, COR was 79.8% of revenue while 2012 saw COR increase to 84.4% of revenue. By Q2, 2013, COR was 85.4% of revenue.Q3 experienced revenue increasing only 2.1% sequentially, but this number enhanced down to the bottom line. COR didn't grow in Q3, but was flat resulting in it reducing to 83.6% of revenue, a 180 basis point reduction. SG&A declined by 7M or 8%. Result was operating income rose 12.65% and despite increased interest payments of $20M to $91M, net income increased $62M to $702M or 9.6%. Where share buybacks added $.03/share value and revenue increased only 2.1%, efficiencies were obviously realized. Reduced share count and cost reductions allowed EPS to increase 14.5% sequentially. Without efficiencies, earnings would have been flat, or negative in rate of growth.Looking forward, efficiencies remain to be realized. But Q4 oil field activity looks slow and international operations really don't kick off until 2014.North American Activity Marked by Reduced Rig Count, but Sustained ServicingStarting in 2012 and going forward, trend in North America (N.A.) is multi-well pads and a sustained 20% overcapacity in pressure pumping. Where gas rig count has shrunk from 914 at the start of 2012 to 370s by mid October 2013, oil rig count went from 777 at the start of 2011 to 1,360s of recent. Result is a net total decline in rig count of 9.4% year to date, 33.9% for gas rigs. For HAL, fewer rigs have challenged revenue.With multi-well pads, however, nature of servicing any one rig has changed, but intensified in terms of service needs for any one pad. When a rig engages in horizontal drilling and fracking, HAL experiences a revenue multiplier of 4x to 5x versus conventional vertical drilling. Multi-well pad dynamics appear to reduce the multiplier given well count increases against HAL's revenue.HAL's N.A. revenue for first half 2013 showed a 9% decline versus 2012. Q3, year over year N.A. declines are less dramatic being down 2%. After considering steep gas rig reductions, it looks as if HAL has adapted and is addressing declining revenue trends in N.A. Implied is HAL's ability to find revenue opportunities while rig count decreases. Changing product mix probably accounts for revenue declines slowing. For instance, inland water and offshore rigs are up y/y 10% and 17% respectively.Q4 does bring seasonal slowing to N.A., due to weather and holidays. Overall, revenue from N.A. looks muted for Q4. While Eastern hemisphere props HAL's revenue increases, Latin America shows Mexico with declining production, but perhaps reaching an inflection point with proposed legislation that could bring foreign technology to depleting fields. Brazil presents similar circumstances with restrictions on use of foreign resources.Oil service industry is in a period of transition due to technological developments in N.A. HAL is transitioning accordingly and appears to be rescuing itself from declining returns. Q4 looks to be lackluster, while Q1, 2014 could be positively surprising if Mexico transforms and bleeds off some excess pressure pumping capacity.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1902051,38201,2013-12-17T06:01:53-05:00,,"Halliburton (HAL) is making a strong comeback in the North American drilling market, from where it derives more than half of its revenue. It has launched a number of programs to enhance the well drilling process for oil field operators. One such project is Frac of the Future, which is designed to provide Halliburton cost advantage over its competitors in the North American drilling market. The company plans to implement this program on more than 20% of its fracking fleet, which would result in 30% cost savings in terms of maintenance and crew costs. In locations where Frac to the Future was deployed, capital cost reduced 20% and completion times reduced 40%. I expect the company will continue to derive efficiencies in its fracking fleet operations as it plans to roll out this program to 50% of its fracking fleet by 2015, helping it further increase the efficiency of its fracking fleet.In addition to Frac of the Future, the company is also continuing its efforts on Battle Red, a program that focuses on digitizing the company's operations from drilling to well completions. This is expected to reduce the working capital requirements for the company. The following table shows the company's working capital requirement over the last three quarters of this year.These two programs are going to benefit Halliburton in the coming quarters by improving its cost structures. Halliburton plans to improve its margin by 500 basis points from its North American operations.Improvement of cost structure is an important step towards this target, because the pressure pumping market is still oversupplied. Halliburton derives around 40% of its global revenue from its pressure pumping service line. The North American pressure pumping market is oversupplied by around 20%, and this trend is expected to continue until late next year or 2015. The company expects the pressure on prices to persist since it is taking time for the oversupply of pressure pumps to reduce due to fracking service efficiency gains resulting in more wells per rig. Each North American active rig drilled around 5.4 wells during the third quarter of this year from 4.7 wells during the first quarter of last year. So, while the environment for pressure pumps remains challenging, Halliburton's plans to streamline its operations will payoff in the coming quarters.Increasing efficiency of well drilling in North America should create more demand for technological services, which increases reservoir productivity. One such service offering from Halliburton is CYPHER, which helps increase the productivity of wells. This service helps in the identification of well location, drilling, and completion of well in a cost effective and optimized manner. In major oil and gas basins in the U.S., production increased 27% in the Utica formation, 24% in the Bakken formation, and 29% in the Niobrara formation, with the application of this service. The Exploration and Production, or E&P, spending is expected to increase 7% next year compared to a 3% increase this year. Since efficiency gains could provide better margins for oilfield operators, this would create demand for services that enhance oil well productivity. So, I expect that the increasing capital expenditure by oil companies combined with CYPHER's technological capabilities would drive revenue for Halliburton.Deepwater drilling continue to strengthenThis month, Halliburton won contracts in Brazil for deepwater drilling, beating Baker Hughes (BHI). Baker Hughes' share of offshore drilling in Brazil is around 20% while Halliburton has a market share of around 50%. Baker Hughes also reduced its workforce in Brazil in response to its reduced market share in the region. The growth of the deepwater drilling market in Brazil is part of a bigger picture for Halliburton. Its deepwater drilling revenue grew at a compound average growth rate, or CAGR, of 31% from 2010 through this year while the oil service industry grew around 13% during the same period. The company aims to grow its revenue an additional 25% over the next three years through 2016. I expect that the deepwater drilling market will provide revenue opportunities in the coming quarters. According to Infield, the share of deepwater drilling out of overall drilling is going to increase from around 7% last year to around 10% through 2017, therefore increasing companies' capital expenditure. The major growth is expected to be in areas of Brazil, the Gulf of Mexico, and West Africa, together known as the ""golden triangle."" While Halliburton has developed a strong position in Brazil's offshore market, it remains to be seen how Halliburton will move into the Gulf of Mexico and West African deepwater markets.The growing opportunities from deepwater drilling are enticing Schlumberger (SLB) to develop products and services focused for this market. In November, the company launched the Vx Spectra surface multiphase flowmeter for offshore production platforms. This device helps measure oil and gas flow rates from wells ranging between various ranges with the help of gamma rays. This device liquid flow rates could be measured upto 24,000 barrels per day while gas flow rates of upto 69 million cubic feet per day.This device will enable operators to measure flow rates accurately and repeatedly. Additionally, this measuring device has the ability to save space on offshore platforms due to its design compared to conventional measuring devices. This device also helps reduce downtime and maintenance. These measurement devices are important for drilling in the complex deepwater environment where drilling cost can exceed $1 million per day. Around 200 new deepwater fields will enter into production from this year through 2017. These will be a major driver for these advanced measurement instruments.Irresistible CommitmentHalliburton's plans for growth are clear. In the North American market, the company continues to be lean in its operation, resulting in an increase for its margin. Streamlining its operation has come at an appropriate time, since the North American onshore drilling market currently has a pressure pump oversupply. So while the market adjustment continues, Halliburton will emerge as an efficient operator. At the same time, the company is moving on with its Cypher service, which would help oil operators realize better margins due to increasing well drilling efficiencies.The company is also expanding its operations in the deepwater drilling segment. While the deepwater segment is poised to grow in the coming quarters, Halliburton continues to strengthen in the key market of Brazil. With the commitment to increase its deepwater drilling service, Halliburton is expected to move into more deepwater markets. Halliburton's improving performance in North America and increasing foothold in the deepwater drilling market will make the company's stock a compelling choice for investors.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: Fusion Research is a team of equity analysts.

1696372,33291,2013-09-16T12:07:22-04:00,,"As a whole, commodity prices have been in a steady downtrend, led primarily by the metals, but oil has been an exception. Oil has been on a steady rise since the summer began, helped by presumably in response to the Syrian crisis. Figure 1 displays oil prices for the last year. As we can see there has been a sharp rise since the US began seriously considering Syrian intervention, and crude oil for October delivery now trades at $107.98 at the time of this writing. However, it seems the Syrian situation may end mostly diplomatically, which could pressure certain oil related stocks that have run up. These same stocks can likely be bought back 10%-15% as oil goes down from here. Long-term, the stocks I will discuss are good buys. In the short run, I think there is downside ahead for them.Figure 1. Crude Oil Prices Over The Last Year, 9/14/2012-9/14/2013, US DollarsLong-term, we have to consider the new oil boom. Many analysts and fellow authors I speak to continue to talk about the new U.S. oil boom. This new so-called boom is in response to fracking technology and recent large deposit discoveries. With newer more efficient technology and large deposits being discovered, American energy security appears within grasp. Historically, the US was one of the largest importers of oil, the so-called nation of foreign oil dependency. Now, the US has become one of the world's largest exporters of refined petroleum products.In the long-term, a shortage in global supply is inevitable. We all know that higher supply eventually results in lower prices, and the global oil supply is heading that way very quickly. For years there has been chatter of so-called ""peak oil."" We probably have surpassed that mark, but did not factor in the possibility of new discoveries and better technology. Despite more cars are on the road, more drivers are on the road and more demand at the pump, the global oil supply is very strong right now and as such under normal economic pressures, prices should be lower or trending lower. They don't seem to be just yet, however a resolution in Syria as well as decreased demand from areas such as mining and transportation should pressure prices in the short-run.While long-term I am bullish on the oil service stocks, I think there are a few names in the oil sector in which profit should be taken. We can look to buy on dips for value, which will help us to take advantage of future higher oil prices. For now, it is likely oil prices will correct.Where to take profits:Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB): I will say right upfront, that in the longer-term this stock will likely trade over $100. For now, I think you have to take some profits. Sell some of the position. The price has run up tremendously in just a month for a low beta stock. In fact, SLB is beginning to look expensive, and on its own could face selling pressure, but combined with the likelihood of lower oil prices, I see it heading to $80 before getting much over $90. Shares trade at around $87.57 with a p/e of 18.93, easily exceeding the S&P 500 average p/e. The company has a decent balance sheet with its annual free cash flow of nearly $9 billion, but only pays a 1.5% dividend yield. SLB relies heavily on drilling in the Gulf of Mexico and activity in that region is growing at a slower pace due to increased activity in land-based exploration in North America. Less than 1/3 of SLB's revenue is derived from North America, which can be seem as both a sign of strength (geo-political diversity) and weakness (missing out on areas with largest growth/development).Make no mistake, the company is improving as well. Its revenue grew 8% year over year to $11.18 billion in the second quarter of 2013, fueled by high growth in its international segment. SLB benefited from growing drilling activities, and hence creating demand for its services. The international segment generates the highest revenue for SLB (but missed some of the North American growth) but any further growth in this segment will lead to incremental revenue. Its revenue from the Middle East and Asia grew 11% to $2.7 billion as a result of increased drilling and exploration activities in this region. SLB is upping its spending as it is expanding its portfolio through acquisitions and is seeking performance-based contracts rather than fixed contracts. Performance-based contracts are tricky; they could allow SLB to generate more revenue due to its efficiency and products, though are often much more costly initially. Finally, rig count is also expected to increase in these regions from 1,410 in the last year to 1,530 in the next fiscal year. All of this bodes well long-term.Why sell short-term? Simply put, Oil is going lower. Summer driving demand is over. The Syrian crisis was over blown internationally and will likely end in diplomacy or very limited military interventions. Oil rose over 10% in a few short weeks. Demand in the mining space is diminished and the international catalyst is gone now, and thus downside is likely ahead. My recommendation? Sell a chunk of the stock at the current price of ~$87.50 and look for re-entry at $82 and $79. The stock is just too expensive at current levels.Halliburton (NYSE:HAL): HAL is SLB's largest competition. Like SLB it is becoming very expensive. In fact, HAL is much more expensive than SLB. The stock price sits just under its 52-week high, trading at $50.14 at the time of this writing. The current p/e is much higher than SLB's sitting at a 25.48 and the dividend yield of just above 1% is absolutely poor for a company that generates over $4 billion in free cash flow annually. While the balance sheet of the company looks good and has been improving since 2009, the stock is simply overvalued. A recent fair value analysis suggests that HAL is sitting atop the range calculated ($27-$51 per share). The price of the stock and the compensation you are paid in dividends simply just does not justify owning the stock at these levels. Long-term, as it expands operations the company and the stock should do well from here, probably heading to $60 so long as oil stays above $90 a barrel. Short-term I see oil heading lower and there is also inherent risk in the stock.We need to remember that there is still a ton of legal risk stemming from the Deep water Horizon disaster fallout. The outcome of this issue could impact the stock, although HAL has entered a guilty plea for its association in the event. The fine that Halliburton agreed to pay is the statutory maximum for the charge it faces, destruction of evidence. The company also has agreed to be on probation for three years and make a $55 million contribution to the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, but that payment wasn't a condition of the plea deal. HAL won't face any other criminal charges in connection with the case, though individual employees could still be charged.Why sell short-term? Aside from the risks associated with litigation and the stock being overvalued, I reiterate that oil is going lower. There just isn't a catalyst to drive it higher. I will also add that hurricane season is upon us, which could wreak havoc on HAL (and SLB's) operations, as well as other refiners and oil related stocks. My recommendation for HAL? Sell half of the position at the current price of ~$50.14 and look for re-entry at $45 and $40. The stock is just too expensive at current levels and could easily pull back 10%-15% as oil falls.Disclosure: I am long SLB. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

1742002,27361,2013-10-13T02:30:06-04:00,,"In an article I published last February, I initiated a buy statement with a target price of $44.54 for Halliburton (NYSE:HAL). At that time the stock was trading in the high $30's to low $40's. The target was based on the opinion that increasing global demand for energy and energy services stocks would increase shareholder value. In revisiting my outlook, I believe there is more significant upside from this point and believe the stock is currently undervalued compared with today's stock price of $48.56.Company DescriptionFounded in 1919, Halliburton is one of the world's largest providers of products and services to the energy industry. With more than 75,000 employees, representing 140 nationalities in approximately 80 countries, the company serves the upstream oil and gas industry throughout the lifecycle of the reservoir - from locating hydrocarbons and managing geological data, to drilling and formation evaluation, well construction and completion, and optimizing production through the life of the fieldCatalyst For Halliburton LimitedHalliburton is a global company with a current market cap of $46.29 billion. Even though Halliburton has many revenue streams, increased E&P spending in the deep-water and ultra-deepwater regions around the world will be a key driver for future growth in revenue, earnings and the stock price.Deep-water and ultra-deepwater exploration and drilling have shown a remarkable increase over the past few years. This is due in part to the development of new technologies, which have reduced operational costs and increased safety. These technological advancements have also increased a company's ability find and access more reservoirs that will produce high-quality production wells.Halliburton, which is a leader in the development of new technologies for deep-water drilling, has pushed the envelope with its engineering and technological advancements. Many of these advancements have opened up a greater amount of opportunities in areas such as the Pre-Salt region off the coast of Brazil, the Barents Sea in Norway and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.As more advanced technologies have created opportunities, that in turn has reduced costs and increased safety, it has become economical for companies to pursue deep-water reserves. Major E&P companies such as Exxon (NYSE:XOM), Chevron (NYSE:CVX), BP p.l.c. (NYSE:BP) and Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE:RDS.A) have increased their presence in deep-water regions. Exxon is expecting deep-water projects to account for 8% of its new source production over the next decade. Chevron is expecting deep-water projects to account for 40% of its new source production. BP p.l.c. is banking on the most as it is expecting 52% of its new source production to be from deep-water reserves over the next 10 years, while Shell is more reserved in that it expects 25% of new source production to come from deep-water projects. To support their deep-water growth, these major E&P companies along with others have significantly increased their deep-water Capex spending outlook over the next four years.Over the next four years, It is estimated that global growth in the offshore E&P sector will increase 8 to 10% YOY. Leading the way in E&P spending is Brazil, which is anticipating $250 billion to be spent on the development of its offshore reserves. Second in E&P spending is Norway, which is expecting $220 billion to be spent on the development of the North Sea, Norwegian Sea and the Barents Sea. The region that Schlumberger is focusing on is the U.S. GoM. Within the U.S. GoM, E&P spending is expected to be around $190 billion over the next four years.Chart by Aker SolutionsNorth America and the GoMAs E&P spending in the U.S. GoM is expected to exceed $190 billion by 2017, there are significant opportunities for growth within this region. Due to production increases in the U.S Gulf of Mexico since the Macondo disaster, Halliburtons' revenues in North America have increased significantly. In 2013, Halliburton is expecting to report North American based revenues in the range of $15.5 billion. This is a 75.54% increase over 2010, when it reported North American revenues of $8.83 billion. The increase in revenue is due in large part to increased production in the U.S. GoM. As production levels continue to increase in the U.S. GoM, it is expected that this will further drive the company's revenues. As the chart below indicates production levels through to 2018 are expected to continue to escalate. U.S. GoM production levels are expected to rise from approximately 2.5 mboe/d to 3.75 mboe/d by 2018.chart sourced by (PCF Energy)Revenue & EPS OutlookOffset by the weaker onshore market, Halliburtons' North America revenues lead by the offshore market is expected to increase significantly over they next couple of years. Driven by the Gulf of Mexico, revenues in North America are expected to increase by 26.25% over the next couple of years.With a global increase in deep-water capex spending relating to Halliburtons' businesses, analysts at MSN Money are expecting significant growth over the next couple of years. They are estimating an EPS for FY 2013 at $3.22 while robust growth is expected to continue into 2014 as EPS estimates increase to $4.28.Bloomberg Businessweek supports this forecast as it expects the company's revenues to be around $29.6 billion for FY 2013 and increase to $32.6 billion for FY 2014.ValuationIn the section below, I will use a couple of different methods to find a valuation of the stock price. In this section, I will use the Discounted Cash Flow valuation model and forward P/E ratios to estimate the current value of each share.I believe using the Discounted Cash Flow valuation model for Halliburton to be fair because DCF analysis can help one see where the company's value is coming from and one can generate an opinion based on that.Even though there are variations in calculating this formula, this model is based off of a terminal value of $68.700 billion and a WACC of 7.96%. The terminal value $68.700B is based off of the company trading at 15X EBITDA. Using these valuations, I have concluded Halliburtons' present value to be $58.41 per share.In another method, I will use Halliburtons' forward P/E ratios with estimated earnings to find the value. Currently, Halliburton has a forward P/E of 11.57 and FY 2015 earnings projected at $5.03. These two metrics lead to a target price of $58.19. I believe this to be a fair P/E ratio moving forward. As we look to be heading into a rising interest rate environment, P/E ratios tend to drop during this time.As of October 10th 2013, Halliburtons' stock was trading at $48.56 - Using the Discount Cash Flow Formula, this indicates the stock is trading at a 20.28% discount to today's price. If I calculate a valuation using forward P/E ratios this indicates a valuation of $58.19 or a discount of 19.83%.Analysts Price TargetsStrategyI believe a good strategy is, add a small position here and wait to see if the overall market would bring the price down. Based on the seasonality of the stock, there could be some volatility in the short term. According to a 20-year seasonal average supplied by equity clock, the fall months show weakness when compared to the S&P.ConclusionEven though Halliburton's stock price has had a solid increase so far in 2013, I believe the stock still has upside. With Halliburtons' strong presence in North America coupled with the growing outlook for offshore deep-water development, it is my opinion this is an excellent time to purchase the stock. At current levels using the Discount Cash Flow Formula, I have calculated that Halliburton is currently trading at a 20.06% discount to today's price.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1686312,33161,2013-09-11T05:18:04-04:00,,"Since the end of the financial crisis, Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) has strongly outperformed the overall market. The reasons for this outperformance are multi-faceted. On one hand, HAL has greatly benefited from a pickup in oil and gas lease activity as well as the overall shale boom. On the other hand, HAL has experienced a benefit from the overall economy and systemic factors of the market. In this article, I will express my belief that HAL's dramatic price ascent of over 100% since 2009 represents irrational exuberance on behalf of the market and an excellent opportunity to short.A Mosaic ApproachWhen we approach an investment thesis, we should be considerate of multiple investment disciplines. Technically, this type of investing is known as ""mosaic"" investing. Essentially, this means that one should gather multiple, uncorrelated investment inputs to arrive at a thesis. In this article, I have pursued this method of analysis by relying on several unrelated concepts, all of which provide an opportunity for shorting HAL.A History of ReturnsIn order to fundamentally analyze HAL, I have relied on a metric known as return on assets. Return on assets is the net income of the firm divided by average total assets. Return on assets is a useful figure in that it allows analysts to normalize earnings and performance across an investment cycle and arrive at a consistent figure for comparison. The intuition behind the number is that as you study return on assets, you are studying how efficiently a firm generates profits given its current slate of assets. In the chart below, 5 years of return on assets for Halliburton can be seen:The chart shows a simplified view of the rich economic history of HAL. In the bullet points below, I have explored three key time periods in HAL's history.The table below summarizes the discussion above.As discussed, the basic economic relationship between returns and stock price is a major fundamental signal for investment decision. As a firm betters itself and experiences rising returns, individuals pile into the stock driving prices higher. Conversely, as a firm experiences declining returns, the market prices the stock lower in anticipation of continued poor performance. Halliburton has entered a period of poor performance. It has been performing poorly for the past year and a half, as objectively measured by return on assets. The funny thing, however, is that the market hasn't caught on. This is where opportunity for the nimble lies.It is my belief that HAL is set for a significant correction. I believe that shares are overpriced at current levels and a short position is warranted. The shale boom, while impressive, has slowed. Halliburton's profits have declined. The stock price has risen. These three elements combine to suggest that shorting HAL now is an excellent fundamental play.And Now for Something Completely DifferentAs I mentioned earlier, this article will rely on a variety of sources. Fundamentally, we have demonstrated that HAL is not a good investment at this time and that the odds favor shorting the security. In this section, I will delve into entirely unrelated facets of the market which suggest that shorting HAL is opportune.SeasonalityThe first mosaic variable which suggests that HAL is due for a correction is seasonality. Seasonality is a tool which studies past time periods to determine if a pattern exists in the data. The economic rationale behind seasonality is that during certain times of the year, funds and institutional investors cycle into and out of specific sectors of the economy. HAL is a victim of the seasonality effect in that it has declined in 63% of the last 32 years. This is significant.The table above is important. It means that if you were to blindly short HAL in every single September, you would have earned an 88% return over the past 32 years. In our case, we are not ""blindly shorting"" in that we know that fundamentally, HAL is set for a decline. It also means that the stock is more than likely going to fall during this month.Pattern RecognitionAnother mosaic element which allows us perception into the possible future of HAL's stock price is pattern recognition. Using tools I constructed for a pattern recognition project, I have applied algorithmic methods of analysis to the market. The tool examines previous market action to find similar events over the past 32 years of market data. The significance of this study is that it allows us to find the most similar market environment to today and examine what happened over a subsequent time period.The table above shows a breakdown of what tends to happen over the next two months following a market environment similar to that of today. The results are noteworthy in that they further our fundamental thesis of a Halliburton decline in the future. Not only is seasonality potentially weighing HAL down, but also similar market patterns strongly indicate priced declines.ConclusionFundamental, statistical, and algorithmic methods all indicate that HAL is set for a decline in the near future. In light of the preponderance of evidence against HAL, I believe the most appropriate question is ""Are you ready?""Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1738362,53422,2013-10-10T09:22:50-04:00,,"Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) is a U.S.-based multinational oilfield services company engaging in drilling and exploration services. From managing and analyzing geological data to drilling service and productivity optimization, Halliburton works with oil majors around the world to ensure efficiency of oil production. Halliburton provides essential engineering services to the oil and gas industry (an industry that has historically achieved large excess free cash flows). Halliburton shares have run up 166% over the last five years, quickly recovering from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill disaster in the Gulf of Mexico that affected BP, Transocean (NYSE:RIG) and Halliburton. BP clearly took the majority of the blame as evidenced by massive underperformance over any measurement period in the last five years.Industry trendsA variety of articles on SA are pointing out increasing global energy demand projections. Millions of millions of people in Asia are being lifted out of poverty every year raising demand for transportation means and energy commodities. In Q2 2013, Halliburton presented an insightful graph about projected world oil demand and drilling/completion spending until 2015 (provided below). It is no secret that global oil supplies are quickly running out as Asian consumption accelerates and new supplies coming to market are increasingly rare. A a result, drilling and completion spending is expected to rise as exploration becomes more and more difficult. Energy reservoirs are low lying and harder to reach than ever posting significant engineering challenges. Improving well productivity and increasing well life also require Halliburton's engineering know-how that will increase the relevance of Halliburton's services in the value chain.Segment growth above market growthBased on Spears & Associates' April 2013 Oilfield Market Report Halliburton outperforms the market in terms of segment compound annual growth rates. The five-year Halliburton compound annual growth rates are above market rates in five out of six segments. In both Wireline and Drill Bits Halliburton substantially outperforms the market. An overview of segment market sizes, Halliburton's relative positioning and CAGR comparisons for each segment are provided below:Revenue breakdown and development52% of Halliburton's Q2 2013 revenues originated in North America with encouraging trends in the Gulf of Mexico, 18% in Europe/Africa, 17% in Middle East/Asia and 13% in Latin America. Given America's shale gas boom, I expect the United States to contribute the majority of Halliburton's revenues and earnings in the future. In terms of revenue growth, Halliburton was able to outperform its peers both in North America and internationally.Market valuationDespite share gains over the course of this year Halliburton is still the cheapest oilfield services company in the peer group. At 11.57 leading earnings Halliburton is much cheaper than Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) at 15.15 and marginally more attractive than Baker Hughes (BHI) at 11.87. In terms of EV/EBITDA Halliburton takes the second spot at 8.61 and Baker Hughes ranks cheapest at 7.18. Again, Schlumberger plays in its own league valuation-wise.Income investors clearly should look outside the oil service sector for dividends. Revenues, earnings and cash flows will depend on future exploration activities, which are also influenced by volatile oil prices. Oil service companies are still cyclical in nature. The resulting risk premium embedded in shares means that share gains will come from price appreciation rather than cash flows. Investors looking for dividend plays may look for BP or Total, which have above-peer average yields.A summary table containing the most relevant valuation metrics as well as discounts/premiums to peer group P/E, EV/EBITDA, PEG and dividend yield averages is provided below:ConclusionHalliburton operates in an industry that is confronted with increasingly complex drilling and exploration work. Halliburton has the expertise to implement drilling solutions, increasing well lives, which increases well productivity for oil majors. The company provides an essential service to large-cap oil companies that depend on outsourced engineering know-how to assure much needed oil supplies can come to the market. Halliburton has impressive growth records compared with the market over the last five years and despite a run-up in share price is still fetching a comparatively low valuation. A strong market position in the U.S., above-average segment growth compared to the market and outperforming revenue growth all justify a higher market valuation. I believe premium results also deserve a premium valuation and Halliburton could achieve a forward earnings multiple of 15 in the long-term which would better reflect the strong fundamentals of the company. The current earnings multiple stands at 11.57 giving the shares 30% upside potential. A long-term Buy for investors looking for capital gains rather than dividends.Disclosure: I am long BP.

1744202,25120,2013-10-14T13:55:42-04:00,,"Shares of Halliburton (HAL) received some support last week after analysts at Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) issued an upbeat research note on the prospects for the oilfield service company.I agree with Jefferies that there could be more upside ahead if North American operations start to show some improvements, coupled with continued payouts to shareholders.That being said, I would not initiate a long position at this moment. After seeing significant momentum already this year, I don't think the risk-reward is too compelling at the moment.Jefferies Is PositiveAnalyst Brad Handler raised his price target for Halliburton from $54 to $58, which suggests there is some 15% upside from current levels.Handler sees Halliburton well positioned to benefit from US upstream spending growth in 2014. The firm can furthermore realize efficiencies growing in non-NAM while it can return cash to shareholders, according to Handler.On the back of these developments, Handler is raising his earnings per share estimate for 2014's earnings from $4.30 per share to $4.55 per share.ValuationHalliburton ended its second quarter with $1.41 billion in cash and equivalents. Total debt stood at $4.82 billion, for a net debt position of around $3.41 billion.Revenues for the first six months of the year came in at $14.3 billion, up 1.3% on the year before. Net earnings more than halved to $661 million as the company took a $1.00 billion charge related to the Macando incident. Adjusted for this, operating earnings came in around $1.3 billion.At this pace, annual revenues could come in a round $29 billion, as annual earnings are seen around $3 billion.Trading around $50 per share, the market values Halliburton at $46 billion. This values operating assets of the firm at roughly 1.6 times annual revenues and 15 times annual earnings.Halliburton currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.12 per share, for an annual dividend yield of 1.0%.Some Historical PerspectiveInvestors in Halliburton have seen ups and downs over the past decade, but all of this was net positive. Shares rose from $15 in 2004 to $50 in 2008, to end that year around $15 per share again.Shares did recover to levels in their fifties in 2011, to fall back to $25 in 2012. Shares have doubled again in the meantime, exchanging hands at $50 per share.Between 2009 and 2012, Halliburton has nearly doubled its annual revenues to $28.5 billion. Net earnings rose by 130% in the meantime to $2.6 billion.Investment ThesisShares of Halliburton have already seen a lot of upside this year, trading with year to date gains of 46% at the moment.Following the second quarter earnings, Halliburton announced a $3.3 billion tender offer to repurchase 68.0 million shares at $48.50 per share back in August, effectively reducing the outstanding shares base by some 7.4%. This was followed by the good news that the investigation regarding the Deepwater Horizon disaster has been closed, prompting Halliburton to pay a fine of merely $200,000.The US, remains the most important business for Halliburton, making up roughly 50% of total revenues and two-thirds of operating profits. Yet, the business saw a 8% fall in second quarter revenues compared to a year earlier. Fortunately all other geographic areas stepped up as the company saw solid growth in Latin America, Europe & the Middle-East, as well as Asia.While completion and production revenues fell by 3.3% to $8.5 billion in the second quarter, revenues at the drilling and evaluation business rose by 8.9% to $5.8 billion. While rig productivity is still under pressure in North America, revenues from servicing these continued more complex rigs becomes more and more lucrative.Back in October of last year, I last took a look at Halliburton's prospects. I concluded that Halliburton and its competitors were suffering from overcapacity in the natural gas market, causing pressure on drilling activity at the time. As raw material costs were on the rise, Halliburton's earnings were getting squeezed from two sides.I concluded that Halliburton was my favorite oil and gas supplier. At the time the valuation multiples looked fair on both absolute and relative terms, while Halliburton has a relative modest net debt position at the time.After the solid returns so far this year, I am a bit more cautious. The continued growth in international operations and shareholder friendly strategies leave a bit more potential when the so important North American operations pick up steam again. As such the long term prospects continue to look good.I suspects that shares could to re-test their all time highs around $57 per share in 2011, if North American operations show some improvements. This should be supported by Halliburton continuing to return cash to its shareholders at an aggressive pace, mainly through share buybacks.Unlike Jefferies, I would be a bit more cautious. I see potential upside as well, but don't think the upside is compelling enough for me to initiate a long position at these levels, after seeing significant momentum in recent times.I remain on the sidelines.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1555532,23479,2013-07-18T12:14:13-04:00,,"Halliburton (NYSE:HAL), the world's second-largest oil field services company, is expected to report its second-quarter earnings on July 22. Although the firm's performance over the last few quarters has been hit by a weak North American land drilling market, its international and U.S. offshore operations have fared reasonably well. In Q1, revenues remained flat year over year at around $7 billion, while income from continuing operations (excluding one-time items) fell by around 24%.While Halliburton's management has indicated that a recovery in North America could be imminent given its improving efficiencies and cost control, some recent cues from the broader U.S. drilling market haven't been so encouraging. Gas-directed drilling in the U.S. fell to an 18-year low this quarter, and the pressure pumping market also continues to be oversupplied. Here's a quick rundown on what to expect when the company releases earnings next Monday.Fracking Market Expected to Remain Dull, Pricing Could Continue to Be ToughFracking Market Will Remain Difficult, but Lower Costs Will Help: Among the oilfield services companies we cover, Halliburton has the greatest exposure to the North American market (56% of its 2012 revenues came from the region). The firm also has a much greater exposure to the natural gas market since it is the world's largest provider of hydraulic fracturing and pressure pumping services. Over 40% of its revenues came from this product line last year. The market for hydraulic fracturing services in the U.S. has been hit by lower gas drilling and an excess of pressure pumping capacity. This caused prices to decline by around 15% last year alone, and we believe that this quarter could continue to be challenging, given the declining trend in the U.S. natural gas rig count.While smaller fracking players like Nabors Industries (NYSE:NBR) have already warned that their Q2 results would be hit by the oversupplied market, we believe that Halliburton could be relatively better off due to its advanced fracking technology and economies of scale. Additionally, the firm could also benefit from lower costs for guar gum (a key raw material used in the fracking process), an increased adoption of pad drilling, and a growing number of 24-hour operations.New Technologies and Increasing Drilling in the Gulf of Mexico Will Aid U.S. Offshore: Drilling activity in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico has been on the uptrend over the past year, with the rig count in the region recently hitting a four-year high of around 57. The increasing offshore activity is likely to have a positive impact on the firm's results. Additionally, since many rigs in the region are moving from drilling toward completion cycles, it should help Halliburton's completions and production business. Halliburton has also been deploying new and more differentiated technologies in the Gulf, which should help to improve its competitive advantage. For example, the company recently deployed an enhanced single-trip multi-zone stimulation for some of its customers in the Gulf. This stimulation technology potentially saves operators weeks of rig time and should help to improve the economics of ultra-deepwater wells.International Operations: Unconventionals in the SpotlightHalliburton's international business performed relatively well in Q1, thanks to increasing sales for its drilling and evaluation product line as well as growing demand from Asia and the Middle East. Revenues and operating income during the quarter grew by around 21% year over year. While we largely expect the international operations to continue to perform well, we will be watching the company's progress in the global unconventional plays space.Halliburton is recognized as the market leader in services for unconventional plays in North America. The international market for unconventional plays on the other hand is still largely untapped and provides a promising growth opportunity for the company. Over the last year, the firm expanded its service footprint, catering to some of the first commercial unconventional wells in Australia and China, and has also stepped up unconventional plays business in markets like Saudi Arabia, Mexico, and Argentina.While we will be watching Halliburton's progress in continuing this expansion, we do not expect the progress to be rapid since most countries are only drilling exploratory wells and full-scale commercial production could still be several years away. However, we believe that it is important that the company continues to bag more early stage contracts in order to understand the markets and geologies, and also to build up relationships that should help it scale up over the long run.Disclosure: No positions."
1664182,40351,2013-08-29T10:36:17-04:00,,"Mexico is gearing up for some significant oil reforms in an effort to revive its economy in general and its oil and gas sector in particular. The country's energy sector has been dominated by Petróleos Mexicanos, also known as Pemex. With the new reforms, one of the world's most restrictive energy markets could open its doors to international energy firms. The oilfield services firms Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) and Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) could be the first to capitalize on this development. The two were already eyeing more than $8 billion worth of large integrated projects in Mexico. Analysts believe that now is the time to buy Schlumberger and Halliburton on these new developments. The new price targets on these firms represent a 30% upside.Declining OutputThe state-owned energy behemoth Pemex has been operating as a monopoly for seven decades. The business has worked under service contracts with foreign firms, as opposed to profit-sharing contracts. The absence of profit or production sharing contracts has kept most foreign energy firms at bay. The country's energy sector has suffered with falling levels of output due to a lack of investment. In the last ten years, Pemex increased its annual investment by five-fold to $20 billion, but its production fell from 3.59 million barrels per day in 2002 to 2.93 million barrels per day in 2012.The oil reforms could bring an energy revival to the country which holds 15 billion barrels of oil (as much as Kuwait) and could be home to 27 billion barrels of deep-sea crude reserves. Besides conventional crude, Mexico also has the eighth largest reserve of shale oil and sixth largest shale gas resources. However, Pemex doesn't have the necessary skills to develop the technically challenging deep-water and unconventional reserves. The country needs U.S. oil and oilfield services firms to develop its resources.Unlike Iraq and Malaysia, Mexico will not offer production sharing contracts, but I believe that even the profit sharing contracts would be a crucial step in the right direction.Mexican ETFMexico's capital markets, which are represented in the iShares MSCI Mexico ETF (NYSEARCA:EWW), reacted negatively to the news. The $2.3 billion ETF has fallen by 5.4% in August. However, the ETF is not a fair indicator of one of the largest non-OPEC oil producing countries. This is because firstly Pemex is not represented in the fund and secondly the ETF is dominated by Consumer Staples and Telecommunication sectors.So far this year, the ETF has recorded net inflows of $647.8 million, including inflows of $108.23 million in last four weeks. The iShares MSCI Mexico ETF is one of the few emerging market funds out there that could see an adverse impact due to the Federal Reserve's tapering expected to begin in September.Opportunity for Oilfield Service IndustryAnalysts believe that Mexico might only open its doors to the big boys of the industry. While deep-sea experts such as Chevron (NYSE:CVX) and Statoil (STO) would be looking for business opportunities in Mexico, the oilfield services firms Schlumberger and Halliburton could be some of the biggest and earliest beneficiaries of the oil reforms. These companies would lay out the groundwork for E&P firms and will not be concerned about the absence of production sharing contracts. Merrill Lynch believes that investors should consider buying the oilfield services stocks that could capitalize on the Mexican oil reforms.Moreover, the heads of both of these companies (Schlumberger and Halliburton) were already eyeing other opportunities in Mexico. The country has a pipeline of large integrated projects worth $8 billion to $10 billion. Mexico could start awarding these projects in the current year through a series of production incentive bids.Merrill Lynch has a $106 price target on Schlumberger which shows nearly a 30% upside from its current price levels. Schlumberger was already targeting ""double digit"" growth due to expected increase in E&P expenditures, particularly in Saudi Arabia, Iraq, China and Australia. With the developments in Mexico, Schlumberger could get more opportunities.Meanwhile, Halliburton has received a 'conviction buy' from Goldman Sachs with a price target of $63. This also indicates a 30% upside from the current price levels. While Halliburton's previous results were above expectations, its performance in Latin America was not impressive due to shrinking margins. Halliburton's operating income in the region dropped by 7.3% sequentially and 26.8% year-over-year to $101 million in 2Q-2013. This was due to a drop in drilling and lower vessel activity. However, Halliburton is expecting improvements in Latin America the second half of the year which will be driven by its operations in Mexico (with the exception of North Mexico).Performance SummaryIn the last three months, the shares of both of these companies have risen by 8.7% (Schlumberger) and 11.8% (Halliburton), easily outperforming the S&P 500-ETF (NYSEARCA:SPY) which is down 1.2% in the same period. Schlumberger is trading 17.38 times its trailing earnings, which is above the industry's average of 16.22 times. However, Schlumberger is the market leader and generates a healthy return on equity of 17.9%, more than the industry's average of 15%. On the other hand, Halliburton is relatively expensive since it is trading 24.5 times its trailing earnings and generates a lower return on equity of 12.2%.ConclusionWith regard to oil reforms, investors should note that this is not a short-term process. The oil field services firms might not get anything from Mexico in the next few months. The E&P companies are awaiting further details on the reforms. The secondary laws related to the structure of contracts and taxation policies are expected to be released in late 2013, at best. Schlumberger itself was not looking at a lot of growth from Mexico in the coming months. However, the oilfield services companies have bright long-term prospects in Mexico due to the oil reforms and the pipeline of large integrated projects.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1691582,24491,2013-09-12T17:43:37-04:00,,"Investing is neither completely art, nor completely science. A good investor will make a ton of mistakes, but have more winners than losers. Nobody will bat 1.000 (one thousand) in baseball, just like nobody will get everything right in investing. The solution in the investment world: a process that focuses on a margin of safety and range of valuation outcomes. Let's dig into this for Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) case.Our Report on HalliburtonInvestment ConsiderationsInvestment Highlights• Halliburton earns a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT, the highest possible mark on our scale.The firm has been generating economic value forshareholders for the past few years, a track record we view very positively. Return on invested capital (excluding goodwill) has averaged 18.9% during the past three years.• Halliburton is a provider of services and products to the energy industry related to the exploration, development, and production of oil and natural gas.• Halliburton's cash flow generation and financial leverage aren't much to speak of. The firm's free cash flow margin has averaged about 2.6% during the past three years, lower than the mid-single-digit range we'd expect for cash cows. However, the firm's cash flow should be sufficient to handle its low financial leverage.• Although we think there may be a better time to dabble in the firm's shares based on our DCF process, the firm's stock has outperformed the market benchmark during the past quarter, indicating increased investor interest in the company.• The firm experienced a revenue CAGR of about 10.7% during the past 3 years. We expect its revenue growth to be below that of its peer median during the next five years.Business QualityEconomic Profit AnalysisThe best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital (ROIC) with its weighted average cost of capital (OTC:WACC). The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. Halliburton's 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 18.9%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 10.1%. As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT. In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate.Cash Flow AnalysisFirms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. Halliburton's free cash flow margin has averaged about 2.6% during the past 3 years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generation is relatively MEDIUM. The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. For more information on the differences between these two measures, please visit our website at Valuentum.com. At Halliburton, cash flow from operations increased about 59% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures expanded about 58% over the same time period.Valuation AnalysisOur discounted cash flow model indicates that Halliburton's shares are worth between $27-$51 each. Why such a large range in some cases? Click here. The margin of safety around our fair value estimate is driven by the firm's MEDIUM ValueRisk™ rating, which is derived from the historical volatility of key valuation drivers. The estimated fair value of $39 per share represents a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 12 times last year's earnings and an implied EV/EBITDA multiple of about 6.3 times last year's EBITDA. Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 6.9% during the next five years, a pace that is lower than the firm's 3-year historical compound annual growth rate of 10.7%. Our model reflects a 5- year projected average operating margin of 15.6%, which is below Halliburton's trailing 3-year average. Beyond year 5, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 3.3% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For Halliburton, we use a 10.1% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows.Margin of Safety AnalysisOur discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $39 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future was known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values. Our ValueRisk™ rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock. In the graph below, we show this probable range of fair values for Halliburton. We think the firm is attractive below $27 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $51 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion.Future Path of Fair ValueWe estimate Halliburton's fair value at this point in time to be about $39 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart below compares the firm's current share price with the path of Halliburton's expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate. The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year 3 represents our best estimate of the value of the firm's shares three years hence. This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the firm's future cash flow potential change. The expected fair value of $51 per share in Year 3 represents our existing fair value per share of $39 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.Pro Forma Financial StatementsDisclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1582872,41391,2013-07-30T08:29:21-04:00,,"Halliburton's criminal plea agreementHalliburton Co. (NYSE:HAL) has entered into a criminal plea agreement with the Department of Justice regarding the 2010 Deepwater oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, which killed 11 people and deposited nearly 5 million barrels of oil offshore causing extensive environmental damage. The company had earlier sworn by its innocence but has now conceded that employees tampered with computer simulations that could damage the company's case. Investors did not seem to be bothered by the admission and the stock ended up on the announcement of a share buyback worth $3.3 billion. Under the agreement, Halliburton will pay $200,000, which is the maximum fine for a misdemeanor and $55 million to the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, but the latter payment could be tax deductible because it will be made to a nonprofit organization. The employee who directed the evidence tampering will remain anonymous and continue to work for the company. Justice will not pursue any charges other than the misdemeanor in exchange for cooperation. The fine of $200,000 is equivalent to a few minutes' revenue for the company and minuscule compared to what TransOcean (NYSE:RIG) and BP (NYSE:BP) had to pay. Halliburton can consider itself extremely fortunate to get away with so little.The consequences of the agreementThe agreement does not provide the company with any protection from the pending decision by a Federal judge on how much the companies involved in the spill should pay as damages in the civil cases involved. How much each company will pay will be determined by the amount of blame that the judge chooses to assign. Halliburton can take a chance on getting a favorable ruling or it can avoid the risk and uncertainty by settling with the team of attorneys representing the many people and businesses claiming damages because of the spill. In fact, the criminal plea agreement will put Halliburton under pressure to complete the settlement before the ruling is issued.Second quarter 2013 resultsDeclines in North American revenues caused second-quarter profits to decline by 8% but growth internationally helped the company to come out ahead of the expectations on Wall Street. The company helps energy producers to produce oil and natural gas offshore and on land. In the last few quarters, domestic oil drilling in the United States has had the highest activity levels in more than 20 years, but an oversupply of natural gas has hit the company's gas business. Growth has slowed down but Halliburton hopes that higher natural gas prices will translate into more business. Net income for the quarter was $679 million, which translates into an EPS of $0.73 compared with the analysts' expectations of $0.72 per share. In the same period of the previous year, the figures were $737 million and $0.79 per share. Revenues at $7.32 billion were also ahead of analysts' estimates and represents growth of 1% compared to $7.23 billion in the previous year period. The increase in revenues was primarily due to growth in Asia.Revenues for the Completion and Production business segment were $4.36 billion a year-over-year decrease of 2.2%. However, the figure was 6.4% higher than the preceding quarter because of increased onshore activity in the U.S. and internationally. Operating income for the segment was $732 million, down 19.9% year-over-year, with North American profits plunging 25.2%. Revenues from another important segment, Drilling & Evaluation, were 6.5% higher than the second-quarter of 2012 level and also 2.8% higher than the preceding quarter at $2.95 billion as a result of increased activity in the eastern hemisphere. Income increased by 5.6% year-over-year and 2% over the preceding quarter.Hydraulic fracturing or fracking, which is a major business for the company and involves using chemicals and water under high pressure to crack rock formations and extract hydrocarbons, has been criticized by environmentalists on the ground that it affects ground water. The company has attempted to defuse criticism by entering into a deal with Nuverra Environmental Solutions Inc. for the recycling of waste water. Preliminary results from a Federal study, which is the first objective look at the effect of fracking chemicals, found no evidence that these chemicals had contaminated drinking water aquifers at a site in Pennsylvania.The bottom lineHalliburton can consider itself extremely lucky to get away so lightly in the settlement with the Justice Department even though it will still have to reckon with the civil proceedings. It is presently quoting at just under $46 compared to the mean target price of analysts of $54.24 and the median target price of $54.00. This means that there is a possible upside of almost 20% with little downside. HAL is definitely worth additional consideration in the Oil and Gas services sector.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1669942,23468,2013-09-03T12:54:30-04:00,,"Isn't only a great expected investment return on Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) enough? NO.Every investment needs a solid understanding of its economic possibilities, and a thorough analysis of its fundamentals can provide this. As a CFA charterholder from the early days of the CFA Institute's organization (charter 953, now there are over 100,000) I am keenly aware of this prerequisite.But investment performance is almost always measured by the progress of the investor's wealth, both as to its growth rate and its irregularity. They come about as a result of the market's appraisal of what seems to be an appropriate price, at each point in time, for every investment. That makes an analysis, which only studies the fundamentals disturbingly incomplete, since annual price fluctuations typically are several times each investment's fundamental growth rate.Yet much of what passes for investment guidance relies on the most cursory assertions of the relationship of past years' prices to what corporate management chooses to report (blessed by auditors that they hire) as what they want the public to believe might have influenced those earlier prices. Is this being cynical? No, it is just a realistic recognition of human behavior, given the current structure of legal motivations.Instead, we believe that a sound fundamental analysis needs to be made complete by a contemporary evaluation of what prices realistically may be expected. Expected not only from the corporate fundamentals, but also in light of the attitudes of observers willing to involve themselves (and their capital) in the market's essential process of ""price discovery.""To that end we observe the behavior of market participants who most likely have developed a thorough understanding of each investment's fundamentals and now must decide how they are likely to be translated in terms of price. Fear of losing capital in the participation, and greed to enlarge their capital by the same means, defines a window of price possibilities. The comparative process is disciplined by the fact that many alternatives exist that must meet the same test of ""what are the realistic future price possibilities here?""Our pursuit of these price expectations is by means of examining how market-makers [MMs] behave in the conduct of their highly-rewarding role. There may be other ways to get qualified forecasts, but for us, the MMs' estimates have extensive real-life ex-ante results demonstrating their abilities.The current case study of HalliburtonOn another day some other stock will push HAL off its current ""top-dog"" (by our selection preferences) energy investment candidate position. But here is how it is seen now:To explain the table's column heads: Sell targets are the % rise from Price Now to top of the forecast range. Drawdowns average the worst end-of-day price comparison with forecast day price during each position holding, among all similar Range Index experiences in the sample. The Range Index measures that % of the forecast range lying below the current price. Win Odds are the % of forecasts reaching targets, plus those that don't but, 3 months later, are at a higher price than at time of forecast. Payoffs are the average % price changes from all similar prior forecasts. Market Days Held reflects early closeouts of achieved sell targets. Annual rates recognize 252-market-day years. Sample size counts number of all forecast days available in the past 5 years, and the number of days therein with similar Range Indexes.These fourteen stocks are screened out of more than ten times as many energy industry stocks followed on a daily basis. Requirements are that we have a sufficient number of histories of forecasts similar to today's, where a standard time-efficient strategy has produced profits in at least 6 out of 8 commitments. The intent is to identify those securities where MMs have demonstrated productive insights into likely future price behavior.The averages of their prior performances under that standard investment management strategy is summarized below the company-by-company detail lines.There is no guarantee that future prices will be similar to the past, but humans often formulate habits that are repetitive where surroundings seem familiar, and it is humans that move market prices.For perspective four other summary lines indicate parallel dimensions on the day, a) for the best of the oilfield services sub-group, b) the entire oilfield services sub-group, c) the entire energy producing sector, and d) the whole measurable population of over 2,000 stocks, ETFs, REITs, and indexes with forecasts every day. Over 3,000 issues examined on this particular day exclude many where sufficient information to generate forecasts may be lacking.In general, the better energy sector stocks have produced significantly higher annual rates of return than the broad population, but the better oil service candidates (*) have done even more. In fact, the energy sector at large now appears less productive than the overall forecast population, in terms of prior annual rates of return from present-day forecast balances between upside and downside prospects.Now, how about Halliburton?This stock has been an institutional favorite for decades, partly because it has cultured a disciplined and effective managerial contingent. In addition to managing the USA's national political affairs from a #2 position for a few critical years, HAL management has maintained a dominant position in a highly competitive, technologically evolving field that is an essential and major part of the economies of every important nation on earth.Advances in extractive technology reinforce its competitive position and enhance its appeal to the 900+ institutions and funds holding 82% of its outstanding stock and float. The active and liquid market for its stock sees more than 5% turnover per week involving some $5 billion in share values.(used with permission)Please note that this is not a typical high-low-close chart looking back in time at past prices. Instead it is a log of forward-looking price range forecasts, represented by the vertical lines, made live in real time when HAL's contemporary price was at the heavy dot in the forecast range. The advances in MM forecasts, keeping pace with its market price quotes are a sign of its continuing strength.What makes the MM forecasts viable is that all of the available fundamental information on HAL, and its competitors, has been gathered by the world-wide, 24x7x365 information-capturing systems of the market makers, examined by their extensive research staffs, and passed on to the volume trading desks where block traders and proprietary traders monitor the minute by minute ""order flow"" from their big-money hedge fund, mutual fund, and other institutional clients.This all goes into the judgments of the MM traders and is reflected in their self-protective actions, hedging their firm's capital that often must be put at risk to competitively ""fill"" client trade orders.Summary & conclusion on HAL:Even though the forecasts see as much price fluctuation downwards as up (-8% vs. +8%), its past history of maximum price drawdowns of -6% make the stock a strong defensive investment candidate. At a time when considerable value questions are present in markets at large, and demonstrated prior price performances of hundreds, even thousands of stocks at times of outlooks like today's are well below recent performances, HAL's 91 out of each 100 in profitable stock price results, and target achievements in 5-6 week holding periods that compound to triple-digit annual rates of gain, are compellingly competitive in comparison with most equity investment alternatives.Additional Disclosure: The author has an investment interest in the website blockdesk.com which, while not yet open to the public, is in conversion from being a delivery medium of information to institutional investors to a new life of providing similar help to do-it-yourself investors.

Indeed, Halliburton Co (NYSE:HAL) offers investors a well-managed business, possessing a good balance sheet and strong forward growth prospects all at an historical discount. This stock is one of my favorite equity investments.A recent announcement concerning a setback in the company's Latin America region, and the continued overhang in conjunction with the BP - Macondo oil spill settlement appear to have held the shares back, thereby offering patient investors a potential opportunity to buy into an undervalued stock with solid growth upside.In this article, we will review Halliburton fundamentals, the corporate storyline, discuss an investment thesis, and perform a valuation exercise.Halliburton Co -- Six-Month Price, Volume and MAscourtesy of bigcharts.comHalliburton Co is an oilfield services company. The Company is provider of services and products to the energy industry related to the exploration, development, and production of oil and natural gas. It serves national and independent oil / natural gas companies worldwide.The FundamentalsBalance SheetI like to begin an analysis with the balance sheet. I view this financial statement as the foundation of a corporation. In this respect, Halliburton is built upon a bedrock footing.Return-on-equity and ROACE (return-on-average capital employed) figures are strong. These two measures are focused upon and communicated to investors by HAL management. Please find a comparison of Halliburton ROACE versus industry peers below. The slide was presented at the UBS Global Oil and Gas Conference on May 21:In addition, I track two other measures that afford me a glimpse into the financial situation of this company.Income StatementWhen reviewing the income statement, I favor companies that are showing solid top and bottom line growth trends, expanding margins, and good expense management. HAL appears to be doing well on all these counts.Cash FlowWhat's the Storyline and Investment Thesis?My analysis begins with the financial statements, but really hinges on a storyline coupled with a thesis. Let's review these components briefly.StorylineHalliburton was hit hard during the 2008-09 economic downturn. Since that time, the company has rallied in the face of tough industry dynamics.The strategic focus has concentrated upon three growth drivers: the deepwater, unconventional oil / gas plays, and mature fields. Here's another slide from the recent UBS conference highlighting this emphasis:Specifically for 2013, management stated the following business goals and objectives:Management has voiced their intent to defend the North American business. This defense has caused considerable operational disruption: many clients were re-deploying rigs from less profitable dry gas to liquids sites. Halliburton hung tight with them, relocating equipment alongside their customers, thereby compromising margins but building business relationships. In addition, the company took a hit in early 2012 by securing large quantities of guar gum in the face of a global industry shortage. HAL management paid top dollar for the material before the market corrected itself, leaving them with a load of the substance to work off. Once again, the objective was to stick by and serve the client, knocking back short-term margins for longer-term business.Of course, numerous risks to the strategy and objectives should be noted.These include working off the expensive guar gum purchased last year; expected to be complete by mid-year 2013. The liability for the BP - Macondo oil spill has been a significant overhang, despite the company insisting that its contracts with BP indemnified them. Nevertheless, the company took a $1 billion charge against first quarter earnings to settle claims. Most recently, Halliburton management announced that the Mexican government had effectively halted many of its energy development projects, stalling a chunk of the company's business book.Investment ThesisI have long advocated Halliburton stock, and written several articles about the company, that last of which was in September 2012. However, I find the investment thesis is still largely intact even after a decent run-up in price.My long view indicates the company remains well-managed, setting itself up for a multi-year growth spurt, and is significantly undervalued. The recent U.S. phenomenon of becoming the potential world leader in tight oil and gas production plays right into HAL business strengths. This is why I believe management has fought to defend its leadership in North American land-based business so fiercely. The significant improvement to the company's international business fortunes has just added luster to the story.Finally, the recent announcement that PEMEX (Mexico) plans to defer 2013 projects has resulted in the stock price taking a step back.I offer this may ultimately be a near-term catalyst.Here's a transcript remark from Mark McCollum, Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer; speaking at the May 21, 2013 UBS Global Oil and Gas Conference:While the news is certainly not good, I take note that Mr. McCollum indicates the work has likely not been cancelled, but deferred until 2014. Nonetheless, the market immediately discounted the news via the stock price: dropping it 5.6 percent in three days. Some may view this as a short-term opportunity to start or add to a position.ValuationI noted earlier that I believe the stock is undervalued. I base this view upon historical valuation multiples of earnings and cash flow. I've utilized several F.A.S.T. Graphs below to illustrate these points.First, I offer a twelve year chart of Halliburton's price and earnings below.courtesy of fastgraphs.comOne can see that, over time, the price (black line) tends to follow the normalized P/E multiple line and expected P/E multiple lines (the blue and orange lines). If the price strays too far from the lines, it always returns to it. Currently, the price is below the historical earnings multiple; thereby offering a potential undervalued situation. If the stock price reached the blue line, it would mean a 24 percent increase.Let's dig a little deeper.Cash is king. How does HAL stock look when comparing its price with normalized FFO (Funds from Operations)? FFO is a close relative of Operating Cash Flow.courtesy of fastgraphs.comWow. Here the undervaluation is even more pronounced. The twelve year historical Price / FFO multiple has been 12.7x. The current ratio is 8.2x. I can find little in the investment thesis above to warrant such a deviation from the norm. A ""reversion to the mean"" appears inevitable at some point in the future. A return to the normalized ""blue line"" represents a 72 percent share price increase.Finally, let's look at Street projected EPS:courtesy of fastgraphs.comThe 33 Wall Street analysts that cover Halliburton expect the company to grow earnings by 20 percent a year over the next five years. This includes a 6 percent bump this year, followed by a 25 percent uplift in 2014. I suggest that the lower growth anticipated this year, and the higher growth forecast in 2014 reflect, at least in part, the PEMEX business that management indicated would be deferred until after January of next year. As a long-term investor, it is of little consequence for me to wait until that work washes back to the company.Finally, peer group analysis indicates the Energy Services industry, as a whole, is undervalued. When reviewing Schlumberger, Baker Hughes (BHI) and National Oilwell Varco (NYSE:NOV), one will find similar disconnects between price and historical valuation multiples.However, Halliburton Company versus peers couples a bigger potential gap in current price versus historic multiples, with a higher forecast five-year EPS growth rate.Reinforcing the valuation metrics, I also compared a few key Halliburton vs. Schlumberger financial measures. I selected SLB for comparison purposes as the company has often been considered the ""best-of-breed"" energy service company. Here's a quick comp table:The purpose of this data is not to refute that Schlumberger isn't a best-of-breed corporation. No, I am simply noting that Halliburton stacks up quite favorably; yet may offer better capital appreciation prospects.Indeed, while any of the aforementioned energy service stocks appear to be reasonable investments, I believe HAL offers better long-term upside and better growth prospects. I contend this is a result of undue multiple compression from the Macondo oil spill liability overhang, short-term operational decisions that have reinforced the long-term business plan, and the recent Mexico / PEMEX development.ConclusionHalliburton Co affords several compelling reasons for investment:My preference would be to purchase shares on an additional pullback in conjunction with an overall market consolidation. I like to target a five to ten percent retracement from a high before pulling the trigger; this would mean about $41. However, one may determine the most recent share drop offers a reasonable point to perhaps begin a new position; adding to it upon further price weakness.Please perform your own careful due diligence before investing any money. Good luck with all your 2013 investments.Disclosure: I am long HAL. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

1674012,24236,2013-09-05T08:31:00-04:00,,"Executive SummaryHalliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) is up 40% year-to-date. In my article published in February of 2013, I suggested buying the stock. The stock was trading for $40.72 at the time. Since, the stock is up over 20%. In the article, I stated the stock was on the cusp of a secular growth cycle impelled by the proliferation of fracking across the globe. The fact of the matter is this is just the beginning of the run for Halliburton. In the following sections I will perform an analysis of the stock and lay out my bull case for the company going forward. See chart below provided by Finviz.com.Recent Earnings Results Quick RecapOn 7/22/2013, Halliburton reported second quarter 2013 earnings of $0.73 per share. This result was in-line with the consensus of the 32 analysts following the company and missed last year's second quarter results by 8.75%. The next tentative earnings announcement is expected on 10/21/2013.Market ComparisonHalliburton looks great in comparison to the industry, sector and the S&P 500. The two major bright spots are Halliburton's forward P/E ratio and its PEG ratio. Halliburton's forward P/E ratio is 13 vs. the industry average of 16 and the S&P 500 average of 17.6. Halliburton is essentially trading at a 30% discount according to P/E comparisons. Halliburton's PEG ratio is 1.2. A company with a PEG ratio of around 1 or less is considered to be highly undervalued. Furthermore, Halliburton's PEG ratio is substantially less than its peers or the S&P 500.Fundamental Peer ComparisonPlease review the following analysis of key fundamentals regarding Halliburton vs. its peers and industry averages. The tables were provided by Scottrade.ProfitabilityHalliburton is underperforming the industry and its peers with regard to the net profit margin. With gross margins less than its peers and far below the industry average, Halliburton needs to gain traction and improve profit margins by cutting costs and focusing on the most profitable endeavors. The company is profitable which is good.ValuationHalliburton looks good when it comes to valuation. The price to tangible book comparison has Halliburton trading substantially lower than its peers and on par with the industry average. The company is trading for 3.3 times tangible book value while its peers are trading for 4.9 and the industry average is 3.0.GrowthHalliburton's five-year sales growth outshines its peers and the industry. Nevertheless, EPS growth over the last two months has been abysmal. The company is one of the few in the oil and gas sector that pays a dividend with a current yield of 1.04%.Financial StrengthThe company's long-term debt to equity ratio is on par with its peers and the industry average. The payout ratio appears sustainable. The company is in good shape financially.Management EffectivenessManagement has been effectively allocating resources. The positive ROI, ROE and ROA statistics prove that out. Nonetheless, there is always room for improvement. Halliburton is on par with its peers and the industry average currently.Positive CatalystsNorth American FrackingNorth America is the dominant source of revenue for Halliburton. With the proliferation of new technologies and techniques a vast new market has opened up for Halliburton. Halliburton practically invented fracking. Everyone always knew North America had an inordinate amount of oil and gas locked within shale rock formations for years but no one knew how to extract it profitably. Halliburton was one of the companies on the cutting edge of newly developed fracking techniques that made the extraction feasible. There is plenty of work left to be done. Please review the map below provided by PacWest Consulting partners.Global GrowthHalliburton has a strong market position in North America but is a global player in the oil and gas industry. In 2007, Halliburton moved its corporate headquarters from Houston to Dubai. This was a smart move. Even though North America has an extraordinary amount of growth in front of it related to oil and gas drilling, the rest of the world is starting to catch up. Halliburton is in a great position to take advantage of this growth. With the experience and knowledge it has gained over the last few years in North America, I am sure its services will be in high demand across the globe for years to come. Furthermore, these new projects should offer higher profit margins as well. The company has had time to work through many of the inefficiencies in the processes at this point.Highly DiversifiedHalliburton does it all. The company has a myriad of products and services for oil and gas companies. The company has expertise in both on and off shore drilling all over the world. Not many companies can say this.Downside RisksReduced Drilling ActivityIf drilling activity wanes across the board this will be bad news for Halliburton. This scenario seems unlikely but it is a possibility. If global growth falls into recession, demand for oil and gas will plummet. This causes exploration companies to pull back on drilling which has a direct effect on Halliburton's bottom line.Political RiskHydraulic fracturing or fracking as it is more commonly known has its detractors. There is still a debate going on in the U.S. and across the globe as to whether fracking is bad for the environment. Many people believe it contaminates ground water. It seems as though the science is on the side of the oil and gas industry at this point, nevertheless, you never know what can happen when politicians get involved. This risk is still evolving.ConclusionHalliburton's profit streams are stable and growing. The company is one of the oldest and most trusted oil service companies in the business. Halliburton practically invented fracking. With the proliferation of new unconventional shale plays being found around the world, you can bet your bottom dollar Halliburton will be extremely busy for the next several years. Several important fundamentals prove this out. For instance, revenue growth is up 3.5% year-over-year. Furthermore, the gross margin, net margin and return on equity are up 14.6%, 8.8% and 12.7% over the last four quarters, respectively. With the turmoil in the Middle East seemingly getting worse, I don't see a slowdown in drilling or a price drop in oil and gas on the horizon. All these factors taken as a whole paint a pretty picture for Halliburton's future earnings potential. The stock is a buy here. If you chose to start a position I would layer in over time to reduce risk.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1371671,23479,2013-04-25T13:52:05-04:00,,"Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) published its Q1 2013 earnings on Monday, reporting a relatively encouraging set of numbers. While the results continued to be weighed down by weak completion and production activity in North America, a better international performance and improved operational efficiencies partly helped to bolster results. Quarterly revenues remained almost flat year-over year at around $7 billion while income from continuing operations excluding one-time charges was around $624 million, down by around 24% year-over-year. However, a one-time provision of around $637 million (after tax) relating to the Macondo incident in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico resulted in a loss from continuing operations of around $13 million. (Halliburton SEC Filings) Here are some of the key takeaways from the earnings release.North America Continues To Pull Results Down But The Outlook Is Improving Among the oilfield services companies we cover, Halliburton has the greatest exposure to the North American market with around 56% of its annual revenues coming from the region. On a year-over-year basis, the segment’s revenues were down 11% to $3.7 billion while operating income was down by nearly 43%. However, margins improved by around 4% on a sequential basis thanks to lower raw material costs as well as better operational efficiencies.Fracking Business Helped By Lower Costs: Hydraulic fracturing, one of Halliburton’s most important services in North America, has been a source of margin contraction for the firm over the last few quarters as excess capacity and lower demand from natural gas wells hurt pricing. According to PacWest Consulting Partners, prices for fracking services fell by around 15% last year. This hit the firm’s North American significantly as fracking along with pressure pumping accounts for more than 40% of Halliburton’s overall business.However, there was good news this quarter due to lower costs for guar gum, a key raw material used in the fracking process. Additionally, the increased adoption of pad drilling and more 24-hour operations resulted in higher service intensity and better operational efficiencies which helped to improve margins.Gulf Of Mexico Hit Temporarily: Results from the U.S. Gulf of Mexico have been a bright spot for the firm over the last few quarters helping to soften the blow of lower onshore drilling. However, during the first quarter, although the number of active offshore rigs in the Gulf rose by nearly 10% year-over-year, activity was slowed down by maintenance work on deepwater rigs. Despite the temporary slowdown, the firm mentioned that its business in the region will see strong revenue and margin growth for the year.Gas Drilling Likely To Remain Sluggish: Natural gas prices rose by over 15% during Q1 to levels of around $4 per mmBtu. However, the U.S. gas drilling rig count fell to a 14-year low during the quarter as producers were able to maintain supply from their existing wells. Halliburton expects the outlook for gas drilling to remain lackluster for the rest of the year unless there is a further increase in gas prices.Pricing Pressure Persists, But The Outlook Is Positive: Halliburton mentioned that pricing pressure continued to exist in services such as cementing, wire line, and directional drilling where there are many smaller competitors in the market. However, it said that it expects pricing to look up over the rest of the year as it focuses on offering more differentiated technologies. The firm expects profitability to further increase this year aided by better pricing and further cost and efficiency improvements.  This is in contrast with larger rival Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB),which still sees uncertainty in North American pricing going ahead.International Operations Do WellHalliburton’s international business had a very good quarter with both revenues and operating income increasing by around 21% year-over-year due to increasing sales for its drilling and evaluation product line and encouraging sales for its Middle East and Asia operations.  Business Grows In Middle East And Asia: The Middle East and Asia segment saw its revenue and operating income increase by around 25% and 51% respectively year-over-year with markets such as Saudi Arabia, China and Australia driving growth. Saudi Arabia performed particularly well with revenues growing by around 30% and the firm expects the country to remain one of its most significant growth markets  for this year. [1] Saudi Arabia could also prove to be an important market for unconventional energy plays as the country intends to expand its exploratory drilling of shale and other unconventional gas reserves. [2]Latin American Business Expands But Margins Drag: Halliburton’s business in Latin America grew by around 21% year-over-year, however, operating income was down by around 11% primarily due to higher mobilization costs for recent deepwater contracts in Brazil and higher costs in Argentina. We expect margins to pick up going forward as the firm begins work on new contracts. Halliburton also made some progress into unconventional plays in Latin America, providing integrated completion services for one of the largest shale wells in Argentina.Notes:Disclosure: No positions"
1404321,30811,2013-05-06T02:43:00-04:00,,"The share price of Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) has returned 23% over the past 12 months. Although the shares are trading near their 52-week high, there are a number of reasons suggesting ample room for further price appreciation:1. Halliburton has a cheap valuation relative to its peers. According to the chart shown below, the company's consensus revenue, EBITDA, and EPS growth estimates are below the peer averages, but the difference is not significant. On the profit side, however, Halliburton demonstrates a superior performance as its various margin and capital return metrics are markedly above par. In terms of debt and liquidity, Halliburton is less leveraged relative to the peer group as reflected by its below-average debt to capitalization and debt to EBITDA ratios. As such, its interest coverage ratio is above the comps average. Both the company's current and quick ratios are considerably above par, reflecting a healthy balance sheet condition.Given Halliburton's slightly below-average growth potential as well as its solid profitability and liquidity performance, I believe the stock's fair value would not trade at a notable discount to the peer average level. Nevertheless, the current price multiples at 6.3x forward EBITDA and 12.4x forward EPS (next 12 months) are on average 10.4% below the same peer-average multiples. After accounting for the 5-year earnings growth estimate, Halliburton's 5-year PEG of 0.6x is still 12% below the peer average at 0.7x, suggesting market has likely not given sufficient credits to the firm's strong profitability and liquidity condition and thus the stock is modestly undervalued relative to the comps in terms of financial performance (see chart above).2. Halliburton's forward P/E multiple is currently trading at a 17% discount to the same multiple of S&P 500 Index, which stands at 14.9x now (see chart below).This relative valuation level appears very attractive as the market discount seems to be exaggerated provided that 1) the market discount has increased from 4% to 17% over the past 3 months, however, Halliburton's consensus revenue, EBITDA, and EPS estimates for 2013 and 2014 have actually trended up slightly over the period (see charts below); and 2) the company's consensus 5-year earnings growth estimate at 20.5% is overwhelmingly above the average estimate of just 8.2% for the S&P 500 companies.3. Analysts are very bullish on the stock. Of the total 33 stock ratings compiled by Thomson One, there are 14 strong buy and 16 buy ratings. Sell-side's average 1-year price target at $51 is 20% above the current share price. Given that Halliburton should command a 12% cost of equity based on the capital asset pricing model (see chart below), the average price target implies that analysts on average believe the stock remains undervalued even after the solid price appreciation.4. On April 24, Credit Suisse added Halliburton to its US Focus List and cited the following rationales (sourced from Thomson One, Equity Research):5. Halliburton has a track record of beating estimates. The company's revenue and EPS exceeded consensus expectations in 7 of the past 8 quarters.Bottom line, investors should continue buying as the stock remains undervalued given the solid fundamentals and promising prospects.All charts are created by the author except for the consensus estimate tables, which are soured from S&P Capital IQ, and all financial data used in the article and the charts is sourced from S&P Capital IQ unless otherwise specified.Disclosure: I am long HAL.

Despite a Q1 loss, HAL is expanding significantly in the international market while improving the margins in North America.Better Than Expected Results Despite Q1 LossDue to $1 billion pretax charge to help settle a lawsuit related to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, the company lost $18M (or 2 cents per share) in Q1. Excluding the money set aside, Q1 earnings declined 25% to 67 cents per share, which still beat analyst expectations by 10 cents.Revenue and MarginTotal company revenue of $7B was a record for a Halliburton first quarter, and operating income was $902M. Revenues and operating income for international operations expanded significantly (revenues grew by 21%) compared with the prior year as HAL outgrew its primary competitors. Sequentially, North America margins improved substantially with nearly a 400 basis point sequential improvement. The activity levels also rebounded from the dramatic drop-off seen at the end of the Q4, 2012. Management continues to expect North America margins to expand over the balance of 2013, subject to the usual year-end seasonality.Natural GasDespite the recent uptick in natural gas prices, management's outlook for gas activity this year remains the same. Sustained pricing improvement needs to be seen before gas activities will increase meaningfully.Large Orders and Growth Strategy RemainsHAL received a final award approval from Petrobras (NYSE:PBR) for both the high tech directional drilling and testing contracts. HAL had won the leading market position in Brazil. HAL won the largest package despite not being the lowest bidder. These contracts are estimated to be over $2B, which will increase HAL's position in the largest deep water market in the world. With the continuing success, management will continue to focus on strengthening its global position in deep water, unconventional, and mature fields.Share Repurchase and CapExDue to Macondo settlement discussions in Q1, HAL was unable to repurchase a significant amount of shares. However, repurchase activity will be picked up in Q2, following anticipated completion of SEC filing. CapEx guidance remains to be about $3B for the full 2013.Gulf Spill Settlement TalksHalliburton is in ""advanced"" talks to settle private claims against it in a trial to determine blame for the 2010 Gulf of Mexico spill. While Halliburton is not the subject of direct federal government actions, BP Plc (NYSE:BP) has tried to hold Halliburton and rig owner Transocean Ltd (NYSE:RIG) partly responsible for damages in the case. As quoted from CFO Mark McCollum, ""Over the past month or so, we have participated in court facilitated settlement discussions with some of the parties included in the multi-district litigation, with a goal of resolving a substantial portion of the private claims against us in this matter."" A Macondo settlement will be a significant positive for the stock as said by UBS analyst, Angie Sedita.Analysts' Calls and EstimatesJefferies boosted estimates and its price target on Buy-rated HAL to $49 (from $47), citing company-specific catalysts after Q1 results. Analyst Brad Handler said,Analysts currently have a mean target price of $49.44, suggesting 24.57% upside potential based on the closing price of $39.69 on April 23, 2013. Analysts, on average, are projecting an EPS of $3.00 with revenue of $29.55B for 2013, which is 3.70% higher than 2012.Fundamentally, HAL's key stats will be compared to its major competitors in the industry of oil & gas equipment and services, including Schlumberger Limited (NYSE:SLB) and Baker Hughes Incorporated (BHI), to see where it stands.Source: Morningstar and Google FinanceSLB has the highest margins while BHI has the fastest revenue growth (three-year average). HAL generates highest ROE while offers a good mix of growth and income. From the valuation perspective, HAL is currently undervalued (P/E of 13.4) as compared with the industry average (P/E average of 17.9).Technically, the MACD (12, 26, 9) indicator is showing a bearish trend, but the MACD difference continues to converge. The momentum indicator, RSI (14), is picking up and approaching the neutral line at 51.15. HAL is trading up and approaching its 50-day MA of $40.34. HAL is above its 200-day MA of $35.55, as seen from the chart below.Source: StockCharts.comHow to InvestHAL's solid fundamental remains and has several short-term catalysts, including the Macondo settlement and accelerating share buybacks. Management's growth strategy is also showing solid progress by winning large orders from Petrobras. In the near term, it is important to see if HAL can break through its 50-day MA to determine its short-term direction.

1364581,45991,2013-04-24T01:46:51-04:00,,"Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) recently reported its quarterly results. The company has earned $0.67 per share, above the analyst expectation of $0.57 (analyst estimates sourced from Yahoo! Finance). This result was surprising because the highest analyst estimate was $0.60 per share. The market embraced the news, and Halliburton rose 5.59% on the day of the earnings report.Halliburton scored a record total revenue of $7.0 bln for the first quarter, up 1.5% from the first quarter of 2012. The decline in North America segment of the business was offset by international operations. The company cited that its international revenue grew by 21% compared to the first quarter of 2012.During the earnings call, the company officials highlighted several important things. I believe they are positive for the company and may attract investors to add HAL to their portfolios.The company is positive about international pricing. David Lesar, CEO of Halliburton, said: "" If you look at where we are bidding today, and where we're winning work, I think we certainly have hit the bottom in terms of international pricing. Believe me, it's still competitive. But I believe that we're seeing that it is starting to turn up."" Pricing has a significant effect on operating margin levels. Currently, HAL has a 15.64% operating margin (sourced from Yahoo! Finance). Its competitors, Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) and Baker Hughes (BHI) have operating margins of 17.74% and 9.81% accordingly.Halliburton looks forward to continue realization of its stock repurchase program. The company plans to speed the process in the second quarter. There is $1.7 bln of stock that could be purchase. At current prices, 43.25 mln shares could be purchased. This is 4.66% of the total share float, and more than 3 times average daily volume. Of course, only a portion of this amount would be purchased in the second quarter of this year. I believe it would lift the prices to a certain extent.HAL has recently increased its dividend. The 1.27% yield is still not very impressive. During the conference call, Mark McCollum, CFO, stated: ""Going forward, our intention is for the dividend to represent at least 15% to 20% of our net income"". This is a positive sign for income oriented investors.The company announced that it has received a final award approval from Petrobras (NYSE:PBR) for drilling and testing contracts. The estimated value of these contracts is more than $2 bln. This is not only an addition to the company's revenue. It improves HAL's position in Latin America's market.Middle East Asia segment was performing well. Revenue increased 25%, while operating income rose 51%. The company seems to work hard on gaining ground in this tempting market. HAL stated that it is beginning to see payoff from the recent launch of the Singapore manufacturing center.I think that HAL is well positioned for possible growth in all parts of the world. While oil prices have fluctuated back and forth for over a year, natural gas prices have been on the rise. While the company stated that they do not see significant increases in contracts due to the rise of the natural gas prices, I think that this is long-term positive. Higher natural gas prices would provide more incentives to deal with this market, and would eventually bring contracts to related companies.HAL is trading at P/E of 14 and a forward P/E of 10. It represents a better value than its competition. BHI scores P/E of 16 and forward P/E of 10. SLB has a 17 P/E and a 12 forward P/E. If you believe in the future of oil industry, you must certainly consider adding HAL to your portfolio. The company presents both value and growth prospects. It is well diversified and has a clear strategy.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in HAL over the next 72 hours.

The company reported a record breaking first quarter revenue of $7 billion on Monday. The stock appears to be undervalued and it is an attractive long-term investment.FundamentalsThe stock has strong fundamentals. The TTM P/E ratio for Halliburton is near 14. Halliburton's P/E ratio is substantially lower than the industry average P/E ratio of 18. National Oilwell Varco (NYSE:NOV) has a P/E ratio of 11.16, Schlumberger's (NYSE:SLB) P/E ratio currently stands at 17.48, and Baker Hughes (BHI) has a P/E ratio of 16.03. The forward P/E ratio for Halliburton is 10.08. The stock's PEG ratio is .73, which could indicate that the stock is undervalued. The stock's dividend yield of 1.3% is slightly below the industry average of 1.5%. The current ratio is 2.75, which could indicate that the company is financially healthy. Free cash flow is also at 5-year highs, as shown in the graph below.Q1 2013 ResultsThe company's revenues and operating income were significantly higher than the previous year and the company outgrew its primary competitors. The company's North American margins improved substantially. The news from North America was very good. Cost saving programs in the North American region finally began to materialize during Q1. The U.S. land rig count averaged 3% lower in Q1, but the company expects to see higher service intensity in the future. The company believes that the oil rig count will continue to grow at a moderate pace from current levels. Margins are expected to expand during the remainder of the year for North America. The company grew its revenues by 21% on a year-over-year basis. In addition to the company's positive news from North America, the story internationally was also upbeat. In Latin America, the company received approval from Petrobas for new contracts. The company grew its revenues by 21% on a year-over-year basis in Latin America. Also, the company will maintain the same growth strategy going forward.Halliburton's FutureThis stock and other energy stocks will likely be held down by low oil prices in the near future. The company announced in Q1 conference call that an uptick in natural gas prices hasn't changed the company's outlook for gas activity. The company will need to see sustained price movements before gas activity will meaningfully increase. Halliburton is far ahead of its competition. 2013 is set to be a great year for the company due to improving margins and great growth rates.ConclusionHalliburton reported a record Q1 and the news from the company was upbeat. The company is crushing its competition, yet it appears to be cheaper than its rivals. The news from North America was positive and international regions such as the Middle East continue to grow very rapidly. Halliburton is an attractive long-term investment due to these factors.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1444371,47641,2013-05-17T15:28:10-04:00,,"The energy sector has had a torrid couple of years compared with the broader equity market. Year to date this trend has shown no signs of stopping, with the gap converging further.The table below plots the two-year performance of the SPDR S&P International Energy Sector (NYSEARCA:IPW) against the iShares MSCI All Country World Index (NASDAQ:ACWI).Source: Yahoo FinanceThe recent disconnect may seem counter intuitive to many investors. The broader stock market, which appears on a strong bull run, could indicate an increased confidence in global growth and economic outlook. Typically this type of investment environment has been positive for energy stocks, which have acted as a leveraged play on global growth, yet we have not witnessed that.So what is going on? Well I think there are issues both on the supply and demand side for oil and gas, which are the main components of the energy basket. Fracturing, or ""fracking,"" particularly in the U.S. has increased the supply and expected future supply of oil and gas. This is evident in U.S. oil inventories, which hit 22-year highs in April 2013. This extra supply has driven down price and also made the U.S. less oil dependent. Imports are down nearly 22% from the highs achieved in the last decade, which again has put downward pressure on price. The extra supply has not been met with extra demand. Fears of a Chinese hard landing has slowed demand for the commodity and with many developed nations' growth all but stalled, the demand is not growing. These issues are indicated in the WTI Oil Forward Curve, which is actually in backwardization.WTI Crude Oil Forward CurveSource: RBSWith expectations of a falling oil price, share prices of all oil stocks have been hit and they have lagged. However, this has created a good buying opportunity, and I particularly like the oil services companies, whose revenues are not solely determined by the price of a barrel of oil and also should benefit from shifting trends in the oil market.Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) is a fantastic oil and natural gas services company, which has been around since 1919. The company has grown over the years and now employs 72,000 people in over 80 countries. It has recently set up another corporate HQ in the Middle East to support its continued growth in the region.Baker Hughes' Oil Rig Count is a useful barometer for oil service companies as it indicates rigs in use, which helps determine demand for services offered by Halliburton. The chart below shows the correlation between Halliburton's share price and the U.S. Rig count.Source: Yahoo Finance, Baker HughesU.S. Rig count is some way off peak levels but there is a likelihood that the U.S. rig count will rise over the coming months, which may indicate a rise in Halliburton's share price. Rig count can be seasonal with the slushy conditions of March - May unsupportive for drilling, however as we approach the summer, and the ground begins to firm up rig count should increase. The discovery and accessibility of shale oil and gas should also help boost rig count as companies look to take advantage of discoveries.As more and more of the easily accessible oil fields decline, E&P companies are forced to look further and deeper to access new wells. Offshore deep water drilling is highly technical and much more challenging, and after the BP oil spill, safety is paramount. As such oil companies are investing more in service companies like Halliburton, which can provide the expertise to efficiently and safely extract oil. This trend should see demand for Halliburton grow and with it revenues and profitability.Supporting these tailwinds is very strong management that is aware of its shareholder obligations. Halliburton increased its quarterly dividend in February 2013 by 39%, and stated it would like future dividends to represent at least 15%-20% of net income. Halliburton had not raised dividends since May 2007, so I think this is a big signal to markets, and should also encourage equity income investors to look at the stock, something that could be supportive of price.Halliburton has nearly doubled revenue between 2009-2012, and this has been consistent YoY growth. Operating income did fall between 2011 and 2012 however.Source: Halliburton Financial StatementsThere is a positive trend of Debt to Total Capitalization (Total debt/Total debt + shareholders' equity) declining. Dividends have been consistent over the four years however, as has previously been mentioned the company raised its Q1 2013 dividend and this should see a growing dividend this year and hopefully going forward, which could lead to a stock re-rating.SummaryThe energy sector has been beaten up over recent years with fears of slowing demand and excess supply. Halliburton is a company that does not rely solely on the underlying commodity price for revenue and is also fantastically positioned to benefit from the growing challenges oil extractors are facing.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1355041,23479,2013-04-19T14:36:43-04:00,,"Quick TakeHalliburton (NYSE:HAL), the world’s second largest oil field services firm, will release its Q1 2013 earnings on April 22. Over the last year, the company’s performance has been impacted by weak North American land-based drilling and higher raw material costs while being offset by a better international performance and a stronger performance in the U.S. offshore market. In Q4, Halliburton’s revenues grew by 3% to around $7.3 billion year-over-year while income from continuing operations fell by almost 35% to around $592 million. In Q1, we expect results to be weighed down by North America yet again since natural gas drilling activity has dropped to its 14-year lows, causing weaker pricing for gas directed services. The firm is also expected to record a $30 million charge related to foreign exchange losses in Venezuela.Fracking Market Remains WeakAmong the oilfield services companies we cover, Halliburton has the greatest exposure to the North American market, which accounts for around 56% of its revenues. Drilling activity in North America has been sluggish for some time now as low gas prices have caused gas directed activity to plummet from around 726 active rigs (both the U.S. and Canada) to around 464 active rigs over the past year. Halliburton is the world’s largest provider of pressure pumping services, which are primarily used for fracking shale gas and oil wells. The decline in gas drilling and an expansion in pumping capacity across North America in recent years has resulted in an oversupply of equipment, driving down prices for the service. Even though oil directed drilling has increased from around 1,437 to 1,474 rigs, it hasn’t been enough to offset the gas drilling plunge since pumping oil wells requires less capacity than gas wells. Pressure pumping accounts for around 45% of Halliburton’s business.While U.S. natural gas prices have recovered by about 20% over the last quarter to levels of around $4 per mmBtu, it hasn’t stopped the declining rig count since companies are able to meet most of their production needs from existing wells. However, if gas prices continue their uptrend and demand grows stronger, we could see a reversal in the declining gas rig count.Lower Guar Gum Costs And Operational Improvements Can Help MarginsWhile weaker pricing is expected to weigh in on the results, the company has been improving its operational efficiency due to 24-hour operations, advancements in drilling and completion technologies, and the growing adoption of pad-drilling technologies. Another positive factor could be the lower raw material costs. The prices of guar gum, which is used for fracking, increased from around $156 per 100 kilogram in March 2011 to over  $1,400 by March 2012 due to supply constraints, causing oilfield service firms to stock up on the raw material early last year in anticipation that prices would rise.  However, prices fell, which led to most firms consuming out of inventory that was above market cost over much of last year. The firm mentioned in its Q4 conference call that it had just a month’s worth of high priced guar inventory to be consumed in Q1, and this should help boost margins relative to last year.International Business: Unconventional Plays And One-Time Forex Charges Halliburton is recognized as the market leader in services for unconventional plays in North America. The international market for unconventional plays on the other hand is still largely undertapped and provides a promising growth opportunity for the company. Through 2012, the firm expanded its service footprint, catering to some of  the first commercial unconventional wells in Australia and China and has also stepped up unconventional plays business in other markets like Saudi Arabia, Mexico and Argentina. We will watch the firm’s progress in continuing this expansion, but we do not expect the progress to be rapid since most countries are only drilling exploratory wells and full scale commercial production could take time. We think it's important that the firm continues to bag more early stage contracts in order to build relationships and scale up over the long run.Halliburton is expected to take a one-time foreign exchange related charge of $30 million for its operations in Venezuela. The country recently devalued its currency from around 4.3 bolívar per  dollar to around 6.3 bolívar per dollar in a move to improve the government’s finances.We have a $48 price estimate for Halliburton, which is a 15% premium over its current market price.Disclosure: No positions."

1355581,23479,2013-04-19T18:38:28-04:00,,"Halliburton  (NYSE:HAL), the world’s second largest oil field services firm, will  release its Q1 2013 earnings on April 22. Over the last year, the  company’s performance has been impacted by weak North American  land-based drilling and higher raw material costs while being offset by a  better international performance and a stronger performance in the U.S.  offshore market. In Q4, Halliburton’s revenues grew by 3% to around  $7.3 billion year-over-year while income from continuing operations fell  by almost 35% to around $592 million. In Q1, we expect results to be  weighed down by North America yet again since natural gas drilling  activity has dropped to its 14-year lows, causing weaker pricing for gas  directed services. The firm is also expected to record a $30 million  charge related to foreign exchange losses in Venezuela.Fracking Market Remains WeakAmong the oilfield services companies we cover, Halliburton has the  greatest exposure to the North American market, which accounts for  around 56% of its revenues. Drilling activity in North America has been  sluggish for some time now as low gas prices has caused gas directed  activity to plummet from around 726 active rigs (both the U.S. and  Canada) to around 464 active rigs over the past year. Halliburton is the  world’s largest provider of pressure pumping services which are  primarily used for fracking shale gas and oil wells. The decline in gas  drilling and an expansion in pumping capacity across North America in  recent years have resulted in an oversupply of equipment, driving down  prices for the service. Even though oil directed drilling has increased  from around 1,437 to 1,474 rigs, it hasn’t been enough to offset the gas  drilling plunge since pumping oil wells requires less capacity than gas  wells. Pressure pumping accounts for around 45% of Halliburton’s  business. [1]While U.S. natural gas prices have recovered by about 20% over the  last quarter to levels of around $4 per mmBtu, it hasn’t stopped the  declining rig count since companies are able to meet most of their  production needs from existing wells.

1276491,21305,2013-03-15T09:44:10-04:00,,"US natural gas Nymex futures prices started falling from a summer of 2011 high of about $5/MMbtu until they bottomed at about $1.90/MMbtu in the spring of 2012. US natural gas Nymex futures prices have since risen to about $3.80/MMbtu as of this writing, Thursday March 14, 2013. The reasons for the fall were twofold. First, all of new unconventional oil and gas fields in the late 2000's brought on a huge ""gold rush"" to profits. As more and more of these fields became big producers of natural gas, US natural gas prices weakened. When the winter of 2011-2012 was an unseasonably warm one, natural gas prices started plummeting. As this happened many oil and gas E & P companies cut back on their natural gas drilling. For instance, Chesapeake Energy's (CHK) natural gas drilling is now only about 10% of what it was a few years ago. Most did not cut back this drastically. However, the cutbacks were huge. The chart below shows the US rig counts over the last two years.The gray bars show the ramp up of the previous year (2011-2012). The red line shows the fall in US gas dedicated rig counts from early 2012 to present. It is apparent that the rig count has bottomed. Since most of the fall in US rig counts was in natural gas rig counts, it is particularly instructive to look at those figures. For Q4 2012 the average number of natural gas rigs active in the US was 423. For Q1 (QTD) the average number of gas rigs active in the US was 427. This amounts to virtually no change quarter over quarter.The number of active oil rigs decreased a small amount during the same period. However, that is more likely due to seasonal factors than to anything else. Some oil fields are located in harsh winter climates; and last year was an unseasonably warm winter. The number of horizontal oil rigs in use in the US actually rose slightly during that period. Looking forward I expect that the number of oil rigs active in the US will start to rise again as new oil fields such as the Utica ramp up their exploration and development activities. This link lists many of the oil and gas shale fields in the US and Canada; and even it is incomplete. There are a lot of relatively new fields. Plus with the rebound in natural gas prices, we may see a small rebound in natural gas drilling.During February, the number of internationally active rigs was 1275. This was up +71 from the prior year. It was down only -4 from the prior month. In sum it would appear that the number of international rigs may also be set to climb in 2013. There are huge new international land based fields such as the Cooper Basin in Australia and the Vaca Muerta in Argentina. Then there are many new hot offshore spots such as offshore Africa (offshore Ghana, Nigeria, and Angola are a few), offshore Brazil, the Bering Sea, the Arctic, and offshore Asia. Since it is the emerging market economies that are growing quickly, it makes sense that drilling activities for oil and gas in their geographic areas would increase to feed their growing energy appetite.Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) has a historical and near term expectations forecast chart of the growth in the deepwater market. The chart speaks for itself.On top of these factors, fracking is becoming an ever more important part of the completion process; and there are increasingly more frack stages being done. Hi-tech multi-stage fracking pioneer, Packers Plus, says it can do 60 fracks with its latest technology. President Dan Thermig recalls that when he started you could only do five frack stages. More frack stages are normally associated with a greater percentage of recovery of the total oil in place in oil shale. As a ball park figure, one fracking stage costs about $100,000. When companies now do 30+ fracking stages in some cases, the revenue from fracking alone can be a significant part of the development cost of an oil shale well. This ultimately means revenue growth for oil services companies. Some suggest that pure fracking companies are the best oil and gas development area to be in as they are the fastest growing.The oil service drillers that perform more services in more of these areas are going to be the ones that benefit the most in the next year. They will get incrementally more business due to their reputations and their greater expertise. One of these, Halliburton (NYSE:HAL), will get incrementally more business because of its reputation for ""green"" drilling and completion (fracking). In fact HAL won 2012 World Oil Awards for (1) ""Best Health, Safety, Environment/Sustainable Development Onshore"" and (2) ""Best Visualization and Collaboration"". It was nominated for eight other awards. These included: Best Completion Technology (EquiFlow AICD, TergoVis I Efficiency Fluid, and Access Frac PD Service), Best Deepwater Technology, Best Drilling Technology, Best Drilling and Completion Fluids, Best Well Intervention, and New Horizons Idea.HAL has recently partnered with Great Bear Petroleum, which is currently a private company, to help Great Bear Petroleum develop its new leases on the North Slope in Alaska. It is no accident that Great Bear Petroleum, which has to deal constructively with the influential environmental groups in Alaska, chose HAL to partner with. Great Bear's drilling areas are near the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Therefore they draw a lot of environmentalist attention. For those interested in Great Bear Petroleum keep your eyes peeled for an IPO in 2013 or 2014. The company seems almost sure to go public in order to finance its anticipated ramp up in drilling in 2014.HAL is not only an unconventional shale oil services provider for land based fields; it also provides services for deep sea drilling and completion. Plus it is so sure of future success that on February 20, 2013 its board approved a 39% increase in its dividend to $0.125 per share for Q1 2013. This still only leaves HAL with approximately a 1.2% annual dividend; but such a significant raise bodes well for HAL to eventually become a significant income producing stock. It also has an existing $1.7B stock buyback program in place, which it just commenced executing. This tends to make one believe that its board does not believe the stock is going to get demonstrably cheaper in the near future. Both of these items bode well for stock price gains over the next few years.HAL is a well run company. It has a history of meeting or exceeding earnings expectations. The average analysts' next five years EPS growth per annum forecast is for 16.39% growth per annum. It trades at a bargain FPE of 10.74 for its expected growth. It carries a mean analysts' recommendation of 1.9 (a buy).Another company in much the same situation as HAL is Schlumberger. SLB is a technological leader just as HAL is. It provides expertise in virtually all fields. It is renowned for its seismic and interpretation technology as well as its drilling efficiency. Its new HiWAY fracking technology allows the use of significantly less water and proppant with superior results.SLB too has a history of meeting or exceeding its earnings expectations -- the mark of a well run company. It pays a dividend of about 1.6%. It carries a bargain FPE of 13.46 for its high next five years analysts' average EPS growth per annum estimate of 16.99%. It has a mean analysts' recommendation of 1.7 (a buy). It has a long and usually well deserved reputation of being a leader in the industry. Both SLB and HAL are buys for many of the same reasons.The two year charts of HAL and SLB provide some technical direction for these trades.The two year chart of HAL is below.The slow stochastic sub chart shows that HAL is neither overbought nor oversold. The main chart show that it has recently begun what I think will be a long term uptrend. Its 50-day SMA is far above its 200-day SMA; and its price line is above its 50-day SMA. It is technically and fundamentally a buy.The two year chart of SLB is below.The slow stochastic sub chart shows that SLB is neither overbought nor oversold. The main chart shows that SLB seems to be breaking out of a long consolidation period. It has started a new uptrend. Its 50-day SMA is above its 200-day SMA. Its price line is above its 50-day SMA. It is technically and fundamentally a buy.You can go into much more depth in the accounting aspects of these companies; but you will only find that the overriding fundamentals are the most important aspect of their future, along with their reputations for technical expertise, safety, and efficiency. They are buys. However, you also want to remember that the overall market is likely near a top. Many are forecasting a significant pullback soon. The strong possibility of a US recession is looming on the horizon. It makes a lot of sense to average into these stocks over the course of 2013.NOTE: Some of the fundamental financial data above is from Yahoo Finance.Good Luck Trading.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in HAL, SLB over the next 72 hours.

1200111,40741,2013-02-18T05:01:39-05:00,,"Investment ThesisHalliburton Co. (NYSE:HAL) has gone through a tough year, but has still managed to post record revenues for the fourth quarter. Although its domestic business struggled in 2012, it believes that by slowly rebuilding its North American margins and cutting costs through their ""frac of the future"" initiative, Halliburton can improve its earnings after coming out of a rough 2012. After the struggles in 2012, CEO David Lesar believes ""in the long-term fundamentals of the gas business and they are not going to abandon the market."" I believe that it is a good idea to buy the stock on the next pullback at around $39.00 since the stock is trading very close to the 52-week high.Company Report-Initiation of CoverageRating & TargetBUYTarget Price (18 months): $48.00Current Price (02/15/2013): $40.71Total Return to Target: 17.91%52-Week Range: $26.28-$43.96Market DataP/E Ratio (TTM): 15.38Beta: 1.61Market Capitalization (Mil.): $39,788.42Shares Outstanding (Mil.): 931.81Dividend: $0.09Yield: 0.84%Company DescriptionHalliburton Co. was founded in 1924 and is headquartered in Houston, TX. The Company provides services and products to the energy industry related to the exploration, development, and production of oil and natural gas. The company operates through two segments; Completion & Production and Drilling & Evaluation. The Completion & Production segment delivers cementing, stimulation, intervention, pressure control, specialty chemicals, artificial lift, and completion services. The Drilling & Evaluation segment provides field and reservoir modeling, drilling, evaluation, and wellbore placement solutions that enable customers to model, measure, and optimize their well construction activities.1-Year PerformanceSource: MorningstarInvestment OverviewStrong fourth-quarter earnings but lower profit marginOn January 25, 2013, Halliburton declared earnings of $0.63 a share versus Wall Street view of $0.60. These earnings were lifted above expectations by the Company's overseas business during the fourth quarter. However, this dependency on foreign business also shows how tough the market is for North American oilfield services due to the abundance of natural gas. Strong margins in the Middle East, Asia, Europe and Africa helped make up for a 58% drop in operating income in North America. In a reversal of past quarters, 53% of Houston-based Halliburton's profits came from outside its home market, helped in part by the growth of hydraulic fracking abroad. CEO David Lesar claims, ""Globally, 2012 was a watershed year for the expansion of unconventionals,"" noting that the Company's work on the first unconventional wells in China and Australia and moves toward them in Saudi Arabia, Mexico and Argentina. In the fourth quarter of 2011, Halliburton made only 22% of its operating earnings in international markets. Oilfield companies' pricing power, especially for the pressure pumping fleets used in fracking, has evaporated as the number of U.S. rigs targeting gas hit 13-year lows.Positive 2013 outlookNorth American land drilling is likely to remain subdued this year as oil and gas companies forecast spending around 2012 levels. The Company expects the North American rig count to improve from fourth quarter levels in 2013, though it will be down slightly compared to 2012. It views the fourth quarter as a low water mark for profit margins, which at 12% were half of what they were at the start of 2012 and what the company considers to be ""normalized"" levels. After last year's stockpiling of guar - a key ingredient for fracking fluid - at record-high prices, Halliburton now believes its guar inventory will be at market prices by the second quarter, which should drive down costs. Halliburton expects 2013 margins in the Eastern Hemisphere to average in the 15-20% range, which is better than some analysts' expectations. In the Q4 2012 earnings call, CEO David Lesar states that he is ""optimistic about the coming year and our ability to rebuild our North American margins and realize continued revenue and margin growth in our international business.""Frac of the future"" initiativeThis efficiency initiative may be causing Halliburton some discomfort in the short term. However, it is a perfect case study of how the drilling industry is innovating in response to pressure to cut costs and its environmental footprint. Working with Apache (NASDAQ:APA), a major gas producer, and Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), an equipment supplier, Halliburton has started to convert some of its pressure pumping units employed in fracturing operations to a dual-fuel system that uses compressed or liquefied natural gas as well as diesel as a source of power. Natural gas is cleaner, burning than diesel, allowing the Company to claim its dual-fuel system cut carbon emissions and is more environmentally friendly. However, much more importantly, natural gas is abundant and cheap, especially in the oil and gas producing regions, while oil is six times as expensive, and diesel is the most expensive refined fuel of them all. In the long-term, this cost cutting can help Halliburton increase its profits as they transition from using oil and diesel to natural gas.Negatives and possible risks· 11.6% decline in gross profit in the fiscal year ended 12/31/2012 compared to the fiscal year ended 12/31/2011.· Decline in gross margin from 20.21% in 2011 to 15.56% in 2012 due to higher fracking costs in oil-rich areas and declining demand for services in natural gas fields.· 7% fall in net income from $2.84 billion in 2011 to $2.64 billion in 2012.· Compared to the industry's average operating margin of 21.62%, Halliburton has an operating margin of 14.59%· Closest competitors, Baker Hughes Inc. (BHI) and Schlumberger Ltd. (NYSE:SLB), have higher EPS and gross margin than Halliburton.Industry OverviewHalliburton is the top seller of services for hydraulic fracking in North America. One of its top competitors, Schlumberger said its fourth quarter earnings fell due to lower revenue from its international operations and a slowdown in North American onshore activity. Similarly, Baker Hughes said its worldwide rig count for January slid 5.7% from a year ago. Last month, Baker Hughes said its fourth quarter earnings fell as the oil-field services company posted a sharp drop in profits from its North American business. Producers have largely been retreating from natural gas drilling as the commodity's prices are near 10-year lows. Oil and gas companies have been shifting their production to oil-rich shale, unlocking the energy trapped in vast shale formations in the U.S. and elsewhere. Compared to these competitors, Halliburton has a good P/E ratio of 15.02 and a PEG ratio of 0.99 indicating that the stock is reasonably valued. As shown in the chart below, Halliburton has clearly outperformed its two competitors over the past year.Source: MorningstarBasic Technical AnalysisSince the short-term moving average (10-day) crosses the long-term moving average (50-day) around December 2012, which is when the stock started to rise, it is an indication of an upward movement in the stock as it has done so for the past three months. This uptrend is likely to continue as long as the Company increases its earnings for the rest of 2013 and onwards. However, on the negative side, the overlay of the Bollinger Bands shows that the stock price is closer to the upper band, which may be a sign that the stock is overbought.Source: Yahoo FinanceConclusionThe fundamentals and growth potential for Halliburton make it a very appealing stock for investors to buy. Considering the record year they had with revenue totaling $28.5 billion, despite the challenges they experienced in the North American market, they have much upside in 2013 if they are able to increase their margins in North America and continue their growth internationally. I expect Halliburton to have a better 2013 than 2012, but still continue to post decent revenue growth. In the long-term, however, the Company should become more profitable as it will have a cheaper supply chain from the ""frac of the future"" initiative and natural gas wells will be in greater demand as the adoption rate increases.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1218861,39301,2013-02-24T00:51:02-05:00,,"IntroductionHalliburton (NYSE:HAL) remains a compelling investment opportunity for those who are looking for higher yields in the energy sector of the economy. The company continues to invest aggressively in order to remain competitive with its peers, and is likely to generate reasonable yields for investors in the foreseeable future.Qualitative AnalysisSource: Information pertaining to HAL came from the shareholder annual report, shareholder quarterly report, Energy Information Administration, along with YCharts.Halliburton continues to expand its operations and is primarily focused on developing solutions for upstream producers of crude oil. It is estimated that the average recovery factor for crude oil from fully developed wells is 35%, for 70% of the world's oil fields. This means that developing solutions for these types of oil fields, where oil recovery is difficult, will improve the global supply of crude oil. Halliburton aims to offer solutions and innovative technologies for upstream producers of crude oil, so they can derive higher efficiency from their oil fields.Halliburton has increased its capital expenditures above the statistical 4-year mean, implying that the company is ramping up its ability to produce oil rigs.The days in inventory outstanding (number of days inventory remains on the balance sheet before sold) is above its statistical 4-year mean. The company generally increases the amount of inventory it has prior to periods of rapid net income growth. I am willing to assume that the company is stockpiling inventory in anticipation of future demand based on historical data. Furthermore, I back this assumption due to the projected increases in production, which is based on the chart below.Source: Data from U.S. Energy Information AdministrationCrude oil production is projected to increase to approximately 15.95 quadrillion BTU by the year of 2020. The crude oil production is projected to decline by 2025. But depending upon the type of hydraulic fracturing techniques developed, peak oil may happen at a later point, perhaps 2030. This means that Halliburton's business remains secure and unaffected by externalities in the foreseeable 5 year investment time frame I have for investors in my articles. Even if oil production were to decline, Halliburton is further downstream and has less risk exposure to declining crude oil production and may in fact benefit from declining production by offering services and solutions to further maximize the yields from pre-existing oil fields.Cash from operations has improved drastically over the past 10 years. Cash flows are likely to improve as the company's inventory levels are likely to decline based on historical data. The cash from operations declined between 2006 and 2010 due to the cyclical nature of oil production. The price of oil can have an effect on the demand for oil rigs.Source: Chart from freestockcharts.comThe demand for oil rigs declined even before the price of crude oil fully peaked, meaning that rising prices decreases the demand for oil rigs. This is because consumers consume less crude oil when the price of oil goes up, and as a result production of oil decreases. During the 2008-2009 period, speculation on crude oil futures kept prices of crude oil at artificially high levels. I don't anticipate this type of behavior over the next 5 years, and I believe that what happened during 2008 and 2009 was a statistical anomaly. I have a stable outlook on the price of crude oil, meaning that I anticipate the price of crude oil to rise at a rate higher than inflation; but I don't anticipate a sudden jump in the price of crude similar in magnitude to 2008 and 2009.Technical AnalysisHalliburton' stock price has been extremely volatile over the past decade. The company is exposed to the price of energy and it can be generally assumed that sudden rises in the price of energy can have a drastically negative effect on the demand for oil rigs. Despite this fact, I believe that since production is likely to increase in the foreseeable future, it is likely that the stock will trade at new all-time highs by 2015 to 2016.Source: Chart from freestockcharts.comThe stock is trading above the 20-, 50-, and 200- Day Moving Averages. The stock will continue to appreciate over the long term, and is in the beginning stages of a multi-year up-trend.Notable support is $30.20, $36.00, and $39.30 per share. Notable resistance is $51.00, $55.00, and $60.50 per share.Street AssessmentAnalysts on a consensus basis have reasonable expectations for the company going forward.Source: Table and data from Yahoo FinanceAnalysts have high expectations, as analysts on a consensus basis have a 5-year average growth rate forecast of 15% for earnings (based on the above table). This growth rate is above the industry average for next 5-years (13.78%).Source: Table and data from Yahoo FinanceThe average surprise percentage is 3.6% above analyst forecast earnings over the past four quarters (based on the above table).Forecast and HistorySource: Data from YChartsIn 2003 and 2004 the company reported a loss due to losses from discontinued operations which resulted in impairment, the losses did not negatively affect the cash flow for the period. The EPS figure shows that throughout the 2003- 2006 period, the company was able to grow earnings. Throughout 2007 to 2009 earnings contracted. The contraction in earnings was due to the great recession. Following the recession the company was able to grow earnings.Source: Data from YChartsBy observing the chart we can conclude that the business is somewhat cyclical and is affected by macroeconomics. Therefore one of the largest risk factors to HAL is the slowing of international gross domestic product growth. So as long as the global economy continues to grow, the company will generate reasonable returns over a 5-year time span based on the forecast below.By 2018 I anticipate the company to generate $6.89 in earnings per share. This is because of production growth, improving global outlook, earnings management and continued development overseas.The forecast is proprietary, and below is a non-linear chart indicating the price of the stock over the next 5-years.Below is a price chart incorporating the past 10 years and the next 6 years. Detailing 16 years in pricing based on my forecast and price history on December 31st of each year.Source: Data from YCharts and price history is from Yahoo Finance.Investment StrategyHAL currently trades at $41.11. I have a price forecast of $40.30 for December 31st 2013. The stock is currently trading at a fair valuation, but should be bought on pull backs as a part of a longer-term accumulation strategy.Long TermThe company is an exceptional investment for the long term. I anticipate HAL to deliver upon the price and earnings forecast despite the risk factors (competition, regulation, economic environment). HAL's primary upside catalyst is international expansion, production growth, share buybacks, and managing costs. I anticipate the company to deliver upon my forecasted price target of $92.26 by 2018. This implies a return of 140% (including dividends) by 2018. This is a great return for an oil well services stock.A higher yielding investment opportunity albeit having higher risk is to buy the Jan 17, 2015 calls at the $42.00 strike. The call premiums trade at $5.35. The price forecast for the end of 2014 is $52.62. The rate of return if the calls expire at $52.62 is 98.50%, the option will break-even when the stock trades at $47.35.The risk-to-reward on the option investment is decent. The risk however is somewhat high (1.6 beta).HAL has a market capitalization of $38.3 billion; the added liquidity makes this an investment opportunity appropriate for larger institutions that require added liquidity.ConclusionOil wells may run dry, but oil rigs won't be hit with a dry spell for quite a while. The future remains bright for Halliburton. Therefore the conclusion remains simple: buy HAL.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1152011,40351,2013-02-02T12:35:06-05:00,,"The second biggest oilfield services firm Halliburton (HAL) has recently released its fourth quarter and full year results. Unlike its rival Schlumberger (SLB), the company relies heavily on pressure pumping and drilling activity in North America. The slowdown in its primary market has caused a drop in its income. Where quarterly revenues have increased by 3.20% to $7.29 billion, the total operating income and net income from continuing operations have fallen by 31.40% and 35% to $981 million and $589 million respectively which translates into earnings per share (excluding one-off charges) of $0.67. However, the quarterly results managed to beat market expectations which caused a 5.92% increase in its stock on Friday (25th January). For the full year, revenues have climbed by 14.80% to $28.50 billion but total operating income and income from continuing operations have dropped by 12.20% and 14.24% to $4.16 billion and $2.58 billion respectively.In 2012, Halliburton earned 56% of its revenues from North America and 43% from abroad. On the other hand, Schlumberger has earned less than one-third (32%) of its total revenues from its home market and nearly 70% from abroad.Halliburton's full year operating income increased by 29% ($135 million) in Latin America, 148% ($354 Million) in Europe/Africa/CIS* and 52% ($236 million) in Middle East/Asia regions but the 26% ($1.04 billion) drop in North America was enough to completely offset the impressive gains made in international markets.On the other hand, while Schlumberger's operating income (pretax) also fell by 10% ($316 million), but the 31% ($1.36 billion) increase in the operating income from outside of North America was more than enough to cover for the fall in North America and translated into 15.23% ($719 million) increase in income from continuing operations to $5.44 billion for the year 2012.In essence, not only does Halliburton rely on North America for more than 56% of its revenues, it has witnessed more than twice as much drop in earnings from there as compared to Schlumberger.Moreover, in terms of revenues over a period of five years (since 2008), Schlumberger has achieved at least 40% growth in all of its markets. Its revenues in North America have more than doubled from $5.91 billion in 2008 to $13.48 billion in 2012. Similarly, Latin America, Europe/CIS/Africa and Middle East/Asia regions have reported revenue growths of 78.6%, 40% and 60.6% respectively. In the three years from the beginning of 2008 till the end of 2010, Schlumberger earned more in Europe/CIS/Africa than in North America. Since 2011, its home market has become the biggest contributor to its revenues, although Europe/CIS/Africa is a close second and the emerging markets of Middle East/Asia are quickly catching up.Halliburton's five year growth story is relatively less exciting (there is no triple digit growth here). Revenues from North America have almost doubled from $8.34 billion in 2008 to $16 billion in 2012 showing an increase of 91.9%. Revenues from Latin America and Middle East/Asia have increased by 52.3% and 35.6% respectively. Halliburton's Europe/Africa/CIS revenues have remained fairly flat and have registered a growth of just 3.8% from their 2008 levels.Overall, since 2008, Schlumberger's international revenues have increased by 55.5% while Halliburton's international revenues have gone up by 25.8%.More importantly, while Schlumberger continues to generate more than twice as much revenues from abroad than from North America, Halliburton is going in the opposite direction. The latter is focusing more on the United States where it yields considerable political influence. Until 2008, the company earned $1.56 billion more in overseas than at its home market. By 2010, this difference shrank to just $319 million and finally, from 2011 onwards, North America became its major market from where it earned at least $3.5 billion more in revenues than from international markets.In the CY-2012, Schlumberger's stock has risen by 3.56% while Halliburton has trailed below the industry leader registering a growth of just 0.52%. Schlumberger has recently increased its quarterly dividend by 13.6% which has taken its yield to $1.70%. Halliburton's stock gives a yield of 0.90% and is currently trading at $40.68 with a P/E of 14.31. Citigroup, on the back of better than expected results, has raised Halliburton's price target to $46 while MarketWatch suggests a price target of $46.95. Although Halliburton is a buy at the moment, given the choice, I would always prefer Schlumberger (also a buy - discussed in more detail in my previous article) which offers better yield, is more profitable (as it doesn't rely on the low margin North American operations for most of its revenues) and a better return on equity.*CIS: Commonwealth of Independent StatesDisclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1199711,41941,2013-02-17T12:47:43-05:00,,"Executive Summary:We believe that Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) is a medium quality company with a Business Quality Score of 6 based on a scale of 1 to 10 (10 is best). Also, shares of Halliburton appear to be undervalued based on a discounted cash flow analysis. Halliburton stock would need to rise 31.1% to reach fair valve based on the closing price of $42.70/share for Halliburton shares on 02-15-2013.Business Quality Analysis:Halliburton has a Business Quality Score of 6 out of 10 based on an analysis of historical data. We assign a Business Quality Score to each company undergoing analysis. The score is based on a scale of 1 to 10 with a value of 10 indicating the best possible Business Quality Score. Our Business Quality Score is a proprietary metric which takes into account the 10 year historical performance of the company. Performance is measured considering the absolute performance (and trends) in revenues, earnings, profit margins, and returns on assets/equity.Low Business Quality Scores (3 or lower) indicate companies that are in a cyclical or commodity business. These businesses have erratic revenues and earnings with associated low profit margins and poor returns on capital. Low quality companies operate in highly competitive/cyclical businesses where consistent profits are nearly impossible to achieve.Medium Business Quality Scores (4 to 6) indicate an average quality business that operates in a business environment that is not overly cyclical in nature. Also, the products or services these businesses provide are not yet commoditized but do operate in a highly competitive business environment. Moreover, these businesses do not have durable competitive advantages that will allow these businesses to earn consistently high returns on capital. Companies with a medium Business Quality Score can sometimes be good investments if bought at deeply discount prices and sold at fair value. This is in contrast to investments in businesses with high Business Quality Scores where paying fair value for shares can yield good returns if held for the long term.High Business Quality Scores (7 or higher) indicate companies that are in high quality businesses with some type of durable competitive advantages that keep competitors at bay. These businesses typically have steadily rising revenues and earnings with associated high profit margins and high returns on capital.Revenue:Halliburton's revenues have had good performance over the last 10 years growing at an annualized rate of 5.8%. Revenues grew in every year except 2007 and 2009. Our opinion is that Halliburton will have good revenue grow over the next decade. We base our opinion on the fact that world oil production has peaked and the search for oil in ever more remote locations will help drive Halliburton's revenues in the coming years. We believe future annualized revenue growth will be about 7% over the next 10 years.Earnings Per Share:Halliburton's earnings grew at an annualized growth rate of 21.7% over the last decade. However, the earnings were not consistent with huge earnings short falls in 2003, 2004 and 2009. In fact, earnings dropped 41% in 2009 compared with 2008. Wide variation in earnings is not indicative of a high quality business with strong competitive advantages. Halliburton's performance in this regard is one reason we gave Halliburton a medium level Business Quality Score of 6. However, we believe that Halliburton has solved most of its problems in recent years and that it will have annualized earnings growth of about 9% in future years.A company's earnings per share is a measure of profitability for a company. The earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net income attributable to the common stock by the average number of common shares outstanding. One drawback in using earnings as a profitably measure is that it does not consider the amount of assets needed to generate the earnings. Earning the same profit using fewer assets is more profitable but this is not captured in the earnings per share calculation.High quality companies will have steadily rising earnings that do not vary greatly through a full business cycle (expansion-recession-expansion). Investing in high quality companies is fairly easy assuming an investor has realistic profit expectations and has the patience to wait for a reasonable stock price relative to the company's value.Lower quality (cyclical) companies will have earnings that vary greatly over a business cycle. Often these cyclical companies will experience a drastic reduction in earnings during economic recessions. Investment profits can be had with investments in cyclical companies but the timing of the buying and selling of the investment must be in sync with the ebb and flow of the stock market. Typically, the stock market will start to recover about 6 months before the economy comes out of recession. However, this point in time is not obvious in the moment and is only known latter with the benefit of hindsight. Furthermore, timing when to sell a cyclical stock is even more difficult. Timing the stock market is a matter of luck so it is best to stick with the higher quality stocks where market timing is not as critical to investing success.Net Profit Margin:Halliburton has had net profit margins in the range of 1.9% to 16.5% over the last decade with an average net profit margin of 9.2%. Halliburton's net profit margin was above 7.5% in 8 out of 10 years. 2003 and 2004 were terrible years for Halliburton which we do not think will occur again in the near future. We expect the net profit margin to hover around its long term average of 9% in the coming years.The net profit margin is net income divided by net revenues. For non-retailing companies, a consistent net profit margin of 7% or higher is an indicator of a good company with some type of durable competitive advantage. In the retailing sector a net profit margin in the range of 2.5% to 5% is the norm even for the best companies. Ideally, the net profit margin should be steady or rising over the past 10 years.Return On Assets:Halliburton has had a return on assets in the range of 2.4% to 16.9% over the last decade. Halliburton's performance in this regard is pretty good considering that the return on assets was only below the critical value of 7% in 2 out of 10 years. We expect the return on assets to hover around Halliburton's average return on assets of 11% in the coming decade.Return on assets is a measure of how much profit is generated from a company's assets independent of how much debt is used to finance the acquisition of those assets. The return on assets is sometimes a better measure of profitability than return on equity because the return on equity can be significantly increased by adding more debt to a company's balance sheet. Adding more debt to a company can inflate profits but comes at the price of a greater risk of bankruptcy.Measuring profitability using the return on assets does not have this problem because to calculate the return on assets the net income plus the interest expense net of income tax savings is divided by the average total assets of the company. Thus, by dividing the net income (adjusted for the affects of debt financing) by the total assets (debt + equity) of the company it cancels out the positive effects of debt.The return on assets is great for comparing the profitability of companies with different levels of debt in their capital structures. Generally speaking, a consistent return on assets of about 7% or more is a good indication of a good business with some type of durable competitive advantage. One exception to this rule of thumb is the banking sector where a return on assets of just 2% is considered exceptional.Return On Equity:Halliburton has had a return on equity in the range of 11.1% to 45.7% over the last decade. Halliburton's performance in this regard is pretty good considering that the return on assets was above the critical 15% level in 7 out of 10 years. We believe that Halliburton's return on equity will continue to average about 22% for years to come.Return on equity measures a company's performance in financing and using assets to generate earnings. In contrast to the return on assets, the return on equity considers the affect of financing in generating profits. To calculate the return on equity the net income (minus dividends paid on preferred stock) is divided by the average common shareholder's equity. As a rule of thumb, a consistent return on equity of 15% or more (assuming a reasonable level of debt financing) is an indicator of a good company with some type of durable competitive advantage.Valuation:A discounted cash flow analysis revealed a fair value for Halliburton shares of $55.98/share. We use the percent of revenue method in our discounted cash flow analysis. The model assumes an average weighted cost of capital (OTC:WACC) of 8.0%. Our WACC is calculated using a proprietary formula unique to our firm. An average annualized revenue growth rate of 7.0% is projected over the next 10 years. An average annualized revenue growth rate of 5.0% is assumed for every year thereafter.Conclusion:Halliburton appears to be a medium quality company with an undervalued stock price. Based on a fair value of $55.98/share and the Halliburton closing stock price of $42.70/share (on 02-15-2013) the stock must rise 31.1% to reach fair value.Disclaimer: We are not investment advisors.

1163531,30811,2013-02-07T08:03:59-05:00,,"Shares of Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) have returned 24.8% over the past 3 months. At $40.31, the stock is trading right at its 52-week high and offers a slight dividend yield of 0.9%. In this article, I will elaborate on the stock valuation analysis which supports my bullish view on Halliburton.Sell-side analysts on average predict the company's revenue, EBITDA, and EPS to grow at CAGRs of 8.3%, 12.5%, and 19.3%, respectively, over the current and next calendar years (see comparable chart below). Those consensus estimates are just slightly below the averages of 8.4%, 13.9%, and 19.4%, respectively, for a group consisting of Halliburton's primary peers in the O&G services sector. Similarly, the company's EBITDA margin is forecasted to expand by 1.7% over the same horizon, slightly lower than the peer average at 2.0%. On the profit side, Halliburton has demonstrated a strong margin performance as most of the firm's profitability margin and capital return measures are markedly above the par. The company's leverage level is fairly consistent with the group as reflected by its in-line debt to capitalization and debt to EBITDA ratios. In terms of liquidity, despite the negative trailing free cash flow margin, the figure is still above the group average. Due to the higher profitability, Halliburton was able to maintain an above-average interest coverage ratio. Both the firm's current and quick ratios are above the peer averages, reflecting a healthy corporate balance sheet.To summarize the financial comparisons, given Halliburton's in-line growth potential and relatively superior profitability performance, the stock valuation should reasonably deserve a slight premium over the peer-average level. Nevertheless, the current valuations at 6.5x forward EBITDA, 13.6x forward EPS, and 0.8x PEG are quite comparable to the peer-average trading multiples, suggesting that Halliburton shares are modestly undervalued on a relative basis.Further, the stock's trailing P/E multiple of 14.7x is currently trading at 15.1% discount to its 3-year average at 17.3x (see chart below). From my view, the lower valuation appears to be an attractive level provided that 1) Halliburton's capital return metrics including ROE, ROIC, and ROA have all trended down from their 3-year highs in 2011, but they remain fairly comparable to their historical level in early 2010; 2) the firm's various profitability margins have seen a similar trend over the same period; and 3) the growth trajectory for revenue, EBITDA, and EPS suggested by the consensus estimates shows a potential recovery and stabilization over the current and next years (see charts below).Moreover, Halliburton's forward P/E multiple is trading at 5.8% discount to the same multiple of the S&P 500 Index, which stands at 14.4x now (see chart below). Although the market discount has substantially reduced from its 1-year average of 23.0%, I expect Halliburton's P/E multiple has a potential to exceed the market level as the company's long-term estimated earnings of 17.6% is overwhelmingly above the average estimate of 8.2% for the S&P 500 companies.Additionally, in the company's recent Q4 2012 earnings release, management announced that the company's capita spending in 2013 will likely be 16% below the 2012 level. That would imply a potentially higher dividend payment or stock buyback as the company returns the capital to shareholders, which will modestly support the stock price in 2013.Most sell-side analysts are bullish on Halliburton. According to Thomson One, of the total 34 stock ratings, there are 12 strong buys, 18 buys, and only 8 holds. In a recent research note, Mike Urban, a research analyst at Deutsche Bank, elaborated on his view for the company's growth prospects in 2013, which I tend to agree on (sourced from Thomson One, Equity Research):Bottom line, despite the recent price appreciation, Halliburton is still trading at a tempting valuation level. In the light of the company's expected margin recovery and free cash flow expansion, a buy rating is warranted.The comparable analysis chart is created by the author, all other charts are sourced from Capital IQ, and all financial data shown in the article and the charts are sourced from Capital IQ unless otherwise noted.Disclosure: I am long HAL.

1141201,24491,2013-01-29T15:43:50-05:00,,"Late last week, oil services firm Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) reported fantastic fourth quarter results. Revenue jumped 3% year-over-year to $7.3 billion, easily exceeding consensus estimates and the best quarterly result in the company's history. Adjusted income from continuing operations was $0.63 per share, a few pennies higher than expected, but down significantly from a year ago.Margins in the Completion and Production (C&P) segment improved sequentially, but declined well over 1,000 basis points year-over-year to 13.9%. International results were excellent, with operating income growing 43% sequentially in Latin America, 22% in Europe/Africa, and 55% in Middle East/Asia. However, operating income in North America, Halliburton's largest segment, fell 26% sequentially due to seasonal factors, as well as pricing and cost pressures. Yet, management seemed somewhat optimistic about the North American C&P segment heading into 2013, noting:Shifting to North America, 2012 was a very challenging year for the industry. Operations we'e impacted by headwinds such as guar costs, pricing pressures and a significant drop in the natural gas rig activity. However I want to be clear before you listen to the rest of the presentation. We believe that the fourth quarter marked the bottom for U.S. land margins, and Jeff and Mark will tell you why we believe this.Management's argument anchored on the notion that other players will act rationally and not add capacity to an already oversupplied pressure-pumping market. While the firm doesn't see margins improving in 2013, it does believe it could mark the end of downward pricing and a slow advance toward market equilibrium could begin. Though we see the logic behind the argument, we remain cautious as energy producers have shown a willingness to act irrationally in the past.Drilling and Evaluation revenue increased 5% sequentially to $3 billion, with operating income jumping 13% sequentially, to $484 million. As with the C&P segment, earnings growth at foreign operations outpaced a declining North American market. Operating income in the firm's international operations is expected to decline sequentially due to seasonal adjustments, but the long-term investments in these foreign markets appear to be accretive.Overall, we liked the quarter, as well as some of the firm's innovations in fracking technology that helps boost drilling activity. The margin outlook for 2013 isn't great, but the firm is reducing capital expenditures by 16% in 2013, so free cash flow generation could be fantastic. Still, Halliburton scores just a 3 on the Valuentum Buying Index (our stock-selection methodology), so we won't be adding the name to the portfolio of our Best Ideas Newsletter at this time.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1040851,28511,2012-12-03T09:08:18-05:00,,"Malaysia-based Dialog Group has signed a $1.2 billion agreement with Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) to increase its output from an offshore oil field in East Malaysia. According to the deal, both companies will hold 50% stakes in their joint venture Halliburton Bayan Petroleum (NASDAQ:HBP) for a period of 24 years. HBP, which was previously a Halliburton subsidiary, is already working with the Malaysian state owned oil giant Petronas to boost the output from the mature Bayan oil field. The current agreement is in line with Dialog's strategy to further develop its mature oil assets for sustainable long term growth.Malaysia is home to one of Asia's largest oil reserves, mostly located offshore but maturing oil fields and little redevelopment has caused its output to fall by more than 26% from 860,000 bpd in 2004 to 630,000 bpd in 2011. During this period (2004-11) its GDP continued to rise - except for 2009 when it fell by 1.6% - and peaked at 7.2% in 2010. As the country's GDP rose from $124 billion in 2004 to $278 billion in 2011, the demand for oil also increased and the government started refocusing on the mature oil fields.Mature oil wells are those from whom now it requires a complex procedure that involves gas pumps and chemicals to extract more oil. All of the easily extracted oil, first through the oil's own natural pressure and second, by actively pumping is gone. At each stage of the well's life, obviously, the cost associated with extraction rises. According to one estimate, mature oil fields account for around 70% of the total global oil production, which is a number that should frighten anyone projecting lower oil prices in the long-term.However, like other Asian countries, such as China, Malaysia needed support from North American and European oil and gas companies as the country simply did not possess the technology to carry out the work itself. Petronas has worked in a joint venture earlier with Chevron (NYSE:CVX) in 2006 on Vietnamese offshore oil projects. About a year ago, Petronas started working with Shell (NYSE:RDS.A) on mature oil fields offshore of Sarawak and Sabah, Malaysia. Before that, in January 2011, the Malaysian government revealed that it expects Shell and Exxon to invest ~$4.9 billion on developing new oil and gas assets in the country.Looking forward, Halliburton's chief has made it clear that the coming quarters will be challenge due to volatile guar gum prices and the general economic slowdown in North America which has prompted its customers to cut costs. However, its international operations remain strong and its current expansion into Malaysia will provide diversity to its North American-focused portfolio.That said, however, International Energy Agency (NASDAQ:IEA) has said that despite having 90% lower oil reserves than Saudi Arabia, the United States could become the world's biggest crude oil producer by 2017, even if it is only short-lived. This is because U.S. has relatively more active drilling operations and is tapping into shale and tight oil. The shale oil output is increasing at an impressive pace and has gone up by 44% to the current 720,000 bpd. The increasingly complex procedure to extract shale oil, which requires hydraulic fracturing (or fracking), has been mastered by Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB), Baker-Hughes (BHI) and Halliburton.So, despite the current decline, all three firms are expected to gain more U.S. business in the coming years. In the short term, however, the oversupply of natural gas will continue to exert pressure on fracking service prices that are expected to fall by 14% in 2012 and 8% in 2013.Schlumberger has reported a 9.5% increase in earnings with a profit of $1.42 billion on the back of strong international operations. Unlike Halliburton, Schlumberger earns just 30% of its revenues from North America where customers are cutting back on drilling operations. In general, we love moves like this by the major oil and gas services companies which will benefit from improving natural gas prices in North America while securing deals to produce gas around the world. Our position on this sector has not changed, we like all three companies for different reasons and see all three as worthy of accumulation on dips to improve yield.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

The second largest oilfield service company reported its third quarter results on Wednesday.Third Quarter ResultsHalliburton reported third quarter revenues of $7.11 billion, up 8.6% on the year before. Reported revenues were roughly in line with analysts estimates.The company reported income from continuing operations of $625 million, or $0.67 per diluted share. Reported net income of $608 million came in at $0.65 per diluted share, down from $0.80 last year. The company took a $30 million charge related to acquisitions and reported a $13 million gain from a settlement of patent infringements. Earnings per share were in line with analysts expectations.Segmental InformationCompletion and ProductionRevenues for the completion and production division rose 6.7% on the year to $4.29 billion. Revenues fell 4% compared to the second quarter as a result of pricing pressure and reduced activity in North America. Operating income fell 35% to $591 million, compared to the second quarter. The decline in operating profits was the consequence of pricing pressure and increased costs for production enhancement services.Drilling and EvaluationRevenues for the drilling and evaluation business rose 11.7% on the year to $2.82 billion. Revenues increased 2% compared to the second quarter driven by a solid performance in Latin America and the Middle-East. Operating income rose 9% compared to the second quarter, to $430 million. The increase in profitability was driven by solid levels of activity in Canada, Mexico and the Middle-East.ValuationHalliburton ended its third quarter with $2.0 billion in cash and equivalents. The company operates with $4.8 billion in long term debt, for a modest net debt position of $2.8 billion.For the first nine months of 2012, Halliburton reported revenues of $21.2 billion. The company reported a net income of $1.97 billion, or $2.12 per diluted share. Full year revenues are expected to come in around $28 billion. Halliburton could earn around $2.6 billion, or $2.80 per diluted share.Currently, the market values the firm at $32.5 billion. This values the firm at 1.2 times annual revenues and 12 times annual earnings.Currently, Halliburton pays a quarterly dividend of $0.09 per share, for an annual dividend yield of 1.0%.Investment ThesisYear to date, shares of Halliburton are trading largely unchanged. Shares traded around $35 in January and fell to $27 at the start of the summer, as oil prices fell amidst fears about a global economic slowdown. Shares recovered to $37 in recent weeks, currently exchanging hands at $35 per share.Over the past five years, shares of Halliburton have fallen some 10%. Shares fell from $50 in 2008 to lows of $15 later that year. Shares steadily recovered to $55 in 2011 before falling back again. Between 2008 and 2012, revenues rose from $18.3 billion to an expected $28 billion in 2012. Net income rose from $2.2 billion to an expected $2.6 billion this year.The boom in the US oil and gas market has some unintended consequences. Oilfield suppliers like Halliburton and some of its competitors, were quick to provide the equipment at a time when oil and natural gas producers were scaling operations back. Earlier this year, natural gas prices hit record lows as a result of overcapacity caused by record drilling activity and a mild winter.To make things worse, margins came under more pressure as raw materials costs for drilling increased. Halliburton decided to stockpile guar, a key fracking fluid, in the second quarter. This decision is putting severe pressure on third quarter margins as prices of guar have begun to fall. The number of US oil rigs increased by 3% over the second quarter, while the number of gas rigs fell by 15%.Within the oil and gas supplier industry, Halliburton is my preferred choice. Shares trade at lower revenue and earnings multiples than many of its competitors, and the company has a relative robust balance sheet with a mere net debt position of $2.8 billion. Key triggers to watch are a recovery in natural gas rig counts, or a dividend hike.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Although the results of the auction have yet to be officially declared, industry officials mentioned that real estate firms, investment companies and coal companies put in more aggressive bids compared to large oil and gas companies, potentially allowing them to participate in China’s fledgling shale gas industry. [1] Taking into account the technical challenges involved in shale gas exploration, these firms will need to seek the services of oil field services contractors like Halliburton (NYSE:HAL).Chinese Shale Gas Reserves Largely Untapped   While shale gas has helped to redefine the energy landscape in countries like the United States where it now accounts for almost 20% of natural gas production, it has been off to a slow start in China despite the fact that it holds the world’s largest shale gas reserves. China began exploring for shale gas in 2009. The Chinese government is targeting 6.5 billion cubic meters of gas production by 2015 and about 100 billion cubic meters by 2020, however the progress has been relatively slow given that it has yet to begin commercial production. [2]How Will Halliburton Benefit?   There are several factors that have impeded shale gas exploration in China like a lack of geological data, poor supporting infrastructure, a dearth of technical know how and the country’s relatively scarce water resources, which is required for hydraulic fracturing.Unlike most oil and natural gas reservoirs that typically require drilling vertical wells, accessing shale gas deposits requires a complex technique of horizontal drilling. In conjunction with this, hydraulic fracturing is required to create cracks in the shale rocks and stimulate the flow of the gasses. While state-owned oil companies including the China National Petroleum Corporation have been investing in shale gas projects in the United States to gain expertise in shale technologies, private players and non-oil firms will be better off engaging contractors like Halliburton to carry out drilling and to provide technology. [3]Halliburton, one of the leading players in America’s shale gas boom, has a strong suite of  services aimed at the shale gas industry, which include technologies to reduce water consumption for fracking and 3-D mapping technologies to gather geological data, which would be valuable in the Chinese market.  If the firm is successful in winning shale gas drilling contracts in the Chinese market, it will increase its revenue per rig as well as EBITDA margins given that unconventional plays require a higher level of service intensity and command better rates.We have a price estimate of $41 for Halliburton, which is about 26% ahead of its current market price.Notes:Disclosure: No positions"
1080451,30071,2012-12-24T10:45:49-05:00,,"Oil service stocks have long been considered underpriced by analysts - as a group they traded well below analysis price targets throughout 2012. Analysts are expecting about 25% upside in Halliburton (NYSE:HAL), 27% upside in Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB), 20% in Baker Hughes (BHI), and over 35% in National Oilwell Varco (NYSE:NOV). These stocks have largely been unchanged throughout the year, with the exception of Baker Hughes which is down over 15% year-to-date.Most investors will not be looking closely at this industry as a healthy oil supply along with a weak economy have kept the price of oil at fairly low levels. Also while the price of natural gas has rebounded it still remains near historically low levels. Furthermore many people have low expectations for the economy in 2013. The CBO estimates if the fiscal cliff is avoided, that GDP will grow at just 1.7% for 2013. If the economy outperforms and there is any disruption in oil supply I think prices in 2013 could be higher than the market currently has priced in.Halliburton appears to be the most undervalued of these stocks. It has the lowest PEG and forward P/E ratio and along with Baker Hughes it has the lowest EV/EBITDA ratio. While Halliburton is the most dependent on North America for its revenues this also gives them more opportunity to gain international market share. One possible area Halliburton could see gains is in China. In the 3rd quarter the company attributed a 3% increase in revenue from the Middle East/Asia region in part to integrated drilling and completion services for shale gas wells provided in both China and Australia.Halliburton is focused on three segments of the oil services business: deepwater, unconventional and mature fields. Halliburton believes it has developed and is developing the best technologies to service these segments. The company highlights that it has doubled spending on technology in the past 5 years. These investments in technology will pay off for Halliburton as the industry increases spending on more highly technical oil fields.Halliburton has been and arguably still is in a consolidation pattern. When looking at the yellow triangle it appears Halliburton may have broken out to the upside, however I believe the upper white line could be a continuation of this consolidation. Longer term the stock is still defined by a trading range it has been in going back about 16 months, with $40 per share providing strong resistance on the upside and strong support coming in around $27. However through this fall the range has narrowed with the stock moving between $30 and $38. With natural gas prices in an uptrend and the possibility of an improving global economy in 2013, Halliburton could be set to break out of this trading range and give investors a nice return in the new year.Data sourced from: Company filings, and Yahoo Finance.

1099591,27361,2013-01-08T04:53:01-05:00,,"Looking at profitability is a very important step in understanding a company. Profitability is essentially why the company exists and a key component in deciding whether to invest or to remain invested in a company. There are many metrics involved in calculating profitability, but for this article, I will look at Halliburton Company's (NYSE:HAL) earnings and earnings growth, profit margins, profitability ratios and cash flow.Through the above-mentioned metrics, we will get an idea about the company's profitability over the past 5 years and a look at what to expect in the future.By comparing this summary to other companies such as Schlumberger NV (NYSE:SLB) and Baker Hughes Inc. (BHI), which are in the same sector, you will be able see which has been the most profitable.All material is sourced from Morningstar, MSN Money and Haliburton Company's webpage.Earnings and Earnings Growth1. Earnings = Sales x Profit MarginHalliburton's earnings have increased from $1.835 billion in 2010 to $2.872 billion in 2012 TTM. This is a increase of 56.51%.2. Five-year historical look at earnings growthIn looking at Halliburton's earnings over the past five years, you can see how the economic crisis affected the company's earnings.In 2009, Halliburton reported it's low in earnings compared to the last 5 years. This decrease was due to the ""response to the global recession, demand for oil and natural gas weakened, reducing global drilling activity and causing customers to change their priorities.""Since 2009, As the economy and commodity prices have been recovering, this has been reflective in the company's earnings. Since the low in 2009, the company's earnings have increased by 150.83%.Profit Margins3. Gross Profit = Total Sales - Cost of SalesIn analyzing a company, gross profit is very important because it indicates how efficiently management uses labor and supplies in the production process. More specifically, it can be used to calculate gross profit margin. Here are Halliburton's gross profits for the past two years:4. Gross Profit Margin = Gross Income / SalesThe gross profit margin is a measurement of a company's manufacturing and distribution efficiency during the production process. The gross profit tells an investor the percentage of revenue/sales left after subtracting the cost of goods sold. A company that boasts a higher gross profit margin than its competitors and industry is more efficient. Investors tend to pay more for businesses that have higher efficiency ratings than their competitors, as these businesses should be able to make a decent profit as long as overhead costs are controlled (overhead refers to rent, utilities, etc.).In reviewing Halliburton's gross margin over the past five years, we can see that the company's gross margin fell in 2009. The 5-year low for the gross margin was reported in 2009 with a margin of 14.96%. After the crisis in 2009, the high for the margin was reported in 2011. The 2011 margin was reported at 20.21%. The 2012 TTM gross profit margin of 17.25% is below the 5-year average of 18.70%.As the gross margin is below the 5-year average this implies that management has been less efficient in the company's manufacturing and distribution during the production process when compared to 2008.5. Operating income = Total Sales - Operating ExpensesThe amount of profit realized from the operations of a business after taking out operating expenses - such as cost of goods sold (COGS) or wages - and depreciation. Operating income takes the gross income (revenue minus COGS) and subtracts other operating expenses, then removes depreciation. These operating expenses are costs that are incurred from operating activities and include things such as office supplies and heat and power.6. Operating Margin = Operating Income / Total SalesOperating margin is a measure of the proportion of a company's revenue that is left over after paying for variable costs of production, such as wages, raw materials, etc. A healthy operating margin is required for a company to be able to pay for its fixed costs such as interest on debt. If a company's margin is increasing, it is earning more per dollar of sales. The higher the margin, the better.Compared to 2008, the operating margin has decreased. In 2008, the company reported an operating margin of 21.94%. In 2012 TTM, the company reported an operating margin of 16.30%. Since 2009, the operating margin has bounced between 13.59% and 19.08%.The 2012 TTM operating margin of 16.30% is below the 5-year average of 17.53%. This implies that there has been less of a percentage of the total sales left over after paying for variable costs of production such as wages and raw materials compared to the 5-year average.7. Net Profit Margin = Net Income / Total SalesThe net profit margin is a ratio of profitability calculated as net income divided by revenue, or net profits divided by sales. It measures how much out of every dollar of sales a company actually keeps in earnings.Profit margin is very useful when comparing companies in similar industries. A higher profit margin indicates a more profitable company that has better control over its costs compared to its competitors. Profit margin is displayed as a percentage - a 20% profit margin, for example, means the company has a net income of $0.20 for each dollar of sales.Over the past 3 years, Halliburton's net profit margin has revealed strength compared to 2009 and 2008. The latest net profit margin of 10.16% is above the 5-year average of 9.60%.As the 2012 TTM net profit margin of 10.16% is above the 5-year average of 9.60%, this implies that there has been an more of the percentage of earnings that the company is able to keep compared to the company's 5-year average.The above listed profitability margins are revealing that the company has been showing weakness when compared to 2008 but has been gaining strength when compared to 2009. This gives an idea of how the financial crisis affected Halliburton, but it also shows how the company is recovering.Profitability Ratios8. ROA - Return on Assets = Net Income / Total AssetsROA is an indicator of how profitable a company is relative to its total assets. ROA gives an idea as to how efficient management is at using its assets to generate earnings. Calculated by dividing a company's net income by its total assets, ROA is displayed as a percentage. Sometimes this is referred to as ""return on investment.""When comparing Halliburton's 2012 TTM ROA to its 2009 ROA, we can see that the percentage of return on assets is significantly higher. The current ROA of 10.92% is above the 2009 ROA of 6.92%.As the 2012 TTM ROA of 10.92% is above the 5-year average of 10.10%, this implies that management has had more of the ability to use the company's assets to generate earnings compared to the average of the last 5 years.9. ROE - Return on Equity = Net Income / Shareholders' EquityAs shareholders' equity is measured as a firm's total assets minus its total liabilities, ROE reveals the amount of net income returned as a percentage of shareholders' equity. The return on equity measures a company's profitability by revealing how much profit it generates with the amount shareholders have invested.Much like the ROA, the ROE has also revealed significant strength when compared to 2009. When comparing the 2009 to the 2012 TTM ROE, we can see that the percentage has strengthened. The 2009 ROE of 13.12% is much lower than the current ROE of 18.93%. As the ROE has strengthened over the past four years, this reveals that there has been an increase in how much profit has been generated compared to the amount that shareholders have invested.Cash Flows10. Free Cash Flow = Operating Cash Flow - Capital ExpenditureA measure of financial performance calculated as operating cash flow minus capital expenditures. Free cash flow (NYSE:FCF) represents the cash that a company is able to generate after laying out the money required to maintain or expand its asset base. Free cash flow is important because it allows a company to pursue opportunities that enhance shareholder value. Without cash, it's tough to develop new products, make acquisitions, pay dividends and reduce debt.It is important to note that negative free cash flow is not bad in itself. If free cash flow is negative, it could be a sign that a company is making large investments. If these investments earn a high return, the strategy has the potential to pay off in the long run.When reviewing the company's free cash flow, we can see that in all but one of the past five years, Halliburton's free cash flow has been negative.11. Cash Flow Margin = Cash Flow from Operating Activities / Total SalesThe higher the percentage, the more cash available from sales.If a company is generating a negative cash flow, it shows up as a negative number in the numerator in the cash flow margin equation. This means that even as the company is generating sales revenue, it is losing money. The company will have to borrow money or raise money through investors in order to keep on operating.As Halliburton's cash flow margin is positive, it does not have to take the above measures to continue operating.SummarySince 2008, the company's earnings have increased significantly. In 2009, the company reported its 5-year low in earnings. Since 2009, as the demand for oil and natural gas began to improve, the company reported a significant increase in earnings. This increase in demand has responded in a strong rebound since the economic crisis of 2008/2009.The listed profitability margins are revealing that the company has been showing weakness when compared to 2008 but has been gaining strength when compared to the low in 2009.Much like the ROA, the ROE has also revealed significant strength when compared to 2009. When comparing the 2012 TTM ROE to the 2009's ROE, we can see that the percentage has gained significantly. The 2009 ROE of 13.12% is much lower than the current ROE of 18.93%. As the ROE has increased over the past four years, this reveals that there has been an increase in how much profit has been generated compared to the amount that shareholders have invested.Over the past 5 years, Halliburton has posted negative cash four times. The company is generating positive cash but is using its cash to purchase assets. As the company is generating positive cash, this implies that the company does not have to borrow money or raise money through investors to keep operating.Looking forward:In 2013, Halliburton is looking at growth ahead. According to the latest Q3 report, Halliburton is anticipating strong energy demand. This increase in energy demand will increase the need for oil and gas service companies such as Halliburton, Schlumberger , Baker Hughes , Weatherford International (WFT) and supply companies such as National Oilwell Varco Inc. (NYSE:NOV) and Cameron Internation (NYSE:CAM).Over the next few years, analysis at Bloomberg Businessweek are predicting an increase in revenue in FY 2012 and revenue growth in 2013. Analysts are estimating revenues for FY 2012 at $28.3 billion and a revenue for 2013 at $29.2 billion.For another article on Halliburton please read: Analyzing Halliburton's Debt And Risk.For an excellent article on Energy read: The Best-Positioned Companies For 2013: Phil WeissDisclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

He cited Lloyd Blankfein's op-ed in the Wall Street Journal today as a possible catalyst as it highlighted energy as one of key drivers of his plan for an American Revival.

936221,29461,2012-10-19T17:46:00-04:00,,"We reiterate our bullish stance on the largest hydraulic fracturing service provider Halliburton (NYSE:HAL), based upon its attractive valuation and a significant upside of 62%. It is trading at a forward price to earnings of 10.3x, at discount when compared to the industry average of 13x. The stock has strong future prospects with an expected increase in natural gas consumption and its recent key business developments. In our opinion, the company will sustain its high profitability position with a sharp increase in consumption and production of natural gas in the coming years, as estimated by the United States Information Administration. Moreover, the company has shown impressive revenue growth of 20% over the last year. With a strong market position, wide variety of product lines, excellent performance in Mexico and Brazil and expected increase in drilling activities, HAL shows considerable promise with regards to future performance.Natural Gas Expected Demand and Supply:The United States Information Administration estimates that natural gas drilling activities are going to increase substantially, as shown in the graph below. Primarily, the structural shift towards natural gas and the cost efficiencies of the hydraulic fracturing process will boost its production and consumption in the coming period.Source: EIAHalliburton's Acquisition of Petris:The company's bright future prospects are justified in its recent developments. HAL recently acquired Petris Technology, which develops data-integration and is involved in management in the oil and gas industry. This acquisition would enable the company to bring more customers into its network, to aid customers in accessing their reservoir through superior technology, to manage the technical information regarding their well data and mission-critical data, and to bring more efficiency, effectiveness and competitiveness in their business.Up-Gradation of Pressure Control System:The company's Boots and Coots business product line has improved its pressure control system through the acquisition of Old School Services Company. This acquisition enables the company to aid its customers to resolve the problems encountered during horizontal and unconventional drilling. We believe this up-gradation is required by the company to sustain its high profits, as high energy demand is expected in the coming period.Advanced Perforating flow lab:HAL has developed a state-of-the-art perforating lab to expand its global perforating testing, research and development capabilities. In our opinion, this expansion will help its customers optimize their reservoir performance through high technology perforating solutions and enable Halliburton to improve its profitability situation.KnoesisSM:The company has launched a new service, named ""KnoesisSM"" to provide timely information to oil and gas companies about their reservoir and stimulation characteristics. This will help its customers optimize their drilling projects and become more efficient in terms of completion of the projects.Financials:The company's net income for this quarter decreased to $602 million, from $683 million in the same quarter of last year. This decrease was witnessed mainly due to the 53% decrease in the natural gas rig count in the United States. HAL's earnings per share have also declined to 65 cents, a 14% drop over the course of last one year. Customer bargaining power has suddenly increased due to less production activities. Halliburton's revenue from all geographical regions has increased considerably in the last one year, as depicted in the graph below. Its revenue from the North America region has increased considerably, from $10 billion in Q3 2011 to $12 billion in Q3 2012. The company is generating around 61% of its revenue from its completion and production business, which increased 20% over the course of last one year. On the other hand, revenue from its drilling and evaluation business also went up 17%.The company's third quarter earnings decreased due to lower fracturing prices, but we believe the expected increase in rig count (as it is increased by 9% in the last one week) will enable the company to restore its high profit margins.Valuation:We have revised our 2013 target price from $52 to $55 using the EV/EBITDA multiple, with a considerable upside of 62%. The company has outperformed our expectation on the stock. The stock is currently trading at 10.3x to its forward earnings, at discount when compared to its peers Baker Hughes, Schlumberger and Technip with forward price to earnings of 11.3x, 14.6x and 16.1x, respectively. The company's cheap valuations are reflected in its EV/EBITDA of 5.34x, which is lower than the industry average of 6.9x.Following are the details of HAL's valuation and target price of $55.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: The article has been written by Qineqt's Energy Analyst.

1135591,30071,2013-01-27T05:27:45-05:00,,"Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) reported 4th quarter and full year results before the market opened on Friday, January 25th. While earnings declined some 26% year-over-year the company beat estimates by six cents, earning an adjusted 67 cents per share in the quarter. Halliburton had record revenue in the 4th quarter of $7.3 billion up 3.2% year-over-year and 2.5% sequentially. Revenue for the year climbed 15% to $28.5 billion, also a record for the company; furthermore Halliburton has now seen revenue nearly double since 2009.International development is driving the growth in Halliburton and 2012 saw Halliburton providing services on the first commercial unconventional wells in Australia and China. Halliburton is also benefiting from investments in deepwater technology over the past few years and management believes this will be an important long term driver for the company. In the 4th quarter the company announced it had signed a contract to service mature TNK-BP tight oil reserves in Russia. Halliburton believes this is an important opportunity to showcase its expertise and help the company win future contracts in Russia. Management appears committed to an organic growth strategy in Russia where the company's market share is well behind Schlumberger Limited (NYSE:SLB) and Weatherford International Ltd. (WFT). Deals like the one with TNK-BP are an important step for Halliburton in Russia, the world's second largest oil producing nation.Halliburton believes that the 4th quarter marked the bottom for North American margins. North American operating margins in the quarter were only 12.4% and while the company believes significant margin gains are likely in 2013 there is no indication that margins will return to the mid 20% range anytime some. This market will benefit from no new equipment entering the market in 2013. Furthermore Halliburton will benefit in North America from decreasing guar gum costs and cost optimizations with the Frac of the Future. However the company believes even with the stabilizing of natural gas rig count in North America the market does not show signs of improving without a substantial increase in natural gas prices. Overall the company believes the North American rig count will be down in the low single digits compared with 2012, but will increase some throughout the year as activity increases.From the valuation perspective, even after the earnings beat, Halliburton looks undervalued compared with Schlumberger and Baker Hughes Incorporated (BHI). Halliburton has the lowest Forward P/E, PEG ratio, and EV/EBITDA ratio. While Halliburton's low dividend might be a disadvantage, the company said it will be focused on returning capital to shareholders in 2013 and that dividends and buybacks were on the table. Halliburton has significant room to increase the dividend with a payout ratio of around 12% and in the fourth quarter the company increased cash and investment securities by $779 million. One potential holdup is the ongoing litigation over the Macondo well blowout, however Transocean Ltd. (NYSE:RIG) recently settled with the DOJ, leaving only Halliburton who has not settled. I believe this means Halliburton's settlement on this from could happen soon.Halliburton remains one of my top picks for 2013 with the tailwinds in the North American market and the continued success internationally. Management's investments in technology over the past few years are beginning to payoff for the company and with the ability to scale back on capex spending in 2013 free cash flow should be strong over the next few years. However it could be worth it to wait for a small pullback before buying into this stock. The chart shows a stock that was consolidating and has now broken out to the upside. There is also a strong uptrend that has been in place since mid November and resistance in the $38 range that has now been broken. The time to enter now could be if the stock pulls back to the uptrend line and the former resistance line and holds at that level. This could provide the support the stock needs to make the move above $40 per share where I do not see any resistance until the $50 level.Data sourced from: Company filings, and Yahoo!Finance.

934521,30811,2012-10-19T02:21:43-04:00,,"Shares of Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) have recovered 36% from their 52-week low of $26.28 touched in June. Market sentiment for the stock is quite bullish. Of the 33 analyst ratings according to Thomson One, there are 10 strong buys, 15 buys, 7 holds, and only 1 underperform. The mean target price of $42.64 represents a 19% upside. However, I am of the view that the market may be overly optimistic, as the stock appears to be reasonably priced and the limited margin of safety would thus not justify the strong-buy sentiment. My opinion is based on the following analysis:HAL's discounted valuations relative to its peers appear to be justified by the company's financial fundamentals (see table below). Analysts on average forecast HAL's revenue, EBITDA, and EPS 2-year CAGRs to be 9.0%, 1.6%, and -0.7% over the current and next fiscal years. The estimations are substantially below the averages of 13.3%, 18.1%, and 26.9% for a peer group consisting of HAL's competitors, including Schlumberger Limited (NYSE:SLB) and Baker Hughes Inc. (BHI). HAL's EBITDA margin is predicted to shrink by 3.2% over the same period, compared to the peer average expansion of 1.0%.On the profit side, HAL's trailing gross margin is below the average, but the EBIT, EBITDA, and net income margins slightly outperforms the group averages. HAL's ROE and ROIC ratios appear to be the firm's bright spot, as they are at the highest level in the peer group. In terms of leverage and liquidity, HAL assumes a low leverage level, as reflected by the company's lower debt to capitalization and debt to EBITDA ratios. Although HAL's free cash flow remains weak, the negative FCF margin is fairly in line with the peer average. Both the firm's current and quick ratios are significantly above the peer averages, reflecting a fairly strong and liquid balance sheet.Click to enlargeIn summary of the financial comparisons, the growth potential appears to be HAL's major issue, and the stock should trade at a solid discount to account for the substantially weaker growth prospects. The current stock's valuations at 1.3x EV/Sales, 5.8x EV/EBITDA, 1.2x P/S, and 11.4x P/E (all on a trailing basis) represent an average discount of 31% to the peer-average trading multiples (see table above), suggesting a fair valuation in my opinion.Despite the fact that both HAL's trailing EV/EBITDA and P/E multiples are trading at 28% and 39%, respectively, discounts to their 3-year historical averages (see charts below), the company's estimated revenue and EPS growth in the current and next two fiscal years are significantly below the actual rates in FY2010 and FY2011 (see chart below).Comparing the company's current financials to the figures in exactly a year ago (see table below), HAL's revenue, EBITDA, and EPS growth estimates have dropped significantly by an average of 87%. The expected change in EBITDA margin has declined from 3.6% to -3.2%. All of the firm's profitability margin and capital return measures have largely come down, and all of the liquidity metrics have also become worse. Nevertheless, the stock's four valuation multiples have only compressed by an average of 10%, and its PEG ratio has, however, expanded by 61% from 0.37x to 0.59x, indicating the valuation has become more expensive over the past year.In spite of the 1-year stock price appreciation of 3.4%, HAL's revenue, EBITDA, and EPS estimates has experienced multiple downward revisions over the past 12 months (see tables below), meaning a pricier valuation.In addition to the unfavorable valuations, I also do not expect the company to raise dividends in the near term. Dividend per share has not changed since FY2008, primarily attributable to the company's lackluster free cash flow generation (see chart below). The annual free cash flow had declined from $1.1B to -$0.8B as of September 2012 on an LTM basis (see chart below). In the recent years, HAL's annual free cash flow was barely able to cover the dividend payments and share repurchase, and as such, I would not anticipate any near-term dividend hike and introduction of a large-scale share repurchase program.Moreover, following the recent Q3 earnings release, Global Hunter Securities cut its ratings for the stock from buy to neutral, with a lower price target of $38. Although Dahlman Rose reiterated its buy rating, it revised down its target price from $49 to $47 as a result of a lower EPS expectation.Bottom line, HAL appears fully priced based on the company's relative financial performance to that of its peers and there is almost no visibility into any growth and cash flow improvement down the road. To derive my 1-year target price, I applied a generous 10% premium over the stock's current trailing P/E multiple at 11.4x to account for any potential macro force (i.e. oil price) that would positively impact the stock price. Based on the average FY2013 EPS estimate of $3.14, my target price is then calculated to be $39.50. As such, I recommend a hold rating for the stock.Comparable analysis table is created by author, all other charts are sourced from Capital IQ, and all financial data is sourced from Morningstar, Thomson One, and Capital IQ.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

933671,25791,2012-10-18T16:42:26-04:00,,"(click image to enlarge)Halliburton Co. (NYSE:HAL) reports preliminary financial results for the quarter ended 2012-09-30.Halliburton Co. recently reported its preliminary financial results, based on which CapitalCube provides a unique peer-based analysis of the company. Our analysis is based on the company's performance over the last 12 months (unless stated otherwise).Halliburton Co.'s analysis versus peers uses the following peer-set: Schlumberger Ltd. (NYSE:SLB), National Oilwell Varco Inc. (NYSE:NOV), Baker Hughes Inc. (BHI), Cameron International Corp. (NYSE:CAM), Technip S.A. ADS (TKPPY.PK), Weatherford International Ltd. (WFT), Oceaneering International Inc. (NYSE:OII), Dresser-Rand Group Inc. (NYSE:DRC), Superior Energy Services Inc. (SPN), and SEACOR Holdings Inc. (NYSE:CKH). The table below shows the preliminary results, along with the recent trend for revenues, net income and returns.Valuation DriversHalliburton Co. trades at a lower Price/Book multiple (2.1) than its peer median (6.4). We classify Halliburton Co. as Harvesting because of the market's low expectations of growth (PE of 11.1 compared to peer median of 19.2), despite its relatively high returns (ROE of 21.0% compared to the peer median ROE of 13.0%).The company's median net profit margins of 10.2% and relative asset efficiency (asset turns of 1.2x compared to peer median of 0.8x) give it some operating leverage. Halliburton Co.'s net margin is less than (but within one standard deviation of) its five-year average net margin of 11.4%.Economic MoatThe company enjoys both better than peer median annual revenue growth of 38.1%, and better than peer median earnings growth performance 67.4%. Halliburton Co. currently converts every 1% of change in annual revenue into 1.8% of change in annual reported earnings. We view this company as a leader among its peers.Halliburton Co.'s return on assets is above its peer median, both in the current period (12.2% vs. peer median 6.0%), and also over the past five years (12.6% vs. peer median 8.5%). This performance suggests that the company's relatively high operating returns are sustainable.The company's gross margin of 25.3% is around peer median, suggesting that Halliburton Co.'s operations do not benefit from any differentiating pricing advantage. However, Halliburton Co.'s pre-tax margin is more than the peer median (15.1% compared to 11.1%), suggesting relatively tight control on operating costs.Growth And Investment StrategyWhile Halliburton Co.'s revenue growth has been above the peer median (10.7% vs. 6.0% respectively for the past three years), the stock's PE ratio of 11.1 is less than the peer median. This implies that the company's earnings are peaking, and the market expects a decline in its growth expectations.Halliburton Co.'s annualized rate of change in capital of 20.3% over the past three years is around the same as its peer median of 18.5%. This investment has generated a better than peer median return on capital of 13.8% averaged over the same three years. The greater than peer median rate of return suggests that the company may be under-investing in growth.Earnings QualityHalliburton Co.'s net income margin for the last 12 months is around the peer median (10.2% vs. peer median of 8.7%). This average margin and relatively conservative accrual policy (1.2% vs. peer median of 0.8%) suggests possible understatement of its reported net income.Halliburton Co.'s accruals over the last 12 months are around zero. However, this modestly positive level is also greater than the peer median, which suggests some amount of building of reserves.Trend ChartsCompany ProfileHalliburton Co. provides oil and gas exploration and its related services. The company adds value through the entire lifecycle of oil and gas reservoirs and integrates products and services, starting with exploration and development, moving through production, operations, maintenance, and conversion and refining, to infrastructure and abandonment.

847371,24491,2012-09-05T12:06:03-04:00,,"With Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) falling significantly from its recent highs set in July of last year, we though it important to share our thoughts on the firm's valuation and whether it exhibits both value and momentum characteristics, two qualities that -- when combined -- have a solid possibility of generating alpha.Click to enlarge images.Investment ConsiderationsInvestment HighlightsHalliburton earns a ValueCreation™ rating of Excellent, the highest possible mark on our scale. The firm has been generating economic value for shareholders for the past few years, a track record we view very positively. Return on invested capital (excluding goodwill) has averaged 19.1% during the past three years.The company looks fairly valued at this time (it is trading within our fair value range). We expect the firm to trade within our fair value estimate range for the time being. If the firm's share price fell below $32, we'd take a closer look at adding it to the market-beating portfolio of our Best Ideas Newsletter. However, based on our fair value point estimate, we see upside to the mid-$40s.Halliburton's cash flow generation and financial leverage aren't much to speak of. The firm's free cash flow margin has averaged about 2.6% during the past three years, lower than the mid-single-digit range we'd expect for cash cows. However, the firm's cash flow should be sufficient to handle its low financial leverage.Although we think there may be a better time to dabble in the firm's shares based on our DCF process, the firm's stock has outperformed the market benchmark during the past quarter, indicating increased investor interest in the company. Halliburton scores a 6 on our Valuentum Buying Index, which considers that it is trading within our fair value range on bullish technicals.The firm experienced a revenue CAGR of about 10.7% during the past three years. We expect its revenue growth to be below that of its peer median during the next five years.Economic Profit AnalysisThe best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital (ROIC) with its weighted average cost of capital (WACC). The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. Halliburton's three-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 19.1%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 9.9%. As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreation™ rating of Excellent. In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate.Cash Flow AnalysisFirms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. Halliburton's free cash flow margin has averaged about 2.6% during the past three years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generation is relatively medium. The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. At Halliburton, cash flow from operations increased about 59% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures expanded about 58% over the same time period.Valuation AnalysisWe think Halliburton is worth $45 per share, which represents a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 13.8 times last year's earnings and an implied EV/EBITDA multiple of about 7.1 times last year's EBITDA. Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 8.7% during the next five years, a pace that is lower than the firm's three-year historical compound annual growth rate of 10.7%. Our model reflects a five-year projected average operating margin of 16.4%, which is below Halliburton's trailing three-year average. Beyond year five, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 4% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For Halliburton, we use a 9.9% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows.Margin of Safety AnalysisOur discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $45 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future was known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values.Our ValueRisk™ rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock. In the graph below, we show this probable range of fair values for Halliburton. We think the firm is attractive below $32 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $59 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion.Future Path of Fair ValueWe estimate Halliburton's fair value at this point in time to be about $45 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart below compares the firm's current share price with the path of Halliburton's expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate.The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in year three represents our best estimate of the value of the firm's shares three years hence. This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the firm's future cash flow potential change. The expected fair value of $59 per share in year three represents our existing fair value per share of $45 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.Pro Forma Financial StatementsDisclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

869411,24389,2012-09-16T01:27:38-04:00,,"Edited By Marianna AvilkinaHalliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) is one of the top providers of oil services, from pressure pumping to drilling. Over time, Halliburton has integrated its services into a single solution. Thanks to this policy, customers can obtain increased well performance, and reduce nonproductive time, by standardizing with Halliburton's services rather than combining services from several service providers. Thus, the company provided all-in-one solution to its partners. Halliburton is a global company. In 2011, 58% of the company's revenues came from North America while the rest was attributed to international ventures.As of September 15, Halliburton stock was trading at around $37, with a 52-week range of $26.28-$40.60. It has a market cap of $35.7 billion. The trailing twelve-month P/E ratio is 11.04, and the forward P/E ratio is 10.67. P/B, P/S, and P/CF ratios stand at 2.5, 1.3, and 10.4, respectively. Its operating margin is 18%, whereas net profit margin is 10.7%. Halliburton has minor debt issues thanks to a low debt/equity ratio of 0.3.Halliburton pays stable dividends - the trailing yield of 0.99% is the same as the forward one. Over the last five years, the company has been paying the same quarterly dividend at 9 cents per share, amounting to 36 cents annual dividend. Consequently, the quarterly dividend is expected to be 9 cents in the coming year as well. While, the dividend yield is low, five-year dividend history suggests that Halliburton is a regular dividend payer.Halliburton has a four-star rating from Morningstar. Out of eight analysts covering the company, all eight have a ""buy"" rating. Wall Street has a largely positive outlook for the company's future. The average five-year annualized growth forecast estimate is 21.30%. What is the fair value of Halliburton given the forecast estimates? We can estimate Halliburton's fair value using discounted earnings plus equity model as follows.Discounted Earnings Plus Equity ModelThis model is primarily used for estimating the returns from long-term projects. It is also frequently used to price fair-valued IPOs. The methodology is based on discounting the present value of the future earnings to the current period:V = E0 + E1 /(1+r) + E2 /(1+r)2 + E3/(1+r)3 + E4/(1+r)4 + E5/(1+r)5 + Disposal ValueV = E0 + E0 (1+g)/(1+r) + E0(1+g)2/(1+r)2 + … + E0(1+g)5/(1+r)5 + E0(1+g)5/[r(1+r)5]The earnings after the last period act as a perpetuity that creates regular earnings:Disposal Value = D = E0(1+g)5/[r(1+r)5] = E5 / rWhile this formula might look scary for many of us, it easily calculates the fair value of a stock. All we need is the current-period earnings, earnings growth estimate, and the discount rate. To be as objective as possible, I use Morningstar data for my growth estimates. You can set these parameters as you wish, according to your own diligence.ValuationHistorically, the average return of the DJI has been around 11% (including dividends). Therefore, I will use 11% as my discount rate. In order to smooth the results, I will also take the average of ttm EPS along with the mean EPS estimate for the next year.E0 = EPS = ($3.39 + $3.51) / 2 = $3.45Wall Street holds diversified opinions on the company's future. While analysts tend to impose subjective opinions on their estimates, the average analyst estimate is a good starting point. Average five-year growth forecast is 21.3%. Book value per share is $15.70. The rest is as follows:(You can download FED+ Fair Value Estimator, here.)I decided to add the book value per share so that we can distinguish between a low-debt and debt-loaded company. The lower boundary does not include the book value. According to my five-year discounted-earnings-plus-book-value model, the fair-value range for Halliburton is between $75 and $91 per share. At a price of $37, Halliburton stock is excessively undervalued; the stock has at least 100% upside potential to reach its fair value.Peer PerformanceWhile there are many companies in the oil and gas services industry, Baker Hughes (BHI) is probably the closest competitor of Halliburton. To assess how much profit companies generate on the money shareholders have invested, we consider return on equity. Halliburton has a trailing twelve-month ROE of 22.6%, while Baker's rate is twice as low. Obviously, Halliburton has a relatively strong advantage in terms of profitability However, Baker's stock is also extremely undervalued these days, as its stock has at least 130% upside potential to reach its fair value. Over the last five years, Halliburton and Baker Hughes have been offering steadfast dividends, amounting to $0.09 and $0.15, respectively. However, in terms of dividend yield, Baker Hughes looks more attractive to investors.Another competitor, Schlumberger Limited (NYSE:SLB) also has an underpriced stock with 22% upside potential to reach its fair value. However, SLB's ttm P/E ratio of 19.45 is far above that of Halliburton. In contrast to both BHI and Halliburton, SLB pays a superior dividend of $0.275 per share.The chart below shows Halliburton's performance against its main competitors over the last five years:HAL data by YChartsCurrent Economic OutlookHalliburton's involvement in the Gulf of Mexico oil spill may be a cause of concern for investors. However, the evidence and public records suggest that the company had little to do with the oil spill. The company expects margins from North America to improve by the start of 2013. What further strengthens this forecast is the $1,105,200 investment into shares, made by the company director, Murray Gerber. This is by far the clearest sign that the insiders have strong expectations for the company's growth in the future, and should be welcome news to investors.The company expects to have an EPS of $3.50 and revenues of up to $26.9 billion in 2013. When compared to 2011′s EPS of $3.08 on sales of $24.8 billion, the stock seems like a bargain. Furthermore, many gas producers are shifting to oil production to take advantage of better commodity prices. The extensive nature of oil exploration puts Halliburton's services in greater demand.SummaryWhen it comes to stocks, there is a rule of thumb: if the price has not yet caught up with the strong earnings growth, that stock is a ""must-buy."" Halliburton's strong revenue, operating margins, stable EPS and continued payment of dividends ensure that the company does indeed have strong earnings.However, based on my FED+ valuation, Halliburton stock has not reached its fair value and this stock has at least 110% upside potential to reach its fair minimum. The earnings uptrend is more likely to pull up the undervalued stock. This is why now would be a smart time to obtain Halliburton stock, before the stock achieves its eventual fair value. The stock has not performed well over the last 5 years. However, if analysts' estimates hold, Halliburton might just become one of the best buys in the current market.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

930391,27151,2012-10-17T14:42:06-04:00,,"When it comes to gum, most people think of that chewy substance some of us get stuck on our shoe from time to time. The one thing we don't often think of when it comes to gum, is the Oil & Gas powerhouse, Halliburton (NYSE:HAL). According to an article featured in Wednesday's Wall Street Journal, gum, and more specifically 'Guar Gum' is as the forefront of the company's latest earnings report.So what exactly is Guar Gum, and why should investors be concerned over Halliburton's efforts to stockpile as much as the company can? According to FRx-Inc., ""The fluid most commonly used during hydraulic fracturing is guar gum gel. Guar gum is a food additive derived from the guar bean. Guar gum forms short-chained polymers when mixed into water, resulting in a solution that has the consistency of mineral oil"". Considering the fact Halliburton is the second-largest oil-field-services company in the world, Guar Gum is a crucial component of its business, except for the fact the company guessed wrong and as a result investors will now have to face the consequences.According to Erin McBride, of the Motley Fool, ""the sudden increase over the past two years in fracking, the demand for guar has skyrocketed, and along with it, the cost. The price two years ago was about $1 per pound for guar powder. The commodity peaked at approximately $12 per pound. The price of guar has come down in recent weeks to about $5 per pound, and that decline is likely to continue"". The erratic behavior in the price of Guar Gum over the last 24 months demonstrates that fact that Halliburton, and companies such as Baker Hughes, Inc. (BHI) and Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB), hadn't had a true grip on the necessary commodity and as a result clearly paid a price that would affect earnings for quarters if not years to come. One of the things Halliburton noted in its recent earnings report was the fact that ""in North America, revenue was down 5% and operating income was down, driven mainly by pricing pressure in hydraulic fracturing, guar cost inflation, and activity disruptions due to Hurricane Isaac. We are also seeing activity reductions by some of our customers as they continue to moderate activity to operate within their stated 2012 budgets"".Final AnalysisBased on my analysis it seems pretty clear that potential investors looking to establish a position in companies such as Halliburton, Schlumberger, and Baker Hughes, Inc. should begin to look for alternative investment vehicles. Why? If we consider the fact that Halliburton's earnings came in-line with street estimates of $0.67/share on revenue of $7.1 billion most investors would see those numbers as being fair. However, if we take into consideration the fact that many analysts ""had penciled-in 87 cents (as recently as May) and, at the beginning of the year, they were projecting a little over a dollar"", we would notice a decline of nearly 33% in terms of earnings expectations due largely in part to the company's stock piling of Guar Gum. Although all three companies trade at P/E ratios under 16, and pay an average yield of 1.3%, I'd wait for a sell-off of at least 3%-5% before establishing a position.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

855791,24018,2012-09-10T06:28:00-04:00,,"Halliburton Co (NYSE:HAL) has taken a beating of late. The company has been saddled with several investment overhangs, management has been criticized roundly, and the share price action has been horrible. The stock has lost about 18 percent over the past year.Halliburton Co -- One-Year Price and Volume(bigcharts.com)Rarely have the shares traded this cheaply.An Investment ThesisHalliburton stock has been oversold big-time. By reasonable and historic measures, the shares are undervalued.The balance sheet remains strong. Three overhangs have further hampered the company: the BP/Macondo incident, the spike in guar gum prices, and the redeployment of North American land-based rigs from dry gas to liquids drill sites. However, these issues are playing themselves out reasonably. They are not long-term problems.Strong Balance SheetHAL possesses a solid balance sheet. Debt-to-equity is 33 percent, a sound figure indicating relatively low levels of debt. Competitors Schlumberger (SLB) and Baker-Hughes (BHI) tout similar ratios. Weatherford International (WFT) carries significantly more debt.Liquidity, as measured by the current ratio, is likewise strong. Halliburton's CR mark of 2.8 is similarly matched by its competitors. A current ratio above 1.0 is generally adequate.I also like to check a company's Equity / Assets ratio. Ben Graham, the father of value investing, looked for this benchmark to be greater than 0.5 when screening for strong businesses. Halliburton clocks in with a 0.57 mark. This figure has remained unchanged since early 2011. Total long-term debt has been stable for the past year.Trailing twelve month return-on-equity and return-on-assets are 23 and 13 percent, respectively. Annualized returns using the most recent quarter are slightly lower. However, all the aforementioned returns are superior to major competitors SLB, BHI and WFT.Indeed, despite recent earnings / margins disappointment, the balance sheet has shown no deterioration. Halliburton continues to offer fundamental ratios as good or better than their competitors.Margins, Earnings and CashHAL management focuses upon operating margin (EBIT / Revenue) as their primary financial metric. Margins have deteriorated in 2012. See the table below for perspective:Furthermore, operating margins in North America have dropped considerably. North America represents more than half of Halliburton's total revenues.Compounding the near-term problems, last week HAL management announced that they expected North America margins to compress an additional 2.5 to 3 percent in the third quarter.Meanwhile, earnings are projected to be about flat in 2012. A recent consensus estimate comes in about $3.21 for the year. This compares with $3.37 for full-year 2011 results. Despite the drop, it should be noted that the company has not missed analyst earnings estimates for the last fourteen quarters. Glossing that record is the fact that management has beat the consensus EPS in eight of those quarters.Operating cash flows have been dragged down along with margins. The company's FCF (free cash flow) has gone negative for the first two quarters of the year. Nevertheless, this does not cause me great alarm given the Halliburton's strong balance sheet, good liquidity, and short-term nature of the problems causing these effects.For the record, the shares include a modest dividend that currently yields about one percent.The ""Overhangs""Now let's talk about the corporate overhangs behind the share weakness. As noted earlier, I see three issues weighing down the company in the near-term.The number of natural gas rigs operating in North America hit a twelve-year low recently. This is not surprising, nor is it a long-term phenomenon. The price of natural gas has cratered in 2012. Indeed, the U.S. storage capacity for such gas is stretched. Consequently, drilling companies are reacting in two ways: they are reducing the number of new wells, and they are moving existing equipment from dry gas sites to liquid-rich hydrocarbon plays. HAL management has stated their intent to defend their North America onshore oil service leadership position even if it means taking a short-term hit. The immediate result has been a loss of revenue as rigs are shut down and transported to new locations.Instead of walking away from the activity, Halliburton has chosen to stick with the drillers, wait, and continue to service their rigs once redeployed. While this had captured market share and built solid business relationships, it is a near-term loser.I believe HAL is wise for taking a long view. Management has decided that building customer loyalty during transition times is worthwhile for two reasons. First, the oil service business is local and relationship driven; what goes around comes around. Second, I suggest that the long-term prognosis for North America drilling activity has taken a rest, not a dive. The quest and need for energy here in the U.S. will trump politics and current oversupply / pricing weakness.Guar gum is a key ingredient for oil well fracturing operations. It has a significant bearing on gross margins for this oil service work. Guar is an agricultural material, most of which is grown overseas. Early this year, the price of guar spiked upon fears upon fears of a 2012 shortage. Halliburton CEO David Lesar made the decision to load up on guar gum at the top of the market. His rationale was that he wanted to ensure that Halliburton had an adequate supply throughout the year to serve all customers. It was another verse from the ""We must defend the North American market"" songbook. Subsequently, the material price came back down: partly due to market conditions and partly due to synthetic substitutes gaining some traction in the field.Mr. Lesar came back and acknowledged the error to analysts and shareholders. He took responsibility for the judgment, and admitted the decision was a mistake. It will take most of the second half of 2012 to work off the excess.While the decision was unfortunate, the underlying issue is not long-term. The executive made a choice: serve the customer first. It was consistent with the earlier decision to build customer confidence in the wake of rig re-deployment and associated inefficiencies. So be it.Lastly, the potential for government fines and legal liability for the BP Deepwater Horizon rig tragedy has hampered the company since the accident and explosion. Sharp rhetoric has been tossed around by all parties subject to litigation. Halliburton management has consistently denied liability based upon their actions and the associated contracts.It appears they were largely correct. Private litigation has tilted towards the HAL position. On September 5, a news release further distanced Halliburton from the incident. BP was cited by the U.S. Government for gross negligence and willful misconduct; Transocean was likewise named in the litigation. However,Earlier, HAL took a charge of $300 million for legal costs and liabilities associated with the incident. An explanation of the incident and rationale for the liability account is found in the recent Halliburton 10-Q filings.Let's Talk about ValuationGoing forward, are the shares undervalued, at fair value, or overvalued?I view the shares as undervalued.Here's why:The problems are near-term and will work themselves out. However, the market has punished HAL share as if these issues are intractable and sure to get worse. Typically, a company's share price follows its earnings. If the proper P/E multiple is placed upon those earnings, a reasonable target valuation can be determined. In addition, most securities ""revert to the mean."" Stated differently, over time the market gets it right. Shares reflect the fair value correlation between earnings and price.In the case of Halliburton, over the past 11 years, the historical multiple that market has placed upon the shares has been approximately 17X. Indeed, it's sometimes higher and sometimes lower, but the mean has been about 17 times operating earnings.This can be justified by the operating EPS growth rate over the same period: about 15.7 percent. This offers a backward PEG ratio of about one. Once again, this is reasonable. The market has fairly compensated Halliburton shareholders over the years for the growth of the company.Going forward, the analysts' consensus suggest that the five-year growth rate will be about the same 16 percent. These figures can be found via S&P IQ, Zacks, MSN money or other sources.Therefore, if we compare the current P/E with the historic multiple, and we can make a decent estimate as to the future earnings, investors can determine a reasonable valuation for the shares.The following 11-year graph puts all of the foregoing in context.(courtesy of fastgraphs.com)Price: $34.24 on 09/07/2012 (black line)Current P/E: 10.5Normal 11-Year PE Ratio 17.3X (blue line)Operating Earnings 11-Year Growth Rate = 15.7%PEG x 15.7 (orange line)HAL shares have suffered from significant P/E compression versus historic norms. The shares are currently undervalued. The current price (black line) is significantly beneath either the historical P/E multiple or an assigned P/E multiple based upon long-term observable earnings growth.The reader may note, that over time, the shares always come back to ""fair value"" by crossing the P/E historical or earnings-justified lines.Notably, the consensus operating earnings for 2013 and 2014 are $3.60 and $4.34.Bottom LineHalliburton has had a rough stretch. Recent management direction and lingering overhangs have resulted in investors losing confidence in the company and its shares. However, the issues associated with the poor stock price have been addressed or are being worked through. In the meantime, the shares have become oversold based upon historical standards. This provides a potential opportunity for investors.A Final NoteBack in April 2011, I wrote a Seeking Alpha article advocating Halliburton. At the time, the share price was over $45. A link to that article is found here.In hindsight, the stock price action clearly missed the mark. However, the underlying company performance did not fall apart. Therefore, over the past year, I continued to buy into the subsequent price weakness since the fundamentals and long-term thesis remained acceptable.I had projected 2012 earnings to be $3.51 with a P/E multiple of 17X for a $60 price target. The current consensus EPS estimate is $3.21, or an 8.5 percent miss. The P/E multiple has been crushed down to 10.5X. This has resulted in excessive undervaluation.Since I generally measure investments in terms of years, not days or weeks, the price action has been a chance to acquire more shares at a firesale price.Disclosure: I am long HAL.

Having an understanding of a company's debt and liabilities is a key component in understanding the risk of a company, thus aiding in the decision to invest, not to invest, or to stay invested in a company. There are many metrics involved in understanding the debt of a company, but for this article, I will look at Halliburton Company's (NYSE:HAL) total debt, total liabilities, debt ratios and WACC.Through the above-mentioned four main metrics, we will understand more about the company's debt, liabilities and risk. If this summary is compared with other companies in the same sector, you will be able see which has the most debt and the most risk.All material is sourced from Google Finance, Morningstar and the company webpage.1. Total Debt = Long-Term Debt + Short-Term DebtDebt is an amount of money borrowed by one party from another, and must be paid back. Total debt is the sum of long-term debt, which is debt that is due in one year or more, and short-term debt, which is any debt that is due within one year.Halliburton's total debt has been increasing over the past five years. In 2007, Halliburton reported a total debt of $2.786 billion. In 2011, the company reported a total debt of $4.820 billion. Over the past 5 years, Halliburton's total debt has increased by 73.0%.2. Total LiabilitiesLiabilities are a company's legal debts or obligations that arise during the course of business operations, so debts are one type of liability, but not all liabilities. Total liabilities is the combination of long-term liabilities, which are the liabilities that are due in one year or more, and short-term or current liabilities, which are any liabilities due within one year.Halliburton's liabilities have been increasing over the past 5 years. In 2007, the company reported liabilities at $6.269 billion; in 2011, the company reported liabilities at $10.479 billion. This is an increase of 67.16%.In analyzing Halliburton's total debt and liabilities, we can see that the company currently has a total debt of $4.820 billion and liabilities at $10.479 billion. Over the past five years, the total debt has increased by 73.0%, while total liabilities have increased by 67.16%. As the company's amount of debt and amount of liabilities have been increasing over the past 5 years, the next step will reveal if the company has the ability to pay them.Debt Ratios3. Total Debt to Total Assets Ratio = Total Debt / Total AssetsThis is a metric used to measure a company's financial risk by determining how much of the company's assets have been financed by debt. It is calculated by adding short-term and long-term debt and then dividing by the company's total assets.A debt ratio of greater than 1 indicates that a company has more total debt than assets; meanwhile, a debt ratio of less than 1 indicates that a company has more assets than total debt. Used along with other measures of financial health, the total- debt-to-total-assets ratio can help investors determine a company's level of risk.As Halliburton's total-debt-to-total-assets ratio has been decreasing over the past 3 years. This indicates that the company has been adding more assets than total debt. This is a positive signal if the company is making money on those assets. As the number is currently below 1 and decreasing, this states that the risk to the company regarding its debt to assets has been decreasing over the past three years.4. Debt ratio = Total Liabilities / Total AssetsTotal liabilities divided by total assets. The debt ratio shows the proportion of a company's assets that is financed through debt. If the ratio is less than 0.5, most of the company's assets are financed through equity. If the ratio is greater than 0.5, most of the company's assets are financed through debt. Companies with high debt/asset ratios are said to be ""highly leveraged."" A company with a high debt ratio or that is ""highly leveraged"" could be in danger if creditors start to demand repayment of debt.In looking at Halliburton's total liabilities to total assets ratio, we can see that the ratio has decreased slightly over the past three years. As these numbers are below the 0.50 mark, this indicates that Halliburton has not financed most of the company's assets through debt, but though its equity. This indicates a good level of financial health for the company.5. Debt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Shareholders' EquityThe debt-to-equity ratio is another leverage ratio that compares a company's total liabilities with its total shareholders' equity. This is a measurement of how much suppliers, lenders, creditors and obligators have committed to the company versus what the shareholders have committed.A high debt-to-equity ratio generally means that a company has been aggressive in financing its growth with debt. This can result in the company reporting volatile earnings. In general, a high debt-to-equity ratio indicates that a company may not be able to generate enough cash to satisfy its debt obligations, and therefore is considered a riskier investment.Over the past three years, Halliburton's debt-to-equity ratio has bounced around from a low of 0.76 to a high of 0.89. As the ratio is below 1, this indicates that shareholders have more equity invested than suppliers, lenders, creditors and obligators. 0.79 indicates a moderately low amount of risk for the company. As the ratio is below 1 and considered moderately low, so is the risk for the company.6. Capitalization Ratio = LT Debt / LT Debt + Shareholders' Equity(LT Debt = Long-Term Debt)The capitalization ratio tells the investors about the extent to which the company is using its equity to support its operations and growth. This ratio helps in the assessment of risk. Companies with a high capitalization ratio are considered to be risky because they are at a risk of insolvency if they fail to repay their debt on time. Companies with a high capitalization ratio may also find it difficult to get more loans in the future.Over the past three years, Halliburton's capitalization ratio has decreased from 0.30 to 0.27. This implies that the company has had slightly more equity compared with its long-term debt. As this is the case, the company has had more equity to support its operations and add growth through its equity. As the ratio is decreasing and still very low financially, this implies a low amount of risk to the company.7. Cash Flow to Total Debt Ratio = Operating Cash Flow / Total DebtThis coverage ratio compares a company's operating cash flow with its total debt. This ratio provides an indication of a company's ability to cover total debt with its yearly cash flow from operations. The higher the percentage ratio, the better the company's ability to carry its total debt. The larger the ratio, the better a company can weather rough economic conditions.Over the past three years, the cash flow to total debt ratio has been increasing. Like many of the ratios listed above, this indicates a strengthening of the company. Even though the ratio is increasing, the ratio is still below 1. As the ratio is below 1, this implies that the company does not have the ability to cover its total debt with its yearly cash flow from operations.Based on the five debt ratios listed above, we can see that Halliburton's ratios have strengthened over the past 3 years. Even though the debt and liabilities have increased, the ratios indicate that the company's growth has been stronger than the increase in debt and liabilities. As this is the case, the ratios indicate a decreasing amount of financial risk to the company over the last 3 years. The next step will reveal how much the company will pay for the debt incurred.Cost of DebtThe cost of debt is the effective rate that a company pays on its total debt.As a company acquires debt through various bonds, loans and other forms of debt, the cost of debt metric is useful, because it gives an idea as to the overall rate being paid by the company to use debt financing.This measure is also useful because it gives investors an idea as to the riskiness of the company compared with others. The higher the cost of debt the higher the risk.8. Cost of debt (before tax) = Corporate Bond rate of company's bond rating.According to the S&P rating guide, the ""A"" rating is - ""Strong capacity to meet financial commitments but somewhat susceptible to adverse economic conditions and changes in circumstances."" Halliburton Company has a rating that meets this description.9. Current tax rate (Income Tax total / Income before Tax)5-year average = 31.95%Over the past five years, Halliburton Company has averaged a tax rate of 31.95%.10. Cost of Debt (After Tax) = (Cost of debt before tax) (1 - tax rate)The effective rate that a company pays on its current debt after tax.The cost of debt after tax for Halliburton Company is 2.63%Cost of equity or R equity = Risk free rate + Beta equity (Average market return - Risk free rate)The cost of equity is the return a firm theoretically pays to its equity investors, for example, shareholders, to compensate for the risk they undertake by investing in their company.Risk free rate + Beta equity (Average market return - Risk free rate)Halliburton has a cost of equity or R Equity of 9.93%, so investors should expect to get a return of 9.93% per-year average over the long term on their investment to compensate for the risk they undertake by investing in this company.(Please note that this is the CAPM approach to finding the cost of equity. Inherently, there are some flaws with this approach and that the numbers are very ""general."" This approach is based off of the S&P average return from 1950 - 2011 at 7%, the U.S. 10-year bond for the risk free rate which is susceptible to daily change and Google finance beta.)Weighted Average Cost of Capital or WACCThe WACC calculation is a calculation of a company's cost of capital in which each category of capital is equally weighted. All capital sources such as common stock, preferred stock, bonds and all other long-term debt are included in this calculation.As the WACC of a firm increases, and the beta and rate of return on equity increases, this states a decrease in valuation and a higher risk.By taking the weighted average, we can see how much interest the company has to pay for every dollar it finances.For this calculation, you will need to know the following listed below:Tax Rate = 31.95% (Halliburton Company's five-year average Tax Rate)Cost of Debt (before tax) or R debt = 3.87%Cost of Equity or R equity = 9.93%Debt (Total Liabilities) for 2011 or D = $10.479 billionStock Price = $33.80 (October 15th, 2012)Outstanding Shares = 927.75 millionEquity = Stock price x Outstanding Shares or E = $31.357 billionDebt + Equity or D+E = $41.836 billionWACC = R = (1 - Tax Rate) x R debt (D/D+E) + R equity (E/D+E)(1 - Tax Rate) x R debt (D/D+E) + R equity (E/D+E)(1 - .3195) x .0387 x ($10.479/$41.836) + .0993 ($31.357/$41.836).6805 x .0387 x .2505 + .0993 x .7495.0066 + .0744= 8.10%Based on the calculations above, we can conclude that Halliburton Company pays 8.10% on every dollar that it finances, or 8.10 cents on every dollar. From this calculation, we understand that on every dollar the company spends on an investment, the company must make $.0810 plus the cost of the investment for the investment to be feasible for the company.SummaryIn analyzing Halliburton Company's total debt and liabilities, we can see that the company currently has a total debt of $4.820 billion and liabilities at $10.479 billion. Over the past five years, the total debt has increased by 73.0%, while total liabilities have increased by 67.16%. The company's amount of debt and amount of liabilities have been increasing over the past 5 years.Based on the five debt ratios listed above, we can see that Halliburton's ratios have strengthened over the past 3 years. Even though the debt and liabilities have increased, the ratios indicate that the company's growth has been stronger than the increase in debt and liabilities. As this is the case, the ratios indicate a decreasing amount of financial risk to the company over the last 3 years.As Halliburton Company's bond rating currently stands at ""A"" this indicates that the company has a ""Strong capacity to meet financial commitments but somewhat susceptible to adverse economic conditions and changes in circumstances.""The CAPM approach for cost of equity states that shareholders need 9.93% average per year over a long period of time on their equity to make it worthwhile to invest in the company. This calculation is so based on the average market return between 1950 and 2011 at 7%.The WACC calculation reveals that the company pays 8.10% on every dollar that it finances. As the current WACC of Halliburton Company is currently 8.10% and the beta is above average at 1.55, this implies that the company needs at least 8.10% on future investments and will have above average volatility moving forward.Based on the calculations above, the company has increased its debt and liabilities but currently has the capacity to make its debt payments and meet its tax obligations.The analysis of Halliburton Company's debt and liabilities indicates a very strong company with increasing debt and liabilities. The analysis also reveals that the company growth rate is increasing faster than the company's debt and liabilities. Over the past 3 years, this has decreased the financial risk to the shareholder. The Bond rating of ""A"" by S&P indicates that a company has a ""Strong capacity to meet financial commitments but somewhat susceptible to adverse economic conditions and changes in circumstances."" The WACC reveals that Halliburton has the ability to add future investments and assets at relatively low rates. Currently, Halliburton Company has the ability to pay for its debts meet its obligations while adding growth.All indications above reveal a company with strong investment potential long term for the shareholder, as long as the above ratios maintain or improve on their current standards.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

865591,29461,2012-09-13T13:28:38-04:00,,"Despite uncertain regulations and demand and supply fluctuations, Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) managed to gain market share in international markets. It was able to enhance its capacity through strong utilization and operational performance. The company has introduced the remarkable invention, PermStim, a substitute of guar bean used as a fluid to fill fracked wells in oil and gas exploration. Furthermore, it has shown impressive YoY double-digit revenue and operating income growth of 21% and 34%. It has seen record returns in its eight product lines, and also achieved record-high operating income in its multi-chem, completion tools, cementing and testing and subsea businesses. Moreover, the stock is trading at low valuations. It is trading at a forward P/E of 10x as compared to the industry average of 13.6x. Our estimated 12-month target price is $52, with an upside of 48%. Thirty one analysts estimate that the company's earnings will grow by 10% till the end of 2013. Based upon its low valuation and the aforementioned points, we recommend taking a long position on the stock.Company OverviewHalliburton is an oilfield company engaged in providing products and services related to the production, exploration, and development of oil and gas. The company's operations are segregated into two segments; completion and production, and drilling and evaluation. It is a global company, providing its products and services in more than 80 countries. There are four primary areas of business operations, which include North America, Asia/Middle East, Latin America, and Europe. It is the second largest oil and gas service provider in the world, and a supplier of hydraulic fracturing in North America.AcquisitionsBarclays's analysts expect future acquisitions by large oilfield service and product manufacturers, including Halliburton, National Oilwell Varco (NYSE:NOV) and Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB). They believe that Halliburton will acquire smaller companies and their assets to remain competitive. Furthermore, they reveal that ""new regulations encourage high specification equipment, the ongoing build-out in offshore markets, and the operator demand for equipment to enhance efficiencies."" Therefore, the market is expecting Halliburton to bring growth through inorganic channels as well. The company has recently acquired Petris Technologies to provide value to its customers by delivering them critical operational information about their reservoirs.InventionThe price of guar bean, the basic raw material used in hydraulic fracturing, has doubled in the last three months due to its shortage. Halliburton has discovered a substitute of guar bean through the introduction of PermStim, used as a fluid to fill fracked wells to extract oil and gas. The company has started placing its PermStim in around 40 wells, in the last quarter, in U.S. basins. Henceforth, this new invention will enable it to stabilize costs and improve its profit margins in the coming period.Revenues by Geographical SegmentationThe company expects that its revenue in North America will decrease from the second quarter to the third quarter. HAL CFO Mark McCollum had previously anticipated that its revenues from this geographical region would remain steady. But the decline in its future outlook is reflected in the company's low pricing power. In fact, this trend has been witnessed by other companies operating in North America as well. U.S. benchmark natural gas prices declined by 25% in the last one year, leading to weakening pricing power of oil and gas equipment and service provider companies. Despite the fact that 57% of HAL's revenues come from North America, the increases in revenues of 13%, 14% and 17% in Latin America, Europe and Africa, and Middle and Asia over the last quarter, offset the impact of the decline in North America. The revenues in Europe/Africa and Middle East/Asia improved from $1,012 million and $908 million to $1,156 million and $ 1,059 million, respectively, over the last one quarter, as depicted in the graph given below.FinancialsHalliburton has registered net income of $745 million and earnings of $0.8 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2012. Its diluted EPS have increased by 15% from 1Q2012 to 2Q2012. In its first quarter result, it included $300 million of estimated losses from the Mocando well incident. The company posed total revenues of $7.2 billion in the second quarter, with an increase of ~5% from the first quarter and 21% YoY. Its cost efficiencies are reflected in the 20% increase in operating income of $1.2 billion. The company's international operations witnessed double-digit growth in revenues and operating margins.Halliburton's revenues and sales in Latin America have risen by 13% in the last quarter, with a 1% increase in rig count. This increase is justified by the company's activity growth, and most importantly, improvements in pricing in Mexico and Venezuela. Going forward, the management expects that margins will further improve. Moreover, it has efficiently implemented its growth strategy by capturing a maximum market share in the Eastern Hemisphere. The company's revenues increased by 15% in this region, with the rig count increasing by 5%. Its negative free cash flows are not a matter of great concern, as the company has a strong liquidity position, a good balance sheet, and rising capital spending on some expansion projects. We assume that these projects will help the company sustain its high gross and operating margins in the coming years.Price AppreciationHAL's stock price has shown an upward trend in the last 3 months due to continuously increasing revenues in the last 4 quarters. The stock is trading at 30% above its last 3 months' price. Its 50-days' and 200-days' moving averages are $33 and $32, respectively. Around 76% of the company's shares are held by institutions. Due to the regulatory environment and the oil demand-supply situation, the company and its peers have witnessed the same trend in the last three months as depicted in the graph given below.Source: Google FinanceValuationsWe have calculated our 12-month target price as $52, by using an EV/EBITDA multiple, with an upside of 48%. The stock is currently trading at 10.1x its forward earnings, at a discount as compared to Baker Hughes Incorporated's (BHI) 11.1x, Schlumberger Limited's 14.3x and Technip's (TKPPY.PK) 15.5x. The stock is trading at cheap valuations as reflected in its 5-year expected PEG ratio of 0.7x.

905861,24389,2012-10-05T03:21:53-04:00,,"Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) is one of the largest providers of oil services. The company provides a variety of oil field services, from pressure pumping to drilling, across North America and about 80 countries around the world. Over time, Halliburton has integrated its services into a single solution. Thanks to this policy, customers can obtain increased well performance, and reduce nonproductive time, by standardizing with Halliburton's services rather than combining services from several service providers. In the past two years, the company has shown remarkable revenue growth. However, the growth in revenues was not reflected in the stock price. The stock significantly lagged its peers in terms of market performance.According to my valuation model, the stock of the company is trading at a considerable discount. Here, I explain why Halliburton is deeply undervalued. Let's start with basic assumptions. Like any other financial model, there are certain assumptions about the revenue growth, cost structure and capital structure of the company.Model Assumptions:The company has recorded growth in revenues of over 20% for the current year. However, in my ProForma earnings estimate, I have taken a conservative and cautious approach. I have assumed 11% growth in revenues for 2012, which will decline to a stable 4% in the terminal year. My revenue growth estimates are in agreement with Morningstar, which uses 11% growth rate for Halliburton revenues. Currently, Halliburton's cost of sales is 81% of sales. In my model, I have assumed a constant 81% cost of sales for the forecasted period. In addition, I have assumed a growth rate of 10% for general and administrative expenses. Halliburton has a tax rate of 32%. The company has significant stock options outstanding, which are generally exercised as the price of the stock moves up.ProForma Earnings:According to my earnings estimate, Halliburton should be able to maintain healthy margins. I expect the company to post EPS of $5.15 by the end of 2017. Halliburton should be able to maintain healthy growth after the valuation period.Valuation:For the valuation purposes, I have assumed a discount rate of 10%. Halliburton has a strong history of revenue growth, healthy cash reserves and immensely strong business model. Taking into account the strong position of the company, I believe a discount rate of 10% is justified.There are two conventional methods to calculate the terminal year value; multiple of terminal year earnings and a constant growth model. I have used the latter, and assumed a 4% constant growth rate after the declining growth period of five years. Furthermore, the terminal year earnings of $5.15 are discounted using the single stage growth model, where the earnings are first adjusted for constant growth and then discounted by the discount rate of 10%. The single stage growth model also adjusts discount rate for growth by deducting the terminal growth rate from the discount rate. Once the terminal year value is calculated; it is then discounted to reach at the present value.On the other hand, earnings before the terminal year are simply discounted to reach at the present value. Finally, the discounted earnings are added to the discounted terminal value to reach at the true value/fair value of the stock. According to my valuation model, Halliburton should trade at $76.22. The stock is currently trading at a significant discount to its fair value.Peer Comparison:Baker Hughes (BHI) and Schlumberger Limited (NYSE:SLB) are the biggest competitors for Halliburton.Source: Morningstar.comIt is evident from the table that the firm beats its competition on almost all the metrics. Halliburton is trading at a lower P/E ratio, while the firm has shown positive EPS growth when the competition recorded negative EPS growth numbers. In addition, the firm has higher margins, ROE and a lower debt to equity ratio as compared to its competitors. Baker Hughes looks relatively cheaper based on the P/B ratio.Summary:Halliburton stock is currently trading at a discounted price. As the valuation model shows, the stock should be trading near to $75 mark. The company has impressive revenue growth and attractive market multiples. At the current price, Halliburton provides an immense opportunity to make healthy returns.The only negatives for the company could be the potential exposure from its role as a contractor on the Macondo well project that led to the catastrophic oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. The oil spill is the subject of quite a few continuing government investigations, which keeps the stock at the current depressed prices. In addition, the company has been named in about 400 civil suits. However, the firm has estimated contingencies of $300 million, and I do not expect the total amount to be significantly higher than the estimated amount. Even after adjusting for these costs, the stock has almost 100% upside potential.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Disclaimer: EfsInvestment is a team of analysts.

882741,24389,2012-09-23T06:52:42-04:00,,"Edited By Adam IsaacHalliburton (NYSE:HAL) is one of the world's leading suppliers of products and services to the energy industry. The firm has more than 70,000 employees in about 80 countries. It primarily serves the upstream oil and gas industry during the lifecycle of the reservoir. Over time, Halliburton has integrated its services into a single solution. Thanks to this policy, customers can obtain increased well performance, and reduce nonproductive time, by standardizing with Halliburton's services rather than combining services from several service providers.The company has two divisions: Drilling and Production. At the end of last year, these two divisions contributed roughly 25.0 billion dollars in revenues. Halliburton is one of the three largest global oilfield service firms, based on total revenues, competing closely with Schlumberger Ltd (NYSE:SLB) and Baker Hughes (BHI).Stock Performance:HAL data by YChartsHalliburton stock is rising after a recent slump and is currently trading at about $36. The stock has an extremely attractive P/E ratio of 10.6, while the industry P/E ratio stands at 17.2. The stock is also cheaper as compared to the industry average P/S and revenue growth metrics. HAL has P/S ratio of 1.2 as compared to the industry average of 1.6. Revenue growth of 10.8% also outperforms the industry average of 5.4%.Recovering Business:Halliburton has gained recently from the growing demand in the North American pressure-pumping market, where the company is the market leader. This market has accounted for an uneven share of Halliburton's expansion in revenues over the past two years. This market has been driven by significantly increased use of new hydraulic fracturing technology to utilize oil and gas shale deposits. However, key players in the hydraulic fracturing industry have been spending more to increase their pressure pumping capacity.Given the low natural gas prices, exploration and production division customers are experiencing a quick swing towards oil directed drilling. This is an encouraging long range development for Halliburton because oil drilling entails a more rigorous use of hydraulic fracturing than natural gas drilling. However, recovery in Halliburton's international markets has fallen behind in North America, although trends have varied widely by country.Financial Highlights:Halliburton's overall financial performance has been incredibly strong. Revenues for the firm increased 38% in 2011 in contrast with 2010 and by an additional 30% in the first quarter of the current year compared with the same period in the previous year. The firm recorded an adjusted EBITDA of $6.9 billion at the end of March this year, up from $4.8 billion during the previous year. Due to the recent recovery in the business, profitability and cash flow in 2012 will improve. Halliburton is profiting from management's focus on improving operating efficiency, together with working capital management.In the most recent guidance, the management announced a capital expenditure of between $3.5 and $4 billion for 2012. Halliburton has moderate debt levels, and the total long term debt of the company stands just below $5 billion. Halliburton has strong cash flows. The firm generated cash flows from operations of over $3 billion at the end of the last year. In the most recent earnings report, Halliburton reported cash flow from operations of $1.13 billion and capital expenditures of $1.6 billion. At the end of the second quarter, Halliburton had cash equivalents of $2.1 billion. In addition, Halliburton's liquidity is incredibly strong. The key elements of its liquidity are the cash reserves of $2.1 billion and $100 million of conservatively invested marketable securities.Additionally, the company also has a revolving credit facility worth $2 billion, which will expire in 2016. None of the long term debt for Halliburton is maturing before 2016, and strong cash flows indicate the firm will be able to meet its capital expenditures.Peer Comparison:Baker Hughes and Schlumberger Limited are the biggest competitors for Halliburton.Source: Morningstar.comIt is evident from the table that the firm beats its competition on almost all the metrics. Halliburton is trading at a lower P/E ratio. The firm has also shown a positive EPS growth trend when the competitors recorded negative EPS growth numbers. In addition, the firm has higher margins, and higher returns on equity compared to its competitors.Summary:Halliburton currently faces potential exposure from its role as a contractor on the Macondo well project that led to the catastrophic oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. The oil spill is the subject of quite a few continuing government investigations. In addition, the company has been named in about 400 civil suits. However, Halliburton has estimated contingencies of $300 million, and I do not expect the amount to be significantly higher than the estimated amount. Other than that, the business prospects of the firm are strong, and the firm should be able to do well in the coming quarters.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Today, CFO Mark McCollum reported at a conference that domestic revenue would miss estimates. This after the company famously complained about high guar prices squeezing margins, only to load up on the product at the peak price.The company is one of the world's leading oil service firms, with revenue approaching $29B for 2012 and a market valuation of nearly $30B.Not surprisingly, the stock has traded down 2-3% today, especially after McCollum mentioned that the profit margins would take a 2.5 to 3 percentage point hit.Surging OilWith surging WTI prices hitting over $95 during the third quarter, it seems odd that Halliburton would see a slide in demand. Possibly the company is still too focused on natural gas shale plays, where demand has plunged.In fact, several domestic exploration companies recently highlighted increasing capex spending for this year. Continental Resources (NYSE:CLR) announced plans to raise capex in the Bakken play and SandRidge Energy (NYSE:SD) increased capex by over 10% for the Mississippian play. These were smart moves by these explorers to increase production while oil prices are surging and drilling costs are dropping.Clearly Halliburton has been unable to offset the lower pricing by reduced costs.Market ConditionsPer Baker Hughes (BHI), the North America rig count is down 74 rigs compared to last year. More importantly, the rigs exploring for gas are down roughly 50% to only 473. The rigs exploring for oil are up 355 from last year to 1,419.The August 31st rig count of 1,894 has slipped from the peak in Q2 of 1,986. This slippage does provide cover for the reduced revenue estimates at Halliburton, but the shift to oil exploration from gas suggests that maybe some competitors are doing better.GuarPossibly the best sign of the issues at Halliburton was the decision to purchase extra inventory of the guar gum at the peak. In fact, the company might have caused the blow off top in the prices. Guar gum is used as a thickening agent for oil and gas extraction.According to this Bloomberg article, guar prices have plunged nearly 70% to $539 per 100 kilograms. On top of that, shipments from India are now forecast to decline for the year started April 1 by nearly 20% to 400,000 metric tons.In fact, the following quote from Halliburton CEO David Lesar suggests that even he recognizes the error of his company's ways: ""We should not have purchased the extra inventory,"" he said during a conference call on July 24. CompetitorsConsidering the spate of issues at Halliburton, investors should consider placing the stock in the penalty box. No longer should the company be seen as the market leader. In fact, it might be too large to maneuver the quickly shifting landscape in the markets.Even with ongoing tax issues, Weatherford (WFT) appears to be better situated. The company has a stronger international presence and relies less on domestic natural gas production.By far, the favorite of the domestic producers should be C&J Energy Services (CJES). The company not only appears to be a better operator, but it has a much better relative valuation (see article). The fact that C&J has a bigger loss today highlights the markets' flawed mindset in favor of a company that continues to miss.ConclusionThe oil services sector appears very attractive at these stock prices compared to the potential growth in the sector long term. Unfortunately, it appears that investors are still focusing on a stock that has now become a sector laggard after a several mistakes.Other sector players such as C&J and Weatherford appear more attractive. When the demand for natural gas rigs returns to normal levels, the sector could see huge growth in the U.S., making the stock prices very attractive at these levels.Investors might also want to buy into the explorers, such as Continental or SandRidge, as both companies take advantage of the opportunities in the market.Disclaimer: Please consult your financial advisor before making any investment decisions.Disclosure: I am long CJES, WFT.

807991,24971,2012-08-15T02:45:30-04:00,,"I have written quite a bit about Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), and how I feel that the company is so well positioned in every aspect of the energy recovery business, which includes oil and natural gas. Another huge company is now positioned to regain its revenue and profit footing. I believe that Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) is on the cusp of surprising capital appreciation.It's not about new oil field discoveries, or cutting production to reduce costs to fit demands. It isn't about any of those headline grabbing news flashes.This is all about a little bean from India.Major Cost Of Oil And Gas RecoveryOne of the major costs involved in the recovery of both oil and gas is that of a bean found in India called ""guar"". The bean itself, when made soluble, creates a liquid gel of some form that helps keep the cracks open in shale rock when ""fracked"", or cracked open.Unfortunately for the big energy companies, the cost of that little bean has gone up over 80% in just the first half of this year alone, as noted in this article.Since the process of keeping that shale open makes up 75% of the cost of recovery, an 80% increase in the cost of the product that makes that process possible is an astronomical drain on the profits of any energy company. So the increase in natural gas prices has been made almost null and void by one little guar bean from India. This also impacts the costs of oil recovery, but with the hefty prices of oil, the rise in price of the guar bean is more readily absorbed.Halliburton To The Rescue?With the earnings of Halliburton themselves being crunched, the company jumped on the bandwagon to find a substitute for the guar bean so that not only could its own costs be contained, but it could offer the proprietary product to other energy companies, and hopefully create more revenue and greater profits for itself. A win-win situation for Halliburton for sure.As this article notes:According to Reuters, PermStim is now used in around 40 of Halliburton's U.S. wells.Obviously this is just the start, and Baker Hughes (BHI) has also developed a substitute called ""AquaPerm"", which has now replaced about 5% of the company's guar bean requirements. Several other companies are in the mix as detailed here as well.We like Halliburton here because the stock is on sale and the fundamentals are great.A Huge Blue Chip At A DiscountHalliburton: Price: $34.92/share, Dividend Yield: 1.10%, ESS Rating: BullishOn July 25th, 2011 the share price stood at $57.27/share. It has been virtually downhill ever since. The stock price has taken an approximate 40% hit. Halliburton's forward guidance has been reduced and shareholder value has suffered. That being said, Wall Street analysts have a more favorable forward-looking opinion of the company.Out of 29 analysts covering the company, 10 have issued a strong buy rating, 14 have issued a buy rating and five have issued a hold rating (as per Yahoo Finance). It would appear that we might have a bargain on our hands.If this substitute of the guar bean is a success, then all bets are off as to where the share price can go to. I believe it can easily re-visit last year's highs of $57.00/share, if not higher.Why?That is what happens when costs are dramatically reduced and revenues and profits dramatically increase. All because of a little bean from India.Disclosure: I am long XOM.Additional disclosure: I will be opening a position in HAL within one week."
739901,23502,2012-07-23T09:45:41-04:00,,"By                 Stephen Ellis We  remain concerned about the health of the oil services industry. While  guar prices have declined to around $10-$12 per kilogram from peak  prices of around $25 per kilogram, the industry still needs to overcome  weak natural gas and natural gas liquids pricing. This situation is  driving continued gas-to-oil rig switching (previously dry gas-to-oil,  now wet gas-to-oil) and pressure-pumping oversupply, as well as the  associated cost inefficiencies. On the international side of the coin,  we expect slowing demand for oil from China and Europe to boost the  overall global oil supply cushion, putting further pressure on oil  prices and limiting appetites for initiating new drilling projects.However, we still like the long-term prospects for the industry, as  the incremental barrel is increasingly coming from the  services-intensive offshore reservoirs. Oil and gas producers also are  sanctioning new efforts to boost recovery rates at old and mature  fields. We believe the market is currently pricing in a weak 2013.  However, as market expectations shift toward 2014 in the next six to  nine months, taking into account the temporary nature of many of the  industry's headwinds, we think both fundamentals and market sentiment  will shift to the positive.As the largest pressure-pumper in North America,  Halliburton's (NYSE:HAL)  outlook is challenging. Not only is the company the most exposed to  region-specific issues, but it will be challenged by stagnant growth in  the overseas rig count. But at around $30 per share, we believe  Halliburton stands as an opportunity to purchase the best-in-class North  American oil services franchise at a discount because pessimistic  near-term concerns are outweighing the more attractive fundamental  long-term outlook. We don't deny that there could be more downside, but  North American players such as Halliburton offer the greatest amount of  upside over the next 12-18 months as North American trends turn positive  from negative. Any sign of stabilization or improvement in the oil  services end markets likely will lead to substantial revaluation toward  our $50 fair value estimate.Guar: A Sticky IssueThe list of the challenges the industry faces in the next two years is  long, but at least the guar issue should be short term as we believe its  pricing inflation is unsustainable. What is guar you ask? That's a fair  question. Oil services firms use it to help carry proppant downhole and  place it in fractures. Guar prices soared during the last 18 months to  $25.00 per kilogram from $1.50. In fact, current official pricing for  guar is unavailable as regulators in India (the source of 80% of the  world's guar) have halted trading in guar gum on its futures exchanges  from March until September while they investigate possible illegal  manipulation of the commodity. Earlier, regulators had raised margin  limits, lowered position limits, and suspended traders to no avail as  guar prices continued to increase. The Forward Market Commission has  submitted a report to the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, indicating that  nearly 5,000 entities were found involved in price manipulation,  apparently acquiring guar gum under various fake names and effectively  cornering the market.However, a substantially larger guar crop harvest in October and  November should put downward pressure on prices, and the potential  margin uplift for the oil services industry could be significant. For  example, we calculate that guar costs went from around 1% of an Eagle  Ford fracturing cost in 2011 to around 28% in 2012, or from about  $36,000 per well to around $730,000 per well. Pressure pumpers were  caught off guard by the rapid rise in guar prices and they were unable  to immediately pass along any cost increases to customers. Guar  substitutes were not available, although the industry is now rapidly  sourcing alternatives. Halliburton, in an effort to avoid shortages,  recently increased its guar inventory to around three to four months  from one month at around peak pricing of $25 per kilogram, by our  estimates. It may take a quarter or two for this high-cost inventory to  flow through the income statement, thus pressuring margins.And Some More Bad News ...The very positive effects of a guar price collapse may be largely offset  by continued weakness in the pressure-pumping market and gas rig count,  and Halliburton will be negatively affected by these North American  dynamics in 2012-13. Natural gas liquids pricing, particularly ethane  pricing, has dropped to under $0.30 a gallon recently from around $0.60 a  gallon in early 2011. This could drive more gas rigs to be laid down  with additional capacity shifted to oil-rich plays, exacerbating the  current oversupply issues. The ethane weakness also hurts the cash flows  of certain gas-focused exploration and production firms, which could  lead to capital spending reductions and a lower demand for services.And given the well-known challenges in Europe and slowing growth in  China, oil demand and prices could decline substantially. Now,  international and national oil companies will continue to invest with a  long-term mindset, meaning projects currently underway are unlikely to  be effected, but those yet to be sanctioned likely will be delayed as  the companies seek to take advantage of lower costs, like we saw in  2009. In this situation, the oil services industry, which is currently  still seeing competitive pricing on standard tenders even as the market  has improved during the last year, likely would lose considerable  bargaining leverage.Looking Up in the Long RunDespite our more pessimistic outlook on the industry for the next few  years, we still view it as attractive in the long term. The North  American market will remain cyclical, but it has structurally improved  over time. We still think long-term operating margins for the industry  in the attractive 20%-range are very achievable. For example, a few  years ago, the industry typically moved services pricing in lock step  across all basins, ignoring the underlying economics of the reservoirs  for E&Ps, which caused rigs to be laid down to the industry’s  detriment. Contracts were on a well-to-well basis, and E&Ps  typically cut the services firm loose at the first sign of trouble.  Today, the step-up in services intensity and expertise required to  properly exploit the new tight oil reservoirs requires a closer working  relationship and a fully integrated services offering to maximize any  cost-efficiencies and well productivity. Contracts tend to be longer  term in nature, to the point where most capacity for the Big 4-- Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB),  Baker-Hughes (BHI), Weatherford (WFT),  and Halliburton--is under contract for 2012. Services pricing is now  typically adjusted on a reservoir-specific basis to keep services  profitability at a reasonable level.A shift toward a more technology-driven solution in North America  still benefits the largest services companies that can spend the most on  research and development and continuously bring new technologies to the  field, such as Schlumberger's HiWAY technology. The brute-force  approach, which required more equipment, fracs, and people in demanding  tight oil plays, has been very beneficial for the oil services  industry--but that reservoir has largely been tapped. Efforts now are  being directed toward more intelligent well design, and Halliburton  already has a leadership role here with its ""frac of the future""  initiative that envisions substantial well-site efficiency improvements  by 2013 to further strengthen its low-cost position in North America.  Halliburton is attempting to lower costs by cutting the level of capital  expenditures per well site by 20% and by reducing both the onsite crews  and the time required to complete a well by 25%. Alternatively,  Schlumberger is simply letting a third party furnish the  pressure-pumping equipment while it provides the technology, such as its  HiWAY efforts. The increased wear and tear on today's fracturing  equipment means that up to 20%-30% of the equipment fails and needs to  be replaced annually, which leads us to believe that any halt in  capacity additions will quickly tighten the market, and North America  will rebound again.Outside of North America, the oil services sector still benefits from  a number of attractive secular trends in terms of oil and gas companies  exploiting more services-intensive offshore reservoirs and increasing  their efforts to boost recovery rates at old and mature fields. National  oil companies may control the majority of the world's reserves, but  they still need considerable services expertise to extract the oil and  gas in the most productive and cost-efficient manner possible while not  damaging the reservoirs' long-term ability to produce. International  shale opportunities in Europe, China, and South America are substantial.  While ExxonMobil's (NYSE:XOM) decision to scale back on its ambitions in Poland is  a short-term negative, the vast amount of reserves ensures that the  services industry will benefit once the infrastructure, regulatory, and  technology-related challenges are resolved. In addition, plans by  Mexico, Iraq, Brazil, and Venezuela to substantially increase production  in the next decade are all healthy demand indicators for the services  industry.Tap Into HalliburtonHalliburton is the industry's best operator in North America, and we  consider its low-cost and highly efficient model as differentiated and  hard to duplicate. The firm has typically delivered the industry's best  margins in the region and its integrated solution has helped the firm  steal significant share from both large and small peers. For example,  Halliburton's production testing and specialty chemicals businesses have  outgrown the respective markets by a 13% and 17% compound annual growth  rate during the last five years. In addition, the company's integrated  model creates real switching costs for customers that will lose out on  productivity gains if they try to use more third-party oil services  providers. Unsurprisingly, we estimate around 60% of the wells  Halliburton drilled at the end of 2011 use its fully integrated drilling  solution. We believe some investors continue to prefer Schlumberger for  its wide-moat attributes while not fully appreciating the strength in  Halliburton's more narrowly focused business model.While we expect a difficult 2012 and 2013, we consider the overall  oil services industry an attractive one with secular growth prospects,  whereas investors seem to be assuming current headwinds will persist  into perpetuity. We do not think that is the case and consider  Halliburton to be the most attractive oil services idea. We expect North  American margins to compress into 2013 but that Halliburton will  generate $6.0 billion in EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes,  depreciation, and amortization) next year. Our $50 per share fair value  estimate implies an 8 times forward EBITDA multiple. For comparison  purposes, Halliburton generated EBITDA of $4.7 billion in 2008, $2.9  billion in 2009, $4.1 billion in 2010, and $6.1 billion in 2011. We  estimate about $6.3 billion for 2012.Disclosure: Morningstar licenses its indexes  to certain ETF and ETN providers, including BlackRock, Invesco, Merrill  Lynch, Northern Trust, and Scottrade for use in exchange-traded funds  and notes.

The rig count in Canada dropped 70% due to the annual spring break up, while the rig count in the U.S. decreased 1% as compared to the preceding quarter.The shift from gas to liquid-and-oil plays has continued in the quarter, and liquid-and-oil directed activity accounted for more than 70% of the rig count at the end of the second quarter, while natural gas directed rigs reached a 12-year low.Operating profit for the second quarter witnessed a decline of 19% as compared to the preceding quarter, due to the high cost of guar gum, which is an essential input for hydraulic fracturing. The negative impacts were partially offset by improved activity in the Gulf of Mexico.HAL acquired high quantities of guar gum at high prices, and the management has expressed regret over the decision. This has been an essential factor in reduced operating profit in the quarter. Beginning next year, the new crop will arrive, which is expected to reduce the crop's prices.Developments for the QuarterEarnings Announcements for other Major Oil and Gas Service Providers:Schlumberger Ltd (SLB)Schlumberger Ltd , the largest oil and gas service company in the world, reported second quarter earnings of $1.05 per share, 7% higher than earnings of $0.98 per share for the preceding quarter.

742371,21821,2012-07-24T07:14:36-04:00,,"The market continues to get good news from large cap oil service names. The second quarter began with a surprise to the upside by Baker Hughes (BHI). Schlumberger (SLB) also beat, as international sales were better than estimates. The story was essentially the same, as the Middle East, Europe, and Africa pushed up revenues. The results from both companies seemed to prepare investors for another good number by Halliburton (HAL). It didn't disappoint, as it beat on both the top and bottom line numbers.In North America, Halliburton saw flat sequential revenues compared to a 17% decrease in rig count. The United States rig count was down 1%, but revenues increased 3%. Natural gas rigs decreased 18% from the first quarter of 2012. We have had a 42% drop in natural gas rigs since October of 2011. Halliburton's problems in North America stemmed from the cost of guar, pricing pressures in its production enhancement business, and efficiency disruptions of equipment locations. Guar was the biggest single problem noted by Halliburton, and in response to this purchased a large amount as it believes this problem will continue throughout the year. Due to this surplus, Halliburton was able secure more work as competitors didn't have enough guar on hand. Halliburton will have to work off this higher priced guar throughout 2012, which will hurt margins going forward. 67% of margin compression in Q2 was due to guar which increased in price by 75% from the first quarter. Q3 prices are expected to be 25% higher than Q2.Like Baker Hughes and Schlumberger, Halliburton had positive things to say about the Gulf of Mexico. Not only is work picking up but margins have returned to pre-moratorium levels. It expects new deep water rigs moving in, will continue to strengthen margins and profits in the upcoming quarters. As with the rest of North America, Halliburton is adding market share in the Gulf.International work significantly outpaced North America, in revenue and margin gains. Latin America had a strong quarter for revenues, but margins were impacted on the moving of equipment to Brazil. Brazil is believed to be an of importance in the upcoming year. Europe and Eurasia are now producing better, with margins better than the eastern hemisphere as a whole. China and Australia are beginning to show very good growth in the unconventional market. Operating income in this region was up 59%.Halliburton's quarter is more interesting when broken down by division. Completion and production saw a revenue gain, while operating income fell. Completion and production in North America had pricing difficulties, but did see increased activity in the Gulf of Mexico and on liquids rich basins on land in the U.S. Completion and production internationally was quite good. Mexico, Argentina, and Venezuela all saw increased activity. It had a very good quarter in Europe and Africa with a revenue increase of 21% and operating income of 67%. The Middle East and Asia did well. Both Saudi Arabia and Australia saw increased sales across all product lines with respect to completion and production.The drilling and evaluation division saw gains in Latin America. Its best areas were Mexico, Columbia, Ecuador, Venezuela, and Brazil. In the United States, this division saw pricing difficulties linked to the mobilizing of equipment from natural gas basins to liquids rich. The Gulf of Mexico helped to offset this. In Europe and Africa, Halliburton saw increases throughout the region in directional drilling. It had better fluids sales in Norway and wireline in Poland. In the Middle East and Asia, Halliburton saw improvements on several product lines in China and Saudi Arabia. India, Kuwait and Brunei also saw demand for these products and services.Baker Hughes and Schlumberger also noted an increased need for service in international deep water plays. Malaysia saw increases across all product lines and was a strong area for Halliburton. East Africa has not only had an increased demand, but its deep water presence helped to sign land contracts Ethiopia and Uganda.In summary, Halliburton reported a lot like Baker Hughes and Schlumberger. Guar pricing will continue to decrease margins throughout 2012. In response, it has found a replacement and will work to develop this in the coming months. Europe, Africa and the Middle East are all driving international growth in oil service. Deep water drilling is also seeing increased revenues and margins. Pricing constraints in hydraulic fracking will continue going forward, but Halliburton sees this bottoming. I would watch this sector closely as it may still have value. Going forward I would watch names like Weatherford (WFT) and Oceaneering International (OII).Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Additional disclosure: This is not a buy recommendation."

Last week competitors Baker Hughes (BHI) and Schlumberger (SLB) already announced decent second quarter results.Second Quarter ResultsHalliburton announced second quarter income from continuing operations of $745 million, or $0.80 per share, beating analysts consensus of $0.75 per share. Operating income was virtually unchanged from the $739 million realized in the second quarter of 2011, but up from the $635 million profit in the first quarter. First quarter earnings were negatively impacted by a $191 million after-tax charge related to the Macondo well incident.Revenues for the second quarter of 2012 came in at $7.2 billion, up 4% compared to the first quarter. Revenues beat analysts expectations of $7.0 billion and came in far above last year's quarterly revenues of $5.9 billion. Similar to its competitors, Halliburton experienced margin pressure in its North American operations as fracking costs are on the rise and price pressure becomes notable as demand is falling. Its international activities reported double-digit percentage revenue growth.Dave Lesar, CEO of Halliburton commentedLSegmental InformationCompletion & ProductionRevenues for the completion and production division rose 4% from the first quarter to $4.5 billion. Increased demand for the U.S. land market offset the Canadian spring break-up. Operating income came in at $912 million, down 12% on the quarter as a result of higher costs for guar gum and pricing pressure on production enhancement services. Europe, Africa and the Middle-East reported a sharp increase in profits amidst cost control in Angola and improved demand in Norway, Russia, Australia, Qatar and Saudi Arabia.Drilling & EvaluationRevenues for the drilling and evaluation business rose 8% on the quarter to $2.8 billion. Greater demand in the Gulf of Mexico and higher activity levels internationally spurred revenue growth. Operating income rose 7% to $393 million. Weakness in North America was offset in international markets.ValuationHalliburton ended its second quarter with $2.2 billion in cash and equivalents. It operates with $4.8 billion in short- and long-term debt for a net debt position of $2.6 billion. The company generated $14.1 billion in revenues for the first six months of 2012. Operating income came in at $2.2 billion and net income rose to $1.37 billion, or $1.48 per share. At this rate, the company is on track to generate annual revenues between $28-$30 billion, on which it is expected to report annual earnings around $3 billion. This values Halliburton at around 1.0 times annual revenues and roughly 10 times annual earnings.Halliburton's valuation compares to a revenue multiple of 2.3 times for Schlumberger and 1.0 times for Baker Hughes. Both competitors trade at around 17 and 11 times earnings, respectively.Currently Halliburton pays a quarterly dividend of $0.09 for an annual dividend yield of 1.1%Investment ThesisShares of Halliburton have lost 9% so far this year as lower oil prices have caused fear among investors about demand for oilfield services. Record low natural gas prices have already reduced demand for oilfield services for natural gas fields. At the same time, margins are under pressure as fracking costs have been on the rise. Consequently, shares have fallen from a peak of $57 in the summer of 2011 to around $31 at the moment.Monday's earnings beat reassured investors after the company warned for lower earnings in recent weeks. In both absolute and relative terms, the company's valuation seems attractive despite the fact that the company is highly reliant on the North American market, which currently is a drag on earnings growth.Despite the low dividend yield, I would consider taking a long-term long position in the stock as a rebound in the North American market will inevitably occur in the medium-term. Until that point in time, excellent results in international markets will continue to keep up the results.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

It's an early indicator for a new manufacturing renaissance. And the best way to play it is with Halliburton and other fracking-related energy suppliers. They're the ones laying a foundation for this explosion.Reuters had some favorable comments about Halliburton's key driver of revenue:However, there's a potential fly in the Halliburton ointment. There's some downside risk due to pending lawsuits stemming from the British Petroleum (NYSE:BP) Gulf of Mexico drilling fiasco a few years ago.The worst seems to be over, though. Take a look at the following chart:Click to enlarge image.You can see that although Halliburton has been correlated to overall market performance, it appears to have finally hit bottom on June 28. I'm a firm believer in volumes, which drive prices. When you look at the chart on June 28, you can see a $2.75 price movement over just less than a week. Was this upper price movement driven by news? It seems that strong numbers from the likes of Chevron (NYSE:CVX) on that day raised the overall confidence of the sector.As any trader knows, this spells a buying opportunity. Furthermore, here's another key quote from the Reuters article that supports my outlook for a short-term buying position:Now, this stock is definitely correlated to overall market performance. But at the same time, it has drastically underperformed the S&P 500 since September 2011.This suggests an excellent buying opportunity over the next four months. I see a potential 8%-10% increase here, and you can thank the energy reserves of Bakken, N.D., to facilitate this renaissance for companies like Halliburton.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
681381,23479,2012-06-25T08:55:57-04:00,,"Natural gas prices in the U.S. increased to $2.53 per Million British thermal units (MBtu), increasing from a low of $1.90 / MBtu in April as producers cut back on gas exploration, and exports of the commodity to Mexico ramped up. Gas exports to the country have spiked in the month of May, helping U.S. gas producers lease the oversupply situation and allay fears that underground storage shortages would pull gas prices below $1/ MBtu.Despite the price rise, analysts contend that producers will still be making losses on gas sales and the gas rig count is continuing its downward spiral, balanced by an uptick in oil exploration. Rig counts are directly tied to exploration spending and to the income of oilfield services players such as Halliburton (NYSE:HAL).We are looking to revise our $43 price estimate for Halliburton, which is at a 50% premium to its current market price.Major changeU.S. gas exports to Mexico reached a record 1,867 Million cubic feet / day (Mcf/d) in the month of May according to Bentek Energy. Despite the low gas prices in the country, American producers have limited options to export their output because of regulation on export of the product to countries with which the U.S. does not have free trade agreements and the the lack of LNG facilities to ship gas to international markets.Consequentially, the present oversupply has pushed down prices and stoked fears that the country could run out of underground storage in the near future. However, companies have been able to tap the market in Mexico, using an already existing pipeline network. The exports have helped prices recover to a certain extent, but the rig count for gas exploration has continued to fall.Some analysts say that the price of gas should be at least double from its present levels for explorers to make a reasonable return on their investments. Gas exploration in the U.S. has fallen drastically this year as producers shifted focus to oil rich plays in the U.S., hitting Halliburton's margins as the company had to realign its operations to counter the shift.The company's margins are set to see a further drop this quarter because of shortage of key input materials for hydraulic fracturing. The shift from gas to oil drilling is also resulting in higher competition, lowering Halliburton's ability to push the costs to its customers. Dropping margins in the U.S. could have a major impact on the company's valuation."
672481,30201,2012-06-20T13:13:24-04:00,,"Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) does not typically unload large blocks at the top of the market. However, they do pick up large blocks prior to an advance. The designated Market Maker in this issue covers short positions and accumulates in multi million share blocks. The reciprocal is that he distributes in smaller blocks of five hundred thousand shares or less.I did not include the smaller blocks in the block matrix because I do not believe that the distribution phase of the merchandising cycle is currently being conducted. I believe quite the opposite is true. I believe that for the most part the accumulation phase has concluded. In addition, the file would be too long considering the space restrictions.I am also supplying a weekly chart, as well as a daily chart. I want to illustrate the longer term nature of this recommendation. Without the weekly chart you might not fully appreciate the importance of the blocks being analyzed. More importantly, I want you to judiciously consider what are the most likely price consequences when blocks of this magnitude trade in this issue.If ever there was an object lesson of history repeating itself we find it here. Observe if you will, the block traded on November 3, 2010 and compare it to the block which traded on June 15, 2012. Do you see any similarities? They both were 4,058,234 shares. The odds of that happening and being unrelated must be astronomical.That said, the first block traded was prior to a long extended advance from the $31 range to the $58 range. So if history repeats itself and I believe that it does. We should see a fairly consistent advance in Halliburton with pullbacks along the way. These pullbacks occurring at key levels could be exploited further by monitoring the 500,000 share trades where the swings will most likely occur. Of course, this is an oversimplification of a far more sophisticated process. Investors could do well enough by buying and holding into the end of the year. You just need the strength of will, to ride out the pullbacks.On the Basis of the foregoing these are my views and observations:The Trade:I recommend establishing a long position in Halliburton. Open your position with only 1/4 of whatever capital you intend to commit to Halliburton at $28.50. Purchase the remaining 3/4 of the position at $26.22 and stop out at $25.15. Do not post your stop out. I have said it before but it is so important that at the risk of being redundant and in an abundance of caution I will say it again. It is too easy for the Designated Market Maker to cash investors out by moving the price above or below your stop out and move the price right back down or up again. In addition, when a stop out is triggered it converts into a market order and that could be disastrous if the Designated Market Maker decides to really take advantage. Remember the ""Flash Crash""? I would be looking to exit the trade (at least half) at an upside price target of $31.99. Do not allow this position to exceed 5% of your overall portfolio. You should seriously consider writing puts to establish your initial position. If the stock is put to you, then the premium will bring the cost basis down and if not, then the premium is money in your pocket. If all goes as planned then I would reestablish the position at $30, once again writing puts to engage. The same principals apply with respect to position sizing.There is always the possibility that the trade may not work out.There Is Never A Sure Thing (particularly on a short)Investors must realize and recognize that there is never a sure thing. Sometimes events that have a low probability of occurring bring forth very serious consequences should they come into being. Investors must judiciously consider what the inherent practical limits are and how much they stand to gain in relation to the risks involved in establishing any position.In addition, persistence can become desperate folly by allowing a losing position to become a viable argument for deciding on a new position. Rather, such decisions should be based on the current and soon-to-be circumstances.Any position in which one unexpected factor has a significant impact on your portfolio is the result of poor planning. It is a fault most commonly associated with people who want to explain away their losses. SUN TZU -Art of War ""Use an attack to exploit a victory, never use an attack to rescue a defeat.""If you follow the process recommended and the trade does not work, the overall loss in this model is $3,000.00. That amounts to .003 of the overall portfolio (theoretically valued at $1,000,000).And finally, never be a brave and brainless investor because a fool and his money are soon parted.A portfolio of $1,000,000 should position size in the following manner.This is a trade, not an investment. Be ever vigilant.That's it for now…. Have a nice day.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in HAL over the next 72 hours."
682821,25381,2012-06-25T17:50:04-04:00,,"Currently Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) is trading for $27.80 which is just 40 cents more expensive than the company's 52-week low price and 52% cheaper than the company's 52-week high price. It is amazing to see a perfectly profitable company lose more than half of its value in less than a year. Lately oil prices have been trending down, which may cut into some of this company's profits. Along with this problem, the company has an even bigger problem. BP (NYSE:BP) has sued it for some of the damages in the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. The final bill might be huge as we have seen it burn much of BP's cash reserves already. Still, the company has already lost about $26 billion in market share, and most of the damages must be already priced in.On Friday I bought 200 shares of Halliburton for $27.80 and wrote 2 call contracts with a strike price of 27, expiring in January 2013. My premium was $3.59 per share, resulting in $718. This will protect me from a downside of all the way to $24.21, and Halliburton hasn't been that cheap since the financial crisis of 2009. If the stock ends the year at a price higher than $27 a share, I will end up selling my shares for $27 and keep the premium of $3.59, resulting in an actual sale price of $30.59. This will result in an upside of 10% in 7 months. All the stock has to do is to stay above $27 until the end of the year. I would say that the trend will be on my side as the stock market usually sees a rally towards the end of the year. Those not as conservative as me could also pick a strike price out of the money.Of course I wouldn't buy a company simply based on technical details like that. A company should also have strong fundamentals to minimize any possible surprises. Currently the only stock I hold that doesn't currently enjoy a strong balance sheet is Nokia (NYSE:NOK), however I hope that to come to a change soon. I've already talked about that particular company in multiple articles, so I will reserve this article to talk about Halliburton.S&P rates Halliburton as ""buy"" and gives the company a 12-month price target of $46. While I agree with the ""buy"" rating, I find the price target to be highly optimistic. A more realistic price target would be $30-$35 due to the legal issues surrounding the oil spill. Currently, Halliburton's cash reserves are under $3 billion, which means that if the court decided that Halliburton would have to pay a large fine regarding the oil spill, the company would probably have to sell some of its assets or take out a loan to pay off the fine.Apart from the legal headaches of the oil spill, the company seems to be in a good shape. Halliburton enjoys a trailing P/E ratio of 9, and it is expected to earn $3.80 per share at the end of this year and $4.93 per share at the end of the next year. Of course, these numbers are highly dependent on oil prices and subject to change, but these numbers provide the company a forward P/E ratio of 7.3 for this year and 5.6 for next year. If the company ends up not getting fined by the courts, then it will have an upside potential of 50-60%.In the last 5 years, the company saw its revenues increase by 62% and its earnings increase by 45%. The growth is likely to continue in the long run as oil prices can't stay low for long. In the long term, global energy demand is likely to double between now and 2030 while the amount of oil in the proven reserves are expected to stay flat at best. Also, it is fair to say that natural gas prices have bottomed this year and they are likely to go up in the long term. Long term trends are bullish for this company. Halliburton's revenue is expected to grow at an annual rate between 10% and 15% in the next few years. The company generates more than half of its revenue from US and Canada, and there is plenty of potential in South America, Africa and Middle East for the company.In conclusion, I am definitely bullish on Halliburton in the long term. Keep in mind that by long term, I mean between 3 to 10 years. Many times when analysts say ""long term"" they are not exactly clear on what their time frame is. Given that Halliburton doesn't pay huge fines as a result of the oil spill in 2010, the company has more than 50% of upside. Even in the worst case scenario, the stock price wouldn't go down much more from here. This may be a good entry point at Halliburton for long term investors.Disclosure: I am long HAL."
672211,29461,2012-06-20T11:21:37-04:00,,"We are of the opinion that Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) has priced in the negative impact because of an increase in the cost of a key raw material, guar, lower inventory levels, and potential damages from a legal investigation related to the Mocando oil spill. We have a positive outlook on the stock due to its cheap valuation and potential upside in profitability going forward, due to the shift from gas to liquids-and-oil-shale production in the U.S., which requires higher levels of service intensity and offers higher profitability to oil service companies.Additionally, an uptick in Upstream Oil and Natural Gas spending is expected due to an increase in demand and high oil prices in the future, provided that growth resumes in China and the U.S., and the debt crisis in Europe is resolved.IndustryTrends in oil and natural gas prices affect the level of exploration, development, and production activity of drilling companies and the demand for the services and products offered by oil service companies. Therefore, high oil and gas prices translate into increased drilling activities, which increase the demand for the products and services offered by the Oil Service Industry.Upstream spending is considered the best indicator of service revenue, as higher upstream spending means higher demand for the services and products provided by oil service companies.CatalystsA turnaround in the economic slowdown witnessed in China and in the U.S. could be a trigger for oil prices, which have decreased by almost 20% in the last three months. A resolution of the debt crisis currently engulfing the European Union would have a similar impact on oil prices, which in turn would increase the upstream spending by oil drilling companies.OutlookAccording to the latest HIS Inc. upstream spending report, It is expected that the total upstream operating and capital expenditures are set to reach a combined record of $1.23 trillion for 2012 and expected to rise to $1.64 trillion in 2016, and this will drive the revenue and profitability of the company going forward.Expected regional growth· Increased drilling activities in Saudi Arabia and Iraq are expected to increase CAPEX by nearly 80 percent from 2011 to 2016 in the Middle East.· Upstream spending in Africa is to be driven by expected growth in offshore activity of 62 percent from 2011 to 2016. This increased activity is linked to both ongoing and upcoming developments in East Africa as well as the Western Gulf of Guinea.· CAPEX in Europe is expected to rise from $45 billion in 2011 to reach $57 billion in 2016, due to recent discoveries in offshore Norway, which are entering the development stage, and as existing regional pipeline projects are completed.· Development and exploration spending in offshore Brazil will be the largest contributor for total upstream spending to reach about $230 billion in Latin America through 2012-2016.· Total OPEX is expected to reach $671 billion in 2016, as new fields are brought online and due to rising global costs per unit of oil/gas produced.Company OverviewHAL is one of the largest providers of services and products to the Energy Industry. It serves the Upstream Oil and Natural Gas Industry all through the lifecycle of the reservoir, from exploration, to well development and drilling and optimizing production life of the field.The two primary revenue segments are Completion and Production, and Drilling and Evaluation.Financial PerformanceThe EPS of $0.89/share for 1Q2012 increased 46% as compared to EPS of $0.61/share reported in 1Q2011.Following is the reported revenue for the first quarter:Source: 10QTotal revenueTotal revenue increased 30% from $5.2 billion in 1Q2011 to $6.8 billion in 1Q2012, which was primarily attributable to increased activity in North America, as the demand for production enhancement and cementing work continued to rise.Cash flow from operation and CAPEXThe cash flow from operations of $734 million improved by 30% as compared to $565 million for 1Q2011. The CAPEX of $782 million for 1Q2012 increased 11%, as compared to $704 million for 1Q2011.U.S. IndustryThe U.S. contributed about 61% of the revenue for 1Q2012. The decline in natural gas prices compared to 1Q2011 has increased the shift from natural gas shale plays to oil-and-liquids-rich shale plays. Gas rig count has declined 18%, while oil rig count has increased 39%, and this transition has resulted in additional costs, squeezing the margins of HAL in 1Q2012. However, in the long run, the shift from gas to liquids-and-oil shale will require provision of high service; hence HAL's profitability will increase. Deepwater drilling activity in the Gulf of Mexico continues to recover due to an increase in drilling permit approvals by the U.S. government. Management expects increased level of permit approvals in 2012, which will lead to additional deepwater rigs being installed in the Gulf of Mexico.International IndustryIt is anticipated that the industry will witness volume increases since improved macroeconomic trends support positive upstream spending outlook and new rigs are expected to enter the market due to the prevailing international oil and natural gas prices. These trends will lead to increased demand for service equipment. It is expected that international pricing will remain competitive due to over capacity, and that the Oil Service Industry will witness increased unconventional oil and gas projects.Guar Gum CostHalliburton recently announced that it expected a decline of 5.00-5.50% in its North America margin for 2Q2012, making it 20.0-20.5%, which was higher than its previous 2.00-2.50% guidance, primarily due to higher costs for guar.The rising guar prices are a result of the rapid shift in the increase in unconventional liquid rich drilling. This increase in guar prices is transitory and is expected to ease with India's Guar seed harvest season in the beginning of next year, and due to the upcoming availability of potential guar substitutes.HAL had previously stated that it had enough guar for the whole of 2012, but now has indicated that it has a four month reserve to be used if it can't procure supplies. Hence, margins are expected to be affected.Potential liability due to MacondoThe U.S. government has reservations over HAL's performance in providing cementing services on the Macondo well, which led to one of the largest oil spills in history. Despite indemnification clauses in HAL's contract with BP, we highlight the risk of potential liability in terms of the spill cleanup and compensation for commercial losses.Market consolidation in unconventional resourcesSchlumberger is focusing efforts on unconventional assets in North America, increasing the competition for HAL. Meanwhile, HAL's market share is expected to be hurt as Baker Hughes intends to add capital to the unconventional resource business, according to analysts at JP Morgan & Chase.Stock price performanceThe stock price performance has shown a decline of 16% in the previous three months, a decline of 15% YTD and a decline of 37% in the last one year.CompetitorsThe major competitors of SLB include Schlumberger Ltd. (NYSE:SLB), National Oilwell Varco Inc. (NYSE:NOV), and Baker Hughes Inc. (BHI).Schlumberger Ltd is trading at a P/E and P/B ratio of 15.3x and 2.7x and offers a dividend yield of 1.7%.National Oilwell Varco Inc. is trading at a P/E and P/B ratio of 11.2x and 1.5x respectively and offers a dividend yield of 0.7%, which is much lower than its peers. Its EPS has witnessed a growth of 44% in 1Q2012 and its profitability is expected to rise going forward.Baker Hughes Inc. is trading at a P/E and P/B of 11x and 1.1x respectively and offers a dividend yield of 1.5%. The company's profits are expected to shrink in the future.RecommendationWe are of the opinion that the financial position of the company is strong at the moment and our expectations are, based on the shift from gas to liquids-and-oil in the U.S., that the profitability of the company will improve, putting it at an advantage since it is a dominant service company in this field.Trading at a P/E and P/B ratio of 8.69x and 1.88x, and offering a dividend yield of 1.28, we believe that HAL is expected to perform well going forward. We have a positive outlook on the stock, but advise a cautious stance related to the legal proceeding in relation to Mocondo and non-reversal in the uptick of guar prices going forward.We recommend a Long position in Halliburton Co. and Short OIH Services ETF (NYSEARCA:OIH).Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
727451,24582,2012-07-17T17:05:02-04:00,,"With oil selling off significantly from its 2012 highs and natural gas prices depressed for most of the year, oil service stocks like Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) have had a tough 2012. However, as is often the case in the marketplace, investors are ignoring the underlying earnings power of Halliburton.Although I believe Halliburton to be an excellent long-term buy, I expect its share price to languish a bit longer, as I expect another leg down in the broader markets and in energy prices. Regardless, those who mitigate their individual equity risk with macro hedges shouldn't mind further weakness.Business IntroductionHalliburton operates in the oil services industry. HAL is employed to oversee the operational processes of drilling, monitor well construction and sealing, evaluate the drilling site, measure flow-rate, and so forth. The company supplies various technologies and equipment to those actually doing the drilling. Halliburton also maintains general consulting, IT infrastructure and software services that help clients perform their own operations.A large part of Halliburton's business is the oversight of hydraulic fracturing, or ""fracking."" Though this operation has taken a lot of political heat, studies from the EPA have proven that the method poses no risk to drinking water supplies, given the various safety procedures that the operators employ.Growth CatalystsThere are definite ""mega-trends"" underway in the energy sector. The first is the transition from coal-based electricity generation to cleaner, more efficient, natural gas-based generation.Just this past April, the EIA reported that coal and natural gas were each responsible for 32% of electricity production; compare this to 2007, when coal produced 100 million more megawatt hours than natural gas.Halliburton benefits from this trend since natural gas producers utilize HAL's services to aid them in their fracking operations. Halliburton has strong operations in huge natural gas extraction sites like the Bakken, where they are the leading service provider. Obviously, with natural gas prices plunging below the $2 level earlier this year, production was rapidly cut to reduce market supply, temporarily hurting Halliburton's sales. Long-term however, natural gas production is in its infancy, and Halliburton's bottom line has already begun seeing the huge benefits from this trend.As natural gas prices begin to rise and production picks up, Halliburton will return to the 50% operating income growth it enjoyed in 2010 and 2011. Since 2009, Halliburton's EPS has grown 152%, and yet investors are worrying about this year's weak growth, due to once in a lifetime natural gas price lows? It's terribly shortsighted, and has sent HAL to a no-growth valuation.Another catalyst is offshore drilling, where Halliburton has large operations. The company's most recent 10-Q notes that its Gulf of Mexico operations have recovered significantly due to more drilling permits in the aftermath of the BP rig explosion. Offshore drilling is a particularly strong business for HAL as their technological expertise is a necessity for the complexities of the extraction process.ValuationValuation is only relevant to see whether or not a company is trading at fair value relative to its underlying cash flow generation and earnings power. In the case of Halliburton, trading at a mere 9 times trailing earnings, it is trading at a near 40% discount to the broader market multiple, despite a recent history of 50% EPS growth.The market clearly believes that natural gas prices and overall energy demand will not recover anytime soon. Halliburton itself notes that natural gas prices of about $4 mmbtu are where producers achieve a reasonable rate of return on their investments.I agree with the market's medium-term forecast; China, Brazil, India, and the U.S. are slowing markedly, and much of Europe may be entering a full-blown depression. This can't be ignored when analyzing any investment. The fact of the matter is an equity could be cheap and have an excellent business, but the overall economy can totally mess it up as a medium term investment.That being said, Halliburton is trading at a huge discount to the broader market multiple, despite huge underlying growth. Five years from now, natural gas will be the clear leader in electricity generation, and will be responsible for far more vehicular energy. Firms will have worked out the supply glut, and Halliburton's leading services will be in high demand. HAL's EPS in 2017 could easily be double, if not more, than today's $3.20.ConclusionsHalliburton's long-term prospects are exciting, and its business is so technological in nature that its existing competitors - Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB), Baker Hughes (BHI), Weatherford (WFT) - are the only threats. Additionally, Halliburton's technology has been a clear leader, especially in the Bakken region, where drillers have been heavily utilizing their services.There are some undeniable risks to the overall macroeconomy in the medium term, and they are going to affect all equities. Investors who implement their own macro hedging strategies don't have to worry, but vanilla investors may want to wait if they're not willing to experience any near-term pain.I understand that some readers may be confused by my conclusion that Halliburton is cheap, but may not be a good investment at this very time. This is simply a result of my strong bearish feelings on the overall economy; if you feel differently, start accumulating Halliburton for the aforementioned reasons. Halliburton should outperform the market over the next decade by a wide margin.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

In essence, you are getting paid to put in a ""limit order.""An investor usually sells a put option if his/her outlook on the underlying security is bullish. The buyer of the put option pays the seller a premium for the right to sell the shares at an agreed-upon price. If the stock does not trade at or below the agreed-upon price (strike price), the seller gets to keep the premium.Benefits associated with selling naked putsThe majority of traders opt to close the put out prior to expiration if they have the chance of buying it back at much lower price. For example, selling the put at $2.50 and buying it back at $0.50.WarningThis strategy should not be employed on speculative stocks. This strategy should only be employed if you would like to own the stock but want to purchase it at a lower price.Reasons to be bullish on Halliburton (NYSE:HAL):Suggested Put strategy for HalliburtonIt has still not managed to break its downtrend despite being a corrective phase for almost a year.

Investors can wait for a test of the 27.21 ranges and then sell naked puts in the 25-27 ranges.It is now trading at $29.31, and the Oct 27 2012 puts are trading in the 1.99-2.03 ranges. So roughly when it trades down to the 27.00 ranges, the Oct 25 puts should be trading roughly in the same range. As long as it does not take an inordinate of time to get there, and if it does traders can aim for the Jan 2013 puts to try to lock in a similar premium. For this example, let us assume that we can sell the Oct 25 puts for $1.99. For each contract sold, $199 will be deposited in your account. If the stock trades below 25, then the shares could be assigned to your account. Your final price would be 23.01 (25-1.99). If the stock does not trade below 25, you get to keep the premium and walk away with a gain of roughly 8% in five months.A more extreme strategy would be to wait for it to test 24 and then sell puts with strikes in the 22-24 ranges. As this is a more extreme entry - your chances are also much slimmer of getting a fill here. However, you could split your money into 2-3 lots and deploy the second lot on a test of 24.00. With this strategy, you could end up getting in as low as $20, which would make for a remarkable long term entry in our opinion. You should understand though that the odds are not very high that it will trade this low. With the wild way, the markets move today, though one never knows, and it will hurt to place a second order at this level.Company: Halliburton CoLevered free cash flow = $785 millionBasic Key ratiosGrowthDividend historyDividend sustainabilityPerformanceConclusionThe markets are still in a corrective mode, but in the interim, some sort of relief rally could (key word being could) take hold as they are extremely oversold.

642211,30071,2012-06-06T17:58:18-04:00,,"Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) announced on Wednesday, June 6th that North American margins would be hit by around 300 bps because of a higher than expected increase in guar gum prices. This is in addition to guidance for a North American margins decrease of 200 to 250 bps in last quarter's release. This announcement has taken Halliburton down around 4%, to $28 per share, approaching at 52 week low of $26.99.While this will create downward pressure on earnings this quarter, and possibility through the end of the year I do believe this is a positive sign for oil service companies. Prices of guar gum are being forced higher by strong demand for fracking services. I think this high demand is a positive sign given the recent downturn in oil prices, and the historically low prices of natural gas.Also I believe guar gum prices will began to fall as supply of guar increases. While Halliburton has not been able to pass along cost increases fast enough on the way up, they will also likely be slow in lowering prices on the way down. About 70% of global guar supply comes from India, were acres planted are expected to increase 50% next year. In the end of March prices reached a record of $1711 per 100 kilograms in Mumbai. Rama Industries, the third largest shipper of guar gum believes prices could drop by as much as 50%.Halliburton reports earnings on July 23th and I believe as earnings estimates are taken down the company could be set up for an earnings beat. This is a company that has a strong record of beating earnings, and it is only trading at around 7 times forward earnings. With revenue growth estimated to be 15% this year, and 10% next year.The move in the stock down to $28 is a strong break below longer term support around $30 per share; however I expect Halliburton to find support as it approaches its 52 week low at $26.99. I would be a buyer of Halliburton near the 52 week low price. If the economy improves, oil prices will pick up, and if the economy fails to improve the Federal Reserve will continue accommodative measures. I believe that would hurt the dollar, and increase commodity prices, including oil, over the medium term. Either way I think oil will be higher over much the next year.Data sourced from: Yahoo!Finance, and company filings.

695531,22742,2012-07-02T03:30:15-04:00,,"By Timour ChayipovHalliburton (NYSE:HAL) is one of the biggest oil service companies in the world, operating in about 80 countries. The stock closed Friday, June 30, 2012 at $28.39.I believe that the company is undervalued by at least 60% relative to its peers or using the discounted cash flow model (DCF). The reason for this discrepancy: it is still battling with BP in the court over responsibilities for the Gulf of Mexico disaster.My personal opinion is that BP doesn't have much chance to prevail legally because in the oil industry (where I work) generally contracts between oil companies and service companies assign responsibilities in the same way: the service company must maintain a reasonable profit margin (not including any risk premium to its own price) but the oil company retains all responsibilities for any kinds of disasters. Unless BP can prove that the disaster is solely due to work performed by Halliburton without BP supervision, approval or involvement, it is highly likely that BP will retain the majority, if not all of the remaining responsibility. HAL has reserved $300 million to cover any adverse decision and it is unlikely, in my opinion based upon my personal observations from within the industry, that any outcome would exceed that amount.But if I am wrong (always a possibility) there is still some potential that HAL will be penalized. So if that happens the price of its shares may drop even more, but I would be very comfortable owning HAL shares at $23 if the price were to drop that low.So my recommendation to play this situation is to use an artificial buy/write strategy. The reason that this is called an ""artificial"" strategy is because we do not actually own the stock; instead, we use options to build a long position in the stock using less money. In this strategy we will not actually own the stock unless it falls below my target of $23 per share. If that happens, we will simply hold onto this quality stock until it recovers, which it ultimately will do, collect the dividends and maybe sell some calls when the price and premiums allow us to do so without risking a loss.Our first step is to sell January 2014 put option(s) with a strike price of $23.00 and collect a premium of $3.00 per share. We then use that premium to construct a Bull Call spread(s): January 2014 strikes $30/$40 for $3.07. What this means is that we buy a January 2014 call option with a strike price of $30 with a premium of $4.50 per share (or $450) and we sell a January 2014 call option with a strike price of $40 and a premium of $1.43 for a net cost of $3.07. Thus, this trade has a total cash outlay of $0.07 per share plus commissions. Commissions should be less than $10 per trade (2 trades = <$20) and if you use options extensively in managing your portfolio, as I do, you can get the cost down to as little as $1 per trade, which is inconsequential to the outcome.We will also need to maintain a cash or cash equivalents balance in our account (brokers differ on their definitions of cash equivalents, so it is best that you contact your own broker to get a better understanding of what you can use here) to secure the put option. If you are using a taxable, margin account you will need to have somewhere between 30 percent and 50 percent (depending upon your broker) of the amount that would be required to purchase the shares if you are put the stock, or from $690 to $1,300 per 100 shares (or for each contract). If you are using a tax-deferred account, you will need to have the full 100 percent to secure the put(s), or $2,300 per 100 share (or for each contract) represented by the put option contract(s) sold. But remember that the benefit of the tax-deferred account is the tax-deferral (or tax avoidance if in a Roth account) and that benefit really adds up over the years.In the following example we are using a taxable, margin account with an assumed 50 percent of the strike price required to secure the put option(s).So now that we have put things in place, let's explore the possible outcomes:If the HAL stock price increases to above $40 in January 2014 our call spread(s) will be in the money and trade for $10 each ($1,000 for each spread), and most of this will be profit because the price which we paid for the bull call spread ($3.07) is almost fully compensated for by the premium which we received from our short put(s) sold for $3.00 each which will expire worthless. The $0.07 difference can be fully recovered by selling a 3 month ''dividend call(s)'' against our long position.If we look at the October 2013 call options currently available, we'll see that the $35 strike price option pays a premium of $0.23 per share. It seems reasonable to assume that the price will be unlikely to rise so far in such a short time because the litigation with BP is likely to be prolonged. So we collect the premium and have all our cash outlays covered, including commissions. If the price were to jump that quickly, our profit would be reduced but our APR would increase because of the greatly reduced holding period and we would just unwind the rest of the positions and look for a new opportunity. If these dividend calls expire worthless in October, we can enhance our income from repeating the sale of new calls with a higher strike price, if appropriate, again for three months out (January 2013). Now we are essentially receiving the dividend (or maybe more) without owning the stock and with a much lower capital requirement (the amount required to secure the put).If the stock price of HAL is below $30 in January 2014 but above $20 we won't lose anything because again our short put(s) will expire worthless and the premiums received will compensate for price of the call spread(s), assuming that we sell at least one dividend call(s) during the holding period.The only way to lose money in this strategy is if HAL's stock price falls below our short put strike ($23), but at this level we should be happy to own the shares (as we are obligated to buy the stock at put strike in this case), because from that level HAL has terrific appreciation potential. However, while this is not a very likely outcome it must be accounted for because it is always possible. Therefore, it is very important to use this strategy with companies that we really would like to own with put strike prices at which we would be very comfortable buying.So, in essence, this strategy is like holding a free lottery ticket with a high probability of wining 75 percent or more. I am sure that there will be detractors who will claim that their strategies will make higher returns over the same holding period. But many of the ""better"" strategies also come with much higher risk levels.I hope that readers enjoy this article and the possibilities of the strategy as I plan to write more articles employing the same strategy as I find appropriate companies with which to employ it. This strategy has worked well of me over the years and I hope it will do as well for others.Disclosure: I am long HAL.Additional Disclosure: One note that is important for readers is that there are two authors  writing under the contributor name of K202 now.

621211,30131,2012-05-28T12:56:12-04:00,,"It may be a bit redundant to refer to a ""Troika"" as ""evil.""Although behavior is not really part of the definition, for many, the word still conjures up the Stalin era judicial system and its use of three impartial judges to find you guilty of a crime to be determined after your execution.More recently, ""Troika"" has been used to describe the participants in what Greek nationals see as the invasion of their sovereignty by the European Central Bank, the European Commission and the International Monetary Fund.My Evil Troika, however, has treated me well, despite being reviled, and rightfully so, by so many. I have no moral qualms about trading the shares of a company that's mired in controversy, although I might think more than twice before purchasing shares in a secondary offering or an IPO.The very names Halliburton (NYSE:HAL), British Petroleum (NYSE:BP) and Transocean (NYSE:RIG) conjure an immediate reaction from all who recall the Gulf Disaster of 2010. For those a little older, there's no shortage of other controversies surrounding these companies or their one time subsidiaries. Many of the controversies surround explosions, but there is ample diversity to satisfy most everyone's needs.At this moment, all three stocks are on my weekly watch list awaiting the post-Memorial Day market open.Of course in the after-math of the Gulf tragedy, some saw some black humor in how the members of the Evil Troika quickly started turning their backs upon one another and pointing fingers of responsibility and seeking legal redress. No doubt, that most people believe that there was more than enough blame to go all around.At first, I had considered writing about trading for income and profit on all three of these misanthropic companies, but realized that would muddy the waters, although not to the same extent as they have proven themselves capable. So instead, I wanted to start with Halliburton.A company that was at one time on many people's ""hate list,"" both for having been lead by Dick Cheney and for it's apparent sweetheart contracts in Iraq, after the invasion in 2004.As with its brethren, 2012 has to date (May 28, 2012) not been a very good year. While the S&P 500 is up 4.8% YTD, Halliburton is down 9.1%, having closed this past week at $31.37Being an inveterate covered call writer, I rarely see large profits on my underlying shares, as I tend to sell near the money or in the money contracts. I also try very hard to have my positions covered at all times, though that is not currently the case with all of my Halliburton shares.Yet despite not allowing myself to benefit from a buy low - sell high kind of existence, Halliburton represents another excellent example of how a stock can generate sufficient income to more than offset paper losses. In Halliburton's case, it can function as an annuity until the day comes, and it will, that a share price rebound will result in assignment.When reporting ROI, I tend to be conservative in how I define the denominator, as it is constantly changing, with new shares moving and out on a regular basis.I often use an analysis that grossly understates the actual return, but I find useful, much the same way as a bank finds the total amount of money that an account passes through via transactions, as perhaps more important than a snapshot of the daily balance.I look at the cumulative amount invested during a period of time. For example, If I purchased 1,000 shares of Halliburton on February 1, 2012 at $35/share and then purchased a new lot of 1,000 shares on February 8th at $35 to replace the assigned February 1st shares, I would consider the denominator to be $70,000, despite the fact that there was never more than $35,000 at risk at any one time.Ridiculous, I know. But using that methodology, my return on Halliburton has been 1.0% YTD. Had I not lost and gambled on using Halliburton shares in an effort to ""Collect Crumbs"" as options were expiring, the return would have been significantly higher. But, the tenet of that sub-strategy is to never have regret over a trade gone badly.A more realistic analysis might simply look at the return relative to the total costs associated with the maximum number of shares held at any one time. In that case, the return was 4.7%, using a $36 purchase price.(See 2012 trading history for Halliburton and associated options)Although that would be slightly below the S&P 500 return, it's far better than the decline in Halliburton share value, demonstrating that you don't necessarily need to know how to pick stocks or know how to time your purchase. You just need to steer the holdings using simple tools.An important distinction to be made is that ROI, in either analysis, represents realized gains, because they came from the sale of option contracts. There are no paper gains to be evaporated in the time it takes to write an article.My approach to the management of shares begins with how and under what circumstances they were acquired and is colored by a general short term pessimistic outlook, despite believing in a longer term upward trend.If acquired by simply purchasing shares, I tend to immediately sell calls at the nearest strike price, reflective of the short term pessimism. If the shares came as the result of having had put contracts assigned to me, I do the same, already having received an option premium for the sale of the put contract. Finally, in the event that I already own shares and they are sitting at a depressed price, I'll often purchase additional shares and sacrifice that newer lot by selling in the money calls, just to generate enhanced premiums to offset the paper losses on the original share lot.Instead of misery of dying by a thousand cuts, I look to create profit by a reveling is a thousand healed scabs, much like you may have received in shot in the face by a vice-Presidential pellet rifle.At the moment, Halliburton's miserable price makes it just right to begin that glorious healing stage.Disclosure: I am long HAL, BP, RIG."
671561,24866,2012-06-20T07:38:11-04:00,,"Halliburton's (NYSE:HAL) a great company. There, I said it. The EPA may find the firm partially culpable for the Macondo oil spill (a disaster that is overblown in more ways than one) and the public may scorn their work, but Halliburton is substantially undervalued. Oil well service peers Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB), National-Oilwell Varco (NYSE:NOV), and Baker Hughes (BHI) are also definitely worth a look.What makes Halliburton so attractive right now? Aside from the fact that the firm has beaten expectations for the last four quarters by an average of 4.8% despite an out-of-touch stock decline of 38.7% over the last 12 months, Halliburton is cheap on a multiples basis. It trades at just a respective 8.7x and 7.9x past and forward earnings - multiples the Street appears to think are cheap given the $44.42 price target and ""buy"" consensus. Halliburton's PE multiple is just three-fifths of its 5-year average PE multiple and 35% of its sector's current PE multiple.Source: Internal research. Note: Halliburton's EPS over the past 5 years.If you take a logarithmic regression of the oil well service firm's EPS over the last decade, you extrapolate 2016 EPS to be $4.60. This figure is actually highly bearish given that the Street anticipates 22.6% average annual growth over the next five years. Nevertheless, multiplying my 2016 EPS projection by the 5-year average PE multiple of 15.2x, the future stock value of Halliburton is $69.90. Discounting backwards by a WACC of 10% yields a target price of $43.40 - in-line with consensus and at a more than 50% premium to the current market value.But the story gets even better. Halliburton is one of those rare firms that is actually generating positive free cash flow in the high-capex oil & gas sector. If you project 26.5% growth over the next six years and 3% into perpetuity, consistent operating metrics, and a discount rate of 10%, you arrive at an intrinsic value of $38.40, which provides a 30.4% margin of safety. This comes on top of a 1.2% dividend yield and excellent management.Schlumberger, NOV, and Baker Hughes are also cheap at a respective 12.7x, 9.9x, and 8.9x forward earnings. They are also recommended on the Street and have delivered impressive momentum. Baker Hughes is only valued for less than one-half of its 52-week high, a total absurdity given better-than-expected results in the first quarter. Shareholders still seem to be on the fence after the 2.5% and 8.3% respective miss in 3Q11 and 4Q11. The fundamentals of the company are still strong: if the firm annually grows EPS at roughly one-half of what it is expected to (ie. 10%) over the next five years and trades at a 15x multiple (the 5-year average is 18.6x), the current stock price is justified at $59.55 (a roughly 50% premium to what it is valued at now) when discounting back by 10%. The market seems to be absurdly factoring in a WACC of 20% on a historically low PE multiple and operating projections that already assume a 50% and growing miss over 5 years.NOV is currently rated an impressive 8 out of 10 on MSN Money's StockScouter Report. The last four quarters have also beat expectations by an average of 7.4%, although the Street has gotten closer and closer to actual results over the time period. The firm still has a PE multiple that is one-half of it's sector. In terms of solvency, NOV is also solid at a current ratio of 2.2. Operations have further yielded an impressive 5-year average ROIC of 12%.Schlumberger adds yet another layer to my bullish oil well service thesis. The company trades at just 83% of its historical 5-year average PE multiple despite solid double-digit growth over the last four quarters. Performance may have a been a bit off in 1Q11 and 3Q11, but the fundamentals are well positioned to exploit growing demand for a scarce resource. EPA regulations have been overblown and are likely to be curtailed in the event of Romney victory. Oil spills have similarly given the industry a bad name despite their value creating role in the economy. But if investors are willing to put production and shareholder value ahead of reputation, the stock price has nowhere to go but up.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Additional disclosure: We seek IR business from all of the firms in our coverage, but research covered in this note is independent and for prospective clients.

608141,30961,2012-05-22T08:25:36-04:00,,"The selloff in the commodity space has been vicious since the top in April and energy specifically has taken a beating. Everything from oil, to service companies to E&P companies have all been sold and sold hard. Is this warranted? Time will tell if we are in the midst of another summer swoon; will we come out of this one unscathed as we did the last two?As the Energy Sector (NYSEARCA:XLE) enters support area from the November/December 2011 lows, many are predicting a bounce. The question is, is this bounce buyable? Or is it just a short term pop that will lead the way to more aggressive selling? I think it's important to look at the underlying fundamentals in order to properly position yourself for the future and to do so, we'll look at Halliburton (NYSE:HAL).Generally speaking, HAL is fairly loved by the analyst community, and rightfully so. They have a solid balance sheet and are a best in breed oil service name. HAL has a price target in the mid to high 40s and with 29 buys, 5 holds and zero sells on the name, the sentiment is rather bullish. By almost any metric HAL seems relatively inexpensive. But is it?It's all about Rig Count This stock lives and dies by the number of rigs running in America. Baker Hughes gives weekly updates to rig counts both in North America and International. Rig counts right now are at near all time high levels, hovering around 2000. Compare that to the fact that HAL is trading near half of its 52 week high, many question why the steep discount?Margins the Canary in the Coal Mine? Although margins in this business cycle never recovered to the 30%+ range that they were in the previous one, an interesting pattern could be unfolding here. Despite all time high rig counts, HAL's North American margins are under pressure. One would think the opposite would be going on here. Margins should be expanding, but instead a price war is beginning to take shape much like we saw in 2007/2008.Some time around the middle of 2007, HAL's gross margins fell from the low 30s to the mid 20s, despite extremely high rig counts. Although rig counts did not materially fall off for another 12-18 months, it signaled weakness ahead. Rig counts went on to plummet in late 2008 and early 2009 during the financial crisis.HAL's gross margins peaked in the middle of 2011 and have been slowly decaying ever since, again, despite all time high rig counts. The pattern is eerily similar to that of 2007/2008. Add to the fact that HAL has guided gross margins to the tune of 20% by the end of the year and you have a continued slow and steady decline, much like we saw the last time. Take a look at the chart below for a visual. If this pattern continues to take shape and unfold like 2007/2008, we will be seeing a major drop in rig counts towards the middle or end of 2012.Dividend Growth? Keep Dreaming... On the Q1 2012 conference call, management was asked about a buyback due to depressed price levels. HAL could buy back some meaningful stock at these levels, but in more words or less said that until Moconda is settled, don't expect a buyback, which means don't expect an increased dividend. Management also alluded to the fact that we are not close to Moconda being settled for good. HAL yields a paltry 1.2% right now from current prices. And although they could double that very easily and still be safe from a vicious downturn in the industry, they won't.The Value in Long Term Now it's not all bearish, HAL continues to take market share in the North American market. It is the premier service company on this continent and if you believe in the long term value of our nation switching from oil towards natural gas you will be hard pressed to find another company more ready to capitalize on that process than HAL. The problem is, that may be a long way out. HAL has a manageable debt level, with half of its 4.8 billion in debt coming due around 2020, and the other half way out in 2040. The company is rock solid on a long term time horizon.But that doesn't make it a good buy right here, right now. It's not as undervalued as many think. Sure its P/E levels are low, but where is the growth going to come from? It sure won't come from the US market with natural gas at these levels, and their international presence leaves a lot to be desired. HAL should trade at a discounted P/E considering its growth prospects looking out 12-18 months. If the company paid a juicy dividend that would be one thing, but it doesn't and has no intention of doing so any time soon. Its margins are contracting, its revenue is flat at best.Eventually the US market will experience a boom in shale gas drilling that will rival anything we have ever seen before. It's not a question of if, more when. Right now the fundamentals do not support that kind of movement and until it does, HAL will remain under pressure. Bottom line: it's not as undervalued as you may think.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

This process culminates in what we call our Valuentum Buying Index (click here for more info on our methodology), which ranks stocks on a scale from 1 to 10, with 10 being the best. In the spirit of transparency, we show how the performance of our VBI has stacked up per underlying score:If a company is undervalued both on a DCF and on a relative valuation basis and is showing improvement in technical and momentum indicators, it scores high on our scale. Halliburton posts a VBI score of 6 on our scale, reflecting our 'undervalued' DCF assessment, attractive relative valuation versus peers, and bearish technicals. Halliburton is near the top of its peer group that includes Baker Hughes (BHI), Cameron International (NYSE:CAM), National Oilwell Varco (NYSE:NOV), and Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB).Our Report on Halliburton imagesInvestment ConsiderationsInvestment HighlightsHalliburton earns a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT, the highest possible mark on our scale. The firm has been generating economic value for shareholders for the past few years, a track record we view very positively. Return on invested capital (excluding goodwill) has averaged 19.1% during the past three years.Halliburton's valuation is compelling at this time. The firm is trading at a nice discount to our estimate of its fair value, even after considering an appropriate margin of safety. The firm's forward earnings multipleand PEG ratio also look attractive versus peers.Halliburton's cash flow generation and financial leverage aren't much to speak of. The firm's free cash flow margin has averaged about 2.6% during the past three years, lower than the mid-single-digit range we'dexpect for cash cows. However, the firm's cash flow should be sufficient to handle its low financial leverage.The firm's shares are trading at an attractive level at this time. We are taking a closer look at picking up some of the firm's shares in the portfolio of our Best Ideas Newsletter. In the spirit of transparency, we show the performance of our Best Ideas Newsletter below (please view our links on our sidebar to the left for more information):The firm experienced a revenue CAGR of about 10.7% during the past 3 years. We expect its revenue growth to be below that of its peer median during the next five years.Business QualityEconomic Profit AnalysisThe best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital (NASDAQ:ROIC) with its weighted average cost of capital (OTC:WACC). The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. Halliburton's 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 19.1%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 9.9%. As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT. In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate.Cash Flow AnalysisFirms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. Halliburton's free cash flow margin has averaged about 2.6% during the past 3 years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generation is relatively MEDIUM. The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. For more information on the differences between these two measures, please visit our website at Valuentum.com (please view our links on our sidebar to the left for more information). At Halliburton, cash flow from operations increased about 59% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures expanded about 58% over the same time period.Valuation AnalysisOur discounted cash flow model indicates that Halliburton's shares are worth $56 each, which represents a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 17.2 times last year's earnings and an implied EV/EBITDA multiple of about 8.7 times last year's EBITDA. Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 9.1% during the next five years, a pace that is lower than the firm's 3-year historical compound annual growth rate of 10.7%. Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 19.4%, which is above Halliburton's trailing 3-year average. Beyond year 5, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 3.8% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For Halliburton, we use a 9.9% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows.Margin of Safety AnalysisOur discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $56 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future was known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values. Our ValueRisk™ rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock. In the graph below, we show this probable range of fair values for Halliburton. We think the firm is attractive below $39 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $73 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion. Please view our links on our sidebar to the left for more information.Future Path of Fair ValueWe estimate Halliburton's fair value at this point in time to be about $56 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart below compares the firm's current share price with the path of Halliburton's expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate. The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year 3 represents our best estimate of the value of the firm's shares three years hence. This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the firm's future cash flow potential change. The expected fair value of $74 per share in Year 3 represents our existing fair value per share of $56 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.

504551,21445,2012-04-17T15:51:41-04:00,,"Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) is expected to report Q1 earnings before the open on Wednesday, April 18, with a conference call scheduled for 9:00 am ET. Analysts are looking for a profit of 86c on revenue of $6.80B. The consensus range is 75c-91c for EPS, and revenue of $6.38B-$7.36B, according to First Call. About a month ago, Halliburton's peer Baker Hughes (BHI) warned of an operating profit decline, as it said a shift away from natural gas drilling is negatively impacting its pressure pumping products and international trends are being negatively affected by seasonality, weather, and project delays. Wells Fargo, which maintained its Outperform rating on Halliburton stock, said in a note to investors on March 26 that it reduced its valuation range on Halliburton after Baker Hughes' warning. Since that time, Halliburton has seen its shares downgraded to the equivalent of ""Hold"" ratings at Morgan Stanley, Howard Weil, and Raymond James. Over the last month of trading, Halliburton shares have declined over 5%, but the stock is up almost 2% in afternoon trading ahead of tomorrow's earnings report."
446341,24627,2012-03-20T14:04:24-04:00,,"The price of oil has been rising and it has been resilient even as  concerns over the global economy persist. Increasingly solid data from  the U.S. and tensions over Iran's nuclear program have been supporting  factors, but the continuing debt crisis and recession in Europe, along  with the possibility of a hard-landing in China should keep the oil  rally from getting out of hand ... for now.Future oil demand is  likely to increase with a growing global population and rising incomes  from consumers in emerging market countries. Because of this, it makes  sense for investors to have exposure to oil in their portfolios. If  Europe takes control of the debt crisis, and stronger growth kicks in  for China as well as other economies, we can expect much higher oil  prices. With the recent stock market rally and jump in oil prices, it's  getting harder to find stock bargains in this sector; however, thanks to  a recent decline, Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) is a bargain worth buying now. This  appears to be a very attractive time to start buying Halliburton, and  here are 6 reasons why the stock should be considered by investors now:1)  Halliburton Company is poised to benefit from the rising global demand  in energy because it provides critical products and services to the oil  and gas sector. Halliburton is cashing in on the shale boom in North  America, and the worldwide increase in deepwater drilling.2) This company recently reported record results.  Revenues for 2011, came in at $24.8 billion which was an increase of  38% from 2010. Net income for 2011, was $3 billion, or $3.26 per share,  versus $1.97 per share in 2010. Furthermore, analysts expect earnings to  continue growing, from about $3.90 per share in 2012 to around $4.53  per share in 2013.3) Halliburton shares are trading well below the average analyst target price,  which is about $51 per share. Based on the current share price of just  $35, this stock could provide gains of about 45% sometime in the next 12  months, if analyst targets are met.4) This stock is trading way  below the 52-week high of $57.77, while many oil stocks, for example,  Chevron (NYSE:CVX), are trading near 52-week highs. Halliburton shares trade  for just about 7.5 times forward earnings, and it has the potential for  multiple expansion in the future.5) The stock would probably be significantly higher now if it were not for lawsuits relating to the oil spill  in the Gulf of Mexico. BP (NYSE:BP) blames Halliburton for some of the  liability it has in the oil spill, but Halliburton has denied the  claims. This uncertainty could continue unless a settlement is reached  with BP. However, BP has recently settled with other contractors so a  settlement seems likely to come sooner or later. A settlement would  remove uncertainty and the stock would have a strong chance of rising  towards the analyst price targets of about $51 per share.6) While  waiting for a settlement and a higher stock price, investors are paid a  dividend yield of about 1%. That may not seem like much, but with  Halliburton earning close to $4 per share and paying out a dividend of  just 36 cents per share, there is a lot of room for the company to raise  the dividend in the future.It often pays to buy stocks while  some uncertainty is hanging over the company and Halliburton appears to  be one of those opportunities.Here are some key points for HAL:Data is sourced from Yahoo Finance.

However with WTI stuck near $100 per barrel and natural gas attempting to put in a floor near $2 I think this stock could be set for a comeback.Halliburton has great exposure to North America where there is an oil boom underway. I believe this is a company firing on all cylinders and not getting any love in the market. Q1 earnings came right in line with guidance and beat analysts' reduced expectations.The stock is trading at 8 times forward earnings, and historically has traded at closer 15 times earnings. Even if you take the $3.97 analysts expect the company to earn in 2013 and apply a 12x multiple you would get to $47.67. With the growth Halliburton is seeing, both domestically and internationally, I am looking for $4.50 a share in 2013.(Click to enlarge)To see what is driving Halliburton's stock a chart going back to last summer showing Halliburton compared to US Natural Gas (NYSEARCA:UNG), and US Oil (NYSEARCA:USO) is very telling. You can see the rise in oil and the fall in natural gas has left HAL to split the different between the two. I believe the stock is stuck in a tug-of-war between these two commodities. This has driven Halliburton down about 30% since last June.As the market starts to look for ways to play a possible comeback in natural gas prices Halliburton could be one of the best. With any stabilization in natural gas prices this stock could be ready to jump, but the company is still able to capitalize on high oil prices in the meantime.(Click to enlarge)Halliburton has been stuck in a tight range of about $30 to $40 for the past six months and an even tighter $32 to $36 for the past two. It is also off about 45% from last summer's highs and currently at the lower end of its trading range. The tightening Bollinger Bands show the volatility disappearing from this name, and should be pointing to a sizable move in either direction soon. I would be looking to enter Halliburton as it comes in to the lower end of this range. I would hold this as a long-term investment, but it could be a great trade on a pop back the upper end of the range.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in HAL, UNG over the next 72 hours."
507811,23762,2012-04-18T15:12:45-04:00,,"One of most undervalued stocks in my portfolio is Halliburton (HAL), which I picked up earlier this year. The stock is down some 40% since its highs over the summer. The entire oil services sector has been impacted by low natural gas prices and worries on what that means for production in that sector. I think those fears are overblown and believe that Halliburton's latest earnings report should help put those concerns to rest. The stock is poised for a nice run-up as it is way below intrinsic value, in my opinion.Highlights from the company's earnings report include the following:As stated in the business description for Halliburton on Yahoo Finance: Here are four additional reasons Halliburton is deeply undervalued at just $33 a share:Disclosure: I am long HAL."
489231,27011,2012-04-10T14:03:22-04:00,,"Oil has been dropping as global economic concerns over a slowdown increase. This has created some weakness in the stock market recently and even sharper drops in many oil services stocks. There is no doubt that the world will continue to consume energy, so it makes sense to consider buying the recent dip in the oil sector. After taking a closer look at a number of top oil services stocks, it becomes clear that Halliburton shares are deeply undervalued relative to other stocks. Here is a closer look at Halliburton and a couple of competitors:Halliburton Company (HAL) is one of the largest oilfield services companies in the world. Like most stocks in the oil sector, Halliburton shares have declined substantially in the past couple of weeks, but the company is prospering from the increased demand for deepwater and shale, which is evident in the improving financial results. Revenue for 2011 was $24.8 billion, which was an increase of 38% from 2010. Net income for 2011 was $3 billion, or $3.26 per share and analysts expect even stronger results in 2012. There is one major overhang on this company and that is unresolved claims from the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. This seems to be the one solid reason for the stock to trade below its peers, however, there is a good chance the claims will be settled. Once they are, the shares could move much higher. The stock trades for about half the 52-week high and for about 7 times earnings estimates. Halliburton's leading position in the industry was recently recognized by Fortune magazine which included the company in the ""World's Most Admired Companies"" list for 2012. This bargain stock is likely to reward investors in the long run, and the biggest indicator of undervaluation comes when you compare Halliburton to its peers (see below). Halliburton shares are currently one of the least expensive ways to buy a fundamentally sound company in the oil sector:Key Data Points From Yahoo Finance:52-Week Range: $27.21 to $57.77Dividend: 36 cents, which provides a yield of 1.1%2012 Earnings Estimate: $3.78 per share2013 Earnings Estimate: $4.39 per shareP/E Ratio: about 8 times earningsMcDermott International (MDR) is an engineering and construction services company, primarily for offshore oil and gas projects. While this company is not a direct or completely comparable stock to Halliburton, it is in the same industry and benefits from the expansion and health of the oil industry. Oil industry investors must evaluate where their capital can be deployed and part of that analysis must be what offers them the best valuation. It is interesting to consider that these shares trade for about 13 times earnings, which is a premium of around 60% when compared with Halliburton's price-to-earnings ratio of just about 8.Key Data Points From Yahoo Finance:52-Week Range: $9.34 to $25.94Dividend: none2012 Earnings Estimate: 89 cents per share2013 Earnings Estimate: $1.23 per shareP/E Ratio: about 13.4 times earningsSchlumberger Limited (SLB) has some similarities to Halliburton and it provides project management and other services to oil and gas companies. This company is also benefiting from the recent strength of the oil industry and it reported full-year 2011 revenue of $39.54 billion and earnings of $3.66 per share. The strength of the business and balance sheet has allowed Schlumberger to increase the dividend by 10% recently. Schlumberger is an industry leader and it deserves to trade higher over time, however, when you see that you can buy Halliburton shares for just around 8 times earnings versus Schlumberger's at about 14, it really makes sense to consider Halliburton shares today. In time, Halliburton will likely put the oil spill claims behind it, and the stock should trade closer to the valuation that Schlumberger receives today.Key Data Points From Yahoo Finance:52-Week Range: $54.79 to $95.53Dividend: $1.10, which provides a yield of 1.5%2012 Earnings Estimate: $4.69 per share2013 Earnings Estimate: $5.72 per shareP/E Ratio: about 14.4 times earningsDisclosure: I am long HAL.Disclaimer: Data sourced from Yahoo Finance.

Energy companies are moving to more expensive and more dangerous drilling sites. Since supply is so tight, any shock to the oil supply system results in a drastic price spike. Just look at the Libyan oil crisis in 2011. The Economist states,""Libya's turmoil has reduced global oil output by a mere 1%."" But yet, ""the price of Brent crude jumped 15% as Libya's violence flared up, reaching $120 a barrel on February 24th.""Here is the Energy Information Agency's projections for oil prices up until 2035:Rising oil prices and potential supply shocks have caused fracking shale to become an economically viable option for energy companies. As you can see, Shale gas is projected to dominate the natural gas industry for years to come. The combination of rising oil prices and the boom of shale gas has led me to a long term investment opportunity. Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) is that opportunity.

It also has a higher projected EPS growth over the next 3-5 years than Exxon. It also leads Exxon on quarterly revenue and earnings growth rates - 36 and 49% respectively vs. Exxon's 15% and 1.6%, respectively.One could argue that the host of lawsuits are a black cloud hanging on Halliburton, and this is clearly reflected in its share price. While Exxon's shares are trading close to its highs, Halliburton's are trading close to 52 week lows. Even though it's possible many of these cases could/might end up being dismissed, one can never predict how things will actually unfold in the future. Here are some of the pending cases the outcomes of which could potentially have a material impact on Halliburton.On the other hand, one could argue that a lot of the worst news is already priced in and that any form of good news could send the stock soaring.From a technical perspective Halliburton appears to be trying to put in a bottom and a weekly close above $35 will turn the outlook bullish. While Exxon does have a higher yield and a higher five-year dividend growth rate, one could argue that Halliburton overcomes this shortfall with higher capital gains. This one is truly hard to call and if push came to shove we would lean with Exxon only because no one can predict with any degree of certainty how these lawsuits will pan out.Which one do you think would make for a better investment and why?

457421,23209,2012-03-26T10:06:28-04:00,,"We have already presented our pricing model for Halliburton (NYSE:HAL). Also we have been routinely reporting on similar models for ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) and ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM). All these models were based on our general concept that the evolution of any share price can be (quantitatively) represented as a weighted sum (or difference) of two CPI/PPI components. This pricing concept was developed four years ago by predicting share prices for a few energy companies. Essentially, we were trying to use the core CPI as an energy independent (dynamic) reference to the headline CPI which includes energy and, in turn, is related to oil price and thus the prices of energy companies. Therefore, we assumed that the difference between these two CPIs might be manifested in the energy pricing power relative to all other goods and services. At the later stages, the set of companies was extended to the S&P 500 list as a whole, and the model obtained new CPIs, time lags and a linear trend term.ConocoPhillips and Exxon Mobil are the biggest energy companies and they have demonstrated almost the same sensitivity to the difference between the core, CC, and headline CPI, C, i.e. their pricing models were almost identical. Halliburton's share price was also modeled and showed a different sensitivity to the change in the defining CPIs. We made a tentative conclusion that COP and XOM might have a larger return to the investor considering energy stocks.Originally, we have demonstrated that the time history of a share price, p(T), (for example, HAL) could be accurately approximated by a linear function of the difference between the core CPI and the headline CPI in the United States. At the initial stage of our research, this difference was found to be the best to predict share prices of energy related companies. Mathematically, a share price, HAL, (we use a monthly closing price adjusted for dividends and splits) can be approximated by a linear function of the lagged difference between the core and headline CPI:HAL = 42 - 3.5dCPI(t+t1) (1)where dCPI(t+t1)=CC(t+t1)-C(t+t1), t is the elapsed time, and t1=0 year is the time delay between the share and the CPI change. In the original model, the CPI difference had no time lag behind the share price, t1=0, and we covered the period between 1999 and 2009. The upper panel of Figure 1 shows the original model performance between July 2003 and February 2012, with the standard model error of $4.51.Since 2009, the original model has been routinely validated by new data. Overall, it has demonstrated a good predictive power but we have also revealed some short-term deviations from observed prices. It was instructive to improve its performance and, using the experience with non-energy companies, to extend the set of defining CPIs. We have tested several pricing models for Halliburton with the same CPI and PPI components which were tested for ConocoPhillips and ExxonMobil. The extended set of defining indices includes: the core and headline CPI, the consumer price index of energy, E, and the producer price index of crude petroleum, OIL, together with the overall PPI. Thus, we tested models similar to (1) using two more differences for the period between 2001 and 2011. For this article, we have modeled the period between July 2003 and February 2012 with the same coefficients, which were obtained and reported in 2011:HAL = 30 - 0.30(CC - E); sterr =$4.85 (2)HAL = 25 - 0.13(OIL - PPI); sterr =$9.34 (3)In other words, all coefficients in (1)-(3) were estimated by the least squares for the period between January 2001 and July 2011 and then used to describe the period through February 2012. The zero time lag was retained in the model similar to that in the ConocoPhillips and ExxonMobil models, where we found no time delay between the share price and defining differences. Unlike for COP, both standard model errors are larger than for the original model, i.e. the original model based on the headline and core CPI is the best among the three studied models. The upper panels in Figures 1 through 3 compare these three HAL models with zero time lags and no time trend. The modeling period is extended by seven months and the most important difference from the July 2011 is that the large excursion in the observed price has been well described by the dCPI. According to the best model, the current price is slightly undervalued.At the same time, model (3) based on the producer price indices is the worst (sterr=$9.34). This may mean that Halliburton does not depend much on the producer prices. Interestingly, the change in oil price does accurately describe the period of the financial crisis. However, the model fails to predict slow changes in the share price. Model (3) has failed to predict the recent price peak but this deviation was only a transient one - the observed price is back to the predicted level.Another possibility to improve the overall agreement between the observed and predicted prices is to allow for different coefficients for the defining CPIs, time lags and linear trend. The latter is an obvious component since we expect all share prices to rise with real economic growth. There models below have been estimated using these new features which have brought visible improvements as expressed by the standard model errors for the same period:HAL= 3.48C - 4.97CC(t-1) + 5.81(t-2000) + 249.24; sterr=$4.16 (4)HAL= -2.08CC(t-2) + 0.34E + 7.61(t-2000) + 261.93; sterr=$3.55 (5)HAL= 0.96PPI - 0.028OIL(t-7) - 3.33(t-2000) - 73.21; sterr=$4.13 (6)Model (5) provides the best explanation of the variability in the HAL share price since July 2003 using a time lead of only two months for the core CPI. The CPI of energy evolves in sync with the share. The CC slope is negative while the E slope is positive and thus we have the difference between the CPIs. The overall agreement between the observed and predicted prices is very good for the past nine years. The PPI model (6) is much better (sterr =$4.13 instead of $9.35) with time leads (OIL leads the share price by seven months) than model (3) without lags. Instructively, that the OIL slope is very small - the HAL share price does not depend on oil directly, but rather through the consumer price of energy as model (5) suggests. The dCPI model (4) is also better than (1) but has lost its position.Finally, Figures 1 through 3 clearly indicate that the closing price in February 2012 was slightly undervalued and one can expect that the current deviation from the predicted price will disappear in the near future. The observed price may rise to $40-$42 per share in March/May 2012. The previous burst in price, observed between February and September 2011, has proved that the price quickly returns to the predicted level.In the long-run, the expected fall in oil price at a five-year horizon down to $30 per barrel will likely (judging by model (5)) result in a proportional increase in HAL's shares.(Click to enlarge)(Click to enlarge)Figure 1.

441291,24866,2012-03-19T00:28:19-04:00,,"With BP plc (NYSE:BP) estimating settlements costs of $7.8B and floating partial blame on its contractors, Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) and Transocean's (NYSE:RIG) fates are still uncertain. As an investor relations consultant, I believe that this negative press has had an irrational impact on limiting value creation for strong brands like Recon Technology (NASDAQ:RCON) and Tesco Corporation (NASDAQ:TESO). I strongly recommend these two smaller oil well & equipment service firms (which I will elaborate on in later articles) and not letting the BP debacle cloud your perspective.In this article, I will run you through my DCF analysis on Halliburton and then will triangulate the result with an exit multiple calculation and a review of the fundamentals compared to Transocean and Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB).First, let's begin with an assumption about revenues. Halliburton finished FY2011 with $24.8B in revenue, which represented a 38.2% gain off of the preceding year. Analysts model 26.5% over the next five years.Moving onto the cost-side of the equation, there are several items to consider: Operating expenses, capital expenditures, and taxes. I expect cost of goods sold to eat 84% of revenue versus 1.3% for SG&A and 32% for taxes. Capex is around 12% of revenue, but we will exclude it from the model since - like many firms in the sector - it renders free cash flow negative. Instead, we will look at adjusted cash flow from operations.We then need to subtract out net increases in working capital. I model accounts receivable as 21% of revenue, inventories as 13% of COGS, accounts payable as 8% of OPEX, and accrued expenses as 290% of SG&A.This means that the company will generate $7.7B worth of adjusted operating cash flow by 2017. If this projection is discounted backwards by a WACC of 10% at a perpetual growth rate of 2%, the contribution to equity is $72B. Of course, we have yet to add in capex.All of this falls under the context of strong performance:From a multiples perspective, Halliburton is fairly attractive. It trades at a respective 10.6x and 7.7x past and forward earnings versus 21.9x and 13.4x for Schlumberger, and 12.2x forward earnings for Transocean. Assuming a multiple of 13x and a conservative 2013 EPS of $4.51, the rough intrinsic value of the stock is $58.63, implying 70% upside.Consensus estimates for Transocean's EPS forecast that it will grow by 94.8% to $3 in 2012 and then by 59.3% and 18.6% in the following two years. Assuming a multiple of 13x and a conservative 2013 EPS of $4.70, the rough intrinsic value of the stock is $61.10, implying 4.1% upside. At the BAML 2011 Global Energy Conference, Transocean's CEO Steven Newman claimed indemnity indemnity and argued that ""[i]f BP fails to honor its promises, it doesn't live up to its obligations"". In a play of brinkmanship, Newman continued that ""the service community [may] no longer rely on the contract"" and that this will cause ""[t]he cost structure [to] increase dramatically"". Transocean, itself, is in strong financial shape and has excellent geographical diversification to hedge against instability in any one region.Schlumberger is similarly proving its strong fundamentals. The company delivered impressive results in the most recent quarter, beating analyst expectations. Rig count decline will, however, put pressure on margins, while free cash flow yield remains low. Utilization rates of around 80% will make Haynesville and Fayetteville the ares to watch as dry-to-wet switching increases. I expect the company to outperform.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in HAL over the next 72 hours.Disclaimer: We seek IR business from all of the firms in our coverage, but research covered in this note is independent and for prospective clients.

322568,20500,2012-01-27T01:52:41-05:00,,"Leading up to and immediately following the recent Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) quarter, much of the sellside and TV financial talk shows centered worries over HAL's margins and generally ended with a tag line along the lines of ""Good company but I like Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) better"" or ""HAL margins are going lower, SLB is better positioned"". Look around and you'll see these types of headlines everywhere.I own HAL and have for quite some time and the margin concern comments are nothing new. Given the recent slide natural gas prices the knee jerk reaction is almost always going to be sell HAL since they are so leveraged to North America (NAM).The stock is already depressed and this latest reaction is overly simplistic. For several quarters, HAL's management team has been transparent about the ongoing shift in equipment from gas centric to liquids rich centric plays in NAM. If people are surprised that there will be some extra costs during the transitionary period over which this occurs (should be large done in 1Q12) then they have not been paying close attention.Furthermore, management has been plain about a slow recovery occuring for international programs and despite recent Middle East and Africa regional turmoil, the international segment has grown (largely, but not entirely due to Latin America) and operating margins there are indeed recovering nicely.But what is really simplistic is the comment that for the reason that SLB is not as exposed to North America it should be bought in place of HAL. The issues for HAL in NAM are near terms ones, and again, they just put up record numbers and once the transition to oilier completions is made they should see higher utilization and more pricing power. Being well positioned in NAM with an ongoing unconventional oil production boom in process is not a bad thing.At the end of the day (or the first quarter in this case), will HAL's operating margins be further pressured? Most likely yes, probably on the order of 100 to 200 basis points. But as they come out of the transition the company emerges in an environment of high demand from liquids rich seeking, natural gas fleeing players like Chesapeake (CHK). Moreover, completing oil wells is more revenue intensive work than completing gas wells. There are more ""touches"" involved in the process. And the work will be steadier. Meanwhile, Gulf of Mexico activity for HAL (not for others) is above pre Macondo levels and the international segment continues to improve in the near term with a longer term promise of ramping activity from unconventional projects that are only in their infancy now.So my thought is that HAL, trading at 9 to 10x 2012 estimates (depending on if you go by consensus or the low end of estimates out there), and under 8x 2013 estimates with its 20%ish operating margins is not necessarily unattractive vs SLB, trading at 16x and 13x 2012 and 2013 consensus estimates respectively with its 21% margins and apparently slower growing revenue stream. Since people don't as readily reel off margins at SLB let's finish with some graphs.Disclosure: I am long HAL, CHK."

321046,20568,2012-01-21T15:38:28-05:00,,"Major oilfield services provider Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL)  is scheduled to report its fourth quarter 2011 results on Monday January 23, 2012 before the start of trading.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter is a profit  of 99 cents per share (with an upside potential of 1.01%) on revenues  of $6.8 billion. In the year-ago quarter, Halliburton recorded a gain of  68 cents per share, while sales came in at $5.2 billion.Third Quarter RecapHalliburton’s third-quarter 2011 results came in better than expected,  helped by the strength and sustainability of the all-important North  American onshore activity levels (to which the company is heavily  leveraged through its market-share-leading pressure-pumping business).Earnings per share, excluding special items, came in at 94 cents,  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 92 cents and comfortably ahead  of the year-ago adjusted profit of 58 cents.Revenues of $6.5 billion were 40.4% greater than that achieved during  the third quarter of 2010 and also surpassed the Zacks Consensus  Estimate of $6.4 billion, as sales increased across the company’s  business units.Halliburton enjoys a strong competitive position within the global  oilfield services markets. We like the company’s broad and  technologically-complex product and service offerings, along with its  robust financial profile.It remains the best-positioned company in the U.S. pressure pumping  market, with significant acreage positions in the highest profile plays,  such as the Haynesville, Eagle Ford shale and Bakken. In the  to-be-reported quarter, Halliburton is likely to benefit from bullish  U.S. land drilling trends, where activity is trending above  expectations.This is likely to be somewhat offset by pricing competition in  international markets that may put pressure on the company’s margins.  However, we believe the market has already priced this into the stock’s  valuation.Agreement of AnalystsAs a result of the above-mentioned factors, there has been an upward  bias among the analysts regarding Halliburton’s outlook. In particular,  we see a notable number of estimate revisions over the past 30 days.Out of the 26 analysts covering the stock, 5 have revised their  estimates upward for the fourth quarter of 2011, while 2 have gone in  the opposite direction.Magnitude of Estimate RevisionsDespite the analysts revising estimates northward over the past 30  days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter has remained static  at 99 cents.Surprise HistoryThe company has a history of positive earnings surprises, surpassing  the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last 4 quarters. Halliburton  has performed consistently during this period with its average earnings  surprise being 6.95%. This implies that the company has beaten the  Zacks Consensus Estimate by 6.95% over the last four quarters.As such, we will not be surprised if Halliburton reports better-than-expected results yet again, particularly after Schlumberger Limited (NYSE:SLB)  – the largest member of the oilfield services contingent – led off  reporting for the group by coming out with robust numbers, as the growth  in global energy demand and the recent strength in oil prices have  helped producers to boost exploration and production spending around the  world.Our RecommendationHalliburton shares currently retain a Zacks #3 Rank, which translates  into a short-term 'Hold' rating. We are also maintaining our long-term  Neutral recommendation on the stock.We like Halliburton’s leading position in the global oilfield services  market, its broad and technologically-complex product/service offerings,  and its robust financial profile. The company has been benefiting from  increased activity in the unconventional shale plays in North America,  which has more than made up for the drop in deepwater Gulf of Mexico  activity and disruptions in North Africa.However, recent disclosures in the Deepwater Horizon incident has  created some overhang on the stock because of Halliburton’s alleged  direct involvement and the ensuing uncertainty regarding its potential  liability exposure. We are also concerned by the slow and geographically  uneven recovery in Halliburton’s international markets.As such, we see the stock performing in line with the broader market and prefer to remain on the sidelines.

377351,21305,2012-02-19T10:03:48-05:00,,"Many are concerned that environmentalists may soon begin to seriously impact the growth story in the oil well services sector. Environmentalists are concerned with the possibility that fracking fluids may pollute the ground water in areas of high drilling. They are also concerned that fracking uses too much water in areas short of water. Further some fracking operations may lead to earthquakes. The services companies that can allay fears in these areas will likely navigate this potential minefield with the least damage. Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) is a leader in this area.Halliburton is a global company, but nearly half of its revenue is derived from US operations (46%). Most of this US business is in unconventional oil well services such as horizontal drilling and fracking. HAL has been the leader in ""clean fracking"" for years. A recent innovation is HAL's ""Clean Suite"" technologies. Among the products in this suite is the CleanStim Formulation -- an ""environmentally friendly"" fracking fluid. CleanStim uses acids and enzymes naturally present in fruits and vegetables. HAL publishes a generalized statement of what is present in this mixture on its web site.Another way of cutting down on the possible environmental pollution is to recycle the fracking fluids. HAL is now providing water conservation capabilities in key shale areas. These areas include the Permian Basin, the Niobrara Shale, and the Eagle Ford Shale. In these areas the water resources are more scarce, and the environmental concerns are also high with many shallower well depths. Essentially the plan is to recycle the fracking fluids (a high proportion of which are water) and to reuse flowback and produced water. This will reduce the amount of fresh water used for fracking. Simultaneously it will reduce the amount of possible pollution, and it will reduce the overall cost for water related services. HAL will also be able to supply the volume of fresh water needed to supplement available recycled water. It can manage the transport, storage, and disposal of the required water volume. HAL's CleanWave technology uses electro coagulation to remove suspended solids from water. This makes it into a clear brine that can then be used for fracking (or other applications).I have heard of no solution(s) to the earthquake problem. Many, usually expensive, solutions have been proposed. However, the only reasonable suggestion so far is to monitor the seismic activity during the fracking fluid disposal process (pumping waste fracking fluids into an empty well). Of course, the above mentioned water conservation/recycling process will automatically cut down on the amount of disposal that needs to be done. This by itself should decrease the earthquake risk.Aside from the above issues, HAL is a leading oil well services firm. It trades at a PE of 11.78 and an FPE of 7.98. Its historical PE range including the recession low is 5 to 27 (last 5 years), so it is currently close to its non-recession low. HAL's average analysts' five year EPS growth estimate per annum is a robust 26.54%. HAL pays a 1% dividend. Plus the analysts' average one year target price of $50.90 gives HAL an approximate 44% upside near term. Longer term the US is in a long term secular bull market for oil well services due to the large and growing number of new unconventional oil and gas fields. These are much more prevalent in the US currently, but they will soon spread to Argentina, China, etc. The US natural gas drilling may be temporarily abating due to low natural gas prices, but it too will pick up long term. The US energy policy has changed recently to include natural gas for trucking. Also the energy business is building LNG liquefaction terminals to allow export of natural gas from the US.I wrote an article last month describing the recent down trend in the number of natural gas rigs, ""Slowing Rig Count May Presage Slower Services Growth For 2012"". It is still a good reference. The latest US rig count (February 17, 2012) is 1994 -- 1272 oil rigs and 716 natural gas rigs and 6 miscellaneous rigs. This shows the down trend is still in place. The total rig count is roughly flat for the last week as the number of oil rigs is still growing, while the number of natural gas rigs is decreasing. This is having an impact on HAL's revenues and earnings. However, HAL is a leader. It can pick up some extra oil business to replace the natural gas business it is losing. This is especially true over the longer term. Plus I forecast in my article that the North American natural gas rig count down trend should level out by this spring sometime. They do still have to drill in many areas just to be able to lock up their leased acreage via HBP. The natural gas drilling will not go to zero (or near it).There has also been a grave concern that Halliburton would be found liable in a huge monetary way for the Macondo well oil spill. BP had sued HAL in order to get it to pay approximately $15B+ in costs for the spill. However, HAL argued that it had a valid indemnification agreement with BP. In January 2012 US District Court Judge Carl Barbier in New Orleans found that the indemnification agreement was valid even if HAL was grossly negligent. The skies are not completely clear. They seldom are in civil law. However, investors have to be very much relieved by this ruling, and it should give them the confidence to again invest in HAL with a deserved fervor.The two year chart of HAL gives some technical information for this trade (click to enlarge image):The slow stochastic sub chart shows that HAL is near over sold levels. The main chart shows that HAL may be slowly rising from a near term bottom. Its low of Oct. 2011 was followed by a higher low in Dec. 2011. If its recent low near $35 is the next low in this sequence of rising lows, HAL's uptrend will soon be firmly in place. The price has moved up past its 50-day SMA. It seems to be channeling upward toward its 200-day SMA. The positive fundamental news of the lawsuit win should help. Seeing the light at the end of the tunnel in the natural gas drilling down trend should help. If the overall market does not undergo a significant retracement in the near term, HAL seems to be set to move up significantly.A quick look at the charts of Baker Hughes (BHI), Patterson-UTI Energy (NASDAQ:PTEN), and Helmerich & Payne (NYSE:HP) show that these stocks are near over sold levels too. It is possible that a general sector up move could occur soon. Even if the market undergoes a retracement, HAL should still move up. It just may have a small blip downward thrown into the mix. The secular growth story for US unconventional oil and gas drilling is still in place. Plus Argentina is beginning to look like it may soon get on the band wagon. The Argentine President is already screaming at oil companies operating in Argentina to step up unconventional oil and gas drilling there. In fact YPF Sociedad Anonima (NYSE:YPF) recently discovered an approximately 1B BOE new unconventional field in Argentina. In early Feb. 2012, YPF upped the estimate for this field's (Vaca Muerta) reserves to 22.8B BOE. Further Vaca Muerta may just be the tip of the iceberg in Argentine oil and gas shale.Averaging in can be a good strategy.Good luck trading.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in HAL, BHI, PTEN, HP over the next 72 hours."
321057,20725,2012-01-21T18:52:09-05:00,,"With Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) not joining the broader market rally recently, I decided to take a closer at the company to see if it is an attractive opportunity. Here are six points I looked at while researching Halliburton:Valuation: Halliburton’s trailing 5 year valuation metrics suggest that the stock is undervalued as the metrics are all below their respective 5 year averages. Halliburton’s current P/B ratio is 2.7 and it has averaged 3.6 over the past 5 years with a high of 6.1 and low of 1.7. Halliburton’s current P/S ratio is 1.5 and it has averaged 1.8 over the past 5 years with a high of 2.8 and low of 0.8. Halliburton’s current P/E ratio is 13.2 and it has averaged 15.3 over the past 5 years with a high of 27.9 and low of 6.9.Price Target: The consensus price target for the analysts who follow Halliburton is $52.50. That is upside of 45% and suggests that the stock is significantly undervalued and has room to run from these levels.Forward Valuation: Halliburton is currently trading at $36 a share and analysts expect the company to report earnings of $4.13 per share next year for a forward P/E of 9. Revenues are projected to grow 16%. Taking a look at what competitors trade at will provide a better idea of Halliburton’s relative value. Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) is trading for a forward P/E of 14, with analysts projecting revenue growth of 16% next year. National Oilwell Varco (NYSE:NOV) is trading at $73 a share and has a forward P/E of 12, with revenues projected to grow 21%. Baker Hughes (BHI) is currently trading at $48 a share and has a forward P/E of 9 with revenues projected to grow 15%. The mean of the three oil stocks is a P/E of about 12, which suggests that Halliburton is undervalued relative to other publicly-traded comps.Earnings Estimates: Halliburton has met earnings estimates the past four quarters, with margins ranging from 2-7 cents or 2-10% from analyst estimates. If the company is able to report earnings 10% higher than analysts’ estimates, that may serve as a catalyst for the stock.Dividend: Halliburton pays a quarterly dividend and has paid one since 1982. It currently pays 9 cents a quarter for an annual dividend of 36 cents or about 1%. The dividend last rose in 2007 when the company boosted its quarterly dividend from 7.5 cents a share to 9 cents a share.Price Action: The stock has been in a funk for the past few months. After rallying nearly 50% from $38 in January to over $56 a share in July, the stock fell apart, falling 50% to below $28 a share in October. Since then, the stock has traded in the $30-40 range. Halliburton is above its 50 day moving average, which sits just below $35, and below its 200 day moving average, which is just below $42. Resistance on the upside includes $38 followed by $40. On the downside, the $34 and the $32 level should provide solid support.Click to enlarge:Conclusion: All of the stars align for Halliburton as analysts, the trailing valuations metrics, and the forward valuation metrics suggest that the stock is undervalued. With it being correlated with the economy because of the higher demand for oil in an economic expansionary period, Halliburton at these prices is a good bet to move higher.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

It will be interesting to see if pricing is currently at a discount, or if the market has been correct to price in lower growth expectations. While the PE looks like a value buy and attractive, the chart sure doesn't. Technically the chart looks weak with the major moving averages including the all important 200 day moving average pointing lower. With the gulf oil spill still hanging over their heads and billions of dollars on the line, I would expect a lot of hesitation for the time being. Even so, I would look for breaks below $30 as a buying opportunity.For the same fiscal period year-over-year, revenue has improved to $17.97 billion for 2010 vs. $14.68 billion for 2009.

Top line growth estimate is 45%, and the bottom line growth estimate is 2% for the next year. Average five-year annualized growth forecast estimate is 18%.What is the fair value of Halliburton given the forecast estimates? We can estimate Halliburton's fair value using discounted earnings plus equity model as follows.Discounted Earnings Plus Equity ModelThis model is primarily used for estimating the returns from long-term projects. It is also frequently used to price fair-valued IPOs. The methodology is based on discounting the present value of the future earnings to the current period:V = E0 + E1 /(1+r) + E2 /(1+r)2 + E3/(1+r)3 + E4/(1+r)4 + E5/(1+r)5 + Disposal ValueV = E0 + E0 (1+g)/(1+r) + E0(1+g)2/(1+r)2 + … + E0(1+g)5/(1+r)5 + E0(1+g)5/[r(1+r)5]The earnings after the last period act as a perpetuity that creates regular earnings:Disposal Value = D = E0(1+g)5/[r(1+r)5] = E5 / rWhile this formula might look scary for many of us, it easily calculates the fair value of a stock. All we need is the current-period earnings, earnings growth estimate, and the discount rate. To be as objective as possible, I use Morningstar data for my growth estimates. You can set these parameters as you wish, according to your own diligence.ValuationHistorically, the average return of the DJI has been around 11% (including dividends). Therefore, I will use 11% as my discount rate. In order to smooth the results, I will also take the average of ttm EPS along with the mean EPS estimate for the next year.E0 = EPS = ($2.96 + $4.15) / 2 = $3.56Wall Street holds diversified opinions on the company's future. While analysts tend to impose subjective opinions on their estimates, the average analyst estimate is a good starting point. Average five-year growth forecast is 18%. Book value per share is $13.43.The rest is as follows:You can download FED+ Fair Value Estimator here.I decided to add the book value per share so that we can distinguish between a low-debt and debt-loaded company. The lower boundary does not include the book value. According to my 5-year discounted-earnings-plus-book-value model, the fair-value range for Halliburton is between $69 and $82 per share. At a price of $33.5, Halliburton is at least 100% undervalued.SummaryHalliburton did not perform well this year, and the stock is trading at more than 40% below its 52-week high. Analysts are pretty bullish on the company, dominantly suggesting 'buy' ratings.Compared to its industry peers, Halliburton is significantly undervalued. The industry leader, Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB), is trading at P/S ratio of 2.4 and P/E ratio of 20.8. This is a huge premium compared to Halliburton's valuation. If Halliburton was valued at this P/E ratio, the stock could be trading around $64.Analysts also agree with me. While not bullish as my model suggests, their mean target price of $53 imply significant upside potential for the company. Barclays has an overweight rating with a target price of $67, which is near the lower end of my fair value range estimate. The stock was subject to massive sale between August and October, loosing near 50% of its market cap. Sell-off seems to be over, and the shares are stabilized above $30. Therefore, I think it can be a good contrarian pick for 2012.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
320357,25159,2012-01-18T14:32:18-05:00,,"With Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) trading at the bottom of its 52-week range, I decided to take a closer look into the company to see if it is an attractive opportunity. Here are six points I looked at while researching HAL:Valuation: HAL's trailing 5-year valuation metrics suggest that the stock is undervalued, as all of the metrics are below their 5 year averages. HAL's current P/B ratio is 2.5, and it has averaged 3.6 over the past 5 years with a high of 1.7 and low of 6.1. HAL's current P/S ratio is 1.4, and it has averaged 1.8 over the past 5 years with a high of 2.8 and low of 0.8. HAL's P/E ratio is 12.3, and it has averaged 15.3 over the past 5 years with a high of 27.9 and low of 6.9. On a discounted cash flow basis using a 10% cost of equity, I value shares at approximately $45 apiece. This means substantial upside could be in store.Price Target: The consensus price target for the analysts who follow HAL is $52.50. That is upside of 54%, and suggests that the stock is significantly undervalued and has a lot of room to run from these levels.Forward Valuation: Halliburton is trading at $34 a share, and analysts expect the company to report earnings of $4.13 next year for a forward P/E of 8. HAL's revenues are projected to grow 16%. Taking a look at what competitors trade at will provide a better idea of HAL's relative value. Baker Hughes (BHI) is currently trading at $48 a share for a forward P/E of 9, with revenues projected to grow 15%. National Oilwell Varco (NYSE:NOV) is trading at $73 a share and has a forward P/E of 12, with revenues projected to grow 21%. Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) is trading at $68 a share and has a forward P/E of 14, with revenues projected to grow 16%. The mean of the 3 stocks is a P/E of about 12, so HAL is undervalued about 50% relative to other publicly traded comps.Earnings Estimates: HAL has beat EPS estimates its last 4 quarters by margins ranging from 2 to 7 cents. It seems like analysts have a pretty good idea of where HAL's earnings will be, so upside from earnings beats will be limited.Dividend: HAL pays a dividend, and has paid one since 1982. It currently pays 9 cents a quarter for an annual yield of 1.1%. The quarterly dividend last increased in 2007 from 7.5 cents to 9 cents a share.Price Action: HAL was strong for the first 6 months of last year, rising nearly 50% to over $56 a share. The stock ran into some trouble over the summer, and the stock fell all the way to below $28 a share in October. Since then, the stock staged a rally to $40 a share before pulling back to its current price level of $34 a share. The stock is way below its 200 day moving average of $42 and just below its 50 day moving average of $35. On the upside, the $38 level should serve as a key resistance level, followed by $40. On the downside, $32 and $30 should serve as support.Conclusion: HAL is undervalued here on all three valuation metrics, and looks like it deserves a spot in a portfolio. The stock should be able to recover to the levels that it traded at in the first half of last year. You will also receive a dividend while you sit and wait for the stock to recover. The industry should start to recover as the economy continues on the right path and demand for oil and oil equipment starts to increase.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
315030,21305,2011-12-20T11:04:30-05:00,,"Oil services companies’ stocks have been beaten down recently. Partly this has been due to overall negative market action. Partly it has to do with fracking (now used in 90% of the oil and gas wells in the US) being called unsafe by many, especially by large groups in New York and Pennsylvania. The biggest criticism of fracking is that it may pollute the groundwater. In the past, chemicals commonly used for antifreeze have been used for fracking. Who wants antifreeze in their drinking water?The industry is changing fracking fluid content in response. Halliburton has a new fracking formulation called CleanStim whose materials are sourced from the food industry. Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) lists the contents of CleanStim as: enzyme, exthoxylated sugar-based fatty acid ester, inorganic and organic acids, inorganic salt, malt dextrin, organic ester, partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, polysaccharide polymer, and sulfonated alcohol. This still sounds a bit non-specific to me. However, Halliburton did have one of their executives drink pure CleanStim at a conference presentation. That does tend to reassure people, especially since they would likely not be drinking pure CleanStim (or even CleanStim diluted 1000 fold). This is probably not perfection, but it should give HAL an edge in well approvals going forward. It may even increase customer demand for its service. Many will not want to deal with possible environmental pollution lawsuits in the near future for use of other than “green” fracking technology.Baker Hughes (BHI) is said to be working on its own “green fracking” formulation. I am sure many others are following. Yet this still hasn’t satisfied some states' environmental organizations. They insist that all fracking water be cleaned after use. It is currently being injected down old empty wells. Cleaning it would be very expensive on a per well basis. Companies such as Baker Hughes and Halliburton are, in many cases, solving this problem by storing it for re-use on other new wells. Perhaps then they will eventually clean it. The re-use strategy also helps to address the complaint that fracking uses too much water in arid areas of the US such as south Texas. This still hasn’t addressed the problem that some fracking activities, especially disposal of the fluid down empty wells, are causing increased seismic activity (mini-earthquakes) in many areas such as Ohio. Still this activity hasn’t yet escalated to public terror the way fracking fluids have in some areas.In sum it looks like fracking should be able to continue without too many regulatory problems, as long as it is “cleaned up”. This should be only a minor expense. Plus the fracking fluid re-use strategy might actually be cheaper longer term. This means that current investor fears of a fracking regulatory debacle are likely overblown.Halliburton is probably furthest along in resolving the environmental concerns with Baker Hughes a close second (among major oil services companies). This means that both of these companies should do well in the secular bull market for high technology oil drilling and completion. I am sure many others will too. The Spears Drilling and Production Outlook (Sept. 2011) calls for Global Drilling and Completion Spending to rise from approximately $265B in 2011 to approximately $440B in 2017. Halliburton, Baker Hughes, Schlumberger Ltd. (NYSE:SLB), Nabors Industries Ltd. (NYSE:NBR), National Oilwell Varco (NYSE:NOV), etc. will grab large parts of this.The IEA world oil supply and demand outlook chart and the OPEC Effective Spare Capacity outlook chart, which shows a decreasing OPEC oil Spare Capacity going forward (see below), show there will be strong overall demand (secular growth) for the foreseeable future as emerging markets’ demand increases.However, it isn’t just the oil demand that will keep this secular trend going for many years. The world demand growth for natural gas is forecast to outstrip the world oil demand growth by threefold for the next 20 years (BP Energy Outlook). This means that drilling for natural gas will soon become far more prevalent than it is currently, especially in Asia and North America. China is supposed to contain the largest amount of recoverable shale gas reserves in the world (see the EIA chart below). The US is not far behind.Halliburton has shown in the recent past that it is adept at picking up a large share of this business. With this secular growth expected, Halliburton should be able to continue its great revenue and income growth of recent years (see the chart below). Notably it increased its US horizontal rigs 116% from Q4 2009 through Q3 2011. It has been hiring and training people as fast as it can. Currently oil and liquids represent 69% of the total US market, but as I have pointed out above, the forecast is for shale gas drilling to soon exceed oil drilling. Many of the other large land oil services companies should be able to grow in a like manner. They have in the past.Halliburton also does offshore drilling and offshore construction. There will not be as many wells drilled in the oceans and seas. However, the oil well services for such things as offshore drilling and construction are considerably more expensive. Halliburton is one of the leaders in these industries, and it intends to maintain a good market position. The chart below shows Halliburton’s approximate business distribution. Fracking has been a good growth engine. With Halliburton’s CleanStim technology, this growth is likely to continue, especially with the ever greater environmentalists’ concerns about fracking.The table below contains some of the fundamental financial data from Halliburton, Baker Hughes, Schlumberger, Nabors, and National Oilwell. It shows how good the growth prospects really are in this secular growth industry. The data are from TD Ameritrade and Yahoo Finance.The data show that Halliburton is a strong stock. According to the forecasts, the biggest potential profits are in HAL, Baker Hughes, and NBR. Halliburton and Baker Hughes may have the highest exposure to environmental fracking concerns, but they also are the farthest ahead in addressing them. NOV has had the strongest performance of late. SLB is perhaps the weakest, but it also has a long term record of stock out performance and overall leadership in the industry. In sum they are all good buys.Commodities are likely to fall further over time as the EU goes into recession. The commodities’ bottom is probably at least 6 months away. Such a fall may hurt the stock prices of these stocks, but many of them have already been beaten down. This makes them good buys for a possible Christmas rally. Money Managers may engineer this in a desire to improve their results for the year.If you consider the long term bullish secular fundamentals in both the oil and the gas well services markets, these stocks are good long term buys. Plus four of them do pay an approximate 1% dividend. You should not buy them for the long term going into an EU recession unless you will be willing to hold them for at least a 1-2 year period. Many do not think that oil will fall as far in this recession. Futures rules have been tightened to prevent hoarding conditions from existing. There will be less panic selling. Plus the demand view of emerging market growth has become more clear. The Asian demand is far higher now than it was just a few years ago. The demand fundamentals will prevent a large or prolonged downturn in the price of oil. Some feel that oil prices will not fall much below $85/barrel. It seems almost certain that oil prices will be in the $100+/barrel range or higher a year and a half from now. We could even be facing $150/barrel oil by then. The above companies are going to benefit from that demand long term. They are going to benefit from the natural gas drilling demand, which is supposed to grow at three times the rate of oil drilling demand over the next 20 years. Any economic slowdown/recession will also serve to prevent further competition from starting up. The above stocks are going to grow. They may be one of the safer areas to put your money if you are a long term investor. The ride will be a wild one, but it is likely to eventually be a lucrative one. It merely depends on which type of investor you like to be. It also is important to realize you will have to have a strong stomach to be such a long term investor. Shorter term, the above stocks are over sold. They are due for a bounce up if the market bounces. The two year chart of HAL below shows the over sold state. It shows the huge potential upside. A $10 (approximately 30%) move in HAL is easily possible within the next month. The risk of taking this chance is low, if you are willing to keep the stock for the longer term.Good Luck Trading.Disclosure: I am long HAL."
312815,23762,2011-12-09T02:24:42-05:00,,"Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) took a significant hit this week on worries it may have more responsibility for the BP (NYSE:BP) gulf oil spill than previously believed. I think this will be a temporary headwind to the stock and be resolved by Halliburton making some sort of settlement with BP as some other firms have done. I also think it is a great opportunity to pick up Halliburton on the cheap. However, given the unknowns provided by this litigation, I believe the best way to play Halliburton is with an option strategy should I be wrong on the impact of this action.-Business description from Yahoo Finance.Option Strategy: Sell the July 12 30 puts and buy the July 12 27 puts via a bull market put spread for a net credit of $1.05.Scenario 1: Halliburton holds at least the $30 level when the option spread expires in July. In this likely scenario, I make my $1.05 a share spread while only tying up $1.95 of collateral in my brokerage accountScenario 2: Halliburton is more impacted by the litigation than I suspect and it continues to decline. In this situation, I get Halliburton for a price-adjusted $28.95 a share while limiting my maximum loss during the time of the option spread to $1.95 a share. I can then reassess the value of Halliburton when the stock is “put” to me.Four reasons why Halliburton is a great long term value at $33 a share:Disclosure: I am long HAL."
306866,24480,2011-11-10T03:59:24-05:00,,"Halliburton (NYSE: HAL) is an oilfield-services company that specializes in completion and production along with drilling and evaluation segments. With a market cap of $38 billion, Halliburton is the second largest oilfield-services company in the world and a dominant player within North America.The stock has fallen dramatically as of late taking a hammering because of the falling prices of crude oil. This was a giant mistake. Halliburton has little to do with the price of oil and does not benefit from giant increases or decreases. Drillers don’t stop drilling just because the price of oil drops from very expensive to just expensive. The production and drilling of oil continues and that’s where Halliburton is there to help.Halliburton is more of a technology play than a play on oil. The stock isn’t subject to the price of oil, or at least it shouldn’t be. Simply, they are there to help the oil companies drill and improve efficiency. Halliburton is very good at what they do, in recent years their engineering capabilities, innovations and advancement have increased total production 75% and led to a 50% reduction in pumping times. One of their biggest technological advancements, Horizontal Drilling, is now being implemented by companies all over the world.In addition to this, recent booms in domestic drilling in North America have led to a surge of new orders and new business generating billions in revenue. Halliburton continues to be on the rise and is growing vastly. This year alone they’re on pace to hire 11,000 new employees in America alone. All around business is booming and we believe the stock is cheap and great value. Below are 10 reasons Halliburton is bullish and 10 reasons why you should invest:10 Reasons Halliburton is Bullish        1. PEG = 0.59 | Halliburton holds a PEG Ratio of 0.59 making it a bullish indicator as the lower the company's PEG Ratio, the more cheaply val ued it is. Companies with PEG Ratios under 1 are undervalued, another reason we believe Halliburton is a strong investment.2. P/S = 1.83 | Halliburton holds a P/S Ratio of 1.83, a good valuation and strong indicator. Value investors look for P/S Ratios under 2 as they show great opportunity. Another thing to consider is the fact that low P/S Ratios and rising stock prices tend to be a good basis to invest in growth stocks that have suffered a setback. This is something that definitely suits Halliburton as they have been unfairly hit hard with share prices falling as much as 30% over the past few months as many investors are correlating the fall in the price of crude oil and Halliburton’s share price too much. Over the course of the past decade, Halliburton’s P/S Ratio has been below average making it a good indicator of value.3. ROE = 20.7% | Halliburton’s Return on Equity averaged out over the past three years is 20.7% (22.49% in 2011) a strong indicator going forward, especially considering the fact that Halliburton plans to grow and further reinvest money within.4. ROA = 12.55% | Equally impressive, Halliburton continues to show effective upper-level management with strong Return on both Assets and Equity.5. Forward P/E = 9.5 | Halliburton sports a cheapish forward P/E of 9.5. That represents a discount to rivals like Baker Hughes (NYSE: BHI) (10.1), National Oilwell (NYSE: NOV) (11.5), and Schlumberger (NYSE: SLB) (14.0).6. 92% Analysts Buy Rating | Halliburton is highly regarded among Wall Street Analysts with 95% projecting the stock to outperform the S&P 500 going forward.7. 82.50% Held by Institutions | Halliburton is held by forty-two hedge funds. HAL represents 4% of T. Boone Pickens BP Capital’s portfolio, Ken Griffin’s Citadel holds more than 2 million shares, Ken Heebner holds a $170 million position, and Jim Cramer holds it in his charitable trust.8. $5.9 Billion Total Revenue | Net income for the 2nd quarter of 2011 was reported at $747 million, vs. $483 million in the 1st quarter prior year. Total revenues improved to $5.9 billion from $4.4 billion in the same quarter last year. Operating income increased to $1.2 billion from $762 million in the June quarter of 2010 on the improving pricing environment and higher equipment utilization.9. $1.4 Billion Cash Balance | Halliburton currently is cash flow positive with a cash balance of $1.4 billion. Like we always say “Cash is King!”10. Dividend Yield = 0.9% | It’s not much but something is better than nothing and a near 1% dividend yield is not bad, especially considering the fact that Halliburton is such a high growth speculative stock to begin with.Halliburton’s specialized services will continue to grow in the booming Oil and Gas industry. As the economy improves, so will Halliburton's prospects and expect revenue streams to increase too. With strong analyst coverage, upbeat projections, and the fact HAL’s trading at 12.8 times 2011 earnings, we project Halliburton’s shares to rise to $75 per share, a total yield of 81%.

303499,24866,2011-10-30T07:54:39-04:00,,"The oilfield services company Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) has received quite a bit of investor attention recently given its supposed macro risk. I find that Halliburton, despite its beta of 1.56, is far less risky than what the market views. This means high-risk adjusted returns for shareholders if a double dip does not occur and my perspective proves true. The stock is already up by more than 21% and I expect it to continue to be one of the best investments for a buy-and-hold strategy. Here is why:While it is true that NAM is experiencing margin compression, this issue has been much too exaggerated, as its effect on market share is not as deleterious as some have made out. Management has put out a conservative outlook, setting the bar low with high single-digit growth in material costs. And yet the firm has the largest margins in its industry at 33.4%. Comparable numbers for competitors: Weatherford (WFT), 25.9%; Baker Hughes (BHI), 22.2%; Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB), 20.3%. The company is also doing well in keeping SG&A lean, for example, by reducing average crew size by 10% recently.Thus, the company's true catalyst is in growing scale (not containing costs) as a means to take away market share from competitors. And, in my view, the company is the best positioned to gain internationally. In the emerging regions of Middle East and Asia, Halliburton has seen 4.9% 3Q11 sequential growth and 13.8% y-o-y growth. Respective figures for competitors are 2% and 18% for Baker Hughes, 3% and 5.4% for Weatherford, and -5% and 8.3% for Schlumberger. This increasing relative exposure to emerging markets will help hedge against Halliburton's domestic risk while presenting a long-term value driver for the oil and gas services company.At the third quarter earnings call, CEO David Lesar noted:My hope is that, as the company expands, its moves more away from Europe, which offers the lowest margins of any geographical region at 9.5%. At the same time, issues in conflict regions are improving, particularly in the North Sea, Algeria, and Africa.The fundamentals of Halliburton are also strong and capable of weathering the storm better than some competitors. Strong activity at Eagle Ford, Permian Basin, and Bakken, in particular, will drive free cash flow for expansion elsewhere. And while recent volatility in the commodity markets is rightfully unsettling for investors, this should not be overblown. The customers that Halliburton works with are large and are diversified across commodities. As a result, they are capable of shifting activity in response to relative prices - de-risking Halliburton in the process. Halliburton has done well adapting to challenges, for example, by moving rigs in Haynesville to more profitable ventures. Furthermore, the fact that coal is also being substituted out for natural gas is not something to be feared, but rather, as I argued earlier, to be excited about. Coal will not be so much replaced, in my view, as it will be overtaken by natural gas as the leading energy source within a decade. At the same time, international unconventional resources could need more equipment to improve profitability, thus increasing Halliburton's clients.And on a comparable basis, Halliburton is far undervalued. It trades at 13.2x and 9.5x past and forward earnings, respectively, while offering a modest dividend yield of 1%. Schlumberger, Baker Hughes, and Weatherford trade at 14.4x, 10.6x, and 10.4x forward earnings, respectively, while offering dividend yields roughly in line with Halliburton. Expectations for Halliburton are bullish with analysts giving the stock a ""strong buy"" - although EPS estimates are down versus up 17 to 13. Consensus estimates for EPS are that it will grow by 62.6% to $3.35 in 2011 and then by 21.8% and 17.4% in the next two years. I anticipate revenue growing by 38% to $24.8B in 2011 and then by 7.1% and 12.1% in the following years.Given that management is clearing up net debt while expanding scale, I find that the fears over margins are exaggerated. They can, and should, take a hit if it means eliminating competition. Accordingly, I recommend the stock as an attractive buy-and-hold.To read my bullish analysis on the natural gas and oil industry, click here for one on ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) and here for one on El Paso (EP).Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
320542,24866,2012-01-19T08:01:04-05:00,,"In an earlier article here, I argued that Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) was meaningfully more undervalued than its competitor, Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB). Since the piece was published, the market partially corrected the value gap as Halliburton appreciated by 7.5%, while Schlumberger depreciated by 1.8%. However, I continue to find that Schlumberger is not the value play that sell-side analysts make it out to be.From a multiples perspective, Halliburton is the cheapest of its most competitive peers. It trades at a respective 11.4x and 8.2x past and forward earnings. Baker Hughes trades at a respective 12.1x and 8.8x past and forward earnings while Schlumberger trades at a respective 21x and 13.8x past and forward earnings. I believe that much of the reason for Halliburton's discount stems from the Macondo debacle with BP p.l.c (NYSE:BP), which, in my view, has been overblown by investors - we will get to this in a second.A review of Halliburton's top-class services is in order. At the the third quarter earnings call, Halliburton's CEO, Dave Lenar, noted how otherwise solid performance in North America was challenged by cost pressures:As Morningstar has rightfully noted, Halliburton offers industry-leading comprehensive solution that is of greater cost-effectiveness and quality to clients. Management has the deep industry knowledge that will be demanded as oil becomes more scarce. I foresee an oil grab over the next five years that will dramatically be driven by emerging market demand. Regulatory headwinds may help set back this event, but, in my view, it is inevitable. Operating margins are normalizing around 18% abroad, with greater competition and capital expenditures this number is trending towards $3.3B in 2012. Further complexity within the industry from environmental limitations will have the company set to grow at a CAGR of around 14%.In regards to the Maconodo spill, I see this providing a major opportunity for high risk/reward returns. There are two ways that Halliburton could proceed - both of which I find will be better than what the market irrationally anticipates. First, it could reach a settlement with BP, which is now suing for Halliburton to pay all of the $21B costs related to the spill ($40B is on the side). This is an egregious amount given that Cameron (NYSE:CAM) settled at $250M - 68% of which is expected to be covered by insurance. A second option is that Halliburton could move forward and hope that its contractual indemnification holds up in court. Whatever action Halliburton chooses to take, the end result will be greater certainty for the market and subsequent multiples expansion.Consensus estimates for Halliburton's EPS forecast are that it will grow by 62.1% to $3.34 in 2011 and then by 23.7% and 16.5% more in the following two years. Assuming a multiple of 13x and a conservative 2012 EPS of $4.02, the rough intrinsic value of the stock is $52.26, implying 52.3% upside. Even if the multiple were to plummet to 9x and 2012 EPS turns out to be 9.2% below consensus, the stock would barely fall. Accordingly, Halliburton merits its ""strong buy"" rating on the Street.Schlumberger, on the other hand, has struggled to perform. During the third quarter, the company had solid progress with growth in North America on land and offshore. Pricing trends and rig count sequentially improved, as deepwater and exploration activity faced better-than-expected underlying demand. With that said, earnings were still a miss and margins may be reaching a peak at this point. The outlook, particularly in Latin America and Asia, has grown markedly worse.Consensus estimates for Schlumberger's EPS forecast are that it will grow by 27.6% to $3.65 in 2011 and then by 33.7% and 23.4% more in the following two years. Assuming a multiple of 17.5x - a significant premium to Halliburton - and a conservative 2012 EPS of $4.76, the rough intrinsic value of the stock is $83.30, implying 21.8% upside.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in HAL over the next 72 hours."

In that article I discussed why selling calls makes sense for long-term investors and provide a detailed explanation of the strategy along with a basic tutorial on call options including term definitions.2) The second objective of each article is to provide a list of call option premiums of up to 20 widely held companies that present, in my opinion, a good opportunity to lock in a good return over the coming month(s).  Again, details can be found in the article link above.Today’s focus company is Halliburton (NYSE:HAL), one of the largest service providers to the energy industry.  The number of countries it operates in fluctuates, depending upon customer needs, yet it currently has operations in about 80 countries. The consensus 12-month target price for HAL is $54.61.  The range of forecasts is $42.00 to $75.00.  The current price (as of the close on Friday, November 25, 2011) is $31.80.  My 12-month target on HAL is $45.00.  That represents an increase from today’s closing price of approximately 41.5%.I don’t own stock in HAL, but if I did I would consider selling the January $36 strike call at a premium of $1.24.  That provides a return on the current share price of 3.6% and if called away at $36 the total received over the three months would be $37.24 for a gain from the current price of 17.1%.   The premium represents an annualized return 21.7% and the company currently pays a 1.1% dividend. The current price, along with the rest of the sector, is being depressed by a couple of factors.  The first, of course, is the overall downward trend of the general equities market.  The second is the assumption that oil demand will slacken as the global economy weakens resulting in less demand for energy services.  This is usually the case, but I think that this sector, and especially HAL, will eventually decouple from the rest of the market and move in the direction of its earnings, even before other sectors. My reasoning is this: HAL is heavily involved in the drilling boom going on in North America’s many shale formations and most of the leasing agreements were written as “use it or lose it.”  This means that the companies that leased the mineral rights must drill prior to a date certain or lose all rights to drill without entering into another agreement which may (and probably will) cost much more.Also, there appears to be hints of activity in the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico gaining some momentum again. Those two regions represent significant growth opportunities for HAL. Other international drilling activity is slowing, but I believe that the activity in the shale region will act to put a floor under HAL’s share earnings.  Once the street wakes up to this the shares will begin to reflect a premium valuation to the market.  At least, that is my opinion of how I expect things to shake out on this stock.And Now The Final Piece Of The ArticleBelow is a list of my favorite call premiums on widely held stocks on November 25, 2011. These are not pure recommendations. Rather this list is provided as a useful tool for those who sell calls to enhance their income from stocks that they own or plan to own in the near future. The list includes premiums that appear to present the best value of all widely held stocks for the day.I have also included calls that meet my criteria on stocks that I have written about in another series that was begun on September 21, 2011, with the inaugural article entitled “My Long-Term Investing for Income Strategy,"" click here to read the article.I hope readers will find this daily list useful as a starting place in finding calls to sell for added income.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
299747,20568,2011-10-15T14:43:04-04:00,,"Major oilfield services provider Halliburton Co. (HAL) is scheduled to report its third quarter 2011 results on October 17, 2011 before the start of trading.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter is a profit of 92 cents per share, on revenue of $6,352 million.Second Quarter RecapHalliburton’s second-quarter 2011 results came in better than expected, aided by the strength and sustainability of the all-important North American onshore activity levels (to which the company is heavily exposed through its market-share-leading pressure-pumping business).Earnings per share, excluding special items, came in at 81 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 72 cents and comfortably ahead of the year-ago profit of 52 cents.Revenues of $5.9 billion were 35.3% above second quarter 2010 and ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.6 billion, as sales increased across the company’s business units.Agreement of AnalystsThe analysts project an optimistic sentiment on Halliburton’s to-be-reported quarter despite the liabilities of the Deepwater Horizon incident that loom over the stock. Furthermore, disturbances in North Africa, the drop in deepwater Gulf activity and sluggish international pricing are expected to pull back the company’s performance.However, the analysts believe that Halliburton enjoys a strong competitive position within the global oilfield services markets based on its broad and technologically complex product and service offerings, along with its robust financial profile.Out of the 24 analysts covering the stock, 7 have revised their estimates upward for the third quarter of 2011, while one moved in the opposite direction. The last seven days saw a complete dearth of estimate revision. Magnitude of Estimate RevisionsWith effect from the earnings revisions by the analysts in the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter increased by a penny to 92 cents. For the past seven days, the estimate for the third quarter remained static.Surprise HistoryHalliburton exhibited a positive earnings surprise trend over the last four quarters. The company recorded a minimum surprise of 3.57% in third quarter 2010 while a maximum of 12.50% was in second quarter 2011. On average, the earnings surprise was 7.30%.Our RecommendationHouston, Texas-based Halliburton remains the best-positioned company in the U.S. pressure pumping market, with significant acreage positions in the highest profile plays, such as the Haynesville, Eagle Ford shale and Bakken. In the near term, Halliburton is likely to benefit from bullish U.S. land drilling trends with demand improvements in select North American basins.However, looking at the longer term, we have a Neutral recommendation on Halliburton taking into account the depressed natural gas prices, international operational risks and aftereffects of the Deepwater Horizon rig disaster. As such, we see the stock performing in line with its peers Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB) and Baker Hughes Incorporated (BHI).Halliburton currently retains a Zacks #3 Rank, which translates into a short-term Hold rating."
300090,24361,2011-10-17T15:14:44-04:00,,"Investors looking for an example of how short-term thinking dominates the equity markets these days do not have to go much past the energy sector. There are still plenty of arguments over what “Peak Oil” is supposed to mean, but hardly anybody thinks that long-term oil and natural gas prices are going to substantially lower than today. And yet, nervousness about the near-term economic outlook and short-term oil price declines as investors leery of even well-established service names like Halliburton (NYSE:HAL).Okay Results Fail To ImpressThis is a market that wants dramatic outperformance and strong upward revisions from management, and Halliburton didn't deliver. Consequently, the fact that revenue was up about 10% sequentially and still a bit stronger that the average analyst guess just isn't going to cut it – particularly when management talked about an increasingly competitive international pricing environment and delays in key growth markets like Iraq and Angola.That said, North American reported revenue climbed just under 13% and continues to drive the company. Even more impressive is that Halliburton's growth basically doubled the reported rig count growth for the same period. Still, international results continue to be a laggard, as revenue up was up 7% sequentially due to strength from Latin America.Margins look like another “what have you done for me lately” set-up. Operating income rose about 16% sequentially, and North American operating income was up about 14%. Still, while incremental margins were in the low 30's, some investors may look at the relatively modest quarter-on-quarter improvement in North American with disappointment.How Much Of A Threat Is Competition? Halliburton shares a privileged position with Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) and Baker Hughes (BHI) as the top dogs in energy services. With that size go certain advantages. Major E&P firms like Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX) want to deal with companies that can meet all of their needs and have the staying power to endure the cycles. Moreover, “packaged” service offerings are becoming increasingly important; service companies have to offer a full range of exploration, evaluation, completion, and production services to get the contracts.To that end, the recent announcement from Superior Energy Services (SPN) that it is acquiring Complete Production (NYSE:CPX) is a minor threat. The deal will certainly bulk up Superior's service capabilities and servicing rig count, and it should make Superior a more valid option in those competitive “soup to nuts” bids. Likewise, companies like Basic Energy Services (BAS) or Key Energy Services (NYSE:KEG) could help a rival like Weatherford (WFT) add some bulk and become more of a rival to Halliburton, though it is more probable that it will just further marginalize the smaller mom-and-pop service operators.Time To Pay BP To Go AwayHalliburton's results have also been overshadowed in part by the announcement on Monday that Anadarko (NYSE:APC) has elected to settle with BP (NYSE:BP) in the legal wrangling over who pays what in regards to the Deepwater Horizon/Macando cleanup. Following settlements with Mitsui and Weatheford, Anadarko is paying $4 billion to end the matter.Halliburton, like Transocean (NYSE:RIG), has been fairly adamant in that the accident was not its fault and its contracts indemnify the company from financial responsibility. All the same, sometimes companies have to swallow hard and pay what they don't believe they must pay in order to move on and avoid costly, prolonged, and distracting legal maneuvers. To that end, investors may well fear that Halliburton either succumbs to “peer pressure” and pays up or that these other settlements are indicative that Halliburton may be more at risk that it maintains.Waiting For The All ClearThere are plenty of appealing energy service stock valuations to pick from today. Cameron (NYSE:CAM), rarely ever cheap, actually looks undervalued, and the same is true of other names like Transocean, Superior, and Weatherford. But valuation is not the only factor that matters – much as it may irritate fundamental investors, sentiment matters in the short run and it looks like there still needs to be a wash-out with these energy service names. Consequently, it may make sense to wait a bit and look for estimates to go down a bit further before jumping in.Longer term, though, this is a stock worth owning. As Statoil's (STO) acquisition of Brigham Exploration (BEXP) highlights, large E&P companies are still on the prowl for reserves and are increasingly looking to maintain drilling activity throughout the full cycle. As one of the best-positioned players in high-value services, Halliburton should be poised to reap the benefit of that eventual upward move in energy prices and the ongoing intensity of drilling in North America.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
312350,24714,2011-12-07T09:32:40-05:00,,"On Tuesday, BP alleged that Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) destroyed evidence that would prove them responsible for the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill. During trading hours, Halliburton shares dropped 3.92 percent on an up day in the market. This means a $1.33 billion drop in the company's market cap. However, many of its competitors were also down on the day, so we can't assume the company's entire drop in share price came from these allegations. I have believed for some time now that Halliburton is an undervalued stock and I believe that after yesterday's drop, now is the time to buy Halliburton shares.From a strategy standpoint, America's commitment to end its dependence on foreign oil along with more deep sea drilling means that oil field service companies like Baker Hughes (BHI) and Halliburton will have a lot of growth and profitability for years to come. In addition, Baker Hughes and Halliburton will have 1 year forward P/E ratios of 9.5 and 8.7, respectively. For high growth companies, this is pretty cheap. Analysts are very bullish on both these stocks. Out of 31 analysts on Yahoo! Finance, 25 rate Baker Hughes as a ""Strong Buy"" or ""Buy"", while the rest put a ""Hold"" recommendation on the stock. For Halliburton, 31 out of 33 analysts rate the stock a ""Strong Buy"" or ""Buy"". Both companies also have high one year targets. Baker Hughes is expected to grow by 44.3 percent in the next year while Halliburton is expected to grow 52.8 percent over the next year. Stocks with bullish analysts and high targets are very rare in the market since high share growth expectations usually means high risk and a lot of downside potential.I also don't think much will come of BP's allegations. Alpha Natural Resources (ANR), the current owner of Massey Energy, paid $210 million in a settlement for the West Virginia Mine Disaster in 2010. If Halliburton were to pay a similar settlement, it would have only a small effect on the stock as the company has a $32.7 billion market cap. Halliburton will definitely lose business from BP and other oil companies for what happened in the Gulf last year, but I believe that most of these potential losses are well accounted for in the stock price and are already factored into analyst estimates.Both Halliburton and Baker Hughes are down over 25 percent in the last 6 months, while the S&P 500 has lost about 2 percent. I believe that both companies will have rebounds in their stock prices because they will both continue to grow as more and more drilling takes place. I believe Halliburton is currently the better buy mainly because the company's negative publicity has made the stock slightly cheaper. For those who think Halliburton will suffer as a result of these allegations, Baker Hughes is still a good buy right now.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

Halliburton’s shares have fallen from around $57 in July to current  levels of around $35. Other major oilfield services firms, like Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) and Baker Hughes (BHI) have also followed suit.Our own estimate  for the stock has remained stable at $59 in the period as rig counts in  most geographies have not shown any major declines in the period  indicating that exploration and production (E&P) activity has not  been hit by global economic worries. We will  analyze this quarter’s  earnings to evaluate if our forecasts have to be adjusted to reflect the  latest developments in the sector.Fracking market grows despite worriesHalliburton’s leading position in the unconventional sources sector  has given the company a huge boost because of the shale gas exploration  activity across the U.S. Despite growing opposition to the practice of  hydraulic fracturing from environmental agencies, interest in the sector  has only increased with leading players like Exxon Mobil and Chevron  increasing their exposure to shale exploration. The recent rush in the  Utica play and initial activity in Europe, where large players are  scouting for prospects in countries like Poland and Ukraine, is expected  to add to the market for unconventional exploration and expand it beyond  the North America region, which accounts for a majority of Halliburton’s  revenues.Within North America, the rig count has continued to increase over  the past few months, although oil and gas prices have remained weak. While  some analysts have questioned the sustainability of shale exploration  in the persistent low-price environment, recent increases in rig count  seem to indicate to the contrary. The Baker Hughes rig count for the first week of October rose by 22  rigs over the previous count. The revival of activity in the U.S. Gulf  of Mexico will also result in a further boost to the prospects of North  America division of the company.International outlook mixedRig counts in other markets have generally remained stable, but have  seen a decline in Asia, where the indicator has fallen by 10% over the  same period last year. Falling oil prices generally reduce the appetite of E&P of oil  firms resulting in lower spending. However, resumption of activity in  the Libyan market should provide a boost for Halliburton’s revenues in  the Europe, Africa and the CIS market which is another source of  significant value for the company.Disclosure: No positions."

The  second-largest member of the oilfield services contingent, behind Schlumberger Ltd. (NYSE:SLB),  has seen its share price fall approximately 35% since the beginning of  July, as oil prices declined to around $80 per barrel. However,  considering Halliburton’s attractive fundamentals and positive outlook,  we believe it is well positioned going forward.We like Halliburton’s leadership status in the global oilfield services  market. We also appreciate its broad and technologically complex  product and service offerings as well as its very strong relationships with  both publicly traded and national oil companies worldwide. The company  has been benefiting from increased activity in the unconventional oil  and gas shale plays in North America, which have more than made up for  the drop in deepwater Gulf of Mexico activity and disruptions in  North Africa.As reinforced by results in the last few quarters, the all-important  North American activity levels (to which Halliburton is heavily exposed  through its market-share-leading pressure-pumping business) are showing  signs of strength and sustainability. Margins in most basins now appear  to be rapidly gaining steam, as the industry looks to balance supply  growth with recovering hydrocarbon demand.Additionally, Halliburton remains in excellent financial health with  about $1.4 billion in cash and a debt-to-capitalization ratio of around  25%. This helps Halliburton to capitalize on investment opportunities  and offers options to make strategic acquisitions, thereby improving  growth visibility.The planned acquisition of San Angelo, Texas-based privately held  oilfield service company Multi-Chem Group LLC is expected to further  help Halliburton to expand the breadth of its services and augment its  average revenue per rig. At the same time, it will be able to serve and  fulfill the demands of a larger number of customers.As such, we believe the company is favorably positioned to continue  accelerating revenue and earnings growth over the next few quarters.  Halliburton currently retains a Zacks #2 Rank, which translates into a  short-term Buy rating.Houston, Texas-based Halliburton is one of the largest oilfield service  providers in the world, offering a variety of equipment, maintenance,  and engineering and construction services to the energy, industrial, and  government sectors.

With a market cap of $38 billion, Halliburton is the second-largest oilfield-services company in the world and a dominant player within North America.The stock has fallen dramatically as of late, taking a hammering because of the falling prices of crude oil. This was a giant mistake. Halliburton has little to do with the price of oil, and does not benefit from huge increases or decreases. Drillers don’t stop drilling just because the price of oil drops from exuberantly expensive to plain old expensive. The production and drilling of oil continues, and that’s where Halliburton operates.Halliburton is more of a technology play than a play on oil. The stock isn’t subject to the price of oil, or at least it shouldn’t be. Simply put, it is there to help the oil companies drill and improve efficiency. Halliburton is very good at what it does, in recent years its engineering capabilities, innovations and advancement have increased total production 75% and led to a 50% reduction in pumping times. One of its biggest technological advancements, horizontal drilling, is now being implemented by companies all over the world.In addition to this, recent booms in domestic drilling in North America have led to a surge of new orders and new business generating billions in revenue. Halliburton continues to be on the rise and growing vastly. This year it's on pace to hire 11,000 new employees in America alone! All-around business is booming, and we believe the stock is cheap and a great value.

We believe that the growth in the company’s North American revenue this quarter and the impact of the turmoil in Algeria and other places in Africa will be important in gauging its financial performance and will contribute significantly to the assessment of the upside and downside potential of our $57 price estimate of the stock. Our estimate is at a 10% premium over the current market price. Halliburton competes with other oilfield services firms such as Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB), Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI) and Weatherford International (NYSE:WFT).The North American Oilfield Services MarketHalliburton’s operations in North America contribute to about 64% of our price estimate for the stock. Exploration and production activity in the region is being driven by exploration of shale deposits and deepwater exploration in the Gulf of Mexico. Weakness in natural gas has forced drillers such as Chesapeake (CHK), Devon (NYSE:DVN) and Petrohawk (HK) to shift their attention to oil and liquid rich shale deposits. [1] The Baker Hughes Rig Count information also indicates that an increasing number of rigs are being used to drill for oil and other liquids. [2](Charts created using Trefis' app)The resumption of drilling activity in the Gulf of Mexico should also boost Halliburton’s revenues in U.S. Exploration and production of deepwater resources and will be a significant growth driver for oilfield services firms such as Halliburton. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates  that by 2030 almost 10% of the oil demand may be met by deepwater production. [3]Effects of disruptions in Libya and other factorsThe fallout of the political situation in Libya and other Arab states may lead to a fall in Halliburton’s business in Africa. Libya has the largest proven reserves of oil in Africa and local strife has brought oil production in the country to a halt. (Libya oil production grinding to a halt, CNN Money) However we expect Halliburton to improve its revenue per rig figure across geographies especially because of the expected demand for its products and services to reduce well decline rates as well as for its deepwater and other technologies.Notes:Disclosure: No positions"

(NYSE:HAL) is scheduled to report its first quarter 2011 results on April 18, 2011, before the start of trading.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter is a profit  of 59 cents per share (with a downside potential of 1.7%) on revenue of  $4.9 billion. In the year-ago quarter, Halliburton recorded a gain of  28 cents per share, while sales came in at $3.8 billion.Fourth Quarter RecapHalliburton’s fourth-quarter 2010 results came in better than expected,  helped by the strength and sustainability of the all-important North  American onshore activity levels (to which the company is heavily  exposed through its market-share-leading pressure-pumping business).Earnings per share, excluding special items, came in at 68 cents,  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 63 cents and were comfortably  ahead of the year-ago adjusted profit of 28 cents.Revenues of $5.2 billion were 40.0% greater than that achieved during  the fourth quarter of 2009 and also surpassed the Zacks Consensus  Estimate of $4.9 billion, as sales increased across the company’s  business units.(Read our full coverage on this earnings report: Halliburton Posts Big Gain.)Points to Ponder for First QuarterHalliburton enjoys a strong competitive position within the global  oilfield services markets. We like the company’s broad and  technologically-complex product and service offerings, along with its  robust financial profile.It remains the best-positioned company in the U.S. pressure pumping  market, with significant acreage positions in the highest profile plays,  such as the Haynesville, Eagle Ford shale and Bakken. In the near term,  Halliburton is likely to benefit from bullish U.S. land drilling  trends, where activity is tracking above expectations.The key negative, in our view, is the company’s recent assertion that  March quarter results will be adversely affected by abnormally seasonal  weather and disruptions in the Middle East/North Africa markets. The  aggregate impact is expected to be 5–8 cents per share for North  American seasonality and 3–4 cents per share associated with the North  African unrest.  Agreement of AnalystsAs a result of the above-mentioned factors, there has been a downward  bias among the analysts regarding Halliburton’s outlook. In particular,  we see a notable number of estimate revisions over the past 30 days.Out of the 32 analysts covering the stock, 13 have revised their  estimates downward for the first quarter of 2011, while 2 have gone in  the opposite direction.Magnitude of Estimate RevisionsConsequent to analysts revising estimates southward over the past 30  days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter has gone down by 3  cents (from $62 cents to 59 cents).Our RecommendationHalliburton shares currently retain a Zacks #3 Rank, which translates  into a short-term 'Hold' rating. We are also maintaining our long-term  '""Neutral'"" recommendation on the stock.We like Halliburton’s leading position in the global oilfield services  market, along with its broad and technologically-complex product and  service offerings, and its robust financial profile. Since the last few  quarters, the company has been benefiting from increased activity in the  unconventional oil and gas shale plays in North America, which have  more than made up for the drop in deepwater Gulf of Mexico activity.However, the world's second-largest oilfield services company after Schlumberger Ltd. (NYSE:SLB)  continues to feel pressure from intense competition in the market,  depressed natural gas prices and the expected curtailment in incremental  drilling projects.As such, we see the stock performing in line with the broader market and prefer to remain on the sidelines."

263906,24018,2011-04-17T09:36:05-04:00,,"I believe that Haliburton (NYSE:HAL) represents a sound choice to capitalize upon the ongoing boom in the oil service sector.HAL one-year price and volume (click to enlarge image):HAL is the second largest oil service company in the world, behind only Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB). The company has recently concentrated efforts to become a pure oil service firm, divesting their Kellogg, Brown and Root construction arm.My investment thesis entails several key premises:Let's review the fundamentals and technical charts for additional insights.FUNDAMENTAL ANALYSISThe company has notable divergence in its valuation metrics. However, on balance, Haliburton couples a several strong value measures with a very strong growth story.When evaluating equity investments, I like to start by reviewing the balance sheet. Here is a strength. Haliburton maintains a sound debt-to-equity ratio of 37 percent. Return on equity and return on assets are 19 percent and 10 percent, respectively. These are both acceptable figures on an absolute basis and stack up well versus industry peers. The current ratio of 2.9 is very strong; indeed perhaps a bit too liquid. This is somewhat offset by the fact that the balance sheet shows only $2.25 a share in cash, or about $2 billion.Long-term debt has been stable after bumping up in 2009.Benjamin Graham used to calculate the equity / asset ratio as an initial screen for value stocks. Graham considered a figure greater than 0.5 a plus. HAL sports a E/A ratio of 0.57.Analyzing the cash flow statement offers a bit more color.Operating cash flows are strong and have demonstrated a general upward bias. However, capital expenditures have been rising even faster. Capex has increased every year since 2002. In fact, FCF (free cash flow) for 2010 was only 15 cents per share: not enough to even cover the modest dividend. The company is attempting to cement its leadership in North America, battle Schlumberger globally, and make inroads to Iraq. While management pursues business growth aggressively, investors seek investments that translate to results. Return on capital employed (ROCE) is a key metric to watch. For all of 2010, the ROCE was about 14 percent. Certainly an acceptable return.The income statement is where the entire narrative gels.Despite the recent run-up in stock price, Haliburton still looks cheap by the numbers. The current P/E is 24, but that's not where to focus. Consensus 2011 earnings are forecast to be $2.85 per share or 16 X earnings. The 2012 EPS is $3.51, a 23 percent improvement. The five-year earnings per share CAGR is projected to be 19 percent. Indeed, while no analyst forecasts can be taken as gospel, I am willing to accept the next two years' EPS targets: HAL management has beaten the numbers six of nine quarters going back to 4Q 2008. Not a bad track record.Utilizing the dynamic EPS projections, the five year PEG equates to 0.8. Anything lower than 1 is considered a good value metric.So what are the negatives?Well, the price to cash flow is 15. A value investor seeks P / CF less than 10. Price to book is 4.0; certainly not a value metric. The dividend is a pedestrian 0.77 percent, though this is mitigated by the five-year dividend growth rate of 8 percent. The Graham Number indicates a fair value of $17.34 a share. Conversely, the enterprise value (market cap + debt – cash) is $48.94.TECHNICAL CHARTSSince Novmeber of last year, Haliburton stock has followed a trendline north. Last week, the stock broke above the 50-day moving average. On balance volume is pointed in the right direction. That indicates the institutions are stepping up. This is important: 80 percent of HAL's investors are institutions.On the other hand, the MACD and slow stochastic remain weak. Nonetheless, watching previous chart action, each time these indicators kissed the “zero” line or flashed the “overbought” signal, the stock price bounced back and resumed along the upward trendline.Therefore, while I favor the fundamentals, a review the charts shows nothing ominous.THE NEWS WIRESHaliburton announces 1Q 2011 earnings on April 18. Some of the April selling pressure may be related to management's warning that first quarter EPS will be negatively impacted by inclement weather in North America and general disruption in the Middle East. For the patient investor, a downturn based upon these transitory issues is a Buy signal.The fallout from the Deepwater Horizon incident remains another overhang. While the potential for significant litigation and damages are real, my view is that HAL's contract will BP will enable the company to avoid most claims. The indemnification language found in such contracts are usually quite strong: requiring proof of Gross Negligence or Willful Misconduct to trigger a loss of protection.On the positive side, Haliburton is the leader in oilfield services in North America. Expansive drilling in the Bakken area and unconventional gas plays throughout the region bode well for the company. Recent contracts with ExxonMobil and Statoil are additional short-term positives.THE BOTTOM LINEHaliburton is a best-of-breed stock in the right Sector (Oil and Energy) and the right Industry (Oil Services) today. A strong balance sheet and promising forward EPS projections position the company's stock to rise in a secular trend that should last at least another two years. Management has demonstrated a penchant for beating the Street during earnings season.These facts offset some questionable valuation metrics. For instance, price to cash flow and price to book ratios appear rich. Free cash flow is weak, but this is due to remarkably high capex, not lagging operating cash.While HAL is not a pure value play, an investor is compensated by the robust future earnings potential.Short-term issues around quarterly earnings are background noise. I believe the Deepwater Horizon tragedy will take several years to play and ultimately not damage the company's finances.Assuming a 2011 EPS of $2.85, and a 19X multiple on the stock, I project a short-term (less than one year) target price of $54 a share. Weakness associated with management's discussion of first quarter earnings reduction presents an opportunity to Buy, not Sell.Placing a 17X multiple on 2012 earnings of $3.51, I envision a twelve to eighteen month pricetag of $60 a share.This offers an investor a 28 percent upside, plus a modest dividend that will add another one or two percent.Risks include prolonged negative geo-political risks in the Middle East, oil prices escalating so high and so fast as to curtail demand and reduce production activity, the company over-extending its capital program to the detriment of prudent ROCE, the ongoing overhang with respect to the Deepwater Horizon incident, and U.S. regulatory risk over longstanding oil production fracturing techniques.Disclosure: I am long HAL."
247774,20568,2011-01-21T09:28:02-05:00,,"Leading oilfield service provider, Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL),  is expected to report its fourth quarter and full year 2010 earnings on  Monday, January 24, 2011, before the opening bell. The Zacks Consensus  Estimate for the fourth quarter is 63 cents per share, while that for  fiscal 2010 is $2.01 per share.Third Quarter 2010 RecapHalliburton’s earnings per share, excluding one-time items, came in at  58 cents, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 56 cents and way  above the year-ago adjusted profit of 31 cents per share. Revenues  increased 30% year over year to $4.7 billion and were slightly ahead of  the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.6 billion.The company’s third quarter profitability was driven by the unique  strength of its balanced geographic portfolio. Halliburton benefited  from the robustness of the North American markets that counterbalanced  the flat international performance.Agreement of AnalystsAnalysts exhibit a positive sentiment for Halliburton in the  to-be-reported quarter based on a bullish pressure pumping market and  indications of strong revenue and margins in North America.  In the last 30 days, out of the 32 analysts covering the stock, 9  analysts have raised their estimates for the fourth quarter of 2010 and  none of the analysts have lowered their estimates for the same quarter.  In the last 7 days, 3 analysts have revised the estimate upward while  none of the analysts have moved in the opposite direction.For fiscal year 2010, the analysts have followed a trend similar to the  fourth quarter discussed above for the last week. However, over the  past one month, 8 analysts raised their estimates.Magnitude of Estimate RevisionsTaking into effect the analysts’ earnings revision, the Zacks Consensus  Estimate for the fourth quarter and full year 2010 went up by a penny  each to 63 cents and $2.01 per share, over the last 30 days.However, for the past one week, the Consensus Estimate for both the quarter and full year remained static.Surprise HistoryHalliburton exhibited a positive earnings surprise trend over the last  four quarters. The company recorded a minimum surprise of 3.6% in third  quarter 2010 while a maximum of 40.5% in second quarter 2010. On an  average, the earnings surprise was 13.9%.The current Zacks Consensus Estimates for the fourth quarter and fiscal  2010 show upside potential of 1.6% and 0.0%, respectively.Our RecommendationHouston, Texas-based Halliburton enjoys a strong competitive position  within the global oilfield services industry. The bullish near-term land  drilling trends and rig count fundamentals in the U.S. are expected to  act as positive catalysts for the company’s performance in the upcoming  quarter. We also expect Halliburton to render high production volumes  courtesy its position in the fertile shale plays like Haynesville, Eagle  Ford and Bakken.However, Halliburton is exposed to intense competition in the market from peers like Baker Hughes (BHI) and Schlumberger Limited (NYSE:SLB).  The depressing natural gas prices and regulatory restrictions on  drilling activities are also possible headwinds that could hamper the  company’s results. We maintain our long-term Neutral recommendation on  the stock."
240611,23502,2010-12-06T01:27:00-05:00,,"By Stephen EllisWe think Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) represents a fairly attractive opportunity at today's levels, as it is one of the cheapest companies in our oil services universe. The company has performed extremely well during the 2008-09 downturn and subsequent recovery, and we think its 2011 prospects look bright, as its end-stage markets continue to improve. In addition, we believe the recent industry consolidation as well as the company's drilling solutions has earned it a narrow moat. More quantitative metrics also support Halliburton's moat, as over the past few years the firm has delivered returns on invested capital well in excess of its cost of capital, and we expect this value creation to persist going forward. In this article, we share the detailed reasoning behind our decision to increase Halliburton's moat to narrow.Industry ConsolidationHistorically, we've been reluctant to award moats to the services players outside of Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) as sustainable pricing power has been elusive, due to the industry's volatility. That said, with the industry consolidation that has taken place over the past year with the Schlumberger/Smith and Baker Hughes (BHI)/BJ Services deals, we think the industry's long-term pricing power has strengthened. Halliburton has also used the 2008-09 downturn to take out many smaller competitors by setting prices below their cash break-even costs. The aggressive moves during the downturn positioned Halliburton to turn in industry-leading performance in North America as the market recovered in 2010.The industry rebound was driven by unconventional activity, which we think also favors larger services players such as Halliburton. The services intensity (services revenue per rig) for some of the liquids-rich shale plays has doubled in the past two years, and has increased about 10% annually for the past decade. Now, about $80 million in services equipment needs to be on site for some wells, versus $20 million in equipment two years ago. The huge need for equipment and people means that smaller players do not have the people, equipment, or capital needed to keep up with the larger players. As the services equipment broke down in the shale plays during the downturn, Halliburton took advantage of its strong financial position by investing in new replacement capacity, and stole huge swaths of market share from its smaller peers.The disappearance of the small industry players has caused the oil and gas companies' bargaining power to clearly diminish over the past two years. Petrohawk (HK) has tried to sponsor smaller services players by giving them work even when it was cheaper to go with a larger services provider, but that has not worked out very well. After Shell (NYSE:RDS.A) bought out some shale acreage, they promptly fired all of the services venders and consolidated their work with Schlumberger and Halliburton. Unsurprisingly, Shell and other oil and gas companies are considering long-term contracts for services work. The advantage for the oil and gas companies is that they know they will have predictable and skilled services providers helping them develop their valuable acreage. Of course, the services industry has stated they are opposed to long-term services contracts, which makes a lot of sense in a strong services pricing environment. Finally, the shift toward a ""manufacturing model"" by the oil and gas companies for unconventional drilling has actually played to some extent into the services industry's hands, as it has diminished the risk of a new technology or drilling approach upending the industry's offerings.Halliburton's Optimized Drilling SolutionFor more than a decade, Halliburton has been working on integrating its drilling services to fully optimize drilling performance while lowering costs. Halliburton began by placing its drilling engineering applications under one roof, which includes fluids, bits, and directional drilling. Over time, the firm has integrated its services into a single solution, which means that a customer can potentially obtain substantially greater well performance and reduced levels of non-productive time by standardizing on Halliburton's services rather than mixing services from multiple services providers. We believe this type of offering will be quite difficult for traditional competitors to duplicate, and impossible for smaller services providers.We believe the integrated aspect of the offering helps retain customers--if the customer tries to bring in an outside and cheaper provider, the additional savings will likely be more than offset by the degraded well performance. The optimization approach changes the services offering from a collection of individual products that are each exposed to significant price competition to a single solution that requires a peer to offer a fully-optimized and integrated product portfolio, which is much harder to do. At its 2010 Analyst Day, Halliburton indicated that 50% of the wells it drilled for a certain customer in the North Sea were in the top quartile of all wells drilled in that basin for the year, which saved the customer on average between $2 million and $10 million per well.Savings such as the above example are commonly cited by services providers as evidence of the value of the technology and expertise they bring to the table. We believe the savings are real for customers, but it is hard to build a sustainable competitive advantage over peers in this highly-competitive industry, as we think peers can typically duplicate savings derived off a single product or product line fairly quickly. The value in Halliburton's packaged approach is that it doesn't just bolt together the various technologies, but it uses proprietary work flows and input from different drilling disciplines to build a compelling solution. We estimate Halliburton's packaged offerings now make up around 40% of its revenue, with most of that success coming from North America.In our view, Halliburton's competitors are struggling to catch up. Our estimates place packaged revenue for Baker Hughes at around 5%-10% of its business. We think Schlumberger paid the huge stock price premium for Smith's drill bit and fluids assets earlier this year largely due to the compelling value proposition from offering a fully-integrated drillstring solution. We suspect part of the reason why Schlumberger realized the strategic value of this approach so late is that it has focused more on international markets rather than North America, which is where packaged services caught on first. The value proposition also likely explains Patterson's (NASDAQ:PTEN) and Nabors' (NYSE:NBR) acquisitions of pressure-pumping assets earlier this year, but we note there are virtually no synergies between rigs and pressure-pumping assets, so it will be hard for the drillers to compete with Halliburton's optimized approach.Halliburton estimates that around 60% of its well completions by the end of 2011 will be using fully-integrated offerings, and we think its peers' approaches are not quite as fully developed. We think Schlumberger is closest to having a comparable solution, but Baker Hughes and Weatherford (WFT) still have a lot of work to do. In addition, about 50% of Halliburton's North American revenue is made up of just 16 customers, which implies that some of the largest services spenders in the U.S. have bought heavily into Halliburton's optimized drilling solution. We believe Halliburton now has a group of very sticky and high-spending customers, which will benefit the firm going forward.Disclosure: Morningstar licenses its indexes to certain ETF and ETN providers, including Barclays Global Investors (BGI), First Trust, and ELEMENTS, for use in exchange-traded funds and notes.

This was helped by the strength and sustainability of the all-important North American onshore activity levels (to which the company is heavily exposed through its market-share-leading pressure-pumping business).Earnings per share, excluding special items, came in at 61 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 58 cents and comfortably ahead of the year-ago adjusted profit of 28 cents.Revenues of $5.3 billion were 40.4% greater than during the first quarter of 2010 and also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.9 billion, as sales increased across the company’s business units.During the quarter, North America accounted for approximately 56% of Halliburton’s total revenues and 82% of its operating income.Segmental PerformanceCompletion & Production Segment: Business-segment-wise, Halliburton’s Completion and Production segment revenues were up 6.3% sequentially and 61.5% year over year to $3.2 billion, mainly reflecting sustained strength in U.S. land operations.Segment operating income was $660 million, a 4.1% sequential decrease but almost tripling from the year-earlier level.Operating income in North America increased significantly – $96 million sequentially and a whopping $477 million year over year – buoyed by increased demand and pricing gains.Internationally, operating income was down $124 million from the fourth quarter of 2010 and $55 million from the first quarter 2010 levels. The reduction over the preceding quarters was on account of lower activity levels in Mexico, operational disruptions caused by geopolitical issues in North Africa, project delays in Kazakhstan, and startup costs in Iraq.Drilling & Evaluation Segment: Revenues from Halliburton’s Drilling and Evaluation business were 3.0% below fourth quarter levels but improved by a healthy 17.4% year over year to $2.1 billion, propelled by higher activity in the Western Hemisphere and the start-up of work in Iraq.The segment’s operating income fell 35.0% from the December quarter and 14.8% from the year-ago period to $230 million.Operating income in North America was $118 million during the quarter, flat from the previous quarter (adversely affected by the muted Gulf of Mexico activity levels) but up $25 million from the first quarter of 2010 (on strong U.S. drilling activity).International operating income decreased $128 million sequentially and $65 million year over year, reflecting operational disturbances due to geopolitical issues in North Africa, lower drilling activity in the North Sea, higher costs in Saudi Arabia and certain locations in Asia Pacific, as well as startup costs in Iraq.Balance SheetHalliburton’s capital expenditure in the first quarter was $704 million. As of March 31, 2011, the company had approximately $1.0 billion in cash and $3.8 billion in long-term debt, representing a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 25.9%.OutlookHalliburton management pointed out that first quarter profitability was driven by strong demand for its services in North America, which more than offset the Eastern Hemisphere disappointment stemming from geopolitical disturbances, delays in Iraq, and typical seasonality.The world's second-largest oilfield services company after Schlumberger Ltd. (NYSE:SLB) believes that bullish near-term U.S. land drilling trends, where activity is being driven by horizontal drilling and liquids-rich plays, were able to make up for the disruptions in North Africa and decrease in activity in the Gulf of Mexico.Going forward, Halliburton anticipates benefiting from demand improvements in select North American basins, as operators continue to make the exploitation of unconventional resources the focus of their investment.At the same time, the company expects margins in Eastern Hemisphere to improve in the June quarter. However, Halliburton cautioned that it will continue to be adversely affected by the situation in Libya and by competitive pricing.Our RecommendationHalliburton shares currently retain a Zacks #3 Rank, which translates into a short-term Hold rating. Longer-term, we are maintaining our Neutral recommendation on the stock."

(NYSE:HAL) – one of the largest oilfield  service providers in the world – is scheduled to report its first  quarter 2010 results on Monday, Apr 19, before the opening bell.   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter is 25 cents per  share (with an upside of 4%), compared to the 44 cents per share earned  in the year-earlier period.  Fourth Quarter Recap   The world's second-largest oil services firm after Schlumberger  Ltd. (NYSE:SLB) reported profit of 28 cents  per share in the fourth quarter of 2009, a penny above the Zacks  Consensus Estimate of 27 cents. The company believed improvement in  North America market helped it to top expectations.  Drilling Activity Picking up in North America   As reinforced by the quarterly results released in December, the  all-important North American activity levels (to which the company is  heavily exposed through its market-share-leading pressure-pumping  business) are showing signs of revival. Margins had bottomed in most  basins during the third quarter of 2009 and now appear to be poised for a  rebound, as the industry looks to balance supply growth with recovering  hydrocarbon demand. We are further encouraged by Halliburton’s recent  deals with industry giants like SGS SA and ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP).    Gas Prices Remain a Concern   But the continued glut in domestic gas supplies, the end of the  three-month cold snap (from Dec. ‘09 through Feb. ’10) and the arrival  of mild spring weather, as well as the rapid rise in the natural gas rig  count, has renewed investor skepticism about natural gas prices.  Estimate Revisions Trend: Erratic & Lacking Any  Specific Trend   With the Zacks Consensus Estimate staying at 25 cents over the past  month, estimates for the first quarter of 2010 have remained firm.  Overall, 4 out of the 26 analysts covering the stock raised their  projections during that time, with 3 downward revisions. Over the last 7  days, 1 analyst upped estimates for the first quarter 2010, while 2  moved in the opposite direction. Our short-term recommendation on  Halliburton remains Hold (Zacks Rank #3).  Positive Surprise History  The company has a history of positive earnings surprises, surpassing the  Zacks Consensus Estimate in 3 of the last 4 quarters. Halliburton has  performed consistently well during this period with its average earnings  surprise being 11.35%. This implies that the company has beaten the  Zacks Consensus Estimate by 11.35% over the last four quarters.   As such, we will not be surprised if Halliburton reports  better-than-expected results, yet again, driven by improved U.S.  pressure pumping activity on the back of higher drilling activity.  Company Profile   Houston, Texas-based Halliburton offers a variety of equipment,  maintenance, and engineering and construction services to the energy,  industrial, and government sectors."
231514,20568,2010-10-21T17:31:56-04:00,,"Earlier this week, major oilfield services provider Halliburton Co. (HAL) announced its financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2010.Now that the analysts have had some time to digest the quarterly  performance, they are weighing in with their estimate revisions. Below  we cover the results of the recent earnings announcement, subsequent  analyst estimate revisions and Zacks ratings for the stock.Earnings ReviewHalliburton's better-than-anticipated third-quarter 2010 results  were helped by the strength in the all-important North American onshore  activity levels (to which the company is heavily exposed through its  market-share-leading pressure-pumping business).Earnings per share, excluding special items, came in at 58 cents,  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 56 cents and were comfortably  ahead of the year-ago adjusted profit of 31 cents.Revenues of $4.7 billion, 30% above the third quarter of 2009, also  surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.6 billion, as sales  increased across the company’s business units.During the quarter, North America accounted for approximately 51% of  Halliburton’s total revenues and 65% of its operating income.Agreement of Estimate RevisionsThere is a strong positive agreement among the analysts regarding  Halliburton’s outlook. In particular, we see a notable number of  estimate revisions over the past 7 days, indicating that the revisions  were in response to the company’s third quarter earnings release.Out of 33 analysts covering the stock, 23 have revised their estimates  for 2010 upward, while 5 have gone in the opposite direction. Looking  forward to 2011, the trend is more or less similar. Out of 33 analysts,  22 hiked their estimates compared to just one negative revision.Estimates are up for the December quarter of 2010 as well. For the  current quarter, 21 of the 29 analysts have increased their estimates  over the last 7 days, against 5 downward revisions.Magnitude of Estimate RevisionsAs a result of the analysts revising estimates over the past 7 days,  the Zacks Consensus Estimates for fiscal 2010 and 2011 have gone up 5  cents (from $1.94 to $1.99) and 13 cents (from $2.49 to $2.62),  respectively. Meanwhile, the estimate for the December 2010 quarter is  up by 3 cents.The increases are based on the expectations of bullish near-term U.S.  land drilling trends, where activity is being driven by oil and  liquids-rich plays. This will make the reduction in gas activity less  meaningful. Halliburton will continue to be a beneficiary of the bullish  rig count fundamentals in the U.S., driven by horizontal drilling in  the service intensive plays.Our RecommendationHalliburton currently has a Zacks #2 Rank (short-term 'Buy' rating). In  the near term, the company is likely to benefit from bullish U.S. land  drilling trends, where activity is tracking above expectations.However, new environmental regulations for hydraulic fracturing in the  shale plays, the intensely competitive nature of the market, and  depressed natural gas prices will continue to overhang the stock during  the longer-term, accounting for our Neutral recommendation."
215196,20568,2010-07-19T16:09:58-04:00,,"Halliburton Co. (NYSE:HAL) – one of the largest oilfield service providers in the world – reported significantly better-than-anticipated second-quarter 2010 results. This was helped by the strength and sustainability of the all-important North American onshore activity levels (to which the company is heavily exposed through its market-share-leading pressure-pumping business).Earnings per share from continuing operations came in at 52 cents, comfortably beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 37 cents and the year-ago adjusted profit of 30 cents (excluding employee separation costs).Revenues of $4.4 billion was 25.6% greater than that achieved during the second quarter of 2009 and also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.1 billion, as sales increased across the company’s business units.During the quarter, North America accounted for approximately 48% of Halliburton’s total revenues and 54% of its operating income.Completion and Production SegmentBusiness-segment-wise, Halliburton’s Completion and Production segment revenues were up 21.8% sequentially and 36.6% year over year to $2.4 billion, reflecting increased activity in North America.Segment operating income was $497 million, more than doubling from the previous quarter as well as from the year-earlier level. Operating income in North America increased significantly – $173 million sequentially and $258 million year over year – buoyed by strong results from US land drilling. Higher service intensity has led to greater absorption of equipment capacity and further improvements in pricing power.Internationally, operating income was up $86 million from the first quarter of 2010, while it declined marginally (by $4 million) from the second quarter 2009 levels. The healthy gain over the previous quarter was on account of improved performance in Mexico and Colombia, strong demand for production enhancement services in Congo, Algeria, and the North Sea, increased demand for completion tools in Nigeria and Norway, and strong completions and production enhancement activity across Middle East/Asia.Drilling and Evaluation SegmentRevenues from Halliburton’s Drilling and Evaluation business was up 11% sequentially and 14.5% year over year to $2 billion, propelled by higher activity in North America, Latin America, and Middle East/Asia.The segment’s operating income rose 17.8% from the March quarter and 12% from the year-ago period to $318 million. Operating income in North America was $131 million during the quarter, up $38 million from the previous quarter and $103 million from the second quarter of 2009, mainly on the back higher horizontal drilling activity across onshore US Latin America operating income increased $38 million sequentially and $2 million year over year, reflecting improved drilling activity in Mexico and higher testing activity in Brazil. These were partly offset by lower activity in the North Sea and certain locations in West Africa, which dragged down Europe/Africa/CIS earnings by $38 million from the previous quarter and by $33 million from the year-ago period.Balance SheetHalliburton’s capital expenditure in the second quarter was $451 million. As of June 30, 2010, the company had approximately $1.2 billion in cash and $4.6 billion in long-term debt (including current maturities), representing a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 32.8%.OutlookHalliburton management pointed out that second quarter profitability was driven by increased activity in the unconventional oil and gas shale plays in North America, aided by anticipated seasonal recovery of markets in the eastern hemisphere and improved activity in Latin America.However, the world's second-largest oilfield services company after Schlumberger Ltd. (NYSE:SLB) cautioned that North American land rig count, which has experienced strong upward momentum over the last twelve months, may plateau in the near future, as growth in highly productive horizontal drilling has led to a natural gas supply overhang and relatively weak natural gas prices in the US market. This is likely to be partially offset by the continued growth of oil- and liquids- rich reservoirs.The firm also believes that the huge oil spill accident in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM) and the subsequent deepwater drilling suspension will reduce its earnings by 5 – 8 cents per quarter for the remainder of 2010.As a reminder, on Apr 20, offshore driller Transocean Inc’s (NYSE:RIG) ultra-deepwater Horizon drilling platform, contracted to British major BP Plc (NYSE:BP), sank following an explosion while operating in the US GoM off the coast of Louisiana. The incident killed 11 workers and caused what is considered the worst oil spill in US history. Halliburton, which provided blowout-prevention equipment, had been embroiled in the incident.Our RecommendationWe like Halliburton’s leading position in the global oilfield services market, its geographic and operational diversity, and its robust financial profile.

214764,20568,2010-07-15T16:53:26-04:00,,"Oilfield services giant Halliburton Co. (NYSE:HAL) is scheduled to report its second quarter 2010 results on Monday, July 19, before the opening bell. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter is 36 cents per share (with an upside of 3%), compared to the 30 cents per share earned in the year-earlier period.First Quarter Recap The world's second-largest oilfield service provider after Schlumberger Ltd. (NYSE:SLB) reported profit of 28 cents per share in the first quarter of 2010, 2 cents above the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Halliburton believed strengthening activity in North America helped it to top expectations, offsetting weak demand across Latin America. During the quarter, North America accounted for approximately 45% of the company’s total revenue as well as its operating income.Drilling Activity Picks up in North America As reinforced by the first quarter results, the all-important North American activity levels (to which the company is heavily exposed through its market-share-leading pressure-pumping business) are showing signs of strength and sustainability. Margins had bottomed in most basins during the third quarter of 2009 and now appear to be rapidly gaining steam, as the industry looks to balance supply growth with recovering hydrocarbon demand. Pressure pumping (an umbrella term used to describe a number of vital services performed on new and existing wells) demand is on a secular uptick and the market is now enjoying around 100% effective utilization. Pricing, which remains well below 2006 levels, has increased meaningfully from the last year’s lows. Halliburton is best suited to gain leverage from these factors, having the highest exposure to pressure pumping. As such, we expect the company to report very strong North American operating income and revenue growth.Agreement of Analysts The following table reflects a strong positive agreement among the analysts regarding Halliburton’s outlook. In particular, we see a notable number of estimate revisions over the past 30 days. Out of 28 analysts covering the stock, 15 have revised upwards their estimates for the second quarter of 2010, while 3 have gone in the opposite direction.Magnitude of Estimate Revisions As a result of the analysts revising estimates over the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimates for the second quarter of 2010 has gone up 2 cents (from 34 cents to 36 cents). The increase is based on the strengthening North American markets, steady international growth expectations, and rebounding activity levels.Positive Surprise History The company has a history of positive earnings surprises, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last 4 quarters. Halliburton has performed consistently well during this period with its average earnings surprise being 10.43%. This implies that the company has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 10.43% over the last four quarters. As such, we will not be surprised if Halliburton reports better-than-expected results, yet again, driven by improved U.S. pressure pumping activity. Limited GoM Liability We are also encouraged by the news from the congressional hearings in May that absolved Halliburton of the liability in the huge oil spill accident in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM). Though the company may be subject to legal challenges, it worked under a limited liability contract and as per Congressional testimony, performed work as instructed by BP plc (NYSE:BP). As a reminder, on April 20, offshore driller Transocean Inc’s (NYSE:RIG) ultra-deepwater Horizon drilling platform, contracted to British major BP, sank following an explosion while operating in the U.S. GoM off the coast of Louisiana. The incident killed 11 workers and caused what is considered the worst oil spill in U.S. history. Halliburton, which provided blowout-prevention equipment, had been embroiled in the incident.Our Recommendation We like Halliburton’s leading position in the global oilfield services market, its geographic and operational diversity, and its robust financial profile.

251969,21821,2011-02-10T05:25:26-05:00,,"It is about time Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) got some love. Over the past few years, I thought this company deserved a higher valuation. As a $41 billion company, Halliburton has proved it is one of the best at what they do, but still it trades at a discount to peers. Even so, certain aspects of the oil services sector will show why there has been a bull run since June of 2010.Halliburton provides services and products to companies in the energy industry. Unconventional drilling has been a boon for this sector. There is currently an expansion in shale drilling in the United States. The United States' rig count has been on a healthy upswing since the third quarter of 2009. As the number of rigs increase, there is an equal percentage increase in horizontal drilling.From the third quarter of 2008 to the third quarter of 2010, horizontal drilling increased from 31% of total rigs to 51%. Oil and liquids rich drilling also increased from 53% to 59%. Areas like the Eagle Ford shale are creating more opportunities. This area has seen a large increase in rigs and money, providing faster development. This situation won't be changing anytime soon. Rig numbers are estimated to increase over 400% from the beginning of 2010 to the end of this year. Land acquisitions are increasing too, as over the same time frame, this has increased from $.2 billion to $4.3 billion in the third quarter of last year.Halliburton will be busy for some time in new shale plays for two reasons. The increased number of wells and the difficulty of drilling those wells. Many oil and gas exploration and production companies do not have the know how or ability to succeed in difficult horizontal wells. In this case, they will call companies like Halliburton, Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB), Baker Hughes (BHI), or Weatherford (WFT) to come out and manage everything from drilling and evaluation to completion and production.The best way to analyze the transformation of new drills is to break down and separate drills into 2008 versus 2010. The information contained shows the differences over two years between four major shales. The first is hydraulic horsepower, which is generated by the pump trucks on location. The second piece of information is lateral length (feet). The third is how many drilling stages are performed. The last is the overall AFE cost (total well cost).2008 Marcellus avg. HHP 6K, 3K ft. lateral, 7 stages, avg. AFE $3.4 M 2010 Marcellus avg. HHP 30K, 5K ft. lateral, 15 stages, avg. AFE $5.2 MThe Marcellus shale shows a large increase in hydraulic horsepower (500%). It also shows the laterals are now 2000 feet longer. Drillers are now doing more than double the stages in this area. Most importantly, each well costs $1.8 million more, and this means more money for companies like Halliburton.2008 Bakken avg. HHP 12K, 6500 ft. lateral, 5 stages, avg. AFE $3.9 M 2010 Bakken avg. HHP 14K, 8500 ft. lateral, 17 stages, avg. AFE $6 MIn the Bakken the hydraulic horsepower was increased only slightly, but the laterals are 2000 feet longer. Stages increased over 300%. Well AFE increased $2.1 million.2008 Eagle Ford avg. HHP 18K, Vertical, 3 stages, avg. AFE $5 M 2010 Eagle Ford avg. HHP 36K, 6K ft. lateral, 14 stages, avg. AFE $8.2 MAt the Eagle Ford, the hydraulic horsepower doubled. These numbers are somewhat skewed as the 2008 numbers were of a vertical well, as in 2010, and average of horizontal wells. AFE increased by $3.2 million.2008 Permian avg. HHP 12K, 3500 ft. lateral, 8 stages, avg. AFE $3.5 M 2010 Permian avg. HHP 30K, 4500 ft. lateral, 12 stages, avg. AFE $5.5 MIn the Permian there was an increase of hydraulic horsepower by 18 thousand. The laterals were 1,000 feet longer. Stages increased and AFE increased by $2 million.This subsection shows very important information with respect to Halliburton's business. The hydraulic horsepower increases with respect to horizontal drilling, and is a new and improved drilling method. Haliburton now uses twenty pump trucks, as opposed to the nine it used in 2008.In 2010, well costs have increased significantly, and although this will help to attain more oil, it creates costs. When looking at well price increases in just two years, it looks as though Halliburton, Schlumberger, and others will continue to make more money with each well. Horizontal wells in shales all over the United States are now using more hydraulic horsepower, longer laterals, increased stages and this all translates to higher costs. These costs have translated to more money for the producer, so the trend will probably continue. The shortage of crews looks to also give pricing power to this group.Halliburton sells itself by being a one stop shop. By offering all the services needed, it is easier for the customer. Halliburton is working to streamline its company. These changes have created a reduction of cap ex by 20%. They have also decreased personnel on location by 35%. Lastly, and most importantly, they have reduced well completion time by 25%.Halliburton has also changed the way it drills unconventionals. In 2008, it used nine pump trucks. By 2010, 20 pump trucks were used. Hydraulic horsepower was increased. The biggest change is with respect to fracking. Right now, there is a large group of environmentalists unhappy with fracking, as they believe it is polluting the environment. There is talk of possible ground water pollution. It seems these concerns are unwarranted. Halliburton has gone to great lengths to make sure they leave as small a footprint as possible in all aspects of drilling. They have spent considerable time and money to develop their CleanSuite of products.Halliburton's CleanWave water treatment system reduces the amount of fresh water needed to complete the fracturing process. This system offers an easy and mobile way of reusing the water. The CleanStream service is used to replace the current biocides used to kill bacteria in the well that can impede flow through corrosion. Last, and most important, is the CleanStim formulation. This is a hydraulic fracturing system composed solely of ingredients from the food industry. It is environmentally friendly while still creating an environment that is good for fracturing. This suite of products is just one way Halliburton is trying protect the environment.Halliburton is also doing unconventional drilling internationally. They believe this is a $15 billion dollar opportunity. This includes the Middle East, with a time horizon of 1 to 2 years. In Asia, there are shale opportunities in China and India. Coal bed methane in Indonesia and Australia are other areas of interest for Halliburton. Latin America has opportunities in Mexico, Columbia and Argentina. Recently there was the first shale frac in Poland. There are shale opportunities all over the world. Some countries like Poland have much higher natural gas prices. Since Halliburton has almost perfected many of the techniques, they can be carried to other countries, where further profit can be made.As a company, Halliburton has been doing quite well. Through quarter three of 2010, it had a year to date revenue growth of 17%. Third quarter operating margins were 19%. Return on capital employed was 13%. In 2010 through the third quarter, Halliburton had superior revenue growth in North America and internationally, when compared to its peer group (SLB and BHI). It's also seen better operating income. Total operating margins for Halliburton were 19%, while Schlumberger and Baker Hughes were at 17%. For the last four years, Halliburton has beaten its peer average with respect to return on capital employed. The most recent number is 2010 through the third quarter, where HAL was 13% and the peer group 8%. The peers are Schlumberger, Baker Hughes, and Weatherford. Revenue per rig is also increasing at a rapid rate.In summary, this sector looks very good going forward. The United States shale drilling increases should help Halliburton's balance sheet. The current shortage of fracking crews continues. Halliburton is placed well, as demand continues to increase along with pricing. It should also be noted that Halliburton currently trades at a discount to its peers, and this discount makes it much more attractive.Since oil is probably going to continue to go up, and the United States will continue with a large scale horizontal drilling program, so will Halliburton's backlog. Also, their environmentally focused strategy will pay off as the possibility of environmental mandates increase.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in HAL, SLB over the next 72 hours."
248140,20568,2011-01-24T09:45:16-05:00,,"Major oilfield services provider Halliburton Co. (NYSE:HAL)  reported better-than-anticipated fourth-quarter 2010 results. This was  helped by the strength and sustainability of the all-important North  American onshore activity levels (to which the company is heavily  exposed through its market-share-leading pressure-pumping business).Earnings per share, excluding special items, came in at 68 cents,  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 63 cents and were comfortably  ahead of the year-ago adjusted profit of 28 cents.Revenues of $5.2 billion were 40.0% greater than that achieved during  the fourth quarter of 2009 and also surpassed the Zacks Consensus  Estimate of $4.9 billion, as sales increased across the company’s  business units.During the quarter, North America accounted for approximately 51% of  Halliburton’s total revenues and 61% of its operating income.Segmental PerformanceCompletion & Production Segment: Business-segment-wise,  Halliburton’s Completion and Production segment revenues were up 12.4%  sequentially and 64.2% year over year to $3.0 billion, reflecting  sustained strength in North America and improved market conditions in  Africa.Segment operating income was $688 million, a 13.0% sequential increase  and more than quadrupling from the year-earlier level. Operating income  in North America increased significantly – $60 million sequentially and a  whopping $473 million year over year – buoyed by strong results for  production enhancement services and some pricing gains that more than  offset typical weather-related seasonality in the Rockies.Internationally, operating income was up $19 million from the third  quarter of 2010 and $45 million from the fourth quarter 2009 levels. The  growth over the preceding quarters was on account of higher activity  levels in Norway and Iraq, better vessel utilization in Angola, along  with increased completion tool sales in Algeria and Southeast Asia.  Drilling & Evaluation Segment: Revenues  from Halliburton’s Drilling and Evaluation business were 8.2% above  third quarter levels and improved by a much healthier 16.4% year over  year to $2.2 billion, propelled by the typical year-end seasonality of  higher demand for Landmark Graphics, a division of Halliburton  specializing in E&P (exploration and production) software and  consulting. Partially offsetting the positive factor were the effects of  the activity declines in the Gulf of Mexico.The segment’s operating income rose 30.6% from the September quarter  and 13.5% from the year-ago period to $354 million. Operating income in  North America was $114 million during the quarter, flat from the  previous quarter (adversely affected by the muted Gulf of Mexico  activity levels) but up $56 million from the fourth quarter of 2009 (on  strong U.S. land results).International operating income increased $84 million sequentially on  the back of higher activity in Iraq and increased direct sales in Asia.  However, ex-U.S. profitability was down $14 million year over year,  reflecting lower income from the Europe/Africa/CIS region.Balance SheetHalliburton’s capital expenditure in the fourth quarter was $657  million, bringing the full-year spending to $2.1 billion. As of December  31, 2010, the company had approximately $1.4 billion in cash and $3.8  billion in long-term debt, representing a debt-to-capitalization ratio  of 26.9%.OutlookHalliburton management pointed out that fourth quarter profitability  was driven by strong demand for its services in North America and  improvement in activity in a number of international markets including  Norway, West Africa, Iraq and Algeria.The world's second-largest oilfield services company after Schlumberger Ltd. (NYSE:SLB)  believes that bullish near-term U.S. land drilling trends, where  activity is being driven by horizontal drilling and liquids-rich plays,  were able to make up for the decrease in activity in the Gulf of Mexico.Going forward, Halliburton anticipates benefiting from pricing  improvements in select North American basins, as operators continue to  make the exploitation of unconventional resources the focus of their  investment. At the same time, the company expects international activity  to continue increasing.   Even though Halliburton has a Zacks #2 Rank (short-term Buy rating) in  the short run, we are Neutral on the shares in the longer term."

As is often the case under such circumstances, good results were already priced in, and investors took profits. The option action was especially bearish, with traders buying puts and selling calls. In the largest trade, some 22,000 November 30 puts were sold for $0.30 and $0.31 against existing open interest. Roughly the same number of January 28 puts were purchased for $0.70 at the same time, indicating that a downside position was rolled out by an additional two months.The trade reflects a belief that the provider of oil-field services has greater downside risk for a longer period of time. It may have been the work of a shareholder looking to protect a long position in the stock.HAL fell 6 percent to $33.66 in late morning trading. On Friday, the shares touched $35.89, their highest price since immediately before the stock market crashed in October 2008.optionMONSTER's tracking systems also detected the sale of about 28,000 November 38 calls, mostly for $0.22 to $0.25.

94255,22274,2008-09-07T06:53:21-04:00,,"Energy servicing giant Halliburton Company (NYSE: HAL) is down over 25% from its summer peak of $55, tracing the performance line of crude oil. This is to be expected in a market with little in the way of broad direction or leadership, but with oil becoming so volatile on YoY levels, price movements have lost some of their longer-term perspective.Nearly all the “picks & shovels” leaders in the energy sector are still clocking record results, with most of those gains made from customer decisions back when crude was $20 to $30 cheaper than today’s $106 and change for NYMEX Light Sweet Crude.Consider that Halliburton grew non-U.S. revenues by 26% in the second quarter while sequentially increasing operating margins from the first quarter of 2008 (see earnings call transcript). They are forecasting roughly 20% top-line growth for the year, order backlogs are strong, and the company is positioned well for horizontal drilling in the newly-fashionable shale sites in the U.S.I conducted a breakup value analysis of the company last year and calculated a value of $59 per share, based mainly on 2006 revenues and crude oil at about $55. Given that margins have compressed about 300 basis points from when I did the study, I will keep the value steady at $59 even though crude is twice as high today. The study was done back when private equity seemed to be eying anything with good cash flows, but estimating what operating segments would be valued at independently is a great way to supplement ongoing due diligence.Halliburton’s decision to move headquarters to Dubai may not make friends in the U.S. but has positioned them to clean up on Middle East contracts. They are in a favorable position to get solid bookings from a $10 billion sour crude project in Abu Dhabi, and have already signed a multi-year deal with Saudi Aramco for an offshore field that could produce up to 900,000 bpd.With oil still well above the zero-barrier line for profitable drilling at darn near any point on the planet, is the 5-year EPS growth estimate of 15% for HAL too low? I’ve got to go with a “yes” here; I just don’t have the gumption to bet against secular global growth trends, peak oil fears, supply disruptions, and freakish global weather, all at the same time. I can think of just two major hypothetical situations that would impede 5 year EPS growth - industrywide -of 20%+ :The greenie in me will celebrate when #2 happens, but I will likely be 15 or 20 years older by then. #1 has been taken care of quite efficiently by global markets in the past month; commodities across the board, hard and soft, have taken a beating. This should be enough to curb inflation fears while still allowing emerging economies to grow their coffers.Project and capital allocation decisions are being made by sovereignties and the multinationals on crude prices much lower than we’re seeing here; I would need to see sub $80 prices before I’d be concerned about the cancellation of a major supply or service contract.Despite continually hitting or exceeding numbers, Halliburton is still getting a valuation discount to its peers. Shares are going for less than 12x forward estimates against a secular backdrop that is really hard to discount. I would be dipping my toes into the proverbial well at these levels, as I believe crude will settle in above $100 before steadily moving higher. If Hurricane Ike continues to retrace the path of 1992’s Hurricane Andrew, that price stabilization could happen much sooner, and at a level more like $120-plus.Disclosure: Author does not hold any positions in the stocks mentioned."
176733,22109,2009-12-06T06:39:56-05:00,,"In my view, Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) is a ""hold,"" and will be a hold for the indefinite future.  It may roughly track the price of oil, but I do not believe its stock price will soar, even if oil prices do.  This may make HAL suitable for holding pattern options strategies such as covered calls or short puts, but little else.To echo Winston Churchill, Halliburton is a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma.  How is it that a company which had substantial sole source contracts in Iraq and enjoys a burgeoning international business can be so plodding in terms of its stock price?  The answer may come not from the annual report, but rather from a unique, self-published book by an American author living in Vienna, Austria, whose work was mentioned on CNBC a couple months ago during a discussion on banking secrecy.As we leave the beaten path to go afield, where transparency fades, prudence requires me to say that none of my commentary is legal or financial advance; moreover, I accuse no person or company of wrongdoing.  Grab a demitasse of espresso and hang on for a ride through Europe.The title of the book is Hidden Treuhand -- How Corporations and Individuals Hide Assets and Money.  It is as fascinating as the author herself, Shelley A. Stark, who began her personal odyssey as a victim of the very techniques and financial shenanigans she later investigated and exposed.  The book's details of that odyssey are poignant, but must remain an exercise for the interested reader, as we focus here on HAL.The book alleges the involvement of Halliburton International GmbH with a Treuhand embedded in the corporate structure, and provides documentation to support this.  Treuhands are entities similar to fiduciary arrangements or trusts, and are often perfectly above board.  However, Treuhands can come with an extra twist in Austria and certain other countries: a secret power of attorney that allows the complete, hidden control of assets by a third party.  If the ""taker"" or manager of the hidden Treuhand is an attorney, the very existence of this power of attorney, as well as the identity of the actual owner, can be concealed perpetually under attorney-client privilege.It's a pretty slick concept, providing anonymous asset ownership vastly more robust than a numbered bank account, as thousands of tax scofflaw Americans have discovered, to their intense discomfort, in the wake of the recent UBS bank disclosure.  Although I am not sure of a hidden Treuhand's legal status in the United States, it appears to be legal in parts of Europe, and indeed is said to be a cottage industry providing large fees for the foreign attorney ""takers.""There is nothing ""fishy"" about a company doing business with its own subsidiaries, at least at first glance.  One question to be asked is whether both entities are adequately protecting the interests of their respective shareholders during the business transactions.  For instance, if a power generation company is buying natural gas from a subsidiary, the ""negotiated"" price may be such that they shareholders in the parent benefit relatively more than those in the subsidiary, or vice versa.  If that happens, there may be cause for scrutiny.However, when parts of a subsidiary are susceptible to secret control by unnamed third parties -- such as parent company executives -- there is clearly less transparency, so to speak, concerning the nature of deals  made.  Whether the Treuhand connections of Halliburton International GmbH are innocent business practices or something else is an interesting line of inquiry.  Since there is no transparency, the answer may never be known.Ms. Stark's book points out Halliburton International GmbH's mysterious buying and subsequent removal from accounts of two Russian subsidiaries and an oil services subsidiary in Kazakhstan, seemingly without reflection on the balance sheet.  She mentions that a GmbH organization, similar to a small corporation, legally  bypasses the more robust accounting checks required for larger companies.  She notes the coincidence -- or is it? -- that Iraq's tax rate for dividends was set at precisely the figure that makes dividends from that country exempt from Austrian corporate income tax.The book also describes part of the relationship between Halliburton USA and Halliburton International GmbH.  Corporate documents from Austria depict how executives appear to be involved in both enterprises.  Ms. Stark found that Halliburton International GmbH is a fully owned subsidiary of Halliburton International in Delaware, which in turn is owned by Halliburton International in Texas, which is owned by -- you guessed it -- Halliburton USA and its stockholders.Sound like ""wheels within wheels?""  It may to some, particularly when HAL is moving its headquarters to Dubai, which will put it at arms length from scrutiny by U.S. authorities.  Of course, it could all be just normal business practice, and indeed we would all be shocked, yes indeed, shocked, if it were anything else.There is a lot more in the book about HAL, as well as about hidden Treuhands.  My explanation is the tip of the iceberg, and it's a big iceberg.My own conclusion is that HAL is not transparent enough to justify an investment.  There have been too many instances in the past where companies used offshore operations, subsidiaries and affiliates for purposes of ""creative"" accounting.  The fact that HAL is linked to extremely powerful people not renowned for a ""kinder, gentler"" mentality must give one pause.  The award to HAL of sole source contracts on a vast scale is another indicator of either a) truly superb business performance, or else b) ""other.""  Given HAL's wide-reaching business opportunities, where is the shareholder value?  Although it is no surprise that oil service revenues have fallen off in the past year as part of declining economic conditions, HAL's general business outlook remains relatively stable.  Yet the share price, while sharply up from its recession low, has been languishing.In HAL's annual report for 2008, p. 44, it is stated that HAL had ""no material off balance sheet arrangements, except for operating leases.""  The vast scope of HAL's operations would imply that even ""nonmaterial"" off balance sheet arrangements apart from operating leases could still exist and be relatively large in dollar terms, but this is only conjecture.In that annual report on p. 50, it is stated that They agreed to pay the SEC $177 million in 2009, which isn't small potatoes, and makes one wonder whether the SEC ""allegations"" might have had some basis in reality.On p. 53 it is stated thatThis is ""the devil made me do it"" doublespeak, because in most businesses, the lines of contractual authority for disbursements are extremely well documented and understood by all parties.  What is equally true is that Americans are relatively naïve about the extent of ""corruption"" as a way of life overseas (and perhaps increasingly in the United States, for that matter).  Payments and kickbacks in many countries are not regarded as corruption by the population, but rather as an income supplement for people who are paid a pittance for logistical, political or economic decision making.This ""holier-than-thou"" attitude of our government vis-à-vis so-called corruption is problematic.  For instance, if someone wants a kickback on a massive contract in some country, that money can easily be couched in a contractual condition where expatriate workers are housed at a high rental rate in a compound owned by the recipient (which may indeed be built expressly for the purpose of collecting that rent and funded by required payment of the rent in advance).  In any case, HAL quite properly mentions that all it can promise is ""best efforts"" in achieving FCPA compliance.  However, the tone of the annual report appears to me to imply that HAL realizes these efforts may not always be successful.One must wonder how far HAL's ""flexibility"" goes in this area, particularly with respect to payments to hidden Treuhands, subsidiaries or other entities.  There is probably a somewhat fine line between legal payments for services rendered and illegal payments under the FCPA.  However, surely we can be confident that HAL does its utmost to ensure that there is no financial hanky panky going on anywhere, as do all U.S. multinationals -- don't they?I particularly like the statement on p. 60.  ""Internal control over financial reporting, no matter how well designed, has inherent limitations.  Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.  Further, because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting may vary over time.""  I believe real estate agents call this a ""weasel clause,"" which allows the writer to get out of contractual commitments if something comes up he doesn't like.Then the accounting firm presents its own weasel clause on p. 61, where it states that ""These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.""  Since HAL operates in dozens of countries around the world, the probability that any accounting firm could perform a comprehensive audit at the detail level for an acceptable cost would seem to be negligible.  Consequently, both management and the accounting firm artfully finesse responsibility for detecting potential wrongdoing.  I do not believe this is unique to HAL.On p. 63 I found it interesting that Operating Income Other, Net was (726) [million dollars].  That's quite a bit of ""other"" loss.In my opinion, despite its upward trend in revenues, HAL is a hold.  It also strikes me that HAL may soon enter, if they haven't already, the echelon of ""too big to fail.""  Although its downside risk appears to me to be low, its upside may be limited by hypothetical forces at play that, as in the Wizard of Oz, lie behind a curtain.I recently met the author of Hidden Treuhand in Vienna, Austria, and purchased a signed copy of the book, which I regard as a tour d'horizon of interest to all who invest in multinational firms.Disclosure: I trade oil patch stocks occasionally, but no position in HAL right now. I am currently long DIG."
102070,21989,2008-10-27T09:01:47-04:00,,"There is no doubt about it: Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) has taken a beating in the last few months. In late August this oilfield services giant traded for about $45 but due to falling oil prices and an expected fall in North American drilling demand, HAL now trades for only about $19.Now there are tons of reasons to be bearish about the oil services industry right now. The drop in crude will undoubtedly lower demand for HAL's product as oil exploration companies will spend less money on drilling. The global slowdown and OPEC's inability to stop falling oil prices are also worrisome for HAL. But I think this has all been priced into HAL and despite these risks I still see upside to old uncle HAL, especially if you have a long enough investment horizon.OverviewHalliburton is headquartered in Dubai and has operations in over 70 countries. In 2007, HAL had revenues of $15.3 billion and operating income of $3.5 billion. According to its 2007 report, the company generates 45% of its revenue (40% of its profit) from 'Drilling and Evaluation' and 55% of its revenue (60%of its profit) from 'Completion and Production'. It is also important to note that 45% of its overall revenue comes from the US.The Bullish Case for HALIt's cheap, granted for a reason, but it's still cheap. Falling oil prices, less drilling, potential terrorist threats, low capital expenditures from US oil companies, yes – But HAL is still trading for about 6.5 times next year's earnings ($18.6/$2.85).Halliburton also has $1.2 billion of credit it can draw upon until July 2012. With a ROE for 35% and a safe LTD/cap of 27%, I think HAL is in a good position to benefit from the long term growth in oil demand.  The recession will not last forever, China, India and the rest of the world are going to come back thirstier than ever for the black crack.ConclusionIn conclusion, I think HAL is a great 401(k) stock. The world is not going to stop needing new sources of oil, especially since 70% of current production comes from mature fields. I would take this drop in HAL's price and add some HAL to your portfolio at current bargain basement prices of 6.5 times next year's earnings.Disclosures: None"
184250,20568,2010-01-25T11:34:19-05:00,,"Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) -- one of the largest oilfield service providers in the world -- reported marginally better–than-anticipated fourth-quarter results, benefiting from increased activity in North America. Earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding receivable settlement charge in Venezuela, came in at 28 cents, a penny above the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Revenue & ProfitabilityOn a year-over-year basis, Halliburton’s adjusted earnings per share was down more than 46% while revenue decreased 25% to $3.7 billion, hurt by weaker drilling activity and pricing pressures in the all-important North American region to which the company is heavily exposed through its market-share-leading pressure-pumping business. During the quarter, North America accounted for approximately 39% of Halliburton’s total revenue and 21% of its operating income.Completion & Production SegmentBusiness-segment-wise, Halliburton’s Completion and Production segment revenue was almost flat sequentially but was down nearly 29% year-over-year to $1.8 billion, while its operating income was $170 million, a decrease of 29% from the previous quarter and 73% from the corresponding quarter of last year.Weakness in international activity was a drag on this segment, where operating income decreased $106 million sequentially and $121 million year-over-year, primarily due to lower activity across all product service lines in Mexico, seasonal weather in Russia and vessel activity declines in the North Sea and West Africa, as well as declines in completion tools sales in the Middle East and lower activity for production enhancement services throughout the Middle East/Asia region. This was partially offset by recovery in production enhancement services and cementing services in U.S. land.Drilling & Evaluation SegmentRevenue from Halliburton’s Drilling and Evaluation business was up 6% sequentially but down 21% year-over-year to $1.9 billion. The segment’s operating income rose 10% from the September quarter, however it fell more than 44% from the year-ago period to $312 million.Operating income in Latin America was $28 million during the quarter, down 46% from the previous quarter and 72% from the fourth quarter of 2008, mainly on the back of bad debt expense related to the accounts receivable settlement in Venezuela and lower natural gas drilling activity in Mexico. This dragged down the segment profitability from the year-ago period, partly offset by better performance in Norway and Asia. Additionally, drilling activity in the Gulf of Mexico continues to recover, reflected by the more than doubling of North American operating income from the third quarter levels.Balance SheetHalliburton’s capital expenditure in the fourth quarter was $474 million, bringing the figure for the full year 2009 to $1.9 billion. At the end of the quarter, the company had approximately $2.1 billion in cash and $4.6 billion in long-term debt (including current maturities), representing a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 34.3%.OutlookHalliburton management indicated that North America margins had bottomed in most basins during the third quarter and now appears to be poised for a rebound. The world's second-largest oilfield services company after Schlumberger Limited (NYSE:SLB) sees 2010 as a transition year in which the industry looks to balance supply growth with recovering hydrocarbon demand.We currently rate Halliburton shares as Neutral."

132911,20612,2009-04-24T05:26:17-04:00,,"By Julian MurdochLogic says that when oil prices are high, oil exploration occurs at a rapid pace, with both small wildcatters and Big Oil motivated to find new supply as fast as possible. But when oil prices are low, some exploration still needs to happen if the industry is going to survive. It takes years to take an oil well from the exploration stage to production stage, and new supply will always be needed eventually, as oil fields age and their productivity slows.So how much exploration are we seeing? Less than you might expect, given the prices we saw last summer. Oil Exploration For DummiesBefore the first drop of oil comes out of a well, even before a drill bit touches the ground, thousands of man hours have gone into a project that has at best a 1 in 3 chance of resulting in actually finding any oil, and only a 1 in 6 chance of finding something that could be considered commercial.The process starts with geologists conducting surface surveys. From there, geophysical surveys are done (think seismograph machines and explosive shock waves for underground mapping) to pinpoint prospective areas for drilling. Those two sentences are big line-items on the budgets of Big Oil, and it's no accident that fundamentally all of the world's nonacademic geologists work in the oil & gas business.Once likely areas are identified, drilling teams are called out and the real fun begins. Most wells that are drilled come up dry – not a drop of hydrocarbon to be found. But just because well A is a dry hole, doesn't mean that well B a mile away will be, so a number of test wells are drilled before a target area is declared a bust. If oil is found, the oil well is either capped (to be completed later) or upgraded to a fully functional well, and the team moves on.Because drilling activity is the only tangible way to measure exploration activities (beyond press releases and TV commercials), the most commonly used way to measure what's actually happening is to look at weekly drill statistics. Here's a handy chart from our friends at the U.S. Energy Information Administration (NYSEMKT:EIA).It puts into graphic relief the statistics that the American Petroleum Institute released last week – which aren't encouraging. According to the API, 11,071 wells were drilled in the U.S. during 1Q 09. That seems like a large number, but it is down 22% from the same quarter last year, and down 35% from last quarter (4Q 08). That number includes oil and natural gas wells and all the dry holes that were drilled during oil & gas exploration. Hazem Arafa, director of the statistics department at API, said in the press release: Apparently, some of those choices include reducing exploration. Mr. Arafa goes on to note: If you look at a chart of all the active oil rigs around the world, not just the U.S., you see the same kind of drop-off. It's obviously a global phenomenon, and the U.S. may actually be in better shape than other parts of the world. In a recent Investors Chronicle article, research by Deloitte was cited that reported that the number of exploration wells in the North Sea dropped 78% in 1Q 09 compared with 1Q 08. Derek Henderson, a Deloitte senior partner, stated: But there are places that are seeing increased activity. For example, on the Norwegian continental shelf, which includes part of the North Sea, the Norwegian Sea and the Barents Sea, exploration continues. In the first quarter of 2009, a whopping 16 wells have been drilled for exploration purposes – 13 of them in the North Sea area. In 2008 there were 52 wells drilled off the coast of Norway, and if drilling continues at pace, some 60 holes will be drilled this year, mostly in the North Sea. The most active explorer in the area at this point is StatoilHydro, a Norwegian oil company, which has drilled 12 of the 16 wells.Right now, the market is much more concerned with inventory levels in the U.S. and demand trends than the number of exploratory wells being drilled. And given that U.S. oil inventories rose higher than expected (again) on Wednesday, it makes a lot of sense. But at some point, if exploration continues to decline, the industry, and the energy market, is going to have to pay the piper.But until that happens, the reduction in exploration impacts primarily one industry: oil services and drilling companies.Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) is one such company, and they're keenly aware of what's going on in exploration. And the picture they paint is interesting. It's not that no wells are being drilled at all, it's that they're being ""banked"" in a sense. They're being partially drilled, then mothballed, ready for completion as soon as there's money to be made.In the transcript of Halliburton's Q1 2009 conference call (supplied by Seeking Alpha), CEO David Lesar said the following: Executive VP Tim Probert went on to say later in the call:Halliburton paints as rosy a picture as it can, of course, but they did take a hit on the reduced rig count, which led to its operating margin dropping from 21% to below 16%, and although it managed to beat analysts' expectations on earnings, the 42 cents a share is 40% lower than earnings this time last year.So bottom line – short term, the market is well-supplied with oil and gas, and for now, the effect of reduced exploration is a ways off. If oil prices remain low, we may see a serious consequence of less investing in exploration, and weaker oil services companies may be hit hardest. Once oil prices stabilize and begin to edge upward again, investment in exploration will pick up again, and if you believe Halliburton, might be able to restart much more quickly than a reduced rig count suggests.Just when that will be? Just yesterday the Oil & Gas Journal published data from Douglas-Westwood Ltd. and Energyfiles prognosticating that very thing. Look for spending on drilling to be up 32% by 2013."

78173,21312,2008-05-21T02:43:51-04:00,,"UK-based oilfield service provider Expro International Group [EXR.L] appears officially “in play”. Candover Investments [CDI.L] and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) kicked things off last month with a £1.6bn (~ $3.2 billion) cash offer for the fast-growing provider of flow assurance equipment and wellsite services. The offer represents a 50%+ premium to Expro’s stock price prior to management’s indication that an offer had been made for the company. But before the ink could dry on the news of the offer by Candover / GS, Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) announced it was in talks to purchase the company as well, presumably at some premium to the price offered by Candover / GS. From what we glean, Halliburton is still kicking the tires and / or in the process of preparing its own bid.Which suitor wins out could hold material implications for Expro customers. Why? Candover / GS would be a financial (i.e., presumably shorter-term) owner, while Halliburton would have more of a long-term strategic interest in the company. To more fully understand why this is important, one has only to hearken back to Candover’s 2004 purchase of Vetco International from ABB Oil & Gas, an acquisition that included wellsite equipment maker Vetco Gray. While Candover, along with partner JP Morgan (NYSE:JPM), turned a tidy profit in the three years in which it owned Vetco Gray (Vetco Gray was sold to GE in 2007 for almost $2 billion), EnergyPoint’s data suggest customers’ satisfaction with Vetco Gray’s performance fell meaningfully during the time the company was owned by Candover.It’s not unreasonable to suggest history could repeat itself in the case of Expro. Candover / GS, in an effort to maximize cash flow, would seem more inclined to limit Expro investments to initiatives offering only the highest returns and the quickest paybacks. Such is the modus operandi of many financial buyers. The firm might even roll back investments and initiatives that current Expro management has in place to enhance operational performance -- initiatives we view as duly warranted. In the end, while Candover / GS might spin more gold for themselves and their investors out of an acquisition of Expro, Halliburton seems better positioned to make Expro shine for customers. Regardless of which suitor triumphs, the victor will inherit a fast-growing supplier with plenty of opportunities for improvement.Disclosure: none"
62240,21312,2008-01-30T06:57:28-05:00,,"To even the sharpest-eyed observers, progress at today’s largest corporations can sometimes prove frustratingly imperceptible. Accordingly, one could be forgiven for viewing Halliburton’s (NYSE:HAL) fourth quarter 2007 earnings as falling somewhere between average and middle-of-the-road. However, if you look at the larger picture and at the right data, there’s evidence that more progress than meets the eye might be underway at the global oilfield giant. With the spin-off of KBR and its nagging asbestos affair now firmly in the rearview mirror, the company seems to have a little more bounce in its step these days. Certainly, its decision to relocate its CEO to Dubai signals a fresh willingness to compete head on with archrival Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) for lucrative business in the promising Eastern Hemisphere.   But the real key to understanding the improved competitiveness we see at Halliburton lies in the gains the company is enjoying with customers. Since 2004, Halliburton’s customer satisfaction ratings, as measured by EnergyPoint’s annual independent surveys, have suggested the company is not only holding its own in the minds of customers, it’s now gaining some valuable ground when compared to key rivals. For example, in our most recent survey, respondents utilizing both Halliburton and Schlumberger’s drilling and wellsite products rated Halliburton higher overall, both from the standpoint of satisfaction and in terms of their willingness to recommend the company to others. This compares to only a few years ago when such direct comparisons showed little in the way of differences in these two areas. So what’s specifically driving Halliburton’s improved competitiveness? While it’s true that differences in the two companies’ pricing produced the highest gaps, Halliburton also outperformed when it came to product availability and delivery, as well as in the categories of downhole completion equipment and oilfield fluids and chemicals. For its part, Schlumberger stood out in terms of the technical soundness and sophistication of its products, along with the depth and breadth of its offerings. Nevertheless, on balance, Halliburton appears to hold the momentum as it emerges as an increasingly viable alternative to Schlumberger in many areas. And who knows, if trends continue, we might even see that bounce in Halliburton’s step replaced by some good old-fashioned swagger."

Dubai is pro free markets and is rapidly becoming a booming area for Western businesses to take interest in. In terms of oil, Dubai is a prime location that can also offer substantial corporate tax savings for businesses. Let’s take a look at a few of the pros and cons of this move and recap some of the key points that Jim Cramer said on Mad Money and key points made by Eric Bolling and Tim Strazzini made on CNBC’s Fast Money show (both shows aired on 3-12-07). Pros: Cons:   Jim Cramer’s Thoughts on Mad Money On the first half of Mad Money, Jim Cramer provided his viewers with his top five oil services stocks. He ranked Halliburton as his #2 oil services stock and commented that Halliburton is steadily losing business to rival Schlumberger. Jim feels that the move to Dubai is part of the solution that can help Halliburton gain back that business and possibly help Halliburton lose its image as a “tool of the Bush regime”.   Eric Bolling’s and Tim Strazzini’s Thoughts on Fast Money Eric Bolling called Halliburton’s move to Dubai simply “a great move” and a “great place to be”. Tim Strazzini described the move as putting Halliburton in the “primary theatre of the entire product” and a “move into the hub for the entire world”. Strazzini commented that some of Halliburton’s biggest customers are located in Dubai’s region. Critics will be out in full force describing Halliburton’s move to Dubai as un-American, tax evasive, or an avoidance of regulatory investigations. However, when you put the comments made by Jim Cramer, Eric Bolling and Tim Strazzini together I think you get the true story. Halliburton’s move to Dubai is about remaining a competitive force in the oil services industry and possibly gaining an edge over its closest competitors. I believe CEO David Lesar is doing what is right for the long term prospects of the company and he is doing what is right in trying to improve shareholder value. Halliburton's growth is coming from international markets and focusing on the Middle East will be critical for Halliburton's long term success. In my opinion, this is a move that just makes sense.

14940,20139,2006-08-03T07:20:49-04:00,,"Former President Dwight D. Eisenhower warned of the irresponsible power of the military-industrial complex in his Farewell Address to the Nation on January 17, 1961. Historians consistently rank Eisenhower among our top 10 presidents—and we “Like Ike"", too! The prescience in Eisenhower’s warning could not be better articulated than looking at Halliburton Company’s (NYSE:HAL) 2Q:06 filing with the SEC last week. Oil services giant Halliburton is making money on more than drill bits and cement. Halliburton is the largest private contractor in Iraq. The Company’s Government and Infrastructure segment provides support services to military and civilian branches of governments throughout the world. The Government and Infrastructure segment's most significant contract [surprise!] is the worldwide United States Army logistics contract, known as LogCAP (Logistics Civil Augmentation Program). The LogCap contract that provides logistic support to our troops is the most recent of three mega-contracts awarded to the Company. First, there was the original $2.4 billion “Restore Iraqi Oil” [RIO] contract, which the Company received in secret without competitive bidding in March 2003; followed by the $1.2 billion RIO-2 contract, which was awarded to the Company, in January 2004, to continue with the restoration and servicing of the oilfields in Southern Iraq. Additionally, the Company is helping to rebuild the oilfields in Southern Iraq, with contracts like PCO Oil South (Project and Contracting Office, a Defense Department agency brought in to oversee the “RIO-2” construction after allegations of “significant deficiencies” in Halliburton’s cost-estimating systems for prior billed work). In his July 1970, chart-topping Vietnam War protest song, “War,” Edwin Starr wrote: ""War! What is it good for? Absolutely nothing….” Sadly, war is good for profits. From the rebuilding of the Balkans in the mid-1990s to the Middle East today, war has been good for Halliburton. For the first six months of FY 2006, Iraq-related work contributed approximately 22.4%, or $2.4 billion to consolidated revenue of $10.7 billion and $74 million to consolidated operating income of $1.47 billion. Top-line contributions from the United States Government, resulting primarily from work performed in the Middle East, represented approximately 31%, or $6.5 billion, of consolidated revenue of approximately $21.0 billion in FY 2005. Iraq-related income totaled $175 million, primarily due to income from the award fees on definitive LogCAP task orders, settlement of ‘Dining Facility’ Contract [DFAC] problems, and other issues. [Ed. note. In an earlier draft of his Farewell Address, President Eisenhower had originally called the cozy, cooperative relationship between defense contractors and the Government, the “military-industrial-congressional-complex”. Readers ought to take note that we have made it almost through this posting without mentioning Vice-President Cheney, Halliburton , and White-House secret deals, in the same paragraph.]    Investment Analysis Albeit doubtful that Halliburton will be found in the portfolio of any “socially responsible” mutual fund (such as Domini Social Investments), the 10Q Detective believes that the stock holds investment merit at its current price: HAL 1-yr chart:"
29452,20099,2007-03-13T10:18:23-04:00,,"Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) has created a PR storm that few comprehend. The official spin is that they are moving something called headquarters to be closer to the market, which they perceive to be the Middle East. Most generals do not place their headquarters in the middle of the battlefield. Many global companies operate around the world and do not locate head offices in a major market. The geo-political perspective will provide more insight than the straight financial perspective. Most observers cannot figure the Middle East out. By embedding your head office in a more politically complicated environment, you are not providing more clarity for investors. The move has disturbed the American political scene unnecessarily. Many claim Halliburton is becoming a tax refugee. By moving outside of the U.S., Halliburton will be able to avoid political and regulatory scrutiny. Oil exploration requires close involvement with dictators and other corrupt elements. It makes for good headlines, but we want our gas station full of gas for our convenience. International banks have long engaged in jurisdiction shopping as they sought out tax effectiveness and secrecy laws to their liking. But banks are intermediaries and act on behalf of clients. Halliburton is a direct participant and gets its hands dirty. Methinks somewhere there is a contract/deal/venture that is so juicy that Halliburton is prepared to take the political heat in America. You would not do this just to get a few rigs into place. The move is entirely customer-centric. Disclosure of all varieties financial and political will be more obscured. Therefore the beta has increased dramatically. Many investors may find the newly increased risk reward unpalatable. Approximately 657 institutions and mutual funds now hold 82% of shares. Markets dislike uncertainty and will act accordingly.    Related: Why Halliburton's Move to Dubai Makes Cents HAL 1-yr chart"

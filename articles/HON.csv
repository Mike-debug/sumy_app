This is concerning as society tries to get back to normal and open schools, stores and restaurants.Honeywell has produced its Healthy Buildings solutions to help manage virus outbreaks within an enclosed space.Two microcap companies named Kontrol Energy and Manganese X are also developing their own solutions for detecting and cleansing COVID-19.","Much of the focus of traders and investors with respect to managing the COVID-19 pandemic has been on developing a vaccine, testing, hand hygiene, personal protective equipment and contact tracing. But one area that I believe might be relatively overlooked is building management. The Centers for Disease Control revised its COVID-19 guidelines earlier this month. The CDC has announced that the virus “can linger in the air for minutes to hours and travel farther than six feet"". This poses serious issues for containing the virus, particularly as society tries to get back to normal with schools, retail outlets and bars and restaurants opening up. This also presents an opportunity for companies that are developing HVAC COVID management solutions.Honeywell International Inc. (HON) recognized this problem and opportunity months ago, launching its Healthy Buildings solutions in May. The company is able to combine its air quality, safety and security products with advanced analytics in order to provide building managers with personalized service to monitor for and minimize any potential virus outbreak. The stock has underperformed the market since the virus outbreak despite the launch of this solution and its heavy involvement in distributing PPE. So investors who are looking for an under-the-radar stock that has benefited from the coronavirus economy might have one in HON.Data by YChartsHoneywell's opportunity is enormous and varied, as evidenced by a recently announced collaboration with the Carolina Panthers NFL team to manage the safe return of fans back to the team's home stadium. The Healthy Buildings solutions will continuously monitor the air quality within Bank Of America Stadium and Honeywell will provide fans with Panthers-branded hygiene and protective gear such as masks, hand gel and cleaning wipes. Given the resistance of some people in the United States to obeying safety protocols which has led to further spread of the virus, the branded gear might help to encourage proper use.Once the threat of COVID-19 subsides, the Honeywell solution can morph into an IoT building management service. In addition to monitoring for the virus, it will identify and correct building controls issues such as carbon dioxide levels, temperature and humidity. The Healthy Buildings dashboard can manage aspects of building management like fan capacity and cleaning tracking. This can lead to cost savings and service improvements as resources and employees such as janitors can be more timely and efficiently deployed. The virus acts like a door-opener for Honeywell's building management solutions that could lead to permanent new business that might otherwise have been a harder sell without the immediate urgency.While Honeywell will be a major benefactor in this sector, there are smaller companies that offer a more ""pure play"" speculative upside approach to COVID building management than a $100 billion company.Kontrol Energy Corp. (OTCQB:KNRLF) (KNR.C) recently created what it calls BioCloud technology in order to manage the pandemic. This wall-mounted unit detects the presence of COVID-19 in the air and triggers an alert system to warn building managers so moves can be made to control an outbreak before it occurs.Last month, the company was featured in an article by the CBC (Canada's government-owned national news media outlet), causing the stock to more than double in price after it already had a good run. It currently has a market cap of approximately $110 million. The immediate target market will be schools, hospitals, long-term care homes and mass transit. The company estimates a $12,000 price tag for each unit and says it has secured the manufacturing capacity to produce up to 20,000 units per month. The technology was independently tested so the next step would be securing contracts.In addition to BioCloud, the company recently procured a new order for its SmartSuite® smart building technology across four apartment buildings located in Ontario, Canada. So much like how Honeywell is able to leverage its virus management solutions into an IoT building management contract, Kontrol may be able to do the same thing on a smaller scale.While Kontrol has developed a virus tracker and early warning system, Manganese X Energy Corp. (OTCPK:MNXXF) (MN.V) is looking to go one step further and outright kill the virus once detected in a building. Earlier this month, its subsidiary Disruptive Battery Corp. signed an MOU with PureBiotics to acquire a significant equity share of up to 50% in a PureBiotics Environmental Air Quality Control Company. Even though it's still in the MOU phase, PureBiotics' CEO Lino Morris recently joined the company's Advisory Board.The two companies are combining forces to develop a product that will circulate air disinfection agents through a building's HVAC distribution system. It leverages Manganese X's patented disinfection apparatus system with PureBiotics' existing product lines and technologies in order to cleanse buildings of COVID-19 and any other pathogens. Lino Morris has over 40 years experience in the pharmaceutical industry. That experience will come in handy as he will be the one spearheading additional testing and validation of the product. He is reaching out to universities to test the air quality control delivery system. Just like Kontrol, Manganese X wants that third party validation of its product.Manganese X sits at around a $25 million market cap, a fraction of Kontrol's valuation as the additional hurdle of validation needs to take place. If validation is successful, Kontrol represents a demonstrated upside for Manganese X shareholders. The stock has already moved up healthily over summer prices and has experienced volatility recently. Hype over Tesla's (TSLA) recent inclusion of Manganese in its battery and desire to source battery materials is the primary reason for the increase. Manganese X owns the Battery Hill Manganese project situated just north of the U.S. border in New Brunswick. I briefly outlined it and the company's familial connection to Tesla in a previous article. Manganese X shareholders have a reduced risk from diversification built in due to these two disparate lines of business. Should one not pan out, that has absolutely no impact on the probability of success for the other.Without getting too heavily into speculation, assuming that both solutions from Kontrol and Manganese X progress as hoped, it would make a lot of sense for a building manager to have both products on hand. BioCloud to detect COVID-19 and the Manganese X solution to cleanse the virus through the HVAC system.While Honeywell offers a virus building management play for conservative investors, these type of small cap companies are more attractive to risk-tolerant small cap investors such as myself. Both Kontrol and Manganese X have moved up a lot in the past few months, so speculative investors are no longer ""buying low"" and have to be prepared for volatility. Early stage investors who are in at lower prices might choose to take their profits along the way. But based on Kontrol's market cap of approximately $110 million and Manganese X's market cap of approximately $25 million, they leave a lot of room for upside. I will continue to monitor the small cap sector for indoor virus management opportunities such as Kontrol Energy and Manganese X."

Sell the stock.","Source: ForbesThe coronavirus pandemic led to shelter-in-place policies and practically shut down business activity. That particularly hurt the industrial businesses of Honeywell International (HON). Consumer spending declined and global travel demand fell hard, leading to a global recession. U.S. Q2 GDP fell over 30%. In Q2 Honeywell reported revenue of $7.5 billion, down 19% Y/Y. Each of the company's key product segments experienced declines.Aerospace revenue fell 28% Y/Y as global travel demand was in free fall. Within the Aerospace segment, commercial aviation and aftermarket sales fell 39% and 54%, respectively. Defense and space revenue actually grew 7%. Global passenger demand fell over 90% shortly after the pandemic materialized. Moody's does not expect passenger demand to recover to pre-pandemic levels for a few years. This will likely create more headwinds for Aerospace, which was 34% of total revenue, down from 38% in the year-earlier period.Each of the company's other product segments also experienced revenue declines. Of note is that Performance Materials and Technologies (30% of total revenue) has customers that operate in the oil and gas industry. Demand destruction amid the pandemic caused oil prices to plummet in February and March. Supply cuts have driven Brent oil into the $42 range, which may not be robust enough to spur more E&P. Schlumberger (SLB) recently rang the alarm on North America E&P; it announced (1) a major restructuring to wring out costs and (2) the sale of its hydraulic fracking business, reducing exposure to North America. Along with Aerospace, I expect Honeywell's Performance Materials and Technologies division to face serious headwinds going forward.The decline in scale was bound to hurt margins. Aerospace previously had the healthiest segment profit margins. In Q2 2019, Aerospace had segment profit margins of 26%; they fell to 21% in Q2 2020. This compared favorably to Honeywell's blended segment profit margins of 19% in Q2 2020. That is a long-winded way of saying that as Aerospace declines, its falling margins have an out-sized impact on the company's blended margins.Honeywell reported gross margin during the quarter of 29%, down 500 basis points versus the year-earlier period. Gross profit on a dollar basis was $2.2 billion, down 30% Y/Y. SG&A costs were $1.2 billion, down 15% Y/Y. SG&A as a percentage of revenue was 16%, up 100 basis points versus the year earlier period. The fallout was that EBITDA of $1.3 billion fell 38% Y/Y. EBITDA margin declined 500 basis points to 17%.Cost takeouts helped keep margins from falling further:Management could potentially wring more costs out of the business in its phase 2 plan. However, if revenue continues to fall, margins could become depressed regardless of management actions. Until the economy fully reopens, I expect revenue and margins to continue to contract.Honeywell's operations are highly-tethered to the global economy. The economy was facing headwinds last year as the U.S. and China were locked in a trade war. Prior to that, economic expansion was getting long in the tooth. The economy should improve once a vaccine for the coronavirus is discovered. However, I believe the global economy is headed for a fall over the long term. That does not bode well for Honeywell or other industrial businesses.Honeywell has a solid balance sheet with about $15 billion in cash and securities. It generated about $2.1 billion of free cash flow (""FCF) through the first half of the year. This portends that liquidity should improve. HON has an enterprise value of $120 billion and trades at 16.8x last 12 months (""LTM"") EBITDA. The stock has benefited from the melt-up in broader markets, yet the valuation likely does not reflect headwinds faced by Honeywell or the global economy.HON is down less than 5% Y/Y, yet the stock is overvalued. Sell HON."
4370558,65113,2020-08-25T05:07:19-04:00,"Honeywell International has understandably taken an earnings hit as a result of COVID-19.However, the Aerospace and Honeywell Building Technologies segments are showing signs of solid recovery.I take a bullish view on Honeywell at this point in time.","Back in May, I made the argument that while Honeywell International (HON) had been showing strong earnings performance up until that point, the outlook for Aerospace and Building Technologies remained quite volatile given the situation surrounding COVID-19.With that being said, the stock has continued to see a healthy climb in the past couple of months:Source: investing.comSome shared my view regarding Honeywell's growing exposure to aerospace in my previous article, with one reader commenting:Source: Previous Comment on Seeking AlphaAs expected, Q2 saw significant downward pressure on earnings and free cash flow as a result:Source: Honeywell Second Quarter 2020 Earnings ReleaseWhen analysing segment performance in more detail - we observe that the Aerospace segment saw a 27% organic decline in sales, compared to a 17% decline for Honeywell Building Technologies and Performance Materials and Technologies. On the whole, the decline due to COVID-19 appears to have been broad across all segments:Source: Honeywell Second Quarter 2020 Earnings ReleaseSegment margin for Aerospace contracted 510 basis points to 20.8% in the latest second quarter, but Honeywell saw continued strength in U.S. defense and space. Moreover, while commercial air passenger numbers still remain well below numbers pre-COVID-19 - there is reason to be more optimistic about the future of the industry.Specifically, the market for domestic flights appears to be making a stronger comeback than that of international flights. In particular, the U.S. and China account for a much higher share of domestic flights than Europe, for instance.As a result, I anticipate that this recovery in the domestic flight market will help in mitigating the broader losses that we have been seeing across the airline industry more broadly. As of July, 59% of the world's global fleet were back in service - and as a result I expect that we will start to see improvement in margin performance for the Aerospace sector in the next quarter.Concerning Honeywell Building Technologies, the effects of lockdown measures to combat COVID-19 has understandably had an impact on global mobility, and hence demand for such technologies.However, Honeywell is taking a leading role in allowing organizations to ensure building safety from a health perspective. Specifically, Honeywell's Healthy Buildings Solutions was launched to allow owners to use advanced analytics tools to assess metrics such as air and sanitation quality, as well as smart monitoring to allow for effective social distancing measures in addition to using pressure control for isolating parts of a building to stop the spread of infection. As sanitization has become an increased priority for commercial buildings that necessarily handle large numbers of people (e.g. airports, schools, corporate offices, hospitals, etc.), there will necessarily be increased demand for use of intelligent systems to promote sanitization. In this regard, I also anticipate that Honeywell will have seen a significant boost in demand across this segment by the end of this year.Ultimately, Honeywell International has recognised that demand across its product segments will have changed post COVID-19, and are taking the necessary steps to align its business model with the ""new normal."" For this reason, I anticipate that the company will continue to make a strong recovery going forward.From a financial standpoint, Honeywell International would appear to be fairly valued from an earnings perspective, and potentially undervalued from a free cash flow perspective.EarningsSource: YChartsFree Cash FlowSource: YChartsWe can see that EV/EBITDA remains just below levels seen back in 2018. While EBITDA per share has shown a drop in the most recent quarter, it still remains significantly higher than levels seen pre-2018. Should we see a solid recovery in Aerospace and Honeywell Building Technologies going forward, then I anticipate a strong recovery in EBITDA accordingly.Concerning free cash flow, we see that price to free cash flow still remains significantly below that seen at the beginning of 2020 - indicating that the stock is more attractively valued on this metric.We observe that the company has had to take on more debt to get through the pandemic, as evidenced by a significant rise in the debt to equity ratio.Source: YChartsHowever, with adjusted free cash flow conversion having come in at 140% for Q2 2020 (up from 100% in Q2 2019), the company is still demonstrating strong cash flow management, and for this reason the rise in debt is not particularly concerning.To conclude, I am more optimistic on Honeywell International than previously, as the company appears to have shown resiliency to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. I anticipate that earnings will continue to rebound from here."
4375026,104254,2020-09-17T18:18:41-04:00,"Honeywell is a great industrial company which is working through an interesting strategic transition to become a software-focused industrial company.This wide-moat company has rebooted by spinning off three low-growth/low-margin businesses over the last couple of years.Near term, the financial performance will be impacted by the global recession, but management's strategy should lead to above GDP growth and increasing margins.Although currently expensive, the opportunity to buy at lower prices should inevitably come if the market corrects.","Honeywell International Inc. (NYSE:HON) is a US-based diversified technology and manufacturing company. Honeywell produces a range of hardware and software products to serve a global customer base.The company was formed after a merger in the 1920s and is named after one of the founding shareholders (who was an engineer) when it manufactured temperature control systems. The company made many acquisitions over the years before it was itself acquired by Allied Signal in 1999. Unusually, due to the strength of the acquired brand, Allied Signal renamed itself as Honeywell.Honeywell continues to reinvent itself as it seeks to focus on the growing segments of its target industries. Over the last three years, it has de-merged (spun off) three listed companies, which today are collectively capitalized at $2,616 M. Honeywell is attempting to become a software-focused industrial company as it tries to become less reliant on traditional hardware solutions.Honeywell’s key strength is the output of its Research and Development (R&D) process. Around $1,600 M is expensed in R&D every year. Since 2007, the company has invested almost as much in R&D as it has in capex and acquisitions. Over the same period, the company has reinvested 44% of its adjusted operating cash flows back into the business.Honeywell is one of the last remaining large diversified manufacturing companies in the world (along with 3M (NYSE:MMM), DuPont (NYSE:DD), and Emerson Electric (NYSE:EMR)). These companies are all mature and are attempting to keep some growth in their businesses as they try to avoid sliding into decline.Honeywell is organized into 4 market-based divisions. In 2019, the divisional revenue splits were:Source: Author’s compilation using Honeywell’s 10-K.Aerospace DivisionAerospace is Honeywell’s biggest division. There are 3 revenue streams in this division:Aerospace employs over 27,000 people of which 12,000 are engineers and software programmers. The company claims that the Aerospace division has over 10,000 active patents, clearly demonstrating the organization’s technical capability.The Aerospace division’s diverse product capability is highlighted in the following table:Source: Honeywell presentation.The financial performance of the Aerospace division has been impressive:Source: Author’s compilation using data from Honeywell’s 10-K’s.Although Aerospace’s revenues had been flat for many years (until recently), the division has done an excellent job in driving margins significantly higher over time. COVID-19 has been particularly impactful on the Aerospace division, and 2020 revenues and margins will be dramatically lower.Safety and Productivity Division (SPS)The SPS division has two broad revenue streams:Safety products include personal protection equipment, apparel, gear, footwear, gas detection equipment and cloud-based notification and emergency messaging.Productivity Solutions include mobile industrial computers, warehousing automation equipment, in-field sensors for collecting data and managing process control as well as asset management systems.The breakdown of SPS revenues by product group and by industry vertical is shown in the following slide:Source: Honeywell Presentation September 2020.SPS has near-term tailwinds for several lines due to COVID-19. The company manufactures N95 masks and has expanded capacity by over 2,500% to meet demand. Similarly, warehousing automation is in high demand as many companies are implementing a direct fulfillment capability due to the temporary service interruptions (closure) of many retail outlets.The long-term financial performance of SPS is shown in the following chart:Source: Author’s compilation using data from Honeywell’s 10-K disclosures.The chart shows that, whilst Safety revenues have been reasonably flat, the Productivity revenues have been growing nicely. At the same time, SPS margins have been rising.The SPS division is thought to have the most growth potential within Honeywell, particularly the warehouse automation component. Sales have traditionally been mainly in the US, but there are evidently significant opportunities to expand internationally.The margin expansion is sustainable as SPS historically has an extremely high proportion of hardware sales, and the majority of future growth is expected to come from higher margin services.Building Technologies Division (HBT)HBT’s revenues have shrunk because of the demerger of Resideo (NYSE:REZI). HBT’s focus is now on the corporate, government, and infrastructure building markets.HBT’s systems offerings include advanced software applications for building control and optimization, sensors, switches, control systems and instruments for energy management, access control, video surveillance, fire products, remote patient monitoring systems and project management.HBT’s addressable market is shown in the following table:Source: Honeywell presentation.Clearly, these markets are quite fragmented. HBT’s sales mix has been shifting over time – it is currently 20% projects, 25% software/services and 55% hardware.A chart of HBT’s historical financial performance is shown below:Source: Author’s compilation using data from Honeywell’s 10-K disclosures.Honeywell claims that HBT’s software and services revenues are growing significantly faster than hardware which should result in margin expansion continuing.Performance Materials & Technologies Division (PMT)There are 3 revenue streams in the PMT division:PMT is a mix of three businesses – process solutions (develops industrial software control systems), advanced materials (manufactures fluorine products, chemicals and polymers) and Universal Oil Products (manufactures catalysts and absorbents for the oil and gas sector).PMT’s sector breakdown is shown in the following chart:Source: Honeywell presentation.PMT’s recent growth has been driven by the process solutions business as shown in the chart below:Source: Author’s compilation using data from Honeywell’s 10-K disclosures.The process solutions business has driven revenue growth and margin expansion over the last few years, whilst the two other businesses have been relatively flat.Professor Damodaran (NYU Stern) makes some interesting observations about the life cycle of a typical company. He has a six-stage model, from startup to decline, which all companies move through over their life cycle:Source: Aswath Damodaran NYU – The Corporate Life Cycle.Honeywell is fighting to stay in stage 4 (Mature Growth) and avoid moving into stage 5 (Mature Stable). In the mature growth stage, a company continues to grow at GDP or higher, whilst at the same time, its margins strengthen and rise.Honeywell’s strategy is a classic stage 4 approach:Over the last four years, Honeywell has simplified its corporate structure and streamlined its target markets by spinning off three divisions:Due to the market disruptions caused by COVID-19, it is too early to tell whether these actions will generate higher than GDP growth in revenues. We have certainly seen improvements in operating margins.A company the size of Honeywell is constantly restructuring – this is demonstrated by the extraordinary costs incurred every year:Source: Author’s compilation from Honeywell’s 10-K disclosures.Given the regularity of these expenses, they should NOT be classified as extraordinary, and therefore, they should be included in the underlying operating expenses of the company. This lowers the underlying operating margin by about 0.5%. This point will be picked up later when we move onto the valuation.There are some long-term issues which are a drag on Honeywell’s valuation. Honeywell has three significant and high-profile legacy issues which take some gloss from the company.Honeywell is financially responsible for the resolution of:I will attempt to determine a “ball-park” financial estimate for each issue.Environmental LiabilitiesHoneywell, for many years, has been funding site environmental remediation generally linked to legacy businesses (many of which are no longer operated). The company has been funding the remediation expenses through operational cash flows.Although the ultimate liability remains with Honeywell, many of these businesses now belong to Resideo. When Resideo was spun off, it signed an agreement with Honeywell to reimburse Honeywell for 90% of its remediation expenses up to a maximum of $140 M per year until 2043.Honeywell’s net remediation expenses for the last 6 years have been:Source: Author’s compilation from Honeywell’s 10-K disclosures.Honeywell has a provision on its Balance Sheet for accrued environmental liabilities of $709 M.As can be seen in the table, the Resideo agreement has recently lowered Honeywell’s net environmental payments. In 2019, the net payment dropped to $59 M where the average net payment had been $258 M per year for the pre-spin years.If Resideo remains solvent, then Honeywell’s accrued liability appears to be a reasonable estimate of what it might pay out. Obviously, if Resideo was to become insolvent, then Honeywell would be responsible for the entire rectification costs.There are clearly several unknowns associated with this estimate (the average net payment and for how many years will the payments continue). For valuation purposes, I am prepared to go with Honeywell’s estimate for this liability. At $709 M, the impact on the valuation is about $1 per share. Even if the estimate is understated by 100%, the impact on the valuation is not material.Asbestos LiabilitiesHoneywell’s asbestos liabilities are generated from two formerly owned businesses:NARCO was owned by Allied Signal until 1986. Due to the post-sale bankruptcy of NARCO, the asbestos liabilities have remained with Allied Signal (now Honeywell). The NARCO asbestos liability resides within a complex trust arrangement which Honeywell is obligated to fund to a maximum of $145 M per year until all the claims are resolved.Honeywell’s NARCO payments net of insurance recoveries for the last 6 years have been:Source: Author’s compilation using data from Honeywell’s 10-K disclosures.Honeywell has a provision on its Balance Sheet for NARCO liabilities of $858 M. Similarly, it has an asset provision for Insurance Recoveries of $281 M (therefore, a net liability of $577 M).I have estimated the present value of the NARCO liability by assuming a net payment of $78 M per year (the average of the last 6 years) for the next 30 years and using a cost of capital of 6%. The present value of this annuity is $1,074 M.I think that the NARCO liability may be understated – in the valuation I will use my estimate.Bendix was a business within Honeywell’s Automotive division. It manufactured brake linings that contained encased asbestos. This business was sold in 2014, but the asbestos liability remained with Honeywell. When Garrett was “spun off”, the Bendix liability was “allocated” to Garrett (but ultimately still resides with Honeywell).To facilitate the Garrett transaction, Honeywell entered into an agreement with Garrett whereby Garrett funds 90% of Honeywell’s asbestos liability relating to Bendix. The agreement caps Garrett’s annual payment to a maximum of $175 M. The agreement terminates in 2048 or earlier depending upon the level of claims.It should be noted that Garrett has recently filed a lawsuit against the validity of this agreement, and the dispute is ongoing. Garrett has also raised concerns about its ongoing financial viability and may become insolvent.Honeywell’s Bendix payments net of insurance recoveries for the last 6 years have been:Source: Author’s compilation using data from Honeywell’s 10-K disclosures.Honeywell has a provision on its Balance Sheet for the Bendix liabilities of $1,499 M. Similarly, it has an asset provision for Insurance Recoveries of $153 M (therefore, a net liability of $1,346 M).Given the current market capitalization of Garrett (around $240 M), I think that it is unlikely that Garrett will be able to cover their contractual arrangement with Honeywell. As a result, I am assuming that the total liability will remain with Honeywell. There has been no reduction in the number of claimants coming forward over the last few years – the number is very steady. This indicates that the payments could go on for an exceptionally long time.In estimating the present value of the Bendix liability, I have used the average net payments for the last 6 years ($174 M), and I have assumed that the payments last another 50 years. With a 6% cost of capital, this annuity has a present value of $2,742 M. I think that Honeywell may be significantly understating their Bendix liability.Summary of Environmental & Asbestos LiabilitiesBased on my calculations, I estimate that the present value of the environmental and asbestos liabilities is approximately $4,500 M, which equates to about $6.50 per share in valuation terms. This amount will be subtracted from my estimate of Honeywell’s valuation.The following chart shows Honeywell’s historical revenues and operating margins:Source: Author’s compilation using Honeywell’s 10-K filings.It should be noted that I have made significant adjustments to Honeywell’s published financial information to arrive at my estimate of their operating margin. The main adjustments include:Due to the recent spin-offs, it is difficult to draw any conclusions about the trajectory for revenue growth. However, it is clear that operating margins have been quite stable over the last couple of years.It is also worth pointing out that Honeywell’s balance sheet is reasonably strong, and gearing has been declining over time. The table below shows that debt is relatively modest with the interest expense being well covered by operating earnings:Source: Author’s compilation using data from Honeywell’s 10-K filings.Honeywell’s balance sheet is also enhanced by over $15 B of cash and marketable securities which were reported at the end of the most recent quarter.My moat assessment for Honeywell is shown on the following table:Source: Author’s compilationHoneywell generates its relatively wide moat from its Research and Development investment output. The quality of the IP embedded in many of its products makes it difficult for customers to switch out of (particularly in aerospace). Honeywell’s advanced manufacturing capabilities also generate significant cost benefits.Honeywell has a well-developed moat which is being enhanced by the growing focus on services and systems (integrated software). The following chart shows how this is translated financially into returns on invested capital:Source: Author’s compilation using data from Honeywell’s 10-K filings.Honeywell has a relatively high ROIC for an industrial company. This is an old-style asset intensive industrial company with a relatively low amount of debt and significant reserves of cash.The moat is being fortified over the last 10 years as Honeywell has invested $18 B (4.7% of sales) in R&D, and 39% of its operating cash flows have been reinvested back into the business as capex and net acquisitions.I would conclude that Honeywell’s moat is relatively wide and strong for an industrial company.My approach to valuation is based on projecting a company’s future cash flows and discounting them back to the present using a discount rate, which is reflective of the risks or uncertainties associated with those cash flows.The process is summarized by this diagram courtesy of Professor Aswath Damodaran:Source: Dr Aswath Damodaran (NYU Stern).Now, keep in mind that this is my scenario for Honeywell. It is based on my best estimates of the future. I acknowledge that there will be many individuals who are better placed than I to forecast Honeywell’s future:The assumptions are then summarized into the following inputs into the valuation model:The DCF is relatively straight-forward. A Free Cash Flow to the Firm approach is used with a 3-stage model (high growth, declining growth, and maturity). The model only seeks to value the cash flows of the operating assets. The valuation has been performed in $USD.The output from my DCF model is:Source: Author’s model.I also developed a Monte Carlo simulation for the valuation based on the range of inputs for the valuation. The output of the simulation was generated after 100,000 iterations.The Monte Carlo simulation can be used to help us understand the major value drivers in the valuation. It turns out that the key value drivers for Honeywell (based on my scenario) are the operating margin estimate and the sales growth. These variables have the highest impact on the valuation and are the greatest source of risk in the valuation.Source: Author’s model.The simulation indicates that Honeywell’s intrinsic value is between $114 and $164 per share with a midpoint of $136.The operating margin spread accounts for 68% of the variation and the growth in revenues spread accounts for 24% of the variation in Honeywell’s valuation.My analysis suggests that Honeywell is currently overpriced relative to its intrinsic value. The following table highlights what are the implied estimates for the value drivers required to justify the current share price:Source: Author’s model.The table indicates that the market is currently pricing in both much higher revenue growth rates and significantly higher operating margins (current margins are 19%).Given the maturity of Honeywell’s markets, I think that it is improbable that revenue growth will be above 6%. Therefore, the current market pricing has much higher expected operating margins built in.Honeywell’s 2019 operating margins are increasing, and I believe that they can go higher, but I think that it is improbable that they can go above 22%.Source: Yahoo FinanceThe chart indicates that Honeywell periodically becomes “unloved”, and at these times, the stock can be purchased when it represents good value. Clearly, when the market bottomed in March, this was a good opportunity to buy the stock relatively cheaply.Source: MorningstarThe Morningstar table shows that Honeywell has underperformed relative to the broader market for the last 3 years (although it has been an over-performer since the COVID-19 market low). The long-term performance of the stock has been better than the market.I think that the key risks facing Honeywell are macro-economic in nature. Most of the sectors serviced by Honeywell are cyclical and dependent upon the strength of the global economy and free trade between countries.Honeywell will be impacted by how long it takes the world to recover from the COVID-19 induced recession. Similarly, any long-term disruption to supply chains caused by regional trade disputes would be harmful for the company.The final step in my process is to look at a summary of the company’s cash flows for the last 10 years:Source: Author’s compilation using data from Honeywell’s 10-K filings.The data indicates that Honeywell:For each company I value, I also assess what role this company could potentially play in my portfolio. The cornerstone of my portfolio is what I term “Tier 1” companies. These are the companies that I hold for the long term (with some trading around the edges as prices ebb and flow) and where I invest most of my cash.My high-level criteria for a company to qualify as a Tier 1 long-term investment are:Honeywell ticks quite a few of these boxes. It is a particularly good company and has been professionally managed for many years. At the right price, it deserves a place in any good portfolio.Is this the right time to buy Honeywell?No – the stock is currently trading at the upper end of my valuation. I would not be buying Honeywell at the current price.What should current holders of Honeywell be doing?Let me acknowledge that I am a shareholder of Honeywell and I have held shares for several years.Based on my valuation, I think that Honeywell is currently expensive, and at prices above the upper end of my valuation ($164), it is time to TRIM your holding and take some profits, but I would stand ready to BUY if there was a market pullback to the March lows.Final Recommendation: HOLD/TRIM"
4362864,24361,2020-07-31T10:59:02-04:00,"Honeywell saw slightly worse-than-average organic revenue erosion in Q2, due to a sharp decline in Aero, but overall performance was a little better than expected.With over 50% of revenue coming from aerospace, non-resi, and/or oil/gas end-markets, and relatively little short-cycle leverage, Honeywell is in for a tough stretch on a comp basis.Honeywell has the balance sheet flexibility to buy growth, and further consolidating the logistics/warehouse automation space would make sense.Honeywell still has appealing traits as a long-term holding, though the short-term risk/reward balance is more ""okay"" than compelling.","When I last wrote about Honeywell (HON), I said, ""I think there are better risk-adjusted opportunities"" in the industrial/multi-industrial space, and indeed there were better near-term performances from names I favored like ITT (ITT) and Johnson Controls (JCI).Even so, given how poorly Honeywell fits with most of the current ""themes"", the 12% or so move in the stock since that last piece still isn't too bad. After all, this is a company that isn't really going to benefit from onshoring, it's not really short-cycle-sensitive, and over 50% of its sales are from end-markets (aero, non-resi, oil/gas) that I believe are looking at multi-year recoveries.Valuation is still in that ""okay, but not great"" zone where I'd be happy to own it as a long-term holding, but where I'd probably try to hold out for a better entry price for a new position. Honeywell is clearly a well-run company, and its M&A optionality may be underestimated, but it is certainly facing some near-term challenges.I can't really call Honeywell's second-quarter results ""good"", particularly as the organic growth and decremental margin numbers were a bit worse than peers, but it was better than feared. Revenue beat expectations by almost 3%, while operating income beat by 7% (around $0.10/share) and segment income beat by 4% ($0.06), continuing a theme I've seen in many multi-industrials where bigger/better cuts at the corporate expense line helped pad the result.Revenue declined 18% in organic terms, the worst performance Honeywell has seen since the second quarter of 2009 (which was also down 18%). Gross margin declined almost five points (with the ""margin shock"" I expected coming through), but cost-reduction efforts limited the operating income decline to 30% (margin down 280bp) and the segment income decline to 31% (margin down 320bp).Aerospace segment revenue declined 27%, as aftermarket revenue (down 54%) largely tracked the declines in flight hours. OE revenue declined 39%, while defense revenue rose 7%. Segment profits fell 42%, with margin down 510bp.The Building Tech segment saw a 17% decline in revenue, with the company seeing some project delays and lower volumes in security, building management, and fire. I'm a little surprised here relative to the results at Halma's Infrastructure Safety business, but they're definitely consistent with Allegion (ALLE) and Johnson Controls (JCI), so Halma looks like the outlier (and the businesses are not apples-to-apples comparables). Segment profit declined 17%, with margin up 50bp.In the Safety and Productivity business, revenue rose 1%, with Safety down 7% and Productivity up 5%, helped by double-digit growth at Intelligrated. Honeywell underperformed 3M (MMM) in Safety (due, I believe, to 3M's stronger leverage to respirators), but the double-digit result at Intelligrated was strong relative to many other factory automation comps, due to the highly specific logistics/warehouse focus of the business. Segment profits rose more than 11%, with margin up 150bp.Performance Materials and Technology revenue fell 17%, with UOP declining 25% on weaker demand for gas processing and refining catalysts. Advanced Materials revenue declined 18%, and Process Solutions declined 13%, weaker than the 9% decline at ABB (ABB), but Honeywell's process automation business is more skewed to North American petrochemicals. Earnings declined 35%, with margin down 460bp.Relative to sell-side expectations, only the Building Tech business disappointed on revenue (a 5% miss), with both Aero and Safety & Productivity beating by more than 5%. At the segment level, PMT missed by $0.04/share, while the others beat by $0.01 to $0.05. Overall decremental margin was around 33%.There's really no reason to think that Aero will be meaningfully better over the next couple of quarters, and Building Tech will likewise be under pressure for the remainder of 2020. Safety and Productivity should see accelerating growth in the second half, with Intelligrated certainly helping (orders were up 300% this quarter). I expect PMT to remain quite weak (double-digit declines) through the remainder of 2020.This leaves Honeywell in a tough spot. Relative to peers like 3M, ABB, Illinois Tool Works (ITW), or Parker-Hannifin (PH), there's not much short-cycle leverage here. Likewise, Honeywell isn't going to get the boost from onshoring that companies like Rockwell (ROK) have seen (the boost being to expectations/sentiment, not results, at this point). While Honeywell does have some leverage to energy efficiency (a part of Biden's plan), that's outweighed by large exposures to weaker markets like aerospace, non-resi, and oil/gas.Longer term, I'm not worried about Honeywell. Those latter markets will eventually recover, and I think Honeywell can generate peer-or-better long-term growth. In the near term, though, it will be tougher sledding.Honeywell's balance sheet is in good shape, and management said it's open for business with respect to M&A (hiring a new executive to oversee that role) - further consolidating the logistics/warehouse automation space could be an option, as could some expansion in controls/instrumentation relating to building, factory, and process automation. Honeywell could afford to buy its way into a new vertical if it so chose, but I don't think that's a priority right now.Relative to the peer group, I've changed my estimates less for Honeywell, apart from a reduction to my 2020 FCF estimate (based on management guidance). A more robust cost-cutting program is welcome, and I think Honeywell will see its revenue start to accelerate at a point when more short-cycle-driven names are starting to decelerate (2022/2023), but the long-term outlook is still for around 3% revenue growth, with improving margins and asset efficiency pushing the FCF growth rate into the mid-teens.Whether I use discounted cash flow or margin/return-driven EV/EBITDA, Honeywell's valuation screens out as ""okay … but not compelling"". The prospective return isn't bad, but I try to shoot for better than mid-to-high single-digit prospective annual returns with new positions. While Honeywell has been left behind a bit recently (not unreasonably, though), it's still a strong company for the long-term and a name to watch if the valuation gets even more reasonable."
4361085,53552,2020-07-27T14:30:15-04:00,"Honeywell's Q2 results showed strong cost control but even larger headwinds, particularly in the aerospace unit, its largest.Given the long-term damage to the sector, it will take years for Honeywell to return to peak profitability.At 23x forward earnings, Honeywell shares offer a poor risk/reward.","Shares of Honeywell (HON) are down 14% over the past year as the industrial conglomerate manages through a severe downturn in its aerospace unit that is unlikely to reverse for some time. HON has taken strong actions to cut costs and preserve cash, and operating results in the second quarter were reasonable given the severe macro headwinds, as its diversified model provides some support. However, at $150, shares are expensive(Source: Seeking Alpha)In the second quarter (financials available here), Honeywell earned $1.26 in non-GAAP EPS, which was down 40% from last year. Organic sales were down 18% at $7.5 billion, and margins were down 280bp to 18.5% as lower revenue led to negative operating leverage, given some fixed costs for a manufacturing firm. Still, these results were $0.02 ahead of consensus while revenue was $200 million ahead.As you can see below, the company faced broad-based weakness. Aerospace, its largest segment, saw sales down 27%, despite strength in defense. Given the financial devastation facing airlines, Boeing (BA) and Airbus (OTCPK:EADSF) will take years to return to peak production levels. Building technologies (HBT) was down 17% as non-residential buildings defer projects. The rent pressure office and retail buildings are likely to face may limit the amount landowners invest in their properties. Performance Materials and Technologies (PMT) has been hit by low oil prices causing companies to cut back on drilling and exploration activity. Safety and Productivity solutions (SPS) was the lone bright spot, up 1%, and increased demand for warehouse management and PPE will continue to support the unit.(Source: Honeywell)Many of these challenges will persist for some time. As such, management expects that in Q3, aerospace sales will once again be down 25%, HBT and PMT will be down over 10% while SPS will accelerate toward up 7% as more PPE capacity comes online, providing a small offset to weakness elsewhere. With low oil prices and aerospace headwinds, HON’s other units can help mitigate the damage, but the company will still face profit pressure.Now, in response to the downturn, the company has found $1.4-$1.6 billion in cost savings in 2020. About $1 billion of that will be permanent, meaning profits can return to peak levels even when revenue is about 3% below peak levels. Thanks in part to these cost savings, Q2 free cash flow was $1.25 billion, which was down 18% from last year. The free cash flow conversion rate (free cash flow divided by net income) was 140%. This conversion level isn’t sustainable as there were $578 million of favorable working capital movements, nearly half of free cash flow. As a consequence, cash flow is likely to weaken incrementally.Critically, Honeywall has the financial strength to withstand even a more protracted downturn. The company has $15.1 billion of cash, more than covering $4.3 billion of debt maturing within 12 months. Net leverage is just 0.9x LTM EBITDA. HON is also reducing the pace of repurchases to just keep the share count steady rather than reduce shares outstanding. Given this balance sheet strength, HON’s $0.90 quarterly dividend is definitely safe.Honeywell has taken action to cut costs and optimize working capital, but these efforts cannot fully offset the headwinds it faces, and these headwinds will take years to reverse.In 2019, Honeywell earned $8.16 per share, adjusting for spin-offs during the year. At $3.61 billion in segment profits in 2019, the aerospace sector accounted for 45% of Honeywell’s total segment profits. However, the aerospace segment is unlikely to return to 2019 earnings levels for several years given the serious headwinds facing that industry. Indeed, Spirit AeroSystems (SPR) has now cut its expected 737 MAX deliveries out to 2022. While defense will provide some offset, Honeywell’s aerospace unit is unlikely to thrive for some time.In Q2, aerospace segment profits were $530 million, just over half of last year’s total. Eventually, the MAX will be approved, and there will be some sequential improvement from Q2/Q3 levels, but expecting $700 million in quarterly earnings (i.e., recouping half of lost income) is a more reasonable aim than a return to peak levels. Similarly, oil exploration activity is unlikely to return to pre-COVID-19 levels for some years. Even if HBT and SPS can combine to return to peak earnings in 12 months, which is optimistic, HON will have a $1 billion profit loss, or about $1.40 per share.At $150, shares are trading about 18.5x 2019 earnings. That’s a full valuation for an industrial company if it could attain those earnings. However, Honeywell’s earnings are only likely to recover to the $6.50-$6.75 area over the next year and a half, which is a 23x forward earnings multiple. That is an expensive multiple for a company facing such challenges. Ultimately, the company is caught between an aerospace and energy downcycle and recovery elsewhere. I would only buy shares if they fell back to $120, which would be 18x forward earnings.Otherwise, if investors want to buy into an aerospace-exposed company they should buy a more direct play, like Boeing or Spirit, for greater potential upside. Or, if they want to avoid aerospace in favor of more predictability, look at a name like Lockheed Martin (LMT), 3M (MMM) or L3Harris (LHX). Given the exposure to end markets it has, Honeywell’s stock looks expensive given the long road to return to peak profits."
4348968,104941,2020-05-20T10:41:33-04:00,"The short-term volatility in Honeywell's business is a certainty, but demand recovery in the economy post-COVID-19 and organic growth will drive Honeywell's revenues higher in the next decade.Honeywell offers a secure 2.7% dividend yield and potential for long-term capital appreciation.The intrinsic value of Honeywell's stock is ~$156, i.e., it is currently undervalued by 20%. I rate Honeywell a buy at $125, though not a strong buy.","Source: honeywell.comThe turbulence caused by COVID-19 led to a sharp sell-off in Honeywell (HON) stock in March. During the latest earnings call, Honeywell's management guided for a significant impact on second quarter results. Honeywell and the whole Industrial sector may remain affected in 2020, but longer-term prospects are still intact for the company. Honeywell's balance sheet strength and low payout ratio insure the strength of its dividend. Additionally, the company already completed the majority of its share repurchase plans for 2020 in the first quarter. Honeywell is currently trading below its fair price, while offering a secure 2.7% dividend yield. Thus, long-term dividend investors should add Honeywell to their portfolios at about $125 per share.To be clear, Honeywell's business has not grown in a decade. Its free cash flow per share has grown at about 10% annually over the last 5 years, but that has been solely the result of its operating and gross margin expansion strategy.Honeywell is another mature titan, struggling to find growth by which to power its share price higher. By purchasing the company at about $125, one will likely outperform the S&P 500 Index Fund, but not by much. Further, when we implement a margin of safety, the company struggles further to clear our required rate of return.With that being said, the company is a stalwart dividend payer with a management team that has proven itself capable of growing free cash flow per share through the strategies it's decided to execute.In a nutshell, my investment thesis is based on the following points:In today's article, we will analyze long-term trends in Honeywell's financials, determine its fair value, and discuss near-term headwinds.Let's get straight into financial statement analysis.Source: YChartsAs can be seen above, over the last decade, Honeywell's revenues have increased from $31 billion to $36 billion (down from $43 billion(2018) due to spin-offs and some organic revenue decline). While the revenue growth rate is low, the company has managed to expand its gross margins from low-20s to mid-30s. Higher gross margins can be attributed to an increased focus on industrial software business at Honeywell. The primary business segments for Honeywell include Aerospace, non-residential Buildings, etc. Let us look at the revenue breakdown to get a clear view:Source: statista.comAs we're all aware, the coronavirus pandemic has triggered an economic downturn, and if you look at Honeywell's business segments, most of them are going to be walloped. For example, in the aerospace segment, where Honeywell JetWave provides satellite communication services on airplanes, the revenue stream will be hurt by reduced airline budgets (which have been reduced by the evaporation of airline passengers).In the building segment, deferred construction of non-residential buildings will cut into Honeywell's top line. In the near term, i.e., during the second quarter, Honeywell's management expects a significant impact on the overall business with guidance for >15% drop in sales.Source: honeywell.comSuch a massive drop in sales is scary. But on the other hand, during this torrid time, Honeywell took up the baton and helped our frontline workers (i.e., doctors, nurses, paramedics, and others) fight the coronavirus by quickly scaling up its PPE manufacturing (e.g., N95 respirator masks). The demand for Honeywell's safety & productivity solutions should be higher going forward, and the management is chasing these new opportunities to generate sales.Source: honeywell.comShort-term volatility is almost a certainty with several headwinds for Honeywell, but the long-term prospects of the business are intact. Further, Honeywell is in a strong financial position and should be able to weather the impending economic downturn and emerge more influential on the other side.Source: YChartsAs of March 2020, Honeywell had cash and short-term investments worth $8.8 billion along with financial debt of $16.11 billion, leaving it with a very reasonable net total long-term debt of $7.3 billion. Over the last several years, both cash and debt have fluctuated in lockstep, maintaining a tight range in net debt position. But with an economic crisis in front of the world, how well is Honeywell prepared to weather the storm?Source: honeywell.comOn top of the $8.8 billion in cash, Honeywell has undrawn credit lines of $11.5 billion. The current portion of long-term debt, i.e., bonds maturing in one year, stand at only $4.3 billion. Thus, Honeywell's balance sheet is certainly strong enough to weather the recession.Honeywell's ability to consistently generate free cash flow over $5 billion serves as the foundation of its dividend and buyback programs. In the last twelve months, the company paid out $2.44 billion in dividends and repurchased stock worth $5.154 billion.Source: YChartsRising DividendsAs we can see in the chart above, the total dividend payout has been increasing, but can it continue in the current environment? The answer is yes. Honeywell's cash dividend payout ratio is only ~42%, thus even if free cash flow for 2020 were to halve, Honeywell could still cover its dividends. In the last four years, Honeywell's dividend per share grew from $2 to $3.44 at a growth rate of 11.46% CAGR.Source: YChartsEven in a recessionary environment, I fully expect Honeywell to continue to pay its dividend, as in a worst-case scenario of 20% or 30% revenue declines, the dividend will be very safe.Buyback AnalysisSource: YChartsIn five years, Honeywell reduced its outstanding shares at a rate of ~2% per year (from 793 million to 717 million). During this time, the size of the buyback program has increased from $0.8 billion to $5.15 billion. Hence, I think Honeywell's management is committed to enhancing shareholder returns via buybacks. With that being said, buybacks have been suspended for Q2, but the company may restart the program in the second half of 2020.To deduce a fair value for Honeywell's stock, we will employ my proprietary valuation model. Here's what it entails:Now, let's check out the results.The L.A. Stevens Valuation Model answers two questions:Assumptions:Using the L.A. Stevens Valuation Model, I determined that Honeywell's fair value is $156, i.e., the stock is currently ""Undervalued"" by 20%.Source: L.A. Stevens Valuation ModelSo you will find DCF calculations all over the internet and in many other articles here on Seeking Alpha. While useful, those calculations do not define specifically where the share price will move over the long term (e.g., a decade), and by extension, what we can expect in the way of future returns from share price appreciation.The L.A. Stevens Valuation Model streamlines the process of calculating share price appreciation (and ultimately determining expected returns) by automatically calculating current and future share prices based on the growth of free cash flow per share (which is what ultimately will drive a stock's price).Here's the result:The expected CAGR on investment in Honeywell for ten years at the current price of $125 is 7.76%, which is lower than our hurdle rate (9.8%, i.e., 90-year annualized return on S&P 500).Source: L.A. Stevens Valuation ModelHoneywell's dividend continues to grow via modest organic free cash flow growth and through share repurchases. So we must consider the impact of dividends to determine the total return on the stock.Hence, I would say that you'd beat the SPY, but not by much of a significant margin. But rising dividends at Honeywell make it a good investment for long-term dividend investors at today's price of $125.Honeywell is an industrial sector giant suffering from coronavirus induced downturn. Still, if you are an investor with a long-term view who is looking to buy a quality business at a great price, then you should jump in at this price. The stock is undervalued, and demand shall return in the second half of this year.In the next five years, we should see a revenue growth rate of low single digits, and management's continued commitment to return excess cash to shareholders via dividends and buybacks should generate value for shareholders. In the short term, Honeywell's dividend is safe, and thus, I recommend our readers looking for dividend investments, with a potential for capital appreciation, to buy Honeywell.Key takeaway: Honeywell International is a buy at $125 and below.Please feel free to provide your feedback in the comments section. Let me know what you think about Honeywell.As always, thanks for reading; remember to follow, and happy investing!"
4344082,24361,2020-05-07T10:50:12-04:00,"Honeywell posted better revenue and profits in the first quarter, but the beat was largely driven by an aerospace business that's entering a sharp downturn.
        Incremental/decremental margins remain a big unknown, as Honeywell's particular business mix can lead to significantly different margins under different market recovery scenarios.
        Honeywell management is taking a big swing at cost reduction, with a $1.1 billion-plus cost-cutting program.
        Honeywell's prospective return is okay for a high-quality industrial, but there are cheaper names available.","Nobody knows exactly how the next 24-36 months are going to play out, particularly with respect to whether we see a V-shaped, U-shaped, or L-shaped recovery, but I feel confident in predicting that when the dust settles, Honeywell (HON) will still be an excellent company. I realize that may sound trite, but I think a company’s ability to make good decisions and generate long-term shareholder value can be overlooked when investors are freaking out about all of the uncertainty in the global economy.I still believe that Honeywell has elevated margin risk, but I think that’s a little better-appreciated now. I am also still concerned about the recovery prospects for Honeywell’s longer-cycle businesses, which contribute about 40% of revenue. The shares have underperformed slightly since my last update and remain in a valuation grey zone. I’d be in no hurry to sell if I owned then, and the prospective return is decent (high single-digits), but I think there are better risk-adjusted opportunities; getting another chance to buy below $120 would be a different story and that’s something to watch for if there’s another pullback.Honeywell’s first quarter results came in a little better than expected, with the company’s 4% organic contraction pretty much in line with the average for multi-industrials this quarter. Segment-level profit came in more than $0.06/share better than expected, but this was driven entirely by the Aerospace business, and the operating income beat was a much more modest $0.01/share.Aerospace revenue rose 1%, with an 11% decline in commercial original equipment revenue, a 1% improvement in commercial aftermarket revenue, and a 7% increase in defense and space revenue. Relative to other large peers in the aero market (like Eaton (ETN) and Parker Hannifin (PH)), Honeywell did better, but that was boosted by the larger defense/space business. Segment profits rose 12% (margin up 280bp to almost 28%) on better mix and self-improvement, and earnings beat expectations by about $0.12/share.Building Tech reported a 6% revenue decline, with weakness in building solutions, building management, and security pulling down otherwise stable results in fire. On balance, I’d say Johnson Controls (JCI) did a little better on an apples-to-apples basis. Segment profits declined 3%, but margins still improved about 100bp.Safety and Productive reported a 9% revenue decline, with a 5% decline in Safety and an 11% decline in Productivity. While demand for PPE products like N95 masks has jumped, that has been offset by sharper declines in short-cycle-driven industrial demand in areas like gas detection, retail, and non-respiratory worker safety. On the Productivity side, Honeywell was facing some tough year-ago comps (up 15%) and a weaker backlog going into the quarter. Segment profits declined 16%, with margin declining 90bp.Performance Materials and Technologies (or PMT) reported a 5% revenue decline, with UOP down 2%, Advanced Materials down 8%, and Process Solutions down 6%. UOP was hit by weaker demand in midstream natural gas, while AdvMat was hurt by weaker auto production volumes and competition with HFCs in Europe. Process Solutions is seeing the same overall declines that other process automation companies like Emerson (EMR) are seeing. Segment profit declined 9% this quarter (margin down 50bp) and this segment missed expectations by about $0.05/share.Not much has changed since my early April article on Honeywell in terms of the uncertainty regarding the Covid-19 downturn. The outlook for the second quarter is clearer, with management guiding to a 15%-plus revenue decline on steep declines in Aero and PMT, but the recovery path certainly isn’t.With flight hours tracking down 50% so far this quarter, Aero aftermarket demand is going to fall off, and OE equipment demand is likely going to be a multiyear recovery story as airlines and lessors try to clean up their balance sheets. Defense and space will be an invaluable offset.HBT is going to be weak as social distancing hurts service-oriented parts of the business and as new installations/orders/projects temporarily vanish. Longer term, I see a similar set-up/challenge as with Johnson Controls – new-build activity is likely to be weak in non-residential construction for 2-3 years, but Honeywell can offset some of that with greater interest in building automation and energy efficiency.SPS is a tougher call. Management guided to revenue only down 5%, and weaker comps do help. I expect growth in PPE sales, but while Intelligrated’s backlog jumped 40% and I do see strong long-term interest in warehouse/logistics automation, I’m not sure Honeywell will be able to deliver on that over the next couple of quarters due to ongoing Covid-19 challenges (including the difficulty of stopping already-strained systems to install automation).PMT was guided down 15% for the second quarter, and I’m not surprised with respect to weaker outlooks for process automation and UOP customers like refineries (given the steep drop in transport fuel demand). UOP should be a decent candidate to rebound more quickly, but I think process automation could be in for a longer recovery as oil/gas and LNG projects get pushed out.Honeywell is focusing on controlling what it can control, and that primarily means an even tighter focus on costs. Management is targeting over $1.1 billion in cost reductions for 2020, with a substantial piece of that (up to $500 million) potentially structural. I expect management to be prudent not to cut to a point where they hamstring their own recovery, but that is a potential risk.Honeywell didn’t say much in terms of decremental margin guidance, and that highlights my prior concerns about “margin shock” here. Mix shifts can have significant impacts on Honeywell’s incremental margins, and very profitable businesses like aero aftermarket and UOP’s catalysts could fall off significantly.I’ve made a few tweak to my model, but nothing substantive. I still expect Honeywell to see a more prolonged recovery relative to peers with more short-cycle exposure and less exposure to markets like aerospace, non-residential construction, and petrochemical process automation. I also still expect 3% long-term revenue growth, though, and a return to former operating margins in the lower 20%.Honeywell doesn’t really stand out as notably cheap now, and investors do have some solid options among quality industrials. Then again, the prospective return looks better here than at names like Dover (DOV), Eaton, and Rockwell (ROK), so investors will have to weigh their preferences for drivers like short-cycle/long-cycle recovery. Below $120 Honeywell would be a much easier call, but I still lean fairly positive here and this is a name to monitor in case the short-cycle/long-cycle positioning leaves this one too far behind."
4336990,24361,2020-04-10T13:12:05-04:00,"Covid-19 is causing chaos across every industrial market, but Honeywell's commercial aerospace, oil/gas, process automation, and non-residential construction customers may be especially vulnerable to a more prolonged decline/recovery cycle.
        Honeywell is reportedly pushing for aggressive concessions from suppliers; arguably a necessary move to offset what could otherwise be a significant decremental margin shock.
        Honeywell has already recovered a lot of ground from the lows of the panic, but the shares look attractively priced on a long-term basis.","The grim reality is that nobody really knows anything right now when it comes to assessing the impact of Covid-19 on the U.S. economy (let alone the global economy), nor how long it will take to get back to business as usual. While the market has recovered pretty strongly over the last couple of weeks, taking Honeywell (HON) shares up more than 40% from the point of peak panic, I don’t necessarily think we’ve seen the last shoe drop. Given the difficulties in predicting end-market demand in this environment, I’d be surprised if Honeywell didn’t pull guidance entirely. I also see a risk of sharp decremental margins – probably not in the first quarter, but possibly in the second and third quarters – and I believe that may shock the Street and rattle sentiment again. On top of that, a significant chunk of Honeywell’s revenue looks to me to be at risk beyond just a sharp correction that resolves by year-end.All of this doom and gloom aside, these are the times that value investors wait for. Honeywell’s valuation isn’t quite where I’d like to be after this strong rally, but it’s good enough for this as a long-term holding and certainly at a level where I’d watch this for any potential “double-dip” in the industrial sector as companies start reporting March quarter earnings.The end-markets for multi-industrials like Honeywell are in turmoil now, with many businesses shutdown or severely curtailed, and not much clarity on the path back over the next few months.Within that uncertainty, I’m still willing to make some predications and estimations as it concerns Honeywell.Aerospace is going to be challenging, and what was once a growth crown jewel for companies like Honeywell, Eaton (ETN), and Parker Hannifin (PH) has definitely lost some luster. The issues with the Boeing (BA) MAX are well known, but the potential damage to the commercial aftermarket may be less well-appreciated. For starters, about 20% of Honeywell’s aerospace revenue is driven by flight hours, and with fleets grounded across the world, that means no flight hours. On top of that, the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak on airlines could lead to order delays or cancellations, throwing further uncertainty into build schedules.Oil/gas, process automation, and industrial automation are likely to be pressured as well. We’ve seen major oil companies cutting capex budgets by 20% or more in response to weak prices, with smaller independents cutting budgets by 50% or more. I don’t believe that companies like Emerson (EMR) and Honeywell are necessarily going to see demand destruction, but projects are definitely getting pushed out. Likewise, in a world where factories are shuttered and supply chains are in turmoil, logistics and warehouse automation projects are likely to get pushed out.Last and not least is the non-residential construction market. This is probably the most controversial market right now. Construction activity has definitely plunged as states and countries have issued shutdown orders, but it’s unclear how quickly things may recover. We were already looking at a thinner funnel of new projects (after years of strong investment in new non-residential construction), and now companies have slammed on the brakes on new investments … and may well decide to wait and see how things shake out after global economies get back up to speed after these shutdowns. On the positive side, Honeywell has a good skew towards services (55% of the Building Tech segment), and those are likely to hold up better.Honeywell isn’t taking this shutdown lying down. As I said in the open, I think Honeywell could be vulnerable to some margin shock, as the company sees significant decremental margins on this sudden and unexpected shutdown – Honeywell is a top-notch operator, but there’s hardly any manufacturing company this large that could adjust its manufacturing and cost base quickly enough to avoid serious decrementals in the face of such a significant unplanned volume decline.But it sounds like Honeywell is moving aggressively to fix this. A widely-circulated report from Barrons describes a memo that Honeywell recently sent to its suppliers demanding some startling concessions. According to the report, Honeywell is insisting on 30% across-the-board price cuts from suppliers effectively immediately, as well as more liberal payment terms, rebates on future order volume growth, holding Honeywell inventory at suppliers, and immediate resolution of outstanding claims against Honeywell.Is this an example of doing what is necessary in extraordinary times, or is this an example of “don’t let a crisis go to waste” and Honeywell trying to turn the screws on suppliers that are under intense strain right now? Maybe it’s both; I don’t expect Honeywell to absorb all the pain itself, but these demands seem quite aggressive to me, and I’ll be curious how many suppliers agree to them.I don’t want to understate the risks that Honeywell is facing. Not only might Covid-19 push the U.S. into a meaningful recession, markets like oil/gas, process automation, commercial aerospace, and non-residential construction may stay weaker for longer than the Street currently expects. Likewise, there’s the margin shock risk I mentioned.The good news, though, is that Honeywell can weather this. The company’s balance sheet is in good shape and has a strong long-term cost/margin structure, and management has repositioned the company into markets with generally attractive long-term drivers. Frankly, as a 3M (MMM) shareholder, Honeywell’s plan is the one I wish 3M’s management were following.I’m now expecting Honeywell to see a high single-digit revenue decline in 2020 with some recovery in 2021 and 2022. I do believe that it may take longer for markets like commercial aerospace, oil/gas, process automation, and non-residential construction to recover, and so my recovery trajectory for Honeywell is not as steep as it is for companies with more short-cycle exposure (which I think will rebound faster). Even so, I still expect revenue to grow at an annualized long-term rate of around 3%, with mid-single-digit FCF growth and FCF margins heading into the high teens over time.Other multi-industrials have sold off worse and not recovered as much, so I can’t say that Honeywell stands out as a big clear-cut bargain. Factor in business quality, though, and I think the opportunity is more promising. Even with challenges in end-markets that make up 40% of revenue, I think Honeywell is one of the best-run multi-industrials and one of the best-positioned for the long term. Another opportunity to buy closer to $100 would be great, but today’s price should still work out well for long-term investors."
4346732,65113,2020-05-12T14:39:05-04:00,"Honeywell International has shown strong earnings performance in the most recent quarter.However, the outlook for Aerospace and Building Technologies remains quite volatile in the current climate.This stock could make a strong recovery - but I would look for more evidence of strong earnings growth before going long.","When I wrote on Honeywell International (HON) last July, I made the argument that the stock would continue to trail higher on account of substantial margin growth for the company’s Aerospace segment.COVID-19 has clearly turned the aerospace market on its head, with demand plunging to historic lows.In this regard, we have seen Honeywell see a significantly greater drop than the S&P 500 on a returns basis in the past year:Source: investing.comWhile Honeywell is a highly diversified company, it is still one that has substantial exposure to the aerospace industry, with this segment accounting for 40% of overall sales in Q1 2020:Source: Honeywell First Quarter 2020 Earnings ReleaseWith that being said, even in the midst of the chaos we are seeing with the commercial airline market, there may be a possibility that the price drop in Honeywell’s stock might be an overreaction on the part of investors – as Q1 2020 results appear to be strong even when taking the decline in commercial aviation into account.For instance, while sales for Commercial Aviation Original Equipment did see a substantial drop of 11%, the Commercial Aviation Aftermarket remained stable albeit low – with a 1% rise. Sales growth for Defense & Space remained respectable at 7% growth.Source: Honeywell First Quarter 2020 Earnings ReleaseWhile organic sales were down by 4% from Q1 2019, overall EPS was up by 15% thanks to segment profit growth. In particular, we see that margins for the aerospace sector increased significantly:Source: Honeywell First Quarter 2020 Earnings ReleaseAs mentioned, U.S. defense and space was a significant contributor to this, as well as demand from the air transport aftermarket.In particular, there is a possibility that we could see the latter continue to see growth going forward. The commercial airline industry will invariably return at some point, but it will look quite different to what it was. It is likely that there will be fewer airlines as weaker players go bankrupt, and those airlines that do remain will need to make the best use of cash reserves in order to survive. Therefore, it is a possibility that airlines will decide to invest more in maintaining existing fleets rather than upgrading outright. In this regard, aftermarket demand could stand to grow significantly under such a scenario.When looking at Honeywell from a valuation perspective, we see that EV to EBITDA has dropped significantly while EBITDA per share has continued to rise.Source: ycharts.comBased on this metric, earnings performance would seem to suggest that Honeywell International is more attractively valued today than in 2019.With that being said, the COVID-19 pandemic has triggered a very volatile environment around the world. Investing in the stock market comes with heightened risk at this time, and Honeywell International is no exception to this.While the aerospace segment has proven to be resilient for this company, it is not a given that this will last. Indeed, if airlines remain grounded for a significantly larger period of time, then this will likely have the effect of shrinking the market very significantly and profit margins for the aerospace segment would likely come under significant strain as a result.Moreover – while it accounts for the smallest segment in terms of sales – I expect that the Honeywell Building Technologies segment will come under more pressure going forward – even if this segment has seen a small drop in sales from last year. With the real estate market having seen a big drop in interest as a result of lockdown measures, coupled with an increasing trend towards work from home arrangements for many companies – these trends would appear to suggest significantly less demand for building construction – and in turn building technologies going forward.In this regard, the company does face significant risks in that both the aerospace and construction industries could look quite different after COVID-19 and Honeywell could come under pressure as a result.To conclude, Honeywell International has shown strong earnings performance to date. However, the company does have exposure to industries that are undergoing significant uncertainty as a result of COVID-19. For this reason, while I am impressed with the company's performance to date, I might be inclined to wait and see whether Honeywell can sustain the strong earnings performance we have been seeing before becoming a buyer."
4331096,22717,2020-03-11T00:07:04-04:00,"Honeywell has been accelerating its buyback program in the past four years. I expect this to continue.As a result, its share count has been reduced by over 10% in the past 10 years. In fact, in the past 5 years, the share count has fallen by 9%.Honeywell has plenty of cash flow to continue doing this. Its FCF yield is over 5%, and up to 70% of that is used for buybacks.Based on this, the stock is at least 16% undervalued, or worth $187.50 per share.","Honeywell International, Inc. (NYSE:HON) is in the middle of a $10 billion buyback program authorized by its board. As of December 31, 2019, there was still $7 billion left in that program. Since HON stock has a $115 billion market value, this represents 6% of its total market capitalization.This has produced great results for the company. For one, the share count has fallen over 10% in the past 10 years. You can see this in the chart below:(Source: Hake)This includes my estimate for the share count drop this year. What is most interesting is from this chart is that the company has been accelerating its share count reduction in the past five years. From 2014 to the end of 2019, the number of shares outstanding has been cut by 9.0%.Honeywell certainly has the FCF to do this. Its FCF has been accelerating, as well as the portion allocated to buybacks. You can see this in the two charts below that I have put together:(Source: Hake)This clearly shows that the amount of money the company dedicated to buybacks is increasing, both in dollar terms and as a proportion of its FCF.In Honeywell's earnings press release, management said that its base case goal for the share buyback program is a reduction of at least 1% every year in its share count. So far, the company has well exceeded that in the past five years.The growth in Honeywell's dividends per share has been much faster than its cost for those dividends. This is a direct result of the company's buyback program.You can see this in the tables below.(Source: Hake)This shows that the Dividend Per Share (""DPS"") has grown 220% in the past 10 years, from $1.15 per share to $3.69 estimated for 2020. This compares to a 173% increase in the 10-year cost of dividends to Honeywell. Even including the 10-year period ending 2019, the cost was up 159% but the DPS rose by 192%.The same thing happened in the past five years. For example, dividends per share rose by 64% to the end of 2019, but the cost was up only 41.5%.Both of these results are due to the fact that the share count was lowered, as I pointed out above.So this means that the buybacks have been successful in returning value to shareholders.Based on this analysis, we can estimate the value of Honeywell stock. One simple way to do this is to estimate its free cash flow as a percent of the market value and then divide it by the new lower estimated number of shares that will be outstanding.For example, the company recently gave a forecast of its free cash flow for 2020. Honeywell said in the earnings release that it would be between $5.7 billion and $6.2 billion for 2020. My estimate, based on the FCF margin, is that FCF will be slightly over $6 billion for 2020. In two years, I estimate it will be up 10% over that amount, or $6.6 billion.Therefore, we can estimate the true value of Honeywell stock:(Source: Hake estimates)I estimate that there will be 675.5 million shares outstanding. The result is the true value is $187.22 per share, or 16% above today's price.The fact is Honeywell stock is quite cheap here. You can see this in the table below:(Source: Hake)The stock has a total yield, including dividend yield and buyback yield of over 6%. Based on my estimate of FCF in two years, the stock is likely 16% undervalued, at $187.22 per share.This is based on its buyback and share reduction program continuing at the same pace that it has been over the past several years. Now that the stock is even cheaper than the beginning of 2020, I believe the company may be increasing its buybacks. Look for good things to happen with HON stock and the dividend per share as a result.If you liked this article, hit the Follow button at the top of the article, and the pop-up real-time alert box.

4334184,79675,2020-03-25T14:18:58-04:00,"Honeywell's stock is down big so far in 2020.However, the company still has promising long-term business prospects. It also helps the bull case that Honeywell entered 2020 in a great position, operationally and financially.I hold a position in Honeywell, and I plan to add shares on any significant pullbacks.","Honeywell's (HON) stock has taken a significant hit so far in 2020 due mainly to COVID-19 concerns (and the potential impact to the economy). On a year-to-date basis, the stock is down ~32% and it is underperforming the broader market by almost 10 percentage points.Data by YChartsInvestors should definitely be concerned about the potential economic impact of the current health scare but, in my opinion, this pullback will eventually turn out to be a great long-term buying opportunity. To this point, I believe that shareholders of this diversified, well-capitalized industrial conglomerate should use the current dip as an opportunity to add to their HON positions.It would be a huge understatement to say that the industrial sector has felt the pain of the COVID-19 fallout.Source: FidelityAdditionally, it's important to note that U.S. economic activity is predicted to fall off of a cliff in the first half of the current year.Source: JPMorganHowever, economic activity is also expected to bounce-back over the last 2 quarters of 2020.There is no doubt that Honeywell's business, especially Aerospace, was/is impacted by the COVID-19 concerns. But, consider this, the current headwinds will (or should I say, are predicted to) eventually dissipate. As such, I believe that investors with a long-term mindset should use this opportunity to add a well-positioned industrial conglomerate with great business prospects to their portfolios.Let's start with the fact that it was already announced that Honeywell is in talks to raise a new $5B term note, with a rumored 2 year maturity. It also helps the situation that the company does not have a material amount of debt maturing over the next few years. Source: 2019 10-KMoreover, Honeywell started 2020 in a great financial position. Source: 2019 10-KObservations: The takeaway, Honeywell has the balance sheet to weather this storm. The $5B note will add a little more flexibility. Plus, operationally, this company has a lot going for it. For example, Honeywell recently reported better-than-expected earnings to end fiscal 2019. The company reported adjusted Q4 2019 EPS of $2.06 (beat by $0.02) on revenue of $9.5B (missed by $120M), which compares favorably to the year-ago period.Source: Q4 2019 Earnings SlidesAs shown, Honeywell's quarterly results were strong across the board. Organic sales were up 2% YoY, which was primarily a result of strength seen in Aerospace (a soon-to-be issue for this company). Additionally, Honeywell's adjusted EPS were higher YoY and, importantly, the company continued the long streak of improving its cash conversion.It is yet to be determined just how bad Honeywell's business will be/was hit by recent turmoil but, make no mistake about it, this company is properly positioned for the future, even if the short-term headwinds are stronger than what many were anticipating. Honeywell's stock is attractively valued at today's price. Data by YChartsAs shown, HON shares are trading at the lower end of the range. Additionally, Honeywell is trading well-below its fair value (per Morningstar).Honeywell is a best-of-breed industrial conglomerate so, in my opinion, HON shares deserve a premium valuation. Therefore, I believe that the current peer comparison shows just how attractively valued HON shares really are. Data by YCharts14x earnings is cheap, especially for a company like Honeywell. If the broader market bounces back, investors should expect to see healthy gains for Honeywell's stock price in the near future. A global recession is the most significant risk to my investment thesis, at least in the near term. We are already on our way there, in my opinion. Therefore, investors should monitor Honeywell's operating results over the next few quarters to determine how bad the company was impacted by the global shut downs. Additionally, investor sentiment is/was extremely bullish for Honeywell and it largely revolves around the prospects for the Aerospace division, so a slow recovery for this industry would likely result in further downward pressure for the stock.The long-term bull story is [still] obvious: Honeywell is an industrial conglomerate that has great businesses in industries that have promising long-term prospects. Moreover, Honeywell appears to have the right management team in place and its focus on software (i.e. Industrial Internet of Things) is already paying huge dividends. So yes, the recent economic activity will definitely negatively impact Honeywell's business, especially Aerospace, but the company still has a lot going for it. This is a tough operating environment, but remember that Honeywell is still a great company. As such, I believe that investors should treat any significant pullbacks, especially if they are caused by broader market concerns, as long-term buying opportunities.

4315219,50291,2020-01-07T06:00:00-05:00,"Despite the Boeing crisis impact on the supply chain and even the US GDP, aerospace continues to be positioned well to return value to investors.While I remain bullish on the industry, escalation of any sort could stall economic growth.For Boeing, 2020 will be all about resurrecting itself and redefining its strategy.","Given concerns about the economy, oil prices and trade war fears, should investors steer clear of the aerospace industry? Or does the business, not only the big players but also smaller ones, present a long-term opportunity?Dhierin-Perkash Bechai has been covering the aerospace industry on Seeking Alpha for well over five years, combining his knowledge about the aerospace industry, which is his field of expertise, with his ability to analyze ""the numbers."" Dhierin's work is a mix of covering news events, earnings reports, product launches and performance comparisons and market outlooks, aiming to provide in-depth coverage of the aerospace industry exclusively on Seeking Alpha, to give readers the tools to better analyze investing opportunities.His articles often are not styled as an ""I would buy this at X and sell at Y,"" but function as puzzle pieces for investors to complete their own ""due diligence jigsaw puzzle"" that create an image with which investors can make proper investment decisions, or at least get a better understanding of the dynamics that are involved. Ultimately, it's his goal to make an incredibly complex and big industry understandable for people who are interested in investing in the industry. Next to his regular coverage on the platform, Dhierin also has established The Aerospace Forum for investors who want to dive a bit deeper into the industry with possibilities to have high-grade discussions and access to data.Despite a chaotic 2019, which will see part of the consequences drip through in 2020, I remain bullish on the aerospace industry. The main reason is because while Boeing (NYSE:BA) is a huge player in the aerospace industry, there are other names that can continue their stellar performance in 2020.On top of that, a trade deal with China could be a positive to Boeing specifically (not so much to other defense contractors). Each year we see all sorts of headlines toward the end of the year outlining how the next year will be the end of the bull market. While we do see mounting tensions, I don’t think we are at an inflection point.For 2020, it’s difficult to point at one thing and say that is what will drive performance, but that's simply because the sectors are extremely big. For aviation, reduced fears of a recession and a trade deal should be considered positives offset by possible higher oil prices as tension in the Middle East continues to exist.Source: GoodFonWith that tension in mind, defense contractors should be in a good spot. I continue to be a big fan of Lockheed Martin (LMT), Raytheon (RTN), United Technologies (UTX) and Northrop Grumman (NOC) shares though regrettably I didn’t buy shares of any of these companies.For commercial aircraft, I believe that a resolution to the Boeing 737 MAX crisis will give Boeing shares a clear direction (positive or negative), though full recovery of the delivery profile and profitability could be stretching well into 2021.For Airbus (OTCPK:EADSF), we see improvements in the singe aisle delivery stream as a positive, while improvement in the margins on Airbus A350 production also should benefit the European jet maker. It will be interesting to see how Airbus’ defense arm performs as that arm will be restructured after recording falling sales figures.All with all, it's not one element that will be the main driver, but each sector and, in some cases, even each company has a specific set of drivers. Overall what seems to be holding is that aerospace will be most influenced by economic growth (and stability) and tension being at a level such that it allows for continued economic growth but also higher defense spending.A combination of economic slowdown fears, the China trade deal not happening and overall global tension. This is not just specific to the aerospace industry, but throughout the year tariffs and “on and off” signals on a trade deal with China have affected share price performance. With the 2020 Presidential Elections upcoming I can’t imagine that President Trump would not look to reach an agreement with China, but if for some reason that trade agreement isn’t reached, I’d consider that the biggest element that could adversely impact performance as it likely will make fear return to the markets and taper overall economic growth expectations.Source: CNBCThis has been partially addressed above but increased political tension (think about tension in the Middle East) likely will benefit the big Defense companies, while escalation could hurt the overall economy and stock market. So, the risk would be an escalation in the Middle East.What I’d also consider a risk is President Trump not winning the elections. I have no political preference for any of the 2020 Presidential Elections, but at this point, it does seem that many Democratic presidential candidates are willing to go after big corporations and “the greedy Wall Street investors that make unethically big profits.” It’s all wrapped in “higher taxes for the super rich” but surely something that could scare off the markets and hit the average Joe who is investing for his/her retirement.One element that's getting a lot of attention is the Boeing 737 MAX crisis. The mistakes made are clear. What I think is not getting enough attention is the fact that this is multi-dimensional crisis involving regulation, transfer of certification tasks, customer relations, financials and development trajectories. The MAX crisis is likely going to affect the way aircraft are being certified in various jurisdictions while Boeing is seeing significant timeline challenges with regard to future aircraft developments, and you could ask yourself how much of a surprise that really is given that while Boeing is struggling getting the MAX back in the air, Airbus is marching ahead with its Airbus A321XLR development. Where the European jet maker can, they will continue pressuring Boeing… that's something that makes the MAX crisis, even though it already is a big crisis, a magnitude bigger than many think.In 2019, we saw that aviation was put in the dunce’s corner, especially in Europe. Big changes are required in the way we move and consume to reduce environmental impact, but we are currently seeing talks about flying with electric vehicles, supersonic travel and traveling by train. All of these “modern alternatives” do have drawbacks.Source: SpoorproTraveling within Europe by airplane is now being regarded as “not done,” reality is that traveling from West Europe to East Europe can still take almost two days while the airplane takes you there in three hours. Everybody wants to be conscious about the environment, but it remains to be seen who's willing to sit in a train for nearly two days while the aircraft gets them to a location within hours. When I chose to aspire a career in aerospace engineering I was told that aircraft would soon be obsolete with the arrival of high-speed trains, fact is that in certain parts of the world the airplane will still be the fastest way to travel for years to come. Traveling by train is a good alternative to air travel, but the state of train networks in certain parts of the world does leave a lot to be desired.One way to travel faster is supersonic air travel. Over the past years, we have seen people being outraged by the fact that aircraft still cruise at the same speed they did a decade ago. Fact is that supersonic air travel comes at a price, a price very few people are willing to pay. So we have yet to see how appealing supersonic aircraft will be. What we do see is that the train can be less demanding on the environment, is cheaper but slower while supersonic travel is fast, expensive and even more polluting than conventional air travel. Air travel isn’t particularly environmentally friendly and electric aircraft are still far off (though it's something that's getting more attention), but I do think that what often is not considered is that many aerospace technologies end up being applied in other applications. Aerospace invites for innovations, and by putting the industry in the dunce’s corner, part of efforts to reduce the carbon footprint on a unit basis that benefits other industries might be reduced. If you are a bear on the aerospace industry thinking that left and right it will be overtaken by novel technologies, at least for the coming decade and possibly two to three decades, you might find an unpleasant surprise.Source: Daily SabahFor Boeing, 2020 will all be about getting the MAX recertified, regain confidence from regulators and customers and regain financial strength. It will be a year for Boeing to reflect, but also pick up the pieces and improve the culture in the company as a whole while rebalancing engineering skill and financial tradeoffs. Boeing stopped buying back shares, which boosted share prices for years, and kept the dividend constant. In 2020, the company has to come up with a plan that strengthens its positions in the long term. If I look at how “well” share prices have been holding while uncertainty is still looming large, I don’t see an opportunity in Boeing share prices at present. At least not with an appreciable risk profile that would convince me to add to my position.For Airbus, I don’t think there's anything indicating that the jet maker can win big from Boeing’s misery in the near term. For a year, I have been hearing how Boeing would lose thousands of orders already logged. Reality is that it didn’t happen. Long term Airbus might get ahead in the development cycle which would strengthen the company’s position in the market, but Boeing, Airbus and their customers ultimately benefit from a healthy degree of competition between the jet makers.Looking at the various aircraft and defense-related companies:In the end, I think you don’t need to dig very deep to see that the aerospace industry shows market-outperforming returns but you should be weighing certain developments and keep in mind that this is an industry with a very long-term vision."
4326610,20449,2020-02-24T10:41:03-05:00,Honeywell International is a global industrial conglomerate that has a major presence in the aerospace and defense industry.The company is raising the dividend at a good clip. The dividend is seemingly very safe with good coverage ratios.The balance sheet is conservative and debt is not an issue from the perspective of dividend safety.The dividend has been raised for nine straight years.,"At the request of one of my readers I am analyzing Honeywell International Inc (HON). For most dividend growth investors, the company is probably under the radar since it has only been raising the dividend for nine consecutive years. But the stock has a respectable yield, the dividend is seemingly safe, and the company is positioned in several growing market segments such as aerospace and defense and performance materials, and margins have been trending up for years. This combination from this industrial powerhouse is desirable from the perspective of a dividend growth investor. On the con side, the company did suffer during the Great Recession and the dividend was frozen so there is some risk here when the economy goes bad at some point in the future. However, the stock price recovered after the Great Recession and has been trending up as the US economy bounced back. At the right price Honeywell could be a good addition to a dividend growth portfolio but investors should wait for a better entry point at this juncture.Source: HoneywellHoneywell is a global industrial conglomerate that traces its modern structure back to 1985. The company operates four business segments: Aerospace, Honeywell Building Technologies, Performance Materials and Technologies, and Safety and Productivity Solutions. This gives the company exposure to the aerospace and defense markets, construction, the oil & gas industries, as well as others. Honeywell spun off Garrett Motion (GTX), which manufactures turbochargers for cars, in 2018. Honeywell also spun off Resideo Technologies (REZI), which sells residential comfort and security solutions, in 2018. The company also spun off AdvanSix (ASIX), which manufactures caprolactam to make Nylon 6, in 2016. The company had about $37B in sales in 2019 of which $14.1B was Aerospace, $10.8B was Performance Materials and Technologies, $6.1B was Safety and Productivity Solutions, and $5.7B was Honeywell Building Technologies.Source: HoneywellAs my readers are well aware, a stock must have top and bottom line growth over time to drive dividend growth. There can be some short-term fluctuations, but dividend growth can only be supported if earnings grow. From this perspective, Honeywell does very well over the past decade. Revenue has grown from roughly $32B in 2010 to ~$42B in 2018. The company typically grows revenue from bolt-on acquisitions and low single-digit organic growth. Revenue came down in 2019 due in part to spin offs and some headwinds in the end markets for the Safety and Productivity segment, which has mostly industrial and manufacturer end customers. This is likely due to the global contraction in manufacturing and slow activity in the oil & gas industry. Tariffs and trade wars have also likely impacted Honeywell’s top line in 2019.Looking forward for 2020. I expect that the effect of the Boeing (BA) 737 MAX has not been fully felt by most manufacturers yet. But they effect will be real for those companies that are suppliers to Boeing and Honeywell is no exception. There have been repeated delays in the return of the 737 MAX to service and currently Boeing has halted production of the plane. At this point it is not fully clear when the plane will return to service and also when production of the plane will resume. On a positive note, tariffs and trade wars are subsiding and manufacturing seems to have stabilized in the US. But with that said, global manufacturing is still in the doldrums.But the real story for Honeywell is not the top line growth but rather margin expansion, which has driven strong earnings growth. Gross margins increased from about 23.6% a decade ago to ~33.7% in 2019. This is simply outstanding and points to the company’s success in controlling and managing its supply chain. The company also seemingly has solid operational efficiencies as operating margins have more than doubled in the trailing 10 years and are currently at over 20%. Profit margins have nearly tripled from about 6% in 2010 to 16.7% in 2019.Source: TIKR.comHoneywell’s dividend safety is of concern due to the freeze in 2009 to 2010. But today the dividend can be considered safe from the perspective of earnings and free cash flow. Even debt is not of significant concern at present adding to the safety.Honeywell’s forward dividend is $3.60 and the consensus 2020 earnings per share is $8.82. This gives a forward payout ratio of ~40.8%. This is a solid value and well below my threshold of 65%. The dividend has been growing rapidly at a double-digit rate. But the low payout ratio combined with the growing bottom line should let the company continue to grow the dividend and maintain a payout ratio below 50% for the next few years. However, I do not expect the dividend to grow at a double-digit rate in the next several years. The company is facing headwinds in certain end markets and margin expansion will likely slow. But still, one can expect that the annual dividend will grow at the same rate or slightly slower than earnings.Honeywell’s dividend is safe in terms of free cash flow as well. In fiscal 2019, operating cash flow was $6,897M and capital expenditures were $839M resulting in free cash flow of $6,058M. The regular dividend required $2,442M giving a dividend-to-FCF ratio of approximately 40.3%. This is an excellent value in my opinion and well below my criterion of 70%.The balance sheet is very conservative. The company had $4,833M in short-term debt and $10,954M in long-term debt at end of 2019. This was offset by cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments of $10,416M. The company can pay its obligations as interest coverage is over 20X, which is very conservative and lower than most other industrial companies. Furthermore, the leverage ratio is less than 1.0, which indicates the company has room to expand debt if needed. Overall, debt is not much an issue from the context of dividend safety.Honeywell is trading at a stock price of $179.42, which gives it a forward price-to-earnings ratio of ~20.4. Granted, this is lower than the broader market so seemingly the stock is undervalued. But the stock is trading at a multiple higher than the trailing average for the past decade of about 15.8 indicating that the stock is overvalued. But of course, the company was a lot less profitable in the past, so a higher valuation is justified. We will use 17.0 as a fair value multiple due to growing margins and good operational execution. The fair value estimate is $156.40 indicating that the stock is overvalued at the current price based on earnings.Estimated Current Valuation Based On P/E RatioSource: dividendpower.org calculationsHow does the above valuation estimate compare to other methods? The Gordon Growth Model gives a valuation of $180 assuming 6% dividend growth rate and 8% desired return. Morningstar’s discounted cash flow model gives a fair value of $188, a little higher than the fair value based on Gordon Growth Model and earnings. The average of all three models gives a fair value of $174.80, which still indicates that Honeywell is slightly overvalued.How does Honeywell compare to other manufacturing stocks? We make the comparison to three other aerospace and defense stocks. Note that Honeywell is somewhat different than a pure play aerospace and defense stock since it has exposure to other market segments. United Technologies (UTX) and General Electric (GE) are currently probably the closest competitors. We also include Lockheed Martin (LMT) in the comparison. But from this comparison we can see that Honeywell is not undervalued and trades on par with its peers or at a slightly higher valuation.Technical Comparison of ValuationsSource: Dividend Power and Seeking AlphaHoneywell is a very safe stock. The company has advantages that come from being a defense contractor with established relationships with the DoD and companies that make major aircraft platforms. The company also spends a decent amount on R&D to develop future technologies. Morningstar gives the stock a wide moat. Value Line gives it an average safety rating of ‘1’ and a financial strength of A++, and the earnings predictability is 100 and the stock price stability is 100. The S&P credit rating is A. These are all excellent numbers.Honeywell is a well-known stock that is followed by many investors. The company has a large aerospace and defense business but is also major player in building technologies, and as a supplier to other industries. The company is being affected by the downturn in manufacturing but not as severely as some of its peers due to its exposure to the aviation and defense markets. Honeywell’s competitive advantages and attributes make it a desirable stock to own. But it is trading at a fairly high valuation right now. I view the stock as a hold for current investors and new investors should probably wait for a better entry point.If you would like notifications as to when my new articles are published, please click the orange button at the top of the page to ""Follow"" me."
4299553,29551,2019-10-28T09:37:47-04:00,"Sorry for saying ""I told you so,"" but I did say two years ago not to be fooled by GE hitting its 52-week low and HON hitting its 52-week high.While Honeywell has been a solid investment since then, General Electric has been an unmitigated disaster.Moving forward, what can investors expect from each industrial giant?","Nobody likes a person who says, ""I told you so"" ... but hey, I did tell you so two years ago about General Electric (NYSE:GE) and Honeywell (NYSE:HON).I have long been bothered by the rote inclusion of 52-week highs and lows in analysis of stock valuations. It's meaningless and arbitrary - as if a 52-week low is somehow more telling than a 44-week low or 61-week low.And it's often misleading, because a company trading at a 52-week low might be quite overvalued while one at a 52-week high might be a compelling buy.I advanced a similar thesis back in October 2017, using GE and Honeywell to illustrate my point: HERE. (I have made the article an ""Author's Pick"" so that it will not be behind a paywall for those who want to check it out now. The comment stream, with benefit of 20/20 hindsight, is especially fun.)I argued that even though General Electric recently had hit its 52-week low of $22.10, it still was extremely overvalued with a P/E ratio of about 22.5. Throw in the fact that it had been a very poorly run company, and I had absolutely no interest in owning GE stock.Meanwhile, Honeywell had just reached its all-time high, $145.96. Despite that, with it trading at about 20.5 times earnings and with it growing both its earnings and its dividend smartly, I considered it a much more appealing investment candidate. And I put my money where my keyboard-pounding fingers were, adding to my HON stake.Well, here's what has happened in the two years since to the industrial giants, both in total return and dividends:Data by YChartsAt market close Friday, Honeywell's price was $171.63; its total return during the span was almost identical to that of the S&P 500 Index. Investors actually have gained even more than just that because, in 2018, shareholders received stakes in two spin-off companies: Garrett Motion (GTX) and Resideo Technologies (REZI). If you owned 100 shares of HON, you received 10 shares of GTX and 16 of REZI.Honeywell's dividend also has been raised twice since I wrote that article two years ago, most recently, a 9.8% hike that goes into effect with its next payment, Dec. 6. (Ex-dividend date: Nov. 14.)While it's been lovely to have been a HON investor since then, woe to those who stuck with GE, which closed Friday at $9. As if the nearly 60% loss wasn't bad enough, General Electric slashed its quarterly dividend twice in the last two years - from 24 cents to 12 cents in December 2017 and then to a pathetic penny one year later.OK, that ends the ""I told you so"" portion of our show. Let's look forward, shall we?Honeywell is trading only about 4% under its all-time high of $178.47, and I continue to believe that doesn't matter one iota.Morningstar's analysts say HON is reasonably valued, having estimated the fair price at $167. In the yellow-highlighted portion of the above graphic from Morningstar.com, note that Honeywell's P/E ratio is well below its 5-year average and the industry norm. The red-circled area shows that the forward P/E is even lower, but the blue-circled PEG ratio is not especially attractive.A FAST Graphs view of the period dating back to the end of the recession illustrates a company trading at a higher-than-usual multiple.As for General Electric... unlike back in 2017, the valuation metrics actually look more favorable now.Zack's and ValuEngine both give GE a fair value of $10. Morningstar has it at $11.70. And FAST Graphs indicates that the company is trading below its post-recession norm.One interesting comparison between GE and HON that FAST Graphs provides is that of expected growth. While General Electric is anticipated to see earnings per share rise 17% in 2020 and 23% in 2021, Honeywell's EPS increase is forecast at a more modest 8% and 9% during those years. Naturally, GE has a lot more room for improvement, as its EPS fell 30% in 2017 and 38% in 2018.And here's something else from FAST Graphs: GE's free cash flow, which had hit the skids in recent years, is expected to skyrocket.Honeywell's FCF growth is expected to be far less dramatic (11% in 2020 and 7% in 2021). Again, of course, GE has a lot of ground to make up.If you are a trader who regards General Electric as an appealing turnaround play, I could understand the temptation. The 52-week prices have nothing to do with anything, but, from a valuation standpoint - unlike two years ago - one could argue that GE is a ""better buy"" than HON and many other industrials.However, valuation is only part of the story, and for me, it's the smaller part of the story.Morningstar says GE has a ""Narrow"" moat and calls its stewardship (management) ""Poor,"" compared to HON's ""Wide"" and ""Exemplary"" grades. Value Line bestows upon Honeywell its best scores for Safety (1) and Financial Strength (A++); GE get VL's second-worst safety rating (4) and a B for strength.Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters strongly favor Honeywell - with 19 of 24 rating HON either a Strong Buy or Buy; only 8 of 19 who follow GE are similarly bullish.And, when it comes to any dividend-related data, the choice is an absolute no-brainer. I'll let the following Simply Safe Dividends graphic tell the story.I am treating Honeywell as a solid Hold. Because I have been slowly building my cash position to fortify my dry powder, I am not gung-ho to buy more HON at 20 times earnings (or anything else). But I am happy to keep such a high quality, 2.1% yielding company in my portfolio.General Electric? I still wouldn't touch it. I don't know why any investor who values dividend growth would even consider a company that has whacked its distribution three times in the last decade.I am not suggesting GE's price will never get above $10 again. As I said, it could be a winning value play for those convinced that better days are coming.I wish all of those folks good luck. If history is any guide, they will need it."
4315311,31441,2020-01-05T21:37:36-05:00,"BA will halt production of its 737 MAX jet, which could hurt revenues of HON's Aerospace segment.The 737 MAX fiasco comes at an inopportune time. The transportation sector is facing headwinds, which could hurt commercial aviation sales.Aerospace is HON's largest segment in terms of revenue and profits. Any headwinds could have an outsized impact on HON.Sell HON.","Source: ForbesLast month Boeing (BA) indicated it was temporarily halting production of the 737 MAX jet:Uncertainty pursuant to the timing and conditions of return to service and training approvals were determining factors in the production halt. The move will negatively impact Boeing suppliers like General Electric (GE), Honeywell (HON) and United Technologies (UTX). The general consensus is the grounding of the 737 MAX will create cash burn for suppliers:Honeywell manufactures avionics and mechanical systems for the 737 MAX. I understand that the 737 MAX's problems are unrelated to those systems. However, the grounding of the plane could create headwinds for Honeywell. The company has over $12 billion of cash on hand and its cash flow is robust; it generated free cash flow (""FCF"") through the first nine months of 2019 of about $3.8 billion. It may be in a better position to sustain a cash flow hit than GE which is cash flow-challenged.Falling 737 MAX orders could hurt Aerospace sales. In Q3, Honeywell reported $9.1 billion in revenue, down 16% Y/Y. The company has been hiving off underperforming assets and becoming more strategically focused. Honeywell achieved organic revenue growth of 3%. Aerospace is the company's largest segment at 39% of total revenue. It reported revenue of $3.5 billion, down 12% Y/Y. However, its organic revenue growth was 10%, impressive for a unit of its size. According to management, double-digit growth for Aerospace could continue:However, their data points suggest otherwise. Within Aerospace, commercial aviation aftermarket sales were extremely strong, up 6% Y/Y. A loss of equipment sales for the 737 MAX could create an opportunity for aftermarket sales on other planes. That sounds logical in theory. GE recently struck a deal to build more engines for the Airbus320neo, a rival to the 737 MAX. If the (1) Airbus320neo increases shipments at the expense of the 737 MAX and (2) Honeywell does not sell more of its avionics and mechanical systems into the Airbus320neo then its sales could drop.Secondly, global trade is down. Thawing trade tensions between the U.S. and China should help, but there is no guarantee global trade will return to previous levels. The World Trade Organization expects world merchandise trade volume to rise 1.2% in 2019. It expects trade volume to grow by 2.6% in 2020, down from its previous forecast of 3.0%. FedEx's (FDX) revenue and earnings have been hampered by the slow-down in global trade. It is looking to reduce capex, including reducing capital for new planes and permanently retiring certain other fleets. That does not bode well for future aircraft orders.The overall transportation sector is already in decline. Rail traffic faced headwinds for most of 2019. I find it difficult to believe that headwinds affecting the transportation sectors will not eventually impact commercial aircraft. Furthermore, industrial production has not been much to write home about, yet it rose in November. I doubt it will be sustainable until business confidence improves.Honeywell reported segment profit of $1.9 billion, down 8% Y/Y. On a dollar basis, operating profit was hurt by spinoffs. However, the company's margins were healthy at 21%, up 200 basis points versus the year-earlier period. The rationale for the spinoffs was to prune low-margin businesses. The strategy appears to be working. Aerospace represented 47% of total segment profits. It had the highest profit margins at 26%, with Performance Materials next at 22%. Aerospace's margins improved by about 400 basis points versus the year-earlier period, implying there is a tremendous amount of leverage in the business.I believe headwinds for the Aerospace sector could materialize by the segment half of 2020. The outlook could turn negative before then, depending on when the 737 MAX is realistically expected to return to service. It has implications for Honeywell's revenue growth. It could have wider implications for profit margins as Aerospace is the company's most-profitable segment.Honeywell's operations are highly-tethered to the global economy. If the economy has peaked, then it could have negative implications for the company's business prospects. HON has an enterprise value of $134 billion and trades at 16.7x run-rate EBITDA (Q3 EBITDA annualized). Honeywell has an excellent management team, which has explained the company's strategy and executed on it. It has also delivered consistent earnings, which is likely a major reason investors have rewarded it with such a high trading multiple. However, the valuation is too robust for a cyclical name.The MAX 737 fiasco is coming as the transportation sector is facing headwinds. That's bad news for HON. Sell the stock."
4299602,98446,2019-10-28T12:46:13-04:00,"Honeywell International had a very strong third quarter, with segment margins showing robust growth.The company's spinoffs last year removed lower margin businesses.Three out of four segments had organic growth.The company has paused its dividend growth twice in the last 15 years, but has averaged more than 10% growth over the last decade.For these reasons, Honeywell is one of my favorite names in the industrial sector.","Honeywell International (HON) is one of my favorite industrial names. The company has spun off some less profitable businesses in order to improve margins and focus on the higher growth areas of the business.Honeywell’s dividend growth track record may contain a few pauses, but the company has averaged more than double-digit dividend growth for the past nine years. Shares are up 18.6% over the last year which compares favorably to the S&P 500’s return of 11.7%.Still, I think Honeywell’s business and potential future dividend growth deserves income investors’ attention even at the current price.After spinning off its Transportation Systems unit in Garret Motion (GTX) on 10/1/2018 and its Homes & Global Distribution unit in Resideo Technologies (REZI) on 10/29/2018, Honeywell is now composed of four segments: Aerospace, Honeywell Building Technologies, Performance Materials & Technologies and Safety & Productivity Solutions. Honeywell has a market capitalization of $123 billion and had $37 billion in sales in 2018.Honeywell reported third quarter earnings results on 10/17/2019.Source: Honeywell International’s Third Quarter Earnings Presentation, slide 5.Excluding last year’s spinoffs, earnings-per share grew 9.5% to $2.08. Consensus estimates had called for $2.01. Again, adjusting for the spinoffs, revenue grew 3.4% to $9.1 billion, though this was $34 million lower than expected.Part of the reason for the spinoffs of Garrett Motion and Resideo Technologies had been to prune the company of its lower margin businesses. This has helped improve margins for the remaining business in recent quarter, but Honeywell saw even further gains in this area in the third quarter.Source: Honeywell International’s Third Quarter Earnings Presentation, slide 7.Ex spins, last year’s segment margin was 19.4%. Margins for the most recent quarter were up 180 bps, with three of four segments contributing to gains. Even without adjusting for the spinoffs, margins were still higher by 80 bps.Aerospace remains Honeywell’s best performing segment. Sales were up 10% organically, the segment’s fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit organic sales growth. Margins improved 350 bps to a company leading 25.6%. Some of this is due to the spinoff of Garrett Motion, but this core business is doing quite well.Defense & Space was the real stand out, producing 17% organic growth. The company’s guidance and navigation systems are highly sought after by customers. Aftermarket volumes for Department of Defense programs also increased. Backlog for Defense & Space was up 20%, with two-thirds of orders ticketed for 2020 or later. This gives this business several years of growth going forward. Commercial OE sales were up 7% on higher deliveries across several platforms. Commercial aftermarket services grew 6% due to higher demand for retrofit, modifications and upgrades.Honeywell Building Technologies had 3% organic growth and margins were higher by 390 bps to 21%. A portion of this growth was due to the spinoff of Resideo Technologies, but Honeywell saw continued strength in commercial fire products. Building management products were up double-digits as Tridium connected software remains in high demand.Organic sales for Performance Materials & Technologies improved 3%. Margins of 21.8% were a 60 bps improvement from the previous year. Process Solutions improved 7% due to growth among all of the company’s automated products. Advanced Materials declined 2% due to lower volumes and pricing due to illegal imports of hydrofluorocarbons, or HFC, into the European Union. Prices for HFC dramatically increased after the EU curbed its supply by nearly 40% last year giving way for the potential for illegal imports.Safety & Productivity Solutions had an 8% drop in organic growth. Lower sales volumes were the primary culprit as distributor destocking and the initiation of fewer large products caused margins to drop 320 bps to 13.4%. This was, however, a 110 bps improvement from Q2 2019. On the positive side, volumes for gas detection products were higher and Honeywell’s Intelligrated program continues to be well received.After repurchasing $1.3 billion worth of stock in the third quarter, Honeywell has now retired $3.7 billion of worth of shares for the year, which is a 3% reduction from the previous year.Honeywell also raised its guidance for 2019.Source: Honeywell International’s Third Quarter Earnings Presentation, slide 9.The company now expects adjusted earnings-per-share in a range of $8.10 to $8.15, up from $7.95 to $8.15 previously. This is the third consecutive quarter that Honeywell has raised its adjusted earnings-per-share guidance.Reviewing the company’s most recent earnings report shows that Honeywell is a thriving business. Growth in the right areas, such as aerospace, and improving margins leads me to believe that Honeywell is one of the best industrial names right now in the market place. The company’s dividend track record is also attractive.Honeywell doesn’t have quite the track record of dividend growth as some of the more well-known dividend paying companies. The company has paused its dividend growth several times over the last 15 years or so.According to ValueLine, Honeywell paused its dividend in 2004 and again in 2010. Readers should note that the company paused, but did not cut its dividend either time. In both cases, Honeywell return to dividend growth the very next year. In 2005, the dividend was raised by 11%. In 2011, the dividend increase was for more than 13%.Double-digit growth isn’t reserved just for years following a dividend freeze. Honeywell has raised its dividend:Honeywell has offered at least 10% dividend growth every year between 2011 and 2018. This year’s increase, which takes effect for the 12/6/2019 payment, comes up just short at 9.8%. Still this is pretty solid growth and marks the ninth consecutive year of dividend growth.Shares of the company currently yield 2.1%, slightly above the average yield of 1.9% for S&P 500. The current yield is about on par with the five-year average yield of 2.1%.Honeywell has been able to offer double-digit dividend growth for nearly a decade because it’s payout ratios, measured by either earnings or free cash flow, are very healthy.Using the new annualized dividend of $3.60 and the midpoint of guidance for earnings-per-share for the year of $8.13, the forward payout ratio is just 44%. This is above both the five and 10-year average payout ratios of 37%, but still within a very safe area.After almost a decade of ~10% dividend growth, investors might be concerned that the company may not be able to continue to offer increases at such a healthy rate. Looking at free cash should offer investors reassurance on this issue.Honeywell paid out $595 million in dividends in the third quarter while generating $1.3 billion in free cash flow. This gives the company a payout ratio of 46%.Over the last four quarters, the company has distributed $2.4 billion of dividends while producing $5.3 billion of free cash flow for a payout ratio of 45%.Looking at 2015 to 2018, Honeywell has retuned $8 billion in capital through dividends to shareholders over this period of time. The company has generated $19.4 billion of free cash flow for an average payout ratio of 42%.Free cash flow paints a picture of a very safe dividend for shareholders of Honeywell. All of the payout ratios, earnings and free cash flow over multiple periods of time, are in the mid to low 40% range.Honeywell did freeze its dividend in or around the last two recessions, but I am comfortable with this as the company has shown it is willing to offer generous dividend growth once the recession is in its rearview mirror. The low payout ratios also make it likely that it would take a prolonged recession for another freeze to even occur.Honeywell’s business is executing at a very high level. Three out of four business segments had positive organic growth. Segment margins were up nicely and the company’s most important segments appear to have further room to run.Honeywell also continues to raise its adjusted EPS forecast and the company has proven to be very shareholder friendly in terms of both buybacks and dividend increases.Dividend increases of at least 10% have been almost automatic over the last nine years. This year’s increase was a hair short of this threshold, but the payout ratios remain very in a safe range .Between business performance and dividend growth, I find Honeywell International to be one of the best industrial companies in the world."

The cumulative performance is up more than four-fold over the last decade. There have been some significant drawdowns - one by as much as 30% - but the shares have always managed to bounce back.The company conference presentation posted on SA in September shared the following update:It appears that more or less the entirety of H1 free cash flow is being used for the purposes of share repurchases. In my view, repurchases basically amount to a special dividend: cash leaves the corporate balance sheet and finds its way onto the balance sheet of shareholders, either in the form of cash or (hopefully) higher share prices due to lower share count.Source: SA EssentialThe YoY revenue figure is not so hot, and for that matter we can see that more than 100% of the past five years' earnings growth is attributable to margin expansion rather than revenue growth. That's a pattern I'd very much like to see change.The company has some cool initiatives at the present, such as Honeywell Connected Enterprise, which has sported strong growth rates. This has been a contributor to further expanding margins.CFO Greg Lewis walked through some of the operational initiatives and reports, confirming that Q3 figures remain intact:CEO Darius Adamczyk cautioned investors and management from getting too slowdown oriented. He mentioned on CNBC a couple weeks back that trade war-related headlines were having an impact on the willingness to invest.Source: SA NewsMr. Adamczyk acknowledges that the macro climate is creating uncertainty, and also that the current year is ""slightly"" worse (emphasis on slightly) than the last, but there are opportunities for growth as well.Beyond that, Honeywell International is an organization with global reach. It is possible, and even likely, that certain markets will be more prone to slowdowns than others:Source: MarketWatchThe USD Index may also provide something of a headwind, and there isn't too much Honeywell can do (aside from currency hedging, which carries risks of its own) about such movements in the short run.Source: Yahoo FinanceAs we head into the Q3 earnings report (this October 17th, pre-market), the last twelve months' performance distribution (in black) appears to have a pretty moderate volatility profile as compared with prior calendar years.HON shareholders have not had it so easy as they did in, say, 2014 or 2017. But the distribution is also calmer than 2011 (green) or 2018 (maroon). From a vol standpoint, a tall distribution represents calm and a short distribution corresponds with a larger span of potential outcomes.Source: SA EssentialThe strengthening dollar as well as the potential for slowing global growth may act as headwinds for Honeywell. Management is continuing to forge ahead with capital deployment, as well as committing to a fairly large share repurchase.Q3 earnings estimates appear to be a target that management has signaled will be hit. I'm interested in what forward guidance looks like this October.The company looks to have gotten a pass from investors at present. The volatility environment, while not highly calm, is also suggestive of an environment where low revenue growth coupled with share repurchases are viewed as acceptable.If the macroeconomy can hold up, then HON shares are likely to continue to forge ahead.Source: SA EssentialData by YChartsI would love to see what current investors and followers of HON have to say about their view on a revenue turnaround story. I understand that this past year saw approximately 2-4% organic revenue growth, but the divergence above concerns me.Thank you for reading. Please consider following."
4297320,24361,2019-10-18T12:51:11-04:00,"Honeywell's third quarter revenue was a little soft, with Aerospace having to do most of the heavy lifting on strong demand in Defense and Space.Margins were better than expected, with all but PMT coming in above Street expectations.Honeywell remains well-positioned with respect to end-market exposures and there are further opportunities for margin improvement, but the shares aren't cheap.","I have to admit that Honeywell's (HON) lackluster share price performance over the past three months has surprised me, as I expected this well-loved multi-industrial to benefit from some ""safe haven"" investment flows as the data on a broader industrial slowdown continued to accumulate. Whether I underestimated how much of that had already taken place, or whether investors were a little put off by valuation, I don't know, but Honeywell has lagged its industrial peers a bit since the second quarter earnings update, though the company is still among the outperformers of the past year.There wasn't really anything in Honeywell's third quarter that changes my view. The company's longer-cycle process businesses are holding up and aerospace should remain strong for some time. Weakness in productivity/automation should be transitory, and the company continues to do well on margins. Healthy mid-single-digit long-term FCF growth and strong margins/ROIC/ROA support a robust valuation for Honeywell shares, but I can't call these shares undervalued today.Honeywell did nothing special in terms of its revenue performance, with a slight miss relative to expectations, but margins came in better than expected, helping drive a roughly $0.03/share beat at the segment income line. Still, that's less than half of the overall reported per-share beat, so while Honeywell's third quarter was better than expected, it wasn't a particularly impressive beat for a company where expectations are already pretty high.Revenue rose 3% in organic terms, driven by another impressive performance in the Aerospace business. Gross margin improved almost four points, helped in part by the margin-lifting disposals Honeywell executed last year. Adjusted operating income rose 4%, while adjusted segment income rose almost 8%, with 80bp of margin improvement.Aerospace revenue rose 10%, with Defense & Space leading at 17% growth, but both sides of Commercial did well (original equipment up 7%, aftermarket up 6%). Segment margin improved by more than three points, helped by the Garrett (GTX) transaction, and the Street remains somewhat concerned about margin prospects in 2020. These results should be encouraging for Eaton (NYSE:ETN), General Electric (GE), Parker-Hannifin (PH), and United Technologies (UTX), and there seems to be little concern that aerospace demand will abate meaningfully in 2020.Building Tech produced 3% growth, with respectable trends in fire and building management. Also helped by spin-off activity (Resideo (REZI) ), margin improved about four points. While Fastenal (FAST) noted healthier trends in non-residential demand, much of this has been supported by larger projects. With that, I'm not quite sure how to assess this for companies like Johnson Control (JCI) or United Technologies - non-residential construction demand seems to be hanging in there, but it also does seem to be fading, and I'm worried that the pipeline of larger projects isn't refilling.Safety and Productivity was the more troubling part of the business. Revenue declined 8%, with flat performance in Safety (a mixed read-through for recently-underperforming 3M (MMM) ) and a double-digit decline in Productivity, including a 20% pullback at Intelligrated on destocking and project pushouts. Margin declined more than three points. Other vendors serving similar automation/productivity markets, including Cognex (CGNX), Daifuku (OTCPK:DFKCY), and KION (OTCPK:KIGRY) had already warned about these trends.Finally, Performance Materials and Technology posted an okay quarter, with 3% organic growth on 7% growth in Process Solutions, flat performance in UOP, and a 2% decline at Advanced Materials. Margins improved slightly (less than a point). Between the healthy results from Honeywell's Process Solutions (including strong order growth) and the strong results from Dover's (DOV) Fluids business, this should be relatively encouraging for Emerson (EMR) and perhaps SPX Flow (FLOW) as well.Although I do have some concerns that non-residential construction will weaken in 2020 and that process solution/automation markets could see a slowdown, on the whole Honeywell is pretty well placed with respect to how the macro environment is developing. The company has low exposures to more troubled markets like autos, electronics, heavy machinery, and upstream oil/gas, and high exposure to aerospace, one of the most attractive markets right now. I'd also note that Honeywell reported 8% growth in its long-cycle backlog; I still see some risk on project timing/delays, but process automation investments continue to go forward.This was the first time in 2019 that Honeywell management didn't boost guidance, and I don't think the Street is going to walk away fully convinced that there isn't margin risk in 2020 (particularly in Aero). Still, management has shown it can continue to drive positive operating leverage, and that will be an invaluable asset over the next 6 to 18 months.My fundamental views on Honeywell haven't really changed. I'm still expecting low-to-mid single-digit long-term revenue growth and mid-single-digit FCF growth. Likewise, I continue to expect Honeywell to report very healthy operating margins, ROA, and ROIC.Honeywell's above-average margins deserve an above-average valuation, but the market is already past that point. I continue to understand and appreciate the ""safe haven"" argument for Honeywell, but given what I see as relatively more promising opportunities elsewhere, this wouldn't be my first pick for new money in the sector, even though I continue to have a great deal of respect for this management team and this collection of businesses."

Not that it's been a disaster, but the shares have endured a roller-coaster of a ride to pocket just shy of 4%.Granted, a lot of this move boiled down to macro-related risk. Many stocks throttled lower in Q4 '18, and subsequently rebounded in Q1-Q2.I ran a correlation analysis for HON to see which Sector SPDRs the shares have moved most in harmony with on a monthly basis over the past five years.Source: Yahoo Finance - Compiled by authorIt may not surprise you that the tightest correlation match was between HON and the Industrials ETF, XLI.Data by YChartsSo, I decided from there to see how HON shares have fared (again on a total return basis) in relation to XLI.We see the fingerprint of a high-beta stock - falling more than its index in the bad times (late '18) and rising on an outsized basis during the good times (H1 '19).Since the summer, however, HON shares have pivoted for the worse, both in absolute terms and in relation to the XLI.Source: Yahoo Finance - Compiled by authorRealized volatilities for the shares are on the rise, especially at the monthly horizon. Rolling shorter-term vol measures lead longer-term measures, and so, it's likely that we'll see an uptick in quarterly/annual realized volatility.I'll point out from the graphic above that HON shares have been through higher spikes in monthly realized vol, frequently right around earnings announcements.Investors by no means need to panic, but they should be aware that market volatility appears to be on the rise for HON shares.Source: SA EssentialIt's certainly not as though management has not been able to consistently guide earnings forecasts in order to deliver upside ""surprises"", at least if the past sixteen quarters shed any light on the matter.Source: SA EssentialForward EPS consensus estimates look pretty solid over the next nine quarters, and so, it does not appear to me that there's a great reason for the recent increase in realized volatility.Source: SA EssentialHON's current dividend yield is quite reasonable at just under 2%. The lowish dividend payout ratio demonstrates that the company is ""paying itself first"" - I mean that in a good way. The dividend has grown handsomely over the past five years, and the company has raised the divvy for the past fifteen years - a solid track record.So, earnings look decent, and there are initiatives underway to support further growth. Profits and margins are healthy.Investors sometimes have to accept that they'll need to weather more volatility than they have in the past to achieve a certain return. It does seem to be the case that measures of dispersion have increased lately, while the return profile hasn't been all that impressive.Investing, of course, is about both risk and return. Keeping an eye on each side of the coin can be helpful toward making deliberate and objective decisions. It's not a good idea to ignore the message of the market, which at the time appears to be ""more vol"". But for the time being, the levels are not at alarming levels.I am giving thought to a call spread on the shares, and perhaps taking outright ownership on a sustained downturn. Perhaps that's grist for a future article.I'm interested in your thoughts. The last year hasn't been too generous from a risk-reward standpoint, but what's your take on the upcoming risk profile for the company and, somewhat separately, the stock?Thank you for reading. Please consider following."
4296424,22717,2019-10-14T12:28:53-04:00,"Honeywell's $10 billion stock repurchase program has been in full swing. It looks like the company will buy back over $5 billion in shares this year alone.The stock benefits greatly from these repurchases. By the end of 2019, Honeywell will have reduced its shares by 100 million or over 12.5% since 2013.The key to its buyback program is Honeywell's massive free cash flow margins which are over 2.5 times its peers at 16%.Including the dividend yield of 2.4% and its buyback yield of 4.76%, Honeywell's total yield, or total return of capital payments on behalf of shareholders, is over 7%.Based on a comp analysis, Honeywell's stock is worth $230.39, or 40% above its present price.","On April 29, 2019, Honeywell's (HON) board of directors approved a $10 billion stock repurchase program. This included $2.3 billion of availability remaining under its previous $8 billion buyback program.Honeywell has been increasing its share buybacks ever since 2013. In 2018, for example, it repurchased $4 billion in common stock. I estimate this year HON will buy back $5.6 billion of shares. This represents 5.6% of its $117 billion market value (the ""buyback yield""). Combined with the dividend yield of 2.42%, HON's stock has a total yield of 7.19%.In effect, Honeywell has been returning higher amounts of capital to its shareholders over the past six years. Looking at the table below, you can see that total return of capital payments have risen to over 100% of free cash flow (""FCF""):Source: Hake calculations taken from SEC filingsThe growth in buybacks is based on the company's powerful free cash flow. HON has given very precise estimates of how much free cash flow.I built a model based on Honeywell's past sales, operating cash flow, capex and FCF history, as well as its recent guidance.For example, here are some of the important slides which help analysts project HON's sales and FCF:Source: Honeywell Q2 2019 slide presentationThis allows me to forecast the Q3 sales number. The next slides allow me to make full-year 2019 sales and FCF projections:Source: Same as aboveBased on these slides, I have projected $36.95 billion in sales for 2019 and $6 billion in net income and FCF. The FCF amount is estimated to be 100% of net income, based on the company's 100% ""conversion"" guidance in the slide above. Subscribers to my Total Yield Value Guide have access to the full Honeywell model spreadsheet.Based on these projections, I estimate that Honeywell will buy back $5.6 billion in shares this year. This represents 93% of its free cash flow. Total dividends and buybacks will actually be 133% of FCF. This percentage will be lower based on cash raised from a smaller amount of shares that are issued to employees and consultants. Nevertheless, the total buyback yield represents over 4.7% of HON's stock market value.The chart I prepared below shows that HON has reduced its share count significantly since 2013 when it started a concerted campaign to buy back shares:Source: Hake using SEC data and model estimatesYou might say so what? Well, here is why that matters. The table below shows that Honeywell has increased its dividend per share at almost twice the rate in the past six years than the dividend cost in millions of dollars. The only reason this occurs is because the HON share count has fallen over 12%.So, for example, quarterly dividend of 41 cents per share in Q2 2013 has now risen to 90 cents per share recently. This is a gain of almost 120%. But the cost has only risen from $374 million per quarter in Q2 2013 to $632 million in Q3 2019 (my estimate). This is a cumulative increase of just 69%.So both shareholders and the company win with share buybacks. Shareholders get a higher dividend per share, and the company does not have to pay the full cost of the increases because there are fewer shares outstanding. Another way to put it is the company can afford to pay higher dividends per share for the same increase in dividends than it would have paid out anyway.This is a very powerful illustration of why share buybacks are so important. Another major reason is that they are extremely tax efficient. You can read more about this in my Total Yield Value Guide service. Here is an article I wrote that briefly describes the benefits of these types of stocks. The Total Yield Value Guide also has articles that describe the tax and mathematical benefits of stocks with large buyback programs.HON's stock market value is priced at $117 billion and its enterprise value is $120 billion, as can be seen in the table I put together below:Source: HakeBelow is a table which shows the valuation metrics for HON stock:Source: Hake estimatesComparing these metrics to HON's peers, with some adjustments, will show at what price the stock should really be valued:Source: Hake estimates using Yahoo! Finance data for peersThis table shows that HON's stock is overvalued in some metrics and undervalued in others. In addition, I adjusted the final valuation based on the dividend payout ratio average and the free cash flow margin comparisons:Source: Hake estimatesThis shows that Honeywell pays out a higher amount of dividends as a proportion of earnings - 41% more. It also shows that the FCF margin at Honeywell is 147% higher than its peers.The peer average dividend yield is much higher than HON's stock. So the implied value for the stock should be adjusted 41% higher to be equal to the proportion of earnings that it pays out in dividends. The same is true based on the higher FCF margin at HON. The implied value should be increased by 147%.Here is the application of the industry metrics, as adjusted, to Honeywell's 2019 inputs. The average of these is used to derive the stock's true value:Source: Hake estimatesThis shows that the average value for HON stock as adjusted is worth 40% more than the present stock price or $230.49 per share.Honeywell will report is Q3 earnings on Thursday, Oct. 17, 2019, before the market opens. It will be interesting to see how much stock it has bought back then and if its free cash flow is still on track to be 100% of its net earnings by year-end.Assuming it tracks the $5 billion+ share buybacks that I estimate will be done this year, the share count will drop significantly. I estimate that by the end of 2019, the share count will have fallen by over 12.5% since 2013 and over 15% by 2020 year-end. This allows the dividends per share to increase at a much faster rate than the total cost for the dividends in millions of dollars, as was shown in this article.I have shown that HON stock is worth 40% more or $230.49 per share than the present price. This is based on a peer comp analysis using our model's analysis of HON's powerful free cash flow, buybacks, and dividends, along with its lower expected share count.Subscribers to the Total Yield Value Guide have access to my model for Honeywell and can view or download the spreadsheet."

As such, I believe that long-term shareholders should consider staying the course.I hold a sizable Honeywell position and I plan to stay long the stock.","Honeywell's (HON) stock has faced downward pressure over the last 3 months, as shown by the fact that the broader market is outperforming HON's shares by ~5 percentage points over this period of time.Data by YChartsThe market has been extremely volatile so far in 2019 with the biggest contributor being the US-China trade war (and related concerns), but, in my opinion, investors should look past the current noise and stick with what has been working, i.e., Honeywell's stock. HON's shares have significantly outperformed the broader market over the last 1-, 3- and 5-year periods. And if you ask me, investors should expect more of the same over the next 5 years.Honeywell recently reported adjusted Q2 2019 EPS of $2.10 (beat by $0.02) on revenue of $9.24B (missed by $130M), which compares favorably to the year-ago period.Source: Q2 2019 Earnings Presentation As shown, Honeywell's quarterly results were strong across the board. Organic sales were up 5% YoY, which was primarily a result of strength seen in aerospace and building solutions (key growth drivers for this company). Additionally, Honeywell's adjusted EPS were higher YoY and, importantly, the company continued the long streak of improving its cash conversion.However, as I previously described here, I believe that Honeywell's margins are the real story for this industrial conglomerate (and its stock), so it is encouraging that the most recent results showed further progress toward management's goal of eliminating unnecessary costs and expanding margins in three out of four of its operating segments.Source: Q2 2019 Earnings PresentationThere is a lot to like about Honeywell's most recent operating results, but looking ahead, it is hard not to be bullish about Honeywell's business prospects, especially after factoring in the strong 2019 guidance.Source: Q2 2019 Earnings PresentationManagement again raised their full-year 2019 guidance (organic sales by 1 percentage point, EPS by $0.05, and adjusted free cash flows by $0.2B) and this well-run company does not appear to be slowing down anytime soon. Looking ahead, investors should begin to bake in expectations for Honeywell to have a strong finish to the current year, which should bode well for HON's shareholders.In a recent interview with the Charlotte Business Journal, Mr. Adamczyk spoke at length about why he feels Honeywell is well-positioned for the future. For a majority of the interview, he talked up the company's main growth driver, Honeywell Connected Enterprise, which is the company's data-driven software portfolio:And most importantly, the data driven approach is not for just one business unit, but instead, each of Honeywell's operating segments have been focusing on expanding its data footprint. This approach is beneficial because software is a high margin business, but as described by Mr. Adamczyk during the interview, Honeywell focusing on software/data will also allow for the company to better manage its earnings profile:The Garrett Motion (GTX) and Resideo (REZI) spinoffs should act as catalysts as the company enters 2020. This smoothing of earnings, which will undoubtedly be a 5- to 10-year story, will be especially important when future recessions hit. Will Honeywell be immune to the next downturn? No, but I do believe that the company's new (and changing) business profile will help Honeywell weather the storms. This point of the company being a good stock to hold in a volatile market was actually recently made by Barclays when Honeywell was given a ""Buy"" rating with a price target of $187.At the end of the day, Mr. Adamczyk was simply just doing his job when he highlighted Honeywell's business prospects in the software space during the Charlotte Business Journal interview, but let's also remember that the company's financial results (and operating metrics) also supports this part of the investment thesis. So yes, Honeywell's management team has a good story to tell, but it helps that the story is also verifiable.HON's shares are not cheap by any means, as shown by the Seeking Alpha valuation grades.Source: Seeking AlphaTwo things to note: (1) Honeywell is by far the best run industrial conglomerate so the sector median should not be a major focus, and (2) Honeywell is now a different company, remember the spinoffs, so its earnings potential going forward is greater than it has been in the past. I say all of this to say, Honeywell's stock is not cheap but let us remember that this best-of-breed industrial conglomerate has the potential to more than grow into its current valuation.A global recession is the most significant risk to my investment thesis, at least in the near term. I do not believe that a recession is not likely to happen over the next 12 months, but if one were to materialize, Honeywell's businesses would be negatively impacted in a major way. Furthermore, investor sentiment is extremely bullish for Honeywell at this point in time and it largely revolves around the prospects for the aerospace division, so a slowdown in this industry would likely result in shares selling off.Honeywell is the best-run industrial conglomerate and the company has promising long-term business prospects, especially in the industrial internet of things (""IIoT"") and software space. Therefore, the investment approach is simple: stick with what has been working. Honeywell's stock has performed well for an extended period of time and I do not see this changing anytime soon.Additionally, the SEC closing the case related to Honeywell's accounting for asbestos claims without recommending any enforcement action may turn out to be another catalyst for the stock. Investors with a time horizon longer than a year should treat HON pullbacks, especially if they are caused by broader market concerns, as long-term buying opportunities."
4290441,104812,2019-09-09T09:00:00-04:00,HON has announced an increase to the quarterly rate of its dividend in September in each of the last two years.Article forecasts a dividend increase to be announced later this month including an analysis on the payout trends.Our view on the future dividend growth potential.,"Honeywell International Inc. (NYSE:HON), with a history going back to the 19th century, is a global diversified industrial giant with a market cap of $123 billion. The company operates across four segments including Aerospace, Building Technologies, Performance Materials, and Safety and Productivity Solutions. The stock has been a consistent winner over the past decade and up nearly 500% since 2009 on a total return basis. Investors may also be attracted to the company's established history as a dividend grower given it has increased the quarterly rate each year since 2011. This article looks at the company's payout and forecasts another dividend rate hike for later this month.(Source: FinViz.com)Honeywell does not have a formal dividend policy but in its 2018 annual report mentioned that it intends to grow the dividend in line with earnings. Curiously, when announcing its 2017 dividend rate hike, the company mentioned that it ""remains committed to growing the dividend faster than earnings for shareholders."" In 2018, the statement was changed to say, ""Honeywell remains committed to delivering value to shareowners through our aggressive capital deployment strategy."" So, there is a bit of ambiguity but nevertheless we are confident that Honeywell will keep a pattern of dividend growth. As we discuss below, the payout is well supported by the company's balance sheet position while positive earnings growth expectations are also a favorable trend.The rate hike has been above double-digits in percentage terms, averaging 12% over the past 8 years. Back in 2011, the company actually increased the quarterly rate twice, once in Q1 and again for the Q4 distribution. This year we are forecasting the next announcement on Friday, September 27, in line with the previous two years of a declaration on the last Friday of the month. It's unclear why the company moved up the announcement date to September starting in 2017 which had previously been in late October. One consideration is that a larger time frame between the announcement and record date allows more potential investors to purchase shares and become eligible for the payment.The record date and payment date history have been more consistent in the middle of November and early December each, respectively. We note that the record date has been set on the third Friday of November while the payment date has been the first Friday of December since 2016. A trend in the industry is for investor relations and finance departments of these major corporations to have a more standardized and predictable distribution schedule. A large surprise on either the timing or amount of a dividend can add to stock price volatility which management typically looks to avoid. We forecast the record date to be set on Friday, November 15, 2019, with the payment to occur on Friday, December 6, 2019.HON history of annual dividend rate hike. Source: data by YCharts/table authorIn terms of the payout ratios it's important to remember that when the Board of Directors votes and sets a new rate, it does so often times in conjunction with management guidance. They are not only looking at the recent financial performance but also a forward outlook. In this regard, Honeywell has had a positive year, last reporting fiscal Q2 earnings in July with EPS up 9% year over year while setting earnings growth guidance for the full year in the range of 8% to 10%.Strong free cash flow has been a theme for the company and it also chooses to buy back a significant number of shares in an ongoing stock repurchase program. This Q2 the company repurchased $1.9 billion in shares compared to the quarterly dividend payout of about $600 million. As of June 30, the company reported $8.7 billion remaining in its share buyback authorization. Clearly, the company favors these buybacks over the regular dividend but recognizes the importance of a well-rounded shareholder remuneration. For reference, the company earned about $7 billion in net income over the past year, generating approximately $5.4 billion in free cash flow. Honeywell reported a cash and equivalents position of $9.9 billion to end Q2 with $8.6 billion in outstanding long-term debt. Overall, we think the liquidity and balance sheet position are solid and the payout is safe.The metric that best describes Honeywell's dividend payout is the ratio to adjusted free cash flow which has averaged 40% since 2013. Considering data over the trailing twelve months through Q2, the ratio is 39.4% over the past year. Earnings, including the GAAP diluted payout ratio and the adjusted EPS measure, have been more volatile this decade considering the number of spin-offs and non-recurring items like the 2018 tax reform benefit. Management uses the adjusted EPS and adjusted free cash flow figure in its earnings presentations which exclude items like pension expenses and spin-off costs.Honeywell Historical Payout Ratios. Source: Company IR/table by author Considering management guidance for free cash flow in the range of $5.7bn to $6.0bn for the full year 2019, any dividend increase this year will push the free cash flow payout ratio slightly higher but still within the historical range. We forecast Honeywell to increase the quarterly rate to $0.90 per share, a 9.8% increase. While not technically ""double-digit increase,"" the precedent here is back in 2013 when it hiked the rate 9.76% to $0.45 and apparently 'rounded-up' in describing a double-digit percentage increase in subsequent investor communications.Consensus estimates see Honeywell growing earnings at that all important 10% rate in 2020 and 2021. Considering relatively stable margins and a flat conversion to free cash flow, these forecasts would support a dividend increase by the same amount each year over the period without too much pressure on the payout ratio. If these estimates are confirmed, the company would have room to push for an even $1.00 quarterly dividend rate by next year which is our forecast. The bigger question becomes how fragile these forecasts are to cyclical trends and global economic conditions. Should economic growth deteriorate, it is likely earnings would take a hit and the payout ratio would have to be pushed higher.Data by YChartsWe think it's prudent for Honeywell to stay on the lower end of any increase while keeping the story of a double-digit percentage increase going as earnings are decelerating to the high single-digits compared to higher rates earlier in the decade. Going forward out a couple of years, it will become more and more difficult to sustain the dividend increases at the same double-digit percentage rate unless there is a clear acceleration in earnings and free cash flow growth. The large share repurchasing program is a major component of its capital allocation but at the same time provides a dividend safety level in that it could cut back on buybacks to support the dividend if necessary. The balance sheet position is overall a source of strength and the payout safe for the foreseeable future under current circumstances.To recap, we are forecasting Honeywell International to declare its next dividend on Friday, September 27, 2019, and increase the quarterly rate by $0.08 to $0.90 per share. Separately, we expect the record date to be set on Friday, November 15, 2019, with the payment date of Friday, December 6, 2019. The new dividend rate if confirmed would represent a forward annualized dividend yield of 2.1%."

Analysts expect revenue of $9.35 billion and EPS of $2.08. The revenue estimate implies 5% growth sequentially. Investors should focus on the following key items:Bulls seem to fancy HON as a growth stock. Parsing through its earnings fundamentals requires an understanding of the economy and company specific issues. After trillions in stimulus from central bankers, the global economy has to peak at some point. If we are at peak economy, then industrial names like Honeywell may have seen their best days. In Q1 2019, Honeywell's revenue fell 15% Y/Y. Aerospace and Building Materials were hit hard, experiencing double-digit revenue declines.The company has been hiving off underperforming assets and becoming more strategically focused. Last year, the company spun off thermostat maker Resideo Technologies (REZI) and turbo charger maker Garrett Motion (GTX). The divestitures triggered the revenue decline.However, Honeywell's organic sales were strong. Aerospace generated 10% organic revenue growth on the strength of aviation and defense orders. Given the strength of commercial air travel and President Trump's emphasis on defense spending, this segment could show strength for several more quarters. This is important, as Aerospace represents Honeywell's largest segment at 38% of total revenue. Organic revenue growth from Building Technologies, Performance Materials (""PMT"") and Safety, Production and Solutions (""SPS"") was 9%, 5% and 10%, respectively.Given the noise created by asset sales, revenue growth sequentially could also be important. The company's revenue growth Q/Q was also off by 9%. Building Technologies revenue fell 23%, while every other segment reported a Q/Q revenue decline in the single-digit range. The revenue estimate for Q2 implies 5% growth Q/Q. I anticipate a big quarter from Aerospace. SPS could report strong growth from the Internet of Things (""IoT"") and industrial automation. I remain skeptical on where the other areas of growth will come from.Honeywell's segment profits of $1.8 billion fell 9% Y/Y, which was much less than the decline in revenue. Segment profit margins of 20% were 100 basis points higher than that of Q1 2018. Margins for Aerospace bounced 250 basis points due to commercial excellence and the spin off of Transportation Systems. Building Technologies reported a 240 basis point improvement, driven by the spinoff of the Home business. PMT margins improved by 140 basis points from restructuring efforts. SPS segment margins contracted by 250 basis points due to a decrease in productivity products and unfavorable mix; higher sales from warehouse and automation businesses could continue to drag down margins.The improvement in segment profit was positive, and likely expected after the spin off of less attractive businesses. The falling margins from SPS could continue unless the business mix changes. Meanwhile, margin improvement from productivity gains and restructuring efforts at other business segments could eventually run its course. That is a long-winded way of saying HON bulls may not be able to rely on continuous margin improvement over the long term.Honeywell has made strategic moves to improve margins and unlock hidden value. It trades at over 17x run-rate EBITDA (Q1 2019 annualized); in my opinion, this is too robust for a cyclical name. Unless one assumes government stimulus will spur financial markets in perpetuity, then HON is overvalued. Sell HON."
4276154,24361,2019-07-19T18:02:07-04:00,"Aerospace, process automation, and building products continue to combine for above-average growth at Honeywell, offsetting weakness in safety and productivity.Ongoing productivity initiatives and strong trends in aerospace should offset most of the risks of wobblier end-market conditions in non-residential construction and process automation.Honeywell's better positioning in this part of the cycle could make it a safe haven for institutions, but valuation is already quite robust.","In a quarter where it has becoming increasingly clear that short-cycle industrial markets are slumping and long-cycle markets are starting to wobble, Honeywell’s (HON) steady performance and minor beat-and-raise for the second quarter certainly solidifies the safe haven credentials that have been part of my bullish thesis on the stock. With a strong Aerospace segment and steady performance in Building Tech and PMT offsetting temporary weakness in Safety and Productivity, there’s not much that concerns me about the performance for the company.What does concern me is the valuation. Although Honeywell has modestly outperformed industrials since my last update, almost all of that outperformance came in the post-earnings jump. Moreover, I’m concerned that we’re going to see a downward revision cycle after this earnings reporting cycle across industrials and a reset in valuations as investors accept that the second-half rebound thesis is looking pretty shaky. I do believe that Honeywell’s valuation could continue to exceed historical norms as institutions flock to own one of the few industrial stocks that’s “working”, but I don’t like playing the game of assuming that above-trend valuation will continue to expand at a time when the sector is seeing downward re-ratings.I have liked Honeywell for its relatively low exposure to problematic short-cycle industrial markets and its significant exposure to longer-cycle markets with good growth characteristics like aerospace. That all came together to deliver a pretty good second quarter, with segment level profits beating expectations by a penny.Overall revenue rose 5% on an organic basis, led by Aerospace at 11%. Within Aerospace, Defense and Space was particularly strong, with an impressive 20% organic growth rate, though the 8% growth in Commercial Aftermarket is quite good too. Building Tech and PMT both did fine, with 5% and 4% organic growth respectively, as Honeywell saw 5% growth in the refinery-driven UOP business and 5% growth in its process automation business, while the more diversified Advanced Materials grew 2%.Safety and Productivity was the outlier and the problem child with a 4% organic revenue contraction in the quarter. Safety was up a little (up 1%), helped some by the gas detection business, but Productivity was down 7%. The Productivity Products business was down a surprising 26% (not encouraging for Zebra (ZBRA) ), Sensing/IoT was flat, and Warehouse/Workflow slowed from 50%+ growth in Q1 to just 7% growth as warehouse automation project activity slowed against tough comps.Adjusted segment profit rose more than 8% in the quarter (slightly better than expected), with 80bp of margin improvement. Building Tech, up a reported 8%, was the best performer relative to expectations (and reported segment margin improved by almost four points), but Aero and PMT both outperformed expectations as well, offsetting a significant shortfall in the SPS business.With second quarter results in hand, management nudged the full-year organic revenue growth target higher (from 4.5% at the midpoint to 5%) and maintained margin guidance of 20.7% to 21%.As I said, the weak performance in Productivity Products isn’t good news for Zebra. As far as the Warehouse business goes, Kion and Daifuku had previously warned that 2019 would be a slower year warehouse automation, but Honeywell’s performance in scanning and warehouse/workflow is not encouraging for Cognex (CGNX) in the near term. I’d say the same about Keyence (KYCFF), but that company is so cryptic about its reporting, that it’s hard to say.Elsewhere, the Building Tech results are modestly encouraging for Emerson (EMR), Schneider (OTCPK:SBGSY), and Johnson Controls (JCI) and the UOP results could be seen as at least somewhat positive for Innospec (IOSP). Weakness in safety products is discouraging news for 3M (MMM), as is the generally weaker growth in Advanced Materials. Strong defense activity should be good news for Lockheed (LMT) among others.I’m not feeling great about where the industrial sector is as a whole, although I think Honeywell’s elevated exposure to aerospace, process automation, and building controls will help it outperform on a relative basis.Short-cycle markets are definitely in trouble, with weak results from Sandvik (SVDKY), SKF (OTCPK:SKFRY), and Yaskawa (OTCPK:YASKY). I’m also a little concerned about some longer-cycle markets, as Atlas Copco (OTCPK:ATLKY) warned of project push-outs, and Alfa Laval (OTCPK:ALFVY) had a very weak number for Marine orders. Honeywell’s warehouse automation business is definitely slowing, and Endress + Hauser (Rockwell’s (ROK) privately-owned process automation partner) previously guided to just mid-single-digit growth for 2019, so the outlook for companies like Emerson may be eroding.My bigger concern is how this plays out relative to expectations. The market was counting on a relatively healthy second quarter with guidance for a second half rebound, and I don’t think that’s going to happen. Moreover, freight and inventory data suggest that there might have been some channel-stuffing across the sector to help push second quarter numbers. If that all plays out, I think there are future cuts to earnings and lower valuation multiples on the way. Honeywell should be able to sail by a lot of this, though I do think there could be downward pressure on multiples.I’ve made almost no changes to my Honeywell model beyond some fine-tuning. Recent presentations (the Investor Day, EPG, and Paris Air Show) give me confidence in my margin expansion assumptions, as well as my FCF margin expansion assumptions (lower working capital needs down the road), and I’m still comfortable with a low-to-mid single-digit revenue growth rate (adjusting for the spin-outs) and a mid-single-digit FCF growth rate. M&A is a wildcard, but it doesn’t sound like Honeywell has a particularly large appetite for large M&A deals, though a steeper downturn in the industrial sector could make management more opportunistic.Honeywell seems priced for mid-single-digit annualized long-term returns now. I suppose that’s acceptable for a high-quality company, but I tend to aim for more with my investing. Consequently, I’m more inclined to stay on the sidelines unless/until a broader decline in industrial stock valuations brings Honeywell’s valuation down a bit."
4278701,65113,2019-07-29T13:35:29-04:00,Honeywell International (HON) has continued to see growth in the most recent quarter.Margin growth in the Aerospace segment has been particularly impressive.I expect further upside from here.,"At the beginning of last month, I made the argument that Honeywell International (HON) is likely too expensive at a price of $164 (where the stock was trading at the time).Specifically, I made the argument that an investor should be seeing a significant increase in free cash flow to justify investment at such a price. Otherwise, an investment at the $140-150 range would be more reasonable.At the time of writing, Honeywell International is trading at a price of $173:Source: investing.comClearly, the stock's growth has exceeded my prior expectations. What is particularly interesting is that when taking into account the company's recent performance in the most recent quarter, we can see that free cash flow growth has actually dropped from that of the previous year, with adjusted free cash flow conversion also having fallen slightly:Source: Honeywell Second Quarter 2019 Earnings ReleaseWith this being said, the company has continued to grow, with sales and EPS up by 5% and 9% respectively:Source: Honeywell Second Quarter 2019 Earnings ReleaseMoreover, on a segment basis, we also observe that the company saw double-digit margin growth, with the highest coming from the Aerospace segment:Source: Honeywell Second Quarter 2019 Earnings ReleaseMoreover, when looking at the company's EBITDA performance, we can see that growth in this metric has risen steadily in the past year, while the EV to EBITDA ratio is trading at the same level it was at the beginning of 2018:Source: ycharts.comIn this regard, I may have overemphasized the importance of free cash flow growth for this company. While growth in this metric may have declined slightly, the company still has a highly impressive conversion rate of 100%. Moreover, we can see that the debt to equity level for this company has continued to fall - and for a company that operates in a capital-intensive industry, Honeywell's performance on this front is highly impressive:Source: ycharts.comFrom a financial standpoint, I see Honeywell as being in a good position to rise further. The market is clearly valuing earnings growth over free cash flow performance, and the company's low debt levels are highly attractive.Looking forward, Honeywell's continued strong performance in the aerospace segment looks likely to continue. While the grounding of Boeing's (BA) 737 MAX aircraft type has led to uncertainty in the airline industry, there is little evidence to suggest that this is having any impact on Honeywell given its role as a Boeing supplier.Additionally, with the company's recent acquisition of TruTrak Flight Systems, a leading autopilot provider for both certified and experimental aircraft - this opens up a market for Honeywell that has seen double-digit growth over the past five-year period. This will further expand Honeywell's reach in the aerospace industry, and solidify its position as a leading provider in the industry.In my opinion, Honeywell's financials and business model are quite impressive. The company has low debt, continues to show long-term growth in earnings and free cash flow, and is maintaining growth across its key business segments. I reverse my prior view that the company is expensive at this price, and expect that should we continue to see growth, Honeywell could quite possibly breach the $180 mark by the next quarter."
4256449,24361,2019-04-24T18:30:00-04:00,"Honeywell posted a surprisingly strong 8% organic revenue growth rate, with strong results in aerospace, automation, and building tech.
        Margin leverage was okay and management's commentary suggests healthy demand for long-cycle businesses amidst some ongoing uncertainty for shorter-cycle industrial markets.
        M&A remains a potential source of value, but Honeywell's share price already reflects its status as a top-tier quality growth company.","At the risk of drifting into the territory of a broken record, Honeywell’s (HON) performance continues to back up my view of the company as one of the best multi-industrials today. With Honeywell’s longer-cycle businesses hitting the sweet spots of their cycles, the company’s growth is finding another gear at a time when shorter-cycle results are likely to be choppier.With its core businesses doing well (and with runways to do even better) and ample capacity to do more M&A, but no particular necessity, the only issue I have with Honeywell is, predictably enough, the price. It’s tough for me to push my valuation models beyond a fair value of $170 today, and I think Honeywell is now enjoying the status as a Wall Street darling and growth safe haven. Honeywell has earned this love and I wouldn’t advise stepping in front of this freight train, but it’s tougher to get excited about the returns on offer from this high level.I’m sure there will be some companies that exceed Honeywell’s first quarter results, but I think this is going to be a tough bar for other multi-industrials beat. Revenue fell by almost 15% as reported due to the company’s spin-offs (Garrett Motion (GTX) and Resideo (REZI)), but organic growth came in at an eye-popping 8% and roughly 3% above expectations in a quarter where there were still plenty of concerns that multi-industrials would walk back guidance for a stronger second half.Honeywell saw good results across most of the business. Aerospace led with 10% growth, as the commercial OE business grew 10%, the commercial AM business grew 8%, and defense grew 13%; these numbers were broadly in line with the double-digit growth reported in United Technologies’ (UTX) aerospace businesses.Building Technologies reported 9% organic growth, which again seems consistent with the 7% growth at UTX Otis and Schneider’s (OTCPK:SBGSY) commentary, even allowing for the different business mixes. Safety and Productivity Solutions saw 10% organic growth on very strong growth on the Productivity side (up 10%, spurred by double-digit growth at Intelligrated) and flat results at Safety – a result foreshadowed by Fastenal’s (FAST) results.Last and not least, Performance Materials and Technologies revenue rose 5%, with just 1% growth at UOP and 4% growth at Advanced Materials, and 7% growth in process automation. UOP and Advanced Materials have been laggards for some time now, which makes this result somewhat disappointing but not really surprising.Gross margin improved by three points, though it came in about a point shy of expectations. The year-over-year comparison for segment profit isn’t so relevant given the spins, but segment profit was 2% greater than the sell-side expected and the segment margin was in the middle of management’s guidance range. Aero and PMT saw good organic margin leverage, while SPS saw margin erosion (due in part to the lower-margin Intelligrated revenues) and HBT’s margin improvement was driven largely by the Resideo spin.All told, about half of Honeywell’s 5% beat on the bottom line came from ongoing operating outperformance, with the rest come from taxes and other assorted below-the-line items. I suppose a real nitpicker could argue that the margin leverage was a little lacking given the strong organic revenue growth, but I’m not going there.Honeywell noted ongoing uncertainty in short-cycle markets, and that corroborates some of the lackluster results from ABB’s (ABB) Industrial Automation business, the 1% growth at Lincoln Electric (LECO), and the slight contraction at Sandvik’s (OTCPK:SDVKY) SMS business. On the other hand, Dover (DOV) posted 8% organic growth and that is not an especially long-cycle company.With that, I’d say “uncertainty” is a good word for what’s going on. I expect companies with exposure to longer-cycle markets like aerospace and process automation will do alright (or better), but shorter-cycle discrete manufacturing companies could have more trouble. That means that upcoming earnings from companies like 3M (MMM), Rockwell (ROK), and Illinois Tool Works (ITW) could be more challenging, while I expect Eaton (ETN), Emerson (EMR), and Ingersoll-Rand (IR) should be okay.Specific to Honeywell, I expect the company to “keep on keeping on”. The trends its riding in aerospace, process automation, warehouse automation, and building systems should still have room to run (at least into 2020), and warehouse automation in particular is still a very attractive market. On the process automation side, Honeywell and Emerson could both see a “stronger for longer” trend driven by LNG; whether ABB can join in remains to be seen.Honeywell management has made it clear that they’d like to do more M&A, but they’ve been equally clear that they’re not approaching the market with a blank check. I’ve speculated in the past on what Honeywell could buy, and among the larger names, I still think Datalogic (OTC:DLGCF) and Cognex (CGNX) make sense, but the latter is problematic from a valuation perspective. It’s an “out there” idea, but Rockwell could be a theoretical possibility, and there is a long list of other names that make some sense.Based on the strong start, I’m boosting my modeling assumptions for Honeywell. I’m not making huge changes to my core assumptions, but I do think underlying organic growth (adjusting for the spins) can approximate 4% to 5% over the long term with some incremental FCF margin improvement.Unfortunately, whether I use discounted cash flow or the more aggressive margin/return-driven EV/EBITDA approach, none of this suggests Honeywell is “cheap” right now. There’s no reason that a high-profile, well-run business like Honeywell should be cheap, so it’s not as though I feel that anything about this is unreasonable. While I realize there’s a school of thought that basically believes in ignoring valuation and simply investing with quality and momentum, and I can appreciate that to a point, Honeywell is certainly outside of my preferred buy range now. I don’t expect Honeywell to get cheap soon unless the market gets spooked, but this is definitely a name I’d pick up on a pullback."
4257562,79675,2019-04-28T21:19:25-04:00,"Honeywell reported strong Q1 2019 results that beat the top- and bottom-line estimates. Management also raised its full-year 2019 guidance.Additionally, Honeywell's margin profile is a key component of the bull case. So it is encouraging that the company's operating margin was over 20% again this past quarter.I am long Honeywell and I plan to stay long the stock.","Honeywell's (HON) stock has outperformed the broader market by almost 6 percentage points over the last year.Data by YChartsIn addition, HON shares are higher by ~28% so far in 2019 and, in my opinion, the stock still has room to run. As I previously described, the recent spinoffs - Garrett Motion (NYSE:GTX) and Resideo (REZI) - have Honeywell better positioned for the future and I believe that the company's most recent operating results show that there is a lot to like about this industrial conglomerate in today's environment. More specifically, Honeywell's margin profile makes the stock a great long-term buy even at current levels.On April 18, 2019, Honeywell reported better-than-expected Q1 2019 adjusted EPS of $1.92 (beat by $0.08) on revenue of $8.9B (beat by $0.26B). The company's Q1 2019 financial results were also significant improvements from what was reported in the year-ago quarter (ex-spins revenue and adjusted EPS were up 8% and 13%, respectively).Source: Q1 2019 Earnings PresentationThe highlights from the quarter:There was a lot to like about Honeywell's Q1 2019 results, but in my opinion, margins are the real story for this industrial conglomerate. To this point, segment margins were over 20% for the second straight quarter with Aerospace leading the charge.Source: Q1 2019 Earnings PresentationDuring the first three months of 2019, Aerospace's margin benefited from several factors (e.g., the Transportation Systems spin and internal projects within the commercial business). However, as shown above, Aerospace was not the only segment that had margin expansion (i.e., segment margins were up by over 100bps for three of the four operating units). And it is important to note that Honeywell's impressive margin profile is nothing new as this has been an area of focus for management since Darius Adamczyk took over as CEO. This was actually a topic that Mr. Adamczyk covered during the Q1 2019 conference call:As expected, the company's margins were greatly impacted by the spinoffs (sometimes smaller is better). Additionally, the investments made over the last two-plus years are already paying huge dividends when it comes to margins and, in my opinion, investors should expect more of the same through at least 2020.To this point, management expects margins to remain above 20% over the next nine months, but it also raised its full-year 2019 guidance for sales, EPS, and adjusted FCF.Source: Q1 2019 Earnings PresentationTherefore, looking forward, investors should begin to bake in expectations for Honeywell to have a strong finish to the current year, which should bode well for HON shareholders.Investors in industrial companies were encouraged after Honeywell and United Technologies (UTX) reported strong Q1 2019 results (UTX reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings and revenue) but sentiment changed when 3M (MMM) reported disappointing Q1 2019 results (3M reported results that missed the top- and bottom-line estimates).3M, in my opinion, dealt with several self-inflicted wounds that had a material impact on its operating results during Q1 2019. As such, I do not think that it would be wise to use 3M's poor performance as a read through for the broader industrial sector. Additionally, it recently announced that the economy grew by 3.2% in Q1 2019, which was well above forecasts.Source: MarketWatchAnother positive development is the fact that 77% of the S&P 500 companies that have reported Q1 2019 results so far have beaten their EPS estimates for Q1 2019.Source: FactSetThe 77% is above the five-year average (72%) and, as shown, the industrials have had a strong showing so far. This is a positive sign for the sector and, more specifically, it is encouraging if you own the best house in a good neighborhood - i.e., Honeywell. It also helps the bull case that HON shares are still reasonably valued.To start, Honeywell's stock is not cheap by any means. For example, HON shares are trading at 21x forward estimates.Data by YChartsHowever, Honeywell is a best-of-breed company in the industrial space, in my opinion, so it makes sense that the conglomerate is trading at a slight premium. Moreover, the ability that management has shown to expand Honeywell's margins will, in my opinion, create significant shareholder value over the next few years.Let's also not forget that the broader market is close to all-time highs so 21x forward estimates - earnings estimates that may very likely turn out to be too conservative - is not as rich as you might think.At the end of the day, Honeywell is the best-run industrial conglomerate that operates in an industry that has promising prospects. Moreover, the internal investments and recent spinoffs have already greatly impacted Honeywell's margin profile and I believe that Mr. Adamczyk and team have more levers to pull that have the potential to propel HON shares higher over the next three-to-five years. As such, investors with a time horizon longer than a year should treat HON pullbacks, especially if they are caused by broader market concerns, as long-term buying opportunities."
4267848,65113,2019-06-03T00:32:30-04:00,"Honeywell International has seen lower free cash flow growth than I anticipated over the past year.The stock may be trading above fair value at this price.However, free cash flow growth could increase if we start to see double-digit growth from Intelligrated continue.","Last October, I made the argument that Honeywell International (HON) remained undervalued on a free cash flow basis at a price of $150, with a price target of $220-230 seeming more appropriate.Fast forward to today and the stock currently trades at $165, but not before having seen a sizable drop down to a low of $124 at the end of last year:(Source: Investing.com)On this basis, does a price target range of $220-230 continue to look realistic for this company? Upon revising my prior free cash flow forecast, I take the view that a target price of $180 may be more realistic for the stock at this point in time.On a price-to-free cash flow basis (which is the primary metric that I used to argue for further upside), we see that free cash flow per share has risen by nearly 60% over the past five years, while the price-to-free cash flow ratio is up by 12%:(Source: YCharts)From a bird’s eye view, the stock appears to have further upside built in.As regards my target price, I originally made the following assumptions about the stock last August:(Source: Calculations from previous article)One year later, free cash flow has grown by just over 2%, with a cumulative 30% growth over the past three years. Moreover, the price-to-free cash flow ratio currently stands at 22x. In this calculation, I also factor in assumed dividend growth per year of 10% (having grown by 37% over the past three years).Assuming a more modest rate of growth of 10% in free cash flow for the next four years, $180 is yielded as a new target price:(Source: Author’s calculations)Based on the revised assumptions for dividend and free cash flow growth, the stock does not appear to have as much upside as I previously anticipated. At the end of January, another SA author outlined his rationale for Honeywell International being fairly valued at a price of $142, and this would likely mark a better entry point into the stock given the current rates of growth.As an industrial company, the main reason that Honeywell saw a significant price drop towards the end of last year was the spin-offs of the Transportation Systems and Homes and ADI Global Distributions businesses, as well as adverse foreign currency translations. While sales were down by 15% on a reported basis, they were up by 8% on an organic basis.The business model for Honeywell itself continues to remain strong. For instance, its 2016 acquisition of Intelligrated for $1.5 billion has seen this company grow its sales by double digits, and with two-thirds of the top 50 U.S. retailers using Intelligrated’s technology, we may well see an acceleration in free cash flow growth going forward should this trend continue.Moreover, with adjusted free cash flow conversion having increased to 82% from 68% from the same period last year, the company is demonstrating more efficiency at generating cash flow more efficiently.No investment in a company is without risk, and Honeywell International is no exception.Specifically, given the nature of its business, fluctuations in raw material costs have the potential to affect profitability significantly.For instance, prices of metals such as steel significantly influence costs across the Aerospace segment, while copper prices are known to significantly impact performance in Performance Materials and Technologies.That said, trade tensions between the US and China have seen prices for steel and copper fall quite significantly, with the latter hitting its lowest price level since 2015. In this regard, the risk of a significant metals price surge appears to be low from a macroeconomic perspective, but long-term rises in price can have an impact on Honeywell's business.Given that the company has been significantly dependent on acquisitions to enter new markets and ultimately expand its business, a much bigger risk to Honeywell is the management of such acquisitions. A key consideration in executing acquisitions effectively is maintaining enough free cash flow to fund the same.To Honeywell's credit, this company has continued to increase its free cash flow conversion rate.(Source: Honeywell May 2019 Investor Conference Presentation)However, given that we have seen a significant moderation in free cash flow growth, this could significantly impact the company's ability to make further acquisitions in the future, which in turn could lead to decreased performance.To conclude, I take the view that Honeywell remains a strong business but might be too expensive at this price. What would make this stock a potential buy for me would be 1) a more reasonable price in the $140-150 range, or ideally 2) a significant increase in free cash flow growth as a result of both higher free cash flow conversion and further growth in Intelligrated, which translates to the bottom line in terms of FCF growth.Additional disclosure: This article is written on an ""as is"" basis and without warranty.

4255732,43041,2019-04-22T13:14:33-04:00,"HON spun off 20% of sales in two actions in H2 last year, but the market cap loss was minimal.The company may do further spins going forward, but it has a more coherent, more growth-oriented structure now.HON has beaten its peers and the SPY for most of the past decade.An overview of its current strengths and opportunity to continue to provide alpha in the years ahead is provided as a starting point for further research.","Honeywell (HON), once an unwieldy conglomerate, is looking sprightly and has provided this post-great recession performance versus a major comparator, United Technologies (UTX) and the S&P 500 (SPY):Data by YChartsThis shows impressive and ongoing alpha. Interestingly, not only HON and UTX - which plans to split into three parts next year - but also the very challenged GE (GE) represent three relatively similar industrial conglomerates all of which are doing or have done some degree of de-conglomeration. I first bought HON in Q1 last year when it sold off with the market and the CEO insisted that at around $140, it was extremely cheap. I have also been long UTX for about two years and look at its negative alpha as poised to reverse once the 3-way split is accomplished. (I also took a flyer that GE would revive under the leadership of John Flannery but took my loss and moved on many moons ago.) Overall, my sense is that US manufacturing companies with a global presence can be good investments going forward, given the paucity of criticism of the administration's policy thrust for the re-industrialization of America.HON's latest style of simplification occurred in the second half of last year. First, a little-known division, Garrett, was spun off to shareholders as Garrett Motion (GTX); it manufacturers turbochargers. Second, in late December, a larger spin off of home products company Resideo (REZI) was accomplished. It's interesting that these spins involved 20% of company revenues, but the total market cap of GTX + REZI is only $4 B. In contrast, the remaining HON has a market cap of $119 B at Friday's close of $169.06, an all-time closing high.I'm not going to discuss GTX or REZI, both of which I sold soon after their spins.HON is now a ""new"" company, with less than $3 B in estimated asbestos liabilities and a growth and margin expansion story I like. The body of this article discusses various aspects of the company and stock, beginning with valuation.Per S&P's weekly spreadsheet (click on ""Additional info,"" then on ""Index earnings""), consensus GAAP EPS for the SPY for 2019 has dropped recently about 10% to $149.61, which translates to a forward P/E of about 19.4X.In contrast, EPS estimates for HON have been increasing quarter after quarter. In its Q1 earnings release, HON beat expectations for EPS and revenue and guided up to a range of $7.90-8.15. Given that HON routinely beats, not having missed in at least 10 straight quarters, I'll go with $8.15. I believe this is on the conservative side for comparative purposes to the SPY because it continues to include some costs related to the spins. At Friday's closing price of HON at $169, that gives a 20.7x PE. Thus HON's premium to the SPY is about 6.8%.If HON were an average company, then maybe it would be marginally overvalued versus the SPY, but it's not.Ex-currency, and adjusting for the spins, HON grew sales 8% yoy in Q1; 5% including currency. Sales growth was driven largely by its long-cycle rather than short-cycle divisions, but clearly, its diverse set of products helped it. The 8% ex-currency growth exceeds that of its peers. I treat it as sustainable. Note, analysts keep waiting for more M&A activity from HON, but the CEO, now Darius Adamczyk since 2017, keep saying they have strict criteria for ROIC and that deal prices are too high. In other words, HON is growing at a very healthy clip and doing so heavily from within. Occasionally, it does an important deal such as Intelligrated, which is growing rapidly.Then, there is margin expansion and (related) free cash flow conversion.In the conference call, Mr. Adamczyk noted rising FCF conversion and projected 95-100% conversion of earnings to FCF in 2019. The company is executing on a business transformation which involves everything from improving the supply chain to greater coherency between different buckets of operations, with the plan to continually drive higher profit margins.The company is not in a rush to make acquisitions; it intends to innovate more. The CEO ended the Q&A by making this point:So, a company which has been outperforming its peers substantially, and the SPY substantially, for at least a decade is saying this about margin expansion in the conference call (emphasis added):And about sales:The questioning showed that analysts were impressed, with, as just one example, Andrew Obin prefacing his question with this comment:Given that by now everyone knows the global economy has slowed, and that HON has a number of short-cycle businesses, I think this was yet another superior quarter from one of the relatively unpublicized stars of the post-great recession market.If you are new to HON, a look at a Feb. 20 PowerPoint Presentation is helpful, especially Slide 3, ""New Honeywell at a Glance."" This company has numerous divisions and subdivisions. Many are tied to ongoing economic activity (short-cycle). As noted above, some are specifically high-tech. Thus, both as proxies for high-tech cycles and for the general global economy, it's worth looking at some charts of just how tough business is in some parts of the world. First, export-oriented South Korea showing a surge in forward P/E that in the past has predicted upturns following sell-offs/slowdowns:Next, Taiwan exports yoy:Both the above and other series suggest something like a 2012 and 2015-2016 period. Both ended with upside moves in the SPY and global economy. If that sort of thing is in train now, I'd rather be long HON given its sensitivity to the global economy than wait for clearer signs that the bottom is in. However, if I'm early, so be it. I expect the company has immense staying power.So, HON gives one an opportunity for cyclicality to work in one's favor. The timing of the cycle is up to each of us if we wish to take a market-timing approach or not.Aside from the above, I see HON as having no ""special"" major risks worth calling out, but risks exist in many ways, ranging from general market risks to unsuspected weaknesses in parts of the sprawling, diverse HON operations. Please review the 10-K and other documents for the company's discussion of risks attendant to owning HON shares.Having gone long HON roughly a year ago, my sense is that this is a very well-run company with many ways to provide alpha. Given its opportunities to grow at least a little faster than the economy (maybe more than a little) and its focus on margin expansion and on innovation, I think a higher premium to that of the SPY is appropriate. In addition, my thought that HON now has a corporate culture of continuous improvement gives me a high degree of confidence that at least it should track the SPY, even if it does not provide alpha. Thus, it makes sense to this retiree to be included in a diversified portfolio, being alert to opportunities to buy it off its highs.Thanks for reading and sharing any thoughts you wish to contribute."
4250900,104147,2019-03-25T15:45:04-04:00,"Since the beginning of 2019, Honeywell has gained 18% outperforming the S&P 500 (SPY) by 6.20%.Honeywell expects to generate a 2% to 5% growth in organic sales in 2019.A valuation from a Free Cash Flow perspective makes Honeywell a good investment.","Honeywell International Inc. (HON) is a technology and manufacturing company combining physical products with software systems for a more efficient and productive world. It operates through four businesses: Aerospace, Building Technologies, Safety and Productivity Solutions and Performance Materials and Technologies.By checking its yearly financial statements and based on the management's guidance for FY19, we are able to recommend buying the stock at current levels with a target price of $200.This conclusion depends on the company's ability to reach its targets, increase its profit margins and maintain a significant growth rate among its four segments for the coming years.SourceWe start our valuation by determining the company's beta (coefficient measuring systematic risk of the specific segment in comparison to the unsystematic risk of the whole market). Since the sources of revenues are divided into four main segments, we have to determine their individual contribution to the overall operating income of the company. We use the unlevered beta determined by Damodaran for each business segment separately to reach an accurate beta for the whole company reflecting its activity. As at 31 December 2018, the book value of equity was $18,358 Million, while its current market cap is approximately $113,501 Million. Also, the company's debt reached $16,214 Million on December 31 and can be summarized as below:Assuming this capital Structure will remain the same for the coming years, the company will be financed 87% through equity and 13% through debt. And with a marginal tax rate of 22% (as mentioned in their financial report), we will reach a levered beta for the entire company of 1.13.On the equity side, given that Honeywell has revenues and operations in different countries around the world, it is inappropriate to determine an equity premium in only one market. Accordingly, we will divide the revenues of the company across the regions to reach a weighted average equity risk premium of 6.88%.Given the current Risk Free Rate of 2.45% and having a beta of 1.13 (as mentioned above), we can conclude that the cost of equity of Honeywell is 10.20%.On the debt side, Standard and Poor's (S&P), Fitch, and Moody's have ratings on Honeywell's long-term debt of A, A and A2 respectively. Accordingly, we will assume a default spread of 1.10%.Adding the default spread to the current risk free rate, we will have an after tax cost of debt of 3.55% x (1 - 0.22) = 2.77%.Finally, by using all the above figures we will reach a weighted average cost of capital of 9.23%.For projecting the growth in Free Cash Flow to Firm of Honeywell over the next five years, we will take the average growth in FCFF during the previous 4 years and assume this rate will continue until 2023.By averaging the growth between 2015 and 2018, we can reach a growth rate of 9.46% that we will use in our study.Assuming a sustainable growth rate of 3% for year 6 and beyond, we will have a terminal value for the company of $133,055 Million which we will discount over 5 years to reach a value of $85,570 Million.We will reach a fair value for the operating assets of the company of $158,825 Million (Sum of the present values of free cash flows and the terminal value).In order to determine the value of Honeywell's equity, we need to account for the non-controlling interest which was valued at $178 Million in the company's financial statements. Since the average P/B value of the industry is 10.02, we can assume that the market value of the minority interests is $1,783 Million and conclude that the equity value is $151,738 Million as per below:Value of Equity = Value of Operating Assets + Cash - Debt - Value of Minority InterestsAs per the financial statements published by the company, the diluted number of shares is 753 Million. As such, we can conclude that the shares of Honeywell are currently undervalued and their fair value is $201, implying a potential 29% profit.Finally, all the above assumptions are subject to change and can be reached if Honeywell's management is able to meet the targets set for 2019.Source"

The Marketplace is our platform for authors to run services that provide research, guidance, and ideas to investors, and to lead investing communities. So we thought this newsletter would be a natural way to share some of those ideas and guidance on specific topics. We'll also highlight related articles and must-reads from our authors over the past week, and any developments on the Marketplace as a whole. Here's our first edition for reference.This week's panel features:Richard Berger: CAT reported great expectation beating results for 1st quarter 2019 and raised full year forecasts even more. Nonetheless, I see a lot of headwinds. CAT has been in a price bubble since late 2017 based on most of the valuation metrics that demonstrate good historical correlation to actual market prices. Current fair value-based on a clustering agreement of multiple valuation metric methodologies pegs CAT at about $107.00, placing the current $160 share price far into bubble territory. Even the 20% earnings growth in the new guidance only justifies a $137.00 valuation if it comes to pass. Storm clouds already have gathered. More than 50% of the quarterly YOY revenue increase was driven by price increases, a non-sustainable event. Furthermore, over 89% of these price increases were offset by forex currency translation losses. The outlook is for continued weakening of the Construction Industries segment, a possible swoon in the Resource Industries contribution as commodity prices and activity weaken along with the global economic trends, and a currently flat and perhaps forward declining Energy Industries segment.Michael Boyd: While not necessarily a large-cap investor, I do follow Caterpillar because as you mentioned it is a great bellwether. 3M Company (MMM) being another I follow closely which, by the way, reported an absolutely awful quarter to start the year.For Caterpillar, even backing out the $0.31/share in favorable one-time tax benefits, Caterpillar still beat consensus. No big surprises were embedded although as is the case with Deere (DE), the jump in inventories is concerning to me. This speaks to trepidation that customers have. Both domestic and global growth is slowing and high end industrial machinery is a big purchase commitment. Pulling the trigger is a tough decision.I think investors are waiting for the Caterpillar Analyst Day to get a better feel on margins and capital allocation strategy. Many just do not believe management optimism globally and want to see a commitment to conservatism. The financing arm, in particular, will be in the spotlight. Whether right or wrong, that market focus on conservatism broad implications for those of us investing in small caps where both leverage and revenue stream concentration tends to be higher. It has been easy to be on the wrong side of that prevailing market theme, buying the right companies at the wrong time.Dhierin Bechai: I think the entire industry is looking to streamline results throughout the year, but only a few can actually manage doing so. United Technologies (UTX) and Honeywell (HON) are two big companies with diverse segments and aerospace and defense programs and a disciplined approach towards their business. Both companies benefit from original equipment manufacturer sales as well as after-market sales in high growth industries (aerospace and defense) and that benefits them as well. It certainly is no given that more companies will be able to pull off the same.WG Investment Research: I believe that the strong earnings reports from Honeywell and United Technologies have broader significance, as the management teams for both of these industrial conglomerates appeared to be extremely bullish about fiscal 2019 (results from the past three months and what the remainder of the year may look like). For example, the management teams from Honeywell and United Technologies raised their full-year 2019 guidance. Moreover, even beaten down General Electric (GE) was able to report strong industrial operating results (excluding Power, of course) for the last three months of 2018. Aviation has been a great business to have operations in so it definitely makes sense that Honeywell, United Technologies and General Electric (i.e., the conglomerates that have material operations in the aviation space) have benefited from several industry-specific tailwinds.Per Fidelity, Industrials have underperformed the S&P 500 over the last year (as of April 24, 2019) but, looking forward, these large companies should benefit from an improving operating environment.Richard Berger: Honeywell has positioned itself across a group of industry segments that balance and complement each other, offering a path towards continuing growth and retaining long term recession resistant parts also. This is reflected in the latest earnings report that highlights this well-engineered mix of components. I have a fair value estimate of $160.00 for the shares and expect that to rise as the year progresses. The price surge since earnings release takes it out of position for an immediate new acquisition at market but the company should easily catch up with the current price via organic growth over the coming few months.Michael Boyd: Both companies are incredibly well run. If I were to buy a large-cap industrial, United Technologies would be it. I find the lack of a 2H 2019 reliance very interesting. Quite a few firms cited issues related to Q1/Q2 on a multitude of fronts. A big one has been volatility in commodity prices which led to some timing hits (selling expensive inventory at lower prices). The late 2018 global hiccup in the equity markets also had broad implications too when it came to deferred purchasing decisions from customers. Then there was also weather. When everyone is on edge about the next recession or, at the minimum, a strong slowdown in GDP growth, there has been little patience for management teams calling for a late-year recovery. That late-year recovery just might be too late.Dhierin Bechai: The Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX is incredibly important to Boeing. During the quarter, Boeing added $1B in costs to the accounting quantity that they use to determine profits. With over 4,400 aircraft undelivered and 3100 aircraft left in the accounting quantity that means a 0.6% margin headwind to all of the remaining deliveries in the accounting quantity. So that is a significant hit coming from just the decision to lower production from 52 aircraft per month to 42 aircraft per month. When it comes to other costs such as the costs for the MCAS system redesign, testing and certification, no numbers were provided. Boeing withdrew its 2019 outlook and did not provide any new guidance, so the exact impact of the Boeing 737 MAX is not known. At this stage we know the costs related to lowering production ($1B), that the costs of MCAS redesign and testing are marginal and Boeing experienced a $455 million hit in free cash flow which is a relatively small sum if you consider that Boeing intended to deliver $2.6B worth of 737 MAX aircraft on top of the ones already delivered during the first quarter. Despite pressures, it does seem that Boeing somewhat managed the cash hit and despite Boeing's cash pile being decimated by several hundreds of millions of dollars, the big cash crunch that some were expecting didn't occur. What remains is that Boeing at present has not been able to provide an updated guidance, which almost certainly will include downward revised outlook. Boeing tends to be judged on its free cash flow profile as well as its full year outlook, so it might somewhat surprising that investors haven't really punished Boeing for not providing an updated view. In the end, earnings weren't bad, but a key element namely the revised outlook was missing.Richard Berger: Boeing is the world's clear leader in air-frame manufacturing, with its product line having soundly beaten out the Airbus competition. Although the 2 crashes and the 100s of deaths from those are deeply unfortunate, the cause is clearly identified (in fact was known and with a fix in the works prior to the March crash). The issues with the MCAS flight automated flight control system, along with its reliance on a single fault sensor, will not require any significant design change to the air-frame, being the software and training changes coupled with the addition of redundant backup sensors to remedy the problem. The delivery delays, along with revenue timing impacts and damages to families and affected airlines, have already been factored into the share price. This is confirmed by the stability after the initial dip and continuing with weekly updated news and the updated numbers in the 4/24/19 earnings report and phone call. Boeing has plenty of liquidity to ride out the temporary revenue dip and its long term outlook remains unchanged, with any cancellations expected to be made up by new orders down the road. Meanwhile, BA's total backlog continues to increase, with significant new defense orders also.Boeing will face a weak 12 to 18 months ahead but the long term prospects remain excellent. With this already priced into the shares, many opportunities continue to exist right now. On March 13th, just days after the Ethiopian Airways crash, it became clear the issue was in the MCAS system and thus a well understood flaw with no threats to the air-frame basic design or other issues needing a revamp of the air-frame beyond already planned software and training fixes, together with probably need for retrofit of redundant sensors to avoid false stall warning triggers (the cause of the initial crash of Lion Air). With this information in hand, on 3/13/19 I told my E.I.I. subscribers to consider writing the cash secured 36-day put for BA 4/18/19 $360.00 @ $10.30 premium for a 28% annualized yield rate. On 4/1/19, I advised rolling that position forward a net 29 days for a net added premium of $3.95. We will roll that position ahead again very soon for similar yields in the 15% to 20% range and expect opportunities to continue doing so for several more months.Michael Boyd: I personally have not found much to worry about. I recently wrote about Boeing on Seeking Alpha, pointing out that short interest is actually lower today than it was late last year before the 737 MAX news broke. As a fellow short side investor, we're generally very good at collectively sniffing out companies where bad news isn't being priced in correctly. It just doesn't look to be the case here. If it were, shorts would be all over it given the ample liquidity and low borrow costs.Within the airplane duopoly, I don't think their business or order flow will be harmed much by this. Maybe we see less upfront financial capital commitments but the backlog will largely remain unharmed in my opinion. Financially, any hit they take is likely small relative to their balance sheet. Management did the right thing by suspending buybacks for the time being to preserve cash, something I've honestly called for because they were extremely aggressive (essentially borrowing to buy back shares if you run the math).Dhierin Bechai: I think Lockheed Martin's (NYSE:LMT) earnings beat stood out with higher segment profits in all of their segments. At times, when you read the news and see the US ordering more Super Hornets, you'd almost think that nobody wants the F-35 anymore. While it may be true for now that some budgets call for less F-35s than originally planned, the F-35 is still high in demand and I do not see that changing any time soon. The F-35 had its problems, big ones and not all problems are solved, but if you look at Lockheed Martin you see that it's a company with advanced products and that allows them to perform well in all of their segments.Richard Berger: Stanley Black & Decker (NYSE:SWK) is a Dividend Zombie. As such, it is a core holding for almost all portfolios, especially income. Stanley's zombie status means that any given earnings report is of minor import, only setting the tone for momentum expectations in the coming few months. Value-based pricing is real target motivator for entry/hold/exit points of SWK. My fair value estimate is currently $135.00 based on the value cluster of several financial metrics with a good proven historical correlation of value and actual market prices. Shares have risen a bit into bubble territory for now but will no doubt continue to grow into the higher values over the coming months. At this time, investors might consider writing the SWK cash secured puts using the 85-day $135.00 strike @ $2.90 premium. This provides an annualized yield rate of 9.43% on the net covering cash. If shares are presented, the entry will be a modest discount from fair value a net basis cost of $132.10. This is $13.87 below current market, a 9.5% decrease in market risk.Michael Boyd: 3M Company is the big one for me within large caps. They have cut guidance consistently quarter after quarter; this was the third guidance cut for 2019 in about six months. For industrial sales to shrink 6.6% at a company like this is bad news. Arguably 3M is perhaps the greatest industrial bellwether of all given its diverse product range; it was a report that should have had broader market implications in my opinion. Still, even after the fall, the company trades at more than 21x earnings! The share price fell less than the guidance cut which means further multiple expansion for a company that really should not have it. To the credit of Wall Street, many have been warning on 3M including Steve Tusa from JP Morgan. Patting myself on the back, I've been short and advocating it as a market hedge for a while now.Dhierin Bechai: Not sure about Industrials as a whole but Aerospace has an extremely long focus. We saw Honeywell, United Technologies and Lockheed performing well and that bodes well for the entire year I think. United Technologies said it could be facing a $0.10 headwind in earnings per share if Boeing does not increase its production this year, so it is going to be interesting to see how quickly Boeing can recover the delivery profile in a diligent and responsible way and to what extent that will affect the supply chain.Richard Berger: My Engineered Income Investing focus is on value-based investing price points to generate income from very high quality dividend equities and occasional special situations. I integrate covered option strategies so to increase cash income and yields while reducing (but never fully eliminating) market risk for my income portfolio. This focus and strategy finds earnings reports to be mainly a canary in the coal mine early warning signal rather than triggering buy/sell signals from the quarterly results themselves. With the focus on quality, surprises, especially those affecting long term value, are very rare.Michael Boyd: The ""earnings recession"" has been a key theme for Q1. It is highly likely, especially given how reports have been going, that Q1 will be the first quarter where we see negative S&P 500 earnings growth in several years, stretching all the way back to 2016.Despite that, high beta stocks have outperformed low beta stocks (measured by quartile) by 8.3% year to date. High earnings growth firms have outperformed by nearly 10%! If you think about it, slower growers are going to have less volatility (utilities, consumer staples, etc.). There has been this ""risk on"" mentality in the market when it comes buying up volatile stocks. That, to me, does not contrast well with the way earnings are going to proceed. I'm quite cautious personally.Editor's Note: Please see disclosures for these authors at the end of the article.Occidental: Another Suitor For Anadarko by The Value InvestorOccidental Petroleum (OXY) came over the top on Chevron's (CVX) bid for Anadarko (APC). The Value Investor of Value in Corporate Events breaks down the numbers on this bake-off to see who comes out winners/losers. Spoiler: OXY or CVX will end up winning the bidding, but their shareholders might view that as a Pyrrhic victory in the end.Facebook: High Expectations And Delivery by Michael Wiggins de OliveiraThe three biggest social media companies - Twitter (TWTR), Snap (SNAP), and Facebook (FB) all beat expectations. Michael Wiggins de Oliveira of Deep Value Returns recaps the high expectations Facebook had going in, and how the company is still undervalued even after beating it.

4247166,31441,2019-03-07T20:03:16-05:00,HON has an enviable portfolio of industrial businesses and is well managed.Its core businesses are subject to the vagaries of the global economy.If financial markets falter HON's rich valuation could become challenged.Sell HON.,"Source: BarronsAfter trillions in stimulus from central bankers the global economy has to falter at some point. Due to concerns over future economic growth and volatility in financial markets, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell could end the Fed's balance sheet unwind fairly soon:Sans more stimulus, it could be difficult for industrial names like General Electric (GE) or Honeywell (HON) to generate growth. Results from GE's industrial operations have been mixed. Eventually Honeywell could falter too. Consistent top line growth is the first attribute I look for before recommending a stock. If a company does not generate consistent growth then it should at least have a hidden catalyst.Honeywell's revenue is currently a mixed bag. Q4 2018 revenue of $9.7 billion was off 10% Y/Y. Every segment experienced a revenue decline except for Safety and Productivity Solutions (""SPS""), which provides products and software that help improve productivity and workplace safety. This segment grew by 15%.Like GE, Honeywell has been busy hiving off assets to become more strategically focused. Last year the company spun off thermostat maker Resideo Technologies (REZI) and turbo charger maker Garret Motion (GTX). The spin off of these businesses explains why total revenue was off by double digits.Despite the 12% decline in revenue, Aerospace reported 10% organic growth. Aerospace's product offerings are found on commercial, defense and space aircraft. It's Honeywell's largest segment at over 35% of total revenue. Aviation and defense shipment volumes were robust, despite the fall in total revenue.Building Technologies and Performance Materials and Technologies (""PMT"") had negative revenue growth, but organic growth was another story. Building Technologies' organic growth was up 1%, while PMT's organic growth was flat. Of note is that Safety, Production and Solutions (""SPS"") had organic growth of 15% and total revenue growth of 16%. SPS houses much of Honeywell's Internet of Things (""IoT"") and automation products. There was robust volume across sensing, IoT and industrial automation. IoT could become the next growth engine and potentially offset a diminution in other segments.Honeywell's segment profits of $2 billion fell 6%, which was less than the 10% decline in revenue. The company's segment profit margins of 20% were 100 basis points higher than that of Q4 2017. The margins for Aerospace were flat at 23%. However, margins for Building Technologies and PMT both increased. The margins for Building Technologies were up 100 basis points, driven by the favorable impact of the spin off of the former Homes and ADI Global Distribution business and benefits from repositioning. Margins for PMT rose 200 basis points due to the favorable impact of shipments in UOP and benefits from repositioning.Management drove margin improvement for Building Technologies and PMT, which both experienced revenue declines. In effect, the company was able to partially offset top line erosion by improving the bottom line. This gives the impression that management has levers to pull in case Honeywell's top line falls further.U.S. economic expansion is getting long in the tooth and that does not bode well for Honeywell. Its Aerospace segment is likely benefiting from previous stimulus efforts and a sizeable order backlog. Once the economy slows, commercial air traffic and equipment orders will likely slow too. The cloud-based business could continue to grow due to a secular shift, but the other segments should ebb and flow with the economy.With an enterprise value of $114 billion HON trades at a 16x run-rate EBITDA (Q4 2018 EBITDA annualized). In my opinion, this reflects the company's previous financial performance and the consistent melt up in financial markets. If the U.S. and China finally end their trade war then HON could experience a short-term spike. However, 16x is too robust for a company exposed to the vagaries of the global economy.HON is overvalued. Sell the stock."
4239391,24361,2019-02-08T09:30:00-05:00,"Honeywell's guidance for 2019 included what I believe is some prudent caution, but the company is still leveraged to a range of attractive end-markets for 2019 and beyond.Slower growth in non-residential construction and petrochemical-related automation are risks, but aerospace and warehouse automation can compensate.Honeywell isn't dirt-cheap, but the relative valuation is reasonable and there's still worthwhile upside for investors who want a core long-term holding.","I thought Honeywell (HON) was one of the best multi-industrial companies for 2018, and although it wasn’t the best performer (Roper (ROP) did better, to name one), I’m basically happy with the modest outperformance it delivered. Looking into 2019, I still have this as one of my top names, given its healthy exposure to longer-cycle sectors like aerospace and its relatively positive end-market mix. With growth opportunities across its existing businesses and more capital deployment options, this looks like a good long-term holding that still has some shorter-term undervaluation to add to the appeal.There weren’t many surprises in Honeywell’s fourth quarter, which is fine given that an above-average level of performance was expected and largely delivered.Revenue rose 6% in organic terms, more or less matching expectations. Aerospace generated 10% organic growth (about 3% better than expected), with strong growth in defense (up 17%) and respectable growth in commercial (up 8% in original equipment and up 5% in aftermarket). Building Technology was up just 1% on flat performance in Buildings, and came in a little below expectations. Safety and Productivity was up a strong 15% (6% ahead of expectations) on 23% growth in Productivity, pushed by double-digit growth in Intelligrated. Performance Materials had a lackluster performance, with flat revenue (missing by 5%) as slight growth in UOP and Process offset weakness in Advanced Materials.Honeywell did well on the price/cost mix, and margins also benefited from last year’s spin-offs. Gross margin improved 40bp, and while segment profits declined more than 6%, margin improved by 80bp. Aero and Building Tech were not surprisingly down in terms of earnings (with the spin-offs), but margins improved 50bp and 100bp respectively, while SPS and PMT saw 30bp and 200bp, respectively, of margin improvement.Although Honeywell did alright in the fourth quarter, it wasn’t a flawless performance and guidance left the door open for some weakness as the year develops.In the Aero business, the 10% organic growth figure was certainly decent relative to expectations, but Parker-Hannifin (PH), Eaton (ETN), United Technologies (UTX) and GE (GE) all posted higher growth rates (ranging from 12% to 22%). Management’s guidance for mid-single-digit growth in 2019 (or better) would seem to leave some room for upside, and I expect aerospace and defense to be relatively attractive end-markets for 2019.Honeywell’s 5% growth in Safety wasn’t all that exceptional next to 3M’s (MMM) performance (up 7% in personal safety), and the company’s Building performance was likewise not so impressive next to Ingersoll-Rand’s (IR) commercial HVAC results nor Siemens (OTCPK:SIEGY) comparable segment performance. I found management’s guide for low single-digit growth in Building to be a credible outlook, as I think non-residential will slow in 2019 (in keeping with comments from others like Kone (OTCPK:KNYJY).Automation was pretty mixed, with Emerson (EMR), Rockwell (ROK), and Siemens all outperforming, though Yokogawa didn’t do as well. Specific end-market exposures can explain at least some of this, with companies like Rockwell better leveraged to more attractive markets like food/beverage and pharma (areas Honeywell is targeting for growth), and management did comment that oil price weakness may have “temporarily delayed” some investment decisions.All told, Honeywell management was generally more cautious on short-cycle businesses while expressing some confidence in longer-cycle businesses like aerospace. That matches my outlook going into 2019, and I think management was wise to lower expectations for some of its industrial and non-residential operations, particularly industrial businesses more exposed to weakness in electronics, China, and so on.I don’t see 2019 as an especially great year, but Honeywell should still grow (on an adjusted/organic basis), and there are still positive drivers across the company’s businesses. Aerospace is still leveraged to healthy commercial order books and market share growth, while the automation business is moving into some new opportunities in hybrid and batch automation that should grow the addressable market. I’m also still quite bullish on the longer-term opportunity in warehouse/logistics automation. There are also a lot of smaller wins I see for Honeywell, like its Solstice commercial refrigerant business.Longer term, I like Honeywell’s post-spin mix, and management is clearly looking to put more capital into M&A. It doesn’t sound as though the company is looking to acquire a brand new vertical (which is likely for the best), but I would think aerospace, building tech, and automation could all see more M&A activity.Nothing is really changing in my outlook, and I still expect core long-term revenue growth in the 3% to 4% range and core FCF growth in the 4% to 5% range. Honeywell shares aren’t cheap on a discounted cash flow basis, with an implied return in the mid-to-high single-digits, but the shares do still look undervalued on EV/EBITDA, and I think the shares are priced for modest outperformance in 2019, with possibly more upside if the “general industrial” environment deteriorates further.Honeywell isn’t the cheapest multi-industrial, and given its strong performance I’d be surprised if it were. In terms of paying up for quality, I think investors are still getting a decent value on balance with Honeywell, and it’s still a name I’d be happy to own at this point."
4242400,104122,2019-02-20T09:04:06-05:00,"Honeywell remains a top performing industrial stock.The company displays a number of competitive advantages.Although Honeywell makes a great industrial stock to hold for the long term, the stock is especially vulnerable to market cyclicality.","Source: Google ImagesIndustrial companies function as essential components of the economic engine, propelling societal innovation through advanced production technologies. Honeywell International (HON) persists as a stellar industrial conglomerate with operations in various industrial segments ranging from industrial automation, residential, aerospace, oil & gas, and defense technology. With over $41 billion in annual revenues, HON demonstrates a formidable positioning in the industrial space. HON provides investors with compelling capital appreciation, a 2.14% dividend yield, stable revenue prospects, and sustained outperformance. This article discusses my investment thesis on HON, analyzing the company's business strengths, growth prospects, valuation, and relevant financials.HON stands out amongst its industrial peers as a result of the company's stable revenue expansion, continued growth, healthy balance sheet, and operational stability. HON makes a phenomenal investment within the industrial space, generating consistent dividends and capital appreciation for investors. The industrial conglomerate designs and manufactures a diverse selection of products in various industries ranging from aerospace, oil & gas, defense technology, and residential/industrial automation. With more than $41 billion in annual revenues, HON prevails as a preeminent global player in the industrial space. Examining HON's operational history reveals sustained revenue expansion, elevated profit margins, a healthy mix of cyclical/non-cyclical segments, and a commitment to shareholder returns. HON exhibits well-diversified revenue segmentation. The company's sales are distributed across the following operating segments: 23% in commercial aerospace, 19% in non-residentials, 22% in industrial productivity, 13% in defense, 15% in oil and gas petrochemicals, and 8% in specialty chemicals. HON does exhibit some exposure to the highly cyclical aerospace and residential building segments; however, the portfolio balances cyclical exposure with its safety and productivity segments. Furthermore, HON derives a significant amount of revenue from international operations; international sales account for more than half of the company's total revenues at 55%, and the remaining 45% is derived from domestic U.S operations. Over the years, HON has continued to bolster its business portfolio through repeated acquisitions. HON's stellar management has successfully performed over $9 billion in acquisitions over the past 4 years while, at the same time, increasing the cash return on capital invested.Data by YChartsFor decades, HON's exceptional management has sustained elevated revenues, cash flow, and profit margins. The company's recent divestitures in its lower performing Garrett Motion and Resideo businesses enable further operational improvement. HON can more prudently allocate resources to growing operating segments instead of expending capital on slow and underperforming operations. Over the past four quarters, the company has consistently beaten market expectations, increased order backlog by 7%, and bolstered cash return on invested capital by 17% (suggesting very efficient capital deployment). HON demonstrates a strong growth trajectory. The company's recent divestitures have better optimized its operating segments: in 2018, 60% of HON's portfolio witnessed 5%+ annual growth. Additionally, the company's aerospace segment will experience continued growth as a result of globalization/aircraft investments and a steady demand for industrial productivity solutions. Furthermore, HON will continue to drive margin improvement as a result of its portfolio reorganization, and the company's entrenched market positioning reinforces a stable top and bottom-line growth trajectory.HON demonstrates a stable financial positioning. The company boasts positive shareholder equity, continued asset expansion, substantial liquidity reserves of $11.6 billion, and a manageable long-term debt load of $16 billion. HON's long-term debt load is well covered by operating cash flow (at 39% coverage of total debt), and the company's current liquidity reserves cover a vast portion of outstanding debt obligations. As compared to competitors, HON exhibits much larger liquidity reserves and a lower debt burden. Overall, HON's healthy financials reinforce a stable business positioning.Data by YChartsIn terms of capital appreciation, HON has remained a top performing industrial stock, competing with the likes of 3M (MMM) and United Technologies (UTX). Over the past ten years, HON has experienced capital appreciation of 367% in addition to offering a 2% dividend yield. The company has consistently expanded its dividend by an average CAGR of 10% for the past eight years. Furthermore, the payout ratio at only 40% is moderate allowing for greater flexibility in dividend increases. However, from a valuation standpoint, HON is slightly overpriced. Based on a discounted cash flow analysis, the stock appears to be slightly overvalued, as the current share price of $153 exceeds my buy target range in the $130s to low $140s.Data by YChartsHON remains a well performing industrial asset. The company remains at the top of the pack in terms of performance, revenue expansion, growth trajectory, and return on investment. HON offers good exposure to the industrial sector; however, the stock is vulnerable to the cyclicality of the stock market. Along with its industrial peers, HON faces significant capital depreciation in recessionary environments. I personally would not recommend investment at this late stage in the game as broader economic deteriorations could be on the horizon. However, as a life-long investment holding, HON remains a well-operated and financially-rewarding stock in the industrial sector.Author's note: Thanks for taking the time to read this article.

The industrial conglomerate reported Q4 2018 financial results that beat the top and bottom line estimates, and its management team raised their fiscal 2019 guidance. The stock has been on an upward trend since the start of 2019, which was helped by the Q4 beat and raise, but HON shares are still underperforming the broader market over the last year.Data by YChartsHowever, as I have consistently described over the last few years, I believe that the pullbacks in HON shares should be viewed as long-term buying opportunities. Moreover, in my opinion, the company's Q4 and full-year 2018 results show that the long-term bullish thesis remains intact, even after factoring in the recent pivot (i.e., restructuring efforts and asset spins).On February 1, 2019, Honeywell reported adjusted EPS of $1.91 (vs. the estimate of $1.89) on revenue of $9.73B (vs estimate of $9.70), which compares favorably to the year-ago results (excluding the spinoff impact).Source: Q4 and Full-year 2018 Earnings PresentationAs shown, Honeywell's quarterly results were strong across the board. Organic sales were up 6% YoY, which was primarily a result of strength seen in aerospace (commercial and U.S. defense) and warehouse automation (a key growth driver for this company). Additionally, Honeywell's adjusted EPS were higher YoY (excluding spin impact) and, importantly, the company continued the long streak of improving its cash conversion.However, as I previously described here, I believe that Honeywell's margins are the real story for this industrial conglomerate (and its stock), so it is encouraging that the most recent results showed further progress toward management's goal of eliminating unnecessary costs and expanding margins for each of its operating segments.Source: Q4 and Full-year 2018 Earnings PresentationIt is important to also note that 2018 turned out to be an extremely eventful year for Honeywell, which make the full-year results that much better. Source: Q4 and Full-year 2018 Earnings PresentationThere is a lot to like about Honeywell's most recent operating results but, looking ahead, it is hard not to be bullish about Honeywell's business prospects, especially after factoring in the 2019 guidance.Source: Q4 and Full-year 2018 Earnings PresentationAt the end of the day, the 2019 guidance shows just how better positioned management believes the 'new' Honeywell will be. The 'smaller is better' theme flowed throughout the earnings material and conference call, which makes sense as management prepares for life after Garrett Motion (GTX) and Resideo (REZI).To this point, Honeywell looks to be well-positioned for 2019 and beyond as its management team appears to be laser-focused on further pivoting this global conglomerate, while also deploying capital in a manner that will benefit its shareholders for years to come.Source: Q4 and Full-year 2018 Earnings PresentationThe main (and overarching) reason why management spun off GTX and REZI was to focus on the businesses that they considered core. So far, the pivot appears to be working as shown by the fact that 2018 played out better than what management originally anticipated (2018 guidance was raised 4 times over the last 4 quarters) and 2019 is projected to be another stellar fiscal year.It also helps the bull case that Honeywell shares are trading at what I would consider to be an attractive valuation.Honeywell's stock is trading at 18x forward earnings, which makes the stock appear to be richly valued based on today's price.Data by YChartsHowever, Honeywell is a best-of-breed company in the industrial space, in my opinion, so it makes sense that the conglomerate is trading at a slight premium. Additionally, HON shares are trading below the average P/E ratio based on its own historical metrics.Data by YChartsI have a 12 to 18-month price target of $175 per share; so, in my opinion, HON shares are attractively valued at today's level.A global recession is the most significant risk to my investment thesis, at least in the near term. I do not believe that a recession is not likely to happen over the next 12 months, but if one were to materialize, Honeywell's businesses would be negatively impacted in a major way. Furthermore, investor sentiment is extremely bullish for Honeywell at this point in time and it largely revolves around the prospects for the aerospace division, so a slowdown in this industry would likely result in shares selling off.Additionally, Honeywell previously disclosed that the SEC opened an investigation into its accounting for asbestos-related liabilities. Management recently increased its estimate for the potential liabilities for these liabilities, so the SEC is looking into the previously communicated (and booked) estimated charges. I view this as noise, but obviously, it is never good when the SEC comes knocking.I believe that Honeywell's Q4 and full-year 2018 operating results show that this company's long-term bull story remains intact. This industrial conglomerate has great businesses in industries that have promising long-term prospects. Moreover, Honeywell appears to have the right management in place and its focus on software (i.e. Industrial Internet of Things) is already paying huge dividends. Lastly, the recent spinoffs helped management create a more focused and streamlined company which, in my opinion, should allow for Honeywell to continue to benefit from strong tailwinds in several key markets (e.g., aerospace is the most notable example).2019 should be a big (and meaningful) year for Honeywell so investors should closely monitor the company's operating results over the next 4 quarters. If management's 2019 guidance is achieved, Honeywell's stock will likely be a market beater over the next 12-18 months. As such, investors with a time horizon longer than 1 year should treat HON pullbacks, especially if they are caused by broader market concerns, as long-term buying opportunities.Author's Note: I hold a sizable Honeywell position in the R.I.P. portfolio and I have no plans to sell any shares in the near future.Disclaimer: This article is not a recommendation to buy or sell any stock mentioned.

4236806,60561,2019-01-30T16:12:17-05:00,Honeywell is a Dividend Challenger with 8 consecutive years of dividend increases.  Shares currently yield ~2.3%.The share price is ~ 11% below its October peak in the low $160s.Strong free cash flow returns on invested capital make Honeywell a good investment candidate.if the valuation makes sense.,"When analyzing my portfolio at the end of 2018 one thing that I wanted to do was to increase my exposure to the consumer staples, consumer discretionary, health care and industrial sector. There's only 4 companies in my portfolio that fall in the industrial sector and they account for roughly 5% of my dividends. Honeywell (HON) is a company that I've long had my eye on but never sat down to truly analyze the company and come up with a valuation.Honeywell's share price had declined over 22% from its October peak at $161 to less than $125 by late December. Since then the share price, as well as the market overall, has cooled down and rebounded nicely but is still roughly 12% below the October peak. The share price might continue to climb higher from here or it could easily head back lower. Whatever the case may be I wanted to be prepared with a valuation in mind for this excellent company should the markets start going haywire once again.Dividend HistoryWhen I choose to invest my hard earned savings into a business I want that company to be run as if I owned the whole thing. That means I want to see excess cash that the business doesn't need to maintain and grow operations to be sent to me in the form of dividends or buybacks.Image by author; data source Honeywell's investor relations. A full screen version of this chart is available here.Honeywell has increased dividends for 8 consecutive years giving them the title of Dividend Challenger. As you can see in the chart below Honeywell's dividend growth history isn't the cleanest as it's come in fits and starts with a freeze in 2010 as well as from 2001 through 2004. However, the dividend hasn't been decreased since it was initiated back in 1985.While dividend growth might not come every single year like clockwork the dividend has typically been raised quite rapidly. The worst 10 year dividend growth rate since 2003 came in at 4.9% which is pretty impressive considering there was 5 years of freezes incorporated into that. More recently the rolling 10 year dividend growth rates have been rising and they've been over 10% for the last 4 years.The rolling 1-, 3-, 5- and 10-year dividend growth rates can be found in the following table.Image by author; data source Honeywell's investor relations. A full screen version of this chart is available here.Overall, Honeywell's dividend growth has been solid. However, just as, if not more, important is the safety of the dividend. Over the last 10 years and the TTM period the earnings payout ratio has averaged 52% while the free cash flow payout ratio has averaged 38.4%. Image by author; data sourced from Honeywell SEC filings.How Does Honeywell Make Money?Honeywell is an industrial conglomerate that operates around the world. The company is separated into 4 operating segments: The following chart shows the revenue and operating profit by segment through the end of 3Q FY 2018 for Honeywell.Image by author; data sourced from Honeywell's 3Q FY 2018 10-QThe Aerospace segment accounts for the bulk of revenues and operating profits at 38% and 42%, respectively. Home & Building Technologies provided 23% of revenues and 20% of operating profit. Performance Materials & Technologies provided 25% of revenue and 26% of operating profit while Safety & Productivity Solutions provided 14% and 12%, respectively.What Do The Numbers Say?Quality companies that are built for the long run will show it out in their numbers. When analyzing an investment candidate I prefer to look at things primarily through their cash flows since it gives a cleaner view of the cash coming into and out of the business and less susceptible to manipulation.Image by author; data sourced from Honeywell SEC filings.Over the last decade Honeywell has struggled to grow sales with total growth of 10.9%, 1.2% per year, between 2008 and 2017. The TTM period is showing a larger uptick in revenues which is encouraging. One thing to note regarding the lackluster growth in revenues is that Honeywell has spun off 3 companies AdvanSix (ASIX) in 2016, Resideo Technologies (REZI) and Garrett Motion (GTX) in 2018. Those 3 companies are forecast to have ~$9.6 B of revenue for 2018.Over that same period operating cash flow grew 57.4% in total or 5.2% annually while free cash flow grew 69.8% or 6.1% annually. While top line growth stalled Honeywell spent that time becoming a leaner and more efficient company.  Image by author; data sourced from Honeywell SEC filings.I consider a 10% free cash flow margin to be the threshold for a strong cash generating business. Honeywell has regularly been right around that mark, but has dipped below from time to time. The general trend is for slight improvement. Over the last decade the free cash flow margin has averaged 9.5%.Alternatively I like use the free cash flow return on invested capital to examine the profitability of the company. The FCF ROIC is the excess cash that one could pull out of the business if you owned it outright under the current capital structure. The ROE is less important to me because a company can juice that number by increasing the debt levels of the capital structure. I've included the FCF ROIC net which nets out the cash held on the balance sheet from the equity and total debt. I want to see a FCF ROIC over 10% and the higher the better. Image by author; data sourced from Honeywell SEC filings. Honeywell has been able to maintain a greater than 10% FCF ROIC every year over the last 10 years. The average over that time has been 15.2%.I prefer the companies I invest in to carry no debt on the balance sheet; however, I also realize that most companies will not meet that criteria and it would severely limit the opportunities that are out there. As such I look for stable and reasonable debt levels.  Image by author; data sourced from Honeywell SEC filings.Honeywell's capital structure has generally remained consistent from year to year with debt making up around 45% of the capital structure. As of the end of FY 2017 the total debt on the balance sheet could be paid off with cash on hand and just over 2 years of 2017's free cash flow. Debt levels are manageable; however, as always I'd prefer to see it lower.To understand how Honeywell uses its free cash flow I examine a few variations on the metric, defined below:Ideally a company will have a positive FCFaDB since that would mean there is excess cash above what is needed to grow and maintain the business and to pay shareholders with dividends and share repurchases. A positive FCFaDB would mean there is still cash available after those needs to either reduce debt or grow dividends/share repurchases in the future, all else being equal. Image by author; data sourced from Honeywell SEC filings. As we saw earlier Honeywell has made solid improvement in free cash flow over the last decade despite stagnant growth in revenues. Since FY 2008 free cash flow has grown 69.8% in total or 6.1% annually. That positive free cash flow has allowed management to move further up the capital allocation ladder to dividends as a means to reward shareholders.Over the last decade Honeywell has grown its FCFaD in the face of a rapidly growing dividend payment. The FCFaD has grown 34.3% in total or 3.3% annually since FY 2008.Likewise the FCFaDB has generally been positive; although it appears that management has been a bit more aggressive with share repurchases throughout 2017 and the TTM period by spending most of the FCFaD on buybacks. Over the last decade Honeywell has generated a total of $10.19 B in positive FCFaDB which explains the $10.09 B increase in equity levels over that same period. Image by author; data sourced from Honeywell SEC filings.Despite the cash spent on repurchases Honeywell's share count has increased from 744 M to 772 M over the last decade or 3.8% in total. However, since FY 2013 the share count has been on the decline from 797 M to 772 M which is good for a 3.1% total reduction or 0.8% annually. Thus far it seems as if the cash spent on share repurchases has been for naught as stock options and issuances for acquisitions have, for the most part, negated the reductions from repurchases. Image by author; data sourced from Honeywell SEC filings. The above chart shows the relationship between the total cash spent on share repurchases versus the total cash spent on dividend payments. In total over the last decade for every dollar spent on dividends an additional $0.86 was spent on buybacks. Over the last 5 years that jumps to $1.03 spent on repurchases for every dollar paid out in dividends. Given the lackluster results from Honeywell's repurchases I'd prefer to see that ratio shift more towards dividends over time. ValuationHoneywell the ""business"" looks solid with strong free cash flow generation and returns on invested capital. The debt levels are higher than I'd like; however, they have been relatively stable and appear to be no real issue at this time. The only real mark against Honeywell is the lack of effectiveness from their share repurchases. Overall it looks like Honeywell would be a solid fit for my FI Portfolio especially in light of the fact that I'd like to increase my exposure to industrial sector if the valuation makes sense.One of the methods that I use to determine a fair value for an investment is the minimum acceptable rate of return, ""MARR"", analysis. A MARR entails estimating future earnings and dividends of a company, applying a valuation on those future earnings and determining whether the forecast return is greater than your minimum threshold for investment.Analysts expect Honeywell to earn $7.88 per share for FY 2019 and to grow earnings at 9.1% per year for the next 5 years on average. I then assumed that Honeywell could manage 5.0% per year growth for the following 5 years. I've assumed that dividends will roughly grow in line with earnings with a target payout ratio of 40%.As a starting point for the valuation of the future earnings I let history be my guide. Over the last decade Honeywell's shares have generally traded for around 20x TTM earnings with a few dips into the 10-15x range. In most ""normal"" market environments I would assume that Honeywell shares should trade between between a 15-25x P/E Ratio.Data by YCharts[object HTMLElement]The following table shows the potential internal rates of return that an investment in Honeywell could provide supposing the above assumptions are met. Returns include estimated dividend payments with a purchase of shares around $142 per share and are run through the end of calendar year 2023, ""5 Year"", and calendar year 2028, ""10 Year"".Alternatively I wanted to include target purchase prices assuming both a 10% and 15% discount rate based on the various future P/E ratios. A purchase at these prices should generate ~10% and 15% annual returns, respectively, assuming the above assumptions are met.ConclusionHoneywell the business looks like a solid candidate to continue to rewarding shareholders. Honeywell has historically generated high free cash flow returns on invested capital and I see no reason for that to change in the future. I would prefer to see management reduce their debt levels; however, they aren't a major concern at this time and I consider it to be more of a preference than a prerequisite. The one area of concern is the share repurchases that's seen over $10 B spent on repurchases since the end of FY 2008 while the share count has increased just under 1.0%. That's $10 B of less debt, more cash on the balance sheet, higher dividends, strategic acquisitions or new business lines each of which would have been a more productive use of shareholder capital.At the current price around $142 I believe that Honeywell is fairly valued. Assuming a ""normal"" market environment returns from an investment in Honeywell are likely to be solid and in the 8-12% range assuming that growth plays out as estimated in this analysis. I'll be looking to initiate a small position in Honeywell between $138-142 with the goal being to get some exposure to a fairly valued and high quality business. The next target area for purchase would be in the $120-125 area to add another lot of shares.I am not a financial professional.

4237715,50452,2019-02-03T15:41:31-05:00,"Honeywell is an industrial conglomerate with strong fundamentals.The company has shed non-core assets and has positioned itself in end markets with strong growth potential such as aerospace and industrial productivity.Shares are in line with historical norms. Due to the company's fundamentals and actions to develop organic growth, we like the current valuation for long-term investors.","The industrial sector is a very crowded space in the investing world. The explanation for this is simple. Industrial businesses drive our society forward through advancements in the production of the goods and services that our society consumes. There are various companies in the sector that have proven to be lucrative investments over time. Because of how crowded the space is, it can be difficult sometimes for a strong company to stand out. Honeywell International Inc. (HON) is an industrial conglomerate that fits this mold. Because it lacks a storied dividend growth streak, it flies under the radar of dividend growth investors. Because it isn't a Dow Jones constituent, it isn't as well known to retail investors. The company boasts a number of qualities such as strong profit metrics, solid growth, a strong balance sheet - all of which make Honeywell a long-term wealth generator worthy of more attention from investors.Honeywell International is an industrial conglomerate that designs and manufactures a wide range of products. These products are sold into a number of industries, including residential, industrial automation, aerospace, oil & gas, and defense technology. The company had generated more than $42 billion in total revenue (which will drop to around $35 billion following recent spin offs of its Transportation Systems business (Garrett Motion (GTX)) & Homes and Global Distribution businesses (Resideo (REZI))). Honeywell is a global company with sales and operations in various countries around the globe.Source: Honeywell International, Inc.Source: YchartsBeing an industrial stock, Honeywell has been negatively impacted by economic downturns over the years. Still, revenue and earnings have trended higher over the long term. Prior to the shake up in 2018, revenue has grown at a 10-year CAGR of 2.28% and earnings at 9.42%. The business profile at Honeywell has changed recently, which we will explore further down.In the meantime, we want to review Honeywell's financial performance. How has the business improved/deteriorated over time, and in what areas? We start by looking at Honeywell's operating margin and FCF conversion rate. We want to see that a company is consistently profitable, or becomes increasingly profitable over time. We also want to see that a company is able to generate strong streams of cash flow.Source: YchartsOver the past decade, Honeywell has seen drastic expansion in both metrics. The operating margin has more than doubled since 2012, and the FCF conversion rate of 12% clears our standard benchmark (10%). Becoming increasingly profitable and generating more cash over time is obviously a sign that management is improving the business.Another perspective is the cash return on capital invested (CROCI). This essentially measures how effective the company/management is at generating cash returns on the resources that it deploys. It is also a baseline indicator of the strength of a company's competitive ""moat"". We typically look for this rate of return to come in at the low-teens or higher.Source: YchartsAs we can see, the current rate of almost 17% meets this criteria. It is also a positive to see that the CROCI has trended higher (although it is a very modest upward trend) over time. Being a large industrial conglomerate, Honeywell routinely dabbles in mergers and acquisitions. There is a lot of execution risk present whenever a diversified company divests and acquires multiple assets. Assets have to be acquired at feasible costs, and integrated into the business effectively. Honeywell's solid CROCI signals that management is succeeding in adding value to the company, rather than destroying value due to poor execution.The last area of review before moving on is the balance sheet. It is obviously important for a company to avoid taking on too much debt. An over-leveraged company can be vulnerable to rising interest rates, or face a potential cash flow squeeze in the event of an unexpected downturn in the business.Source: YchartsHoneywell is currently carrying $9.8 billion in cash against total debts of $18.25 billion. The company's leverage ratio of 2X EBITDA is below our ""warning sign"" threshold of 2.5X. On top of that, Honeywell's cash pile is a great financial cushion. It has enough cash to wipe out more than half of its total debt load.Honeywell froze its dividend during the recession almost a decade ago, so the company is currently rebuilding its dividend growth streak. It currently stands at eight years. The dividend is paid out quarterly, and totals an annual sum of $3.28 per share. The dividend yields 2.28%, which isn't terrible - but still falls short of what investors can get from 10-year US treasuries (yielding 2.68%).Source: YchartsSince freezing the dividend, Honeywell has returned it to a very solid growth trajectory. Over the past 10 years, the dividend has grown at a CAGR of 10.8%. Management has been pretty consistent with this growth rate (most recent raise was 10.1%). Investors should be aware that should a significant economic downturn occur, the dividend could again be frozen. The payout ratio barely exceeded 60% of cash flow when it was last frozen. This shouldn't be a deterrent, as Honeywell's dividend still ""gets to where it needs to go"" over the long term. Given strong cash generation and a low payout ratio, we see continued growth at 7%-10%.Honeywell has just recently gone through a bit of a shakeup that management expects will result in a more profitable, higher growth entity. The company spun off non-core assets in Garrett Motion (Transportation Systems) and Resideo (Residential and Global Distribution).The spin offs have left Honeywell with a more focused portfolio with exposure to various growth areas (60% of portfolio saw 5%+ organic growth in 2018).Source: Honeywell International, Inc.The shuffling of Honeywell's portfolio is also expected to further boost margins. Management has projected margin expansion of 110-140 basis points in FY19.Honeywell has built strong positions in markets poised for continued growth. Its large exposure to commercial aerospace will benefit Honeywell as increased globalization will require more investments into aircraft. Aftermarket and original equipment sales generate 65% of revenues in Honeywell's Aerospace segment. Honeywell's second largest market - Industrial Productivity - will provide growth as manufacturers across the world strive for increased efficiency by investing in smarter machines and production methods.Investors should note that the company's largest risk remains the macroeconomic environment. Honeywell is sensitive to recessions, when certain customers (such as industrials) will cut spending. While a recession will negatively impact the business, Honeywell's strong financial position should enable the company to endure these down-cycles.Source: YchartsHoneywell is currently trading at just under $145 per share. In an up and down year, the stock is currently near the midpoint of its 52-week high. Management is guiding FY19 earnings per share at between $7.80-$8.10. This would put the stock at an earnings multiple of 18.125X. This is right in line with the stock's 10-year median PE ratio of 18.06X.Looking at valuation from a cash flow basis, Honeywell is currently offering a FCF yield of 5.56%. This is near its multi-year peak going back five years.Source: YchartsBased on the stock trading within historical norms, and a solid cash flow yield, we think that Honeywell is at a reasonable entry point for long-term investors. As an industrial stock, a downturn in the economic environment could push shares downward further yet.We are bullish on Honeywell's long-term potential as a dividend growth stock. The company's strong financial position (high cash balance, manageable leverage ratio) combined with management's willingness to shed non-core assets and ""focus"" on the portfolio should continue what has been a multi-year uptrend in margin and cash flow generation.There is always macroeconomic risk to the share price due to Honeywell's industrial exposure. However, investors should feel confident in Honeywell's fundamentals.If you enjoyed this article and wish to receive updates on our latest research, click ""Follow"" next to my name at the top of this article.Author Disclaimer: Wealth Insights is an investor and investment author.

4226577,24992,2018-12-05T17:18:11-05:00,"The Momentum Growth Quotient for the company is 11.52, which is 20.62% higher than the average for the S&P 100.Shares present a forward rate of return of 11.24% at the current price.ChartMasterPro upward target price of $154.00.","Shares of Honeywell International Inc (HON) are down 8.20% since peaking on Oct. 1, 2018, and in my opinion, the shares of this consumer products, engineering, and aerospace conglomerate are an attractive buy at current price levels. The company has a solid history of generating impressive earnings growth, and the future growth ratios point to continued growth over the next twelve months. I lay out my bullish argument for the company below by reviewing some pertinent fundamental and technical aspects of the stock.My Momentum Growth Quotient (MGQ) plays a critical part when it comes to determining if I am going to go long or short a stock. Generally, I only want to go long a stock with an MGQ higher than that of the S&P 100, and I want to go short a stock with an MGQ lower than that of the index (for a more detailed explanation of how I calculate the MGQ, please see my blog post).As of the end of October 2018, the MGQ for the S&P 100 was 9.21.The current MGQ for HON stands at 11.24, which implies a 20.62% higher growth rate compared to the S&P 100. This tells us that HON has strong future growth potential and is a good candidate for a long position.Let's dig a little deeper into the financial data to get a better feel for how the company has performed on certain fundamental metrics and what these numbers imply for future growth.Caveat Lector: I am Quant Trader - that is, I seek to understand market behavior by using mathematical and statistical modeling, measurement, and research. So, you won't find much qualitative analysis in my work or in my trading process. The goal is to identify optimum entry points for trades based on my quantitative model and execute those trades as effectively as possible.During the past 12 months, the average EBITDA per share growth rate of Honeywell International was 11.50% per year. During the past three years, the average EBITDA per share growth rate was 6.70% per year. During the past five years, the average EBITDA per share growth rate was 9.50% per year. During the past 10 years, the average EBITDA per share growth rate was 8.00% per year (GuruFocus). Earnings growth has been strong and consistent over the last 10 years.The operating margin percent for HON stands at 15.57%. Each dollar of revenue the company generated brought in 15.57 cents of earnings. The company's five-year average operating margin growth rate was 8.80% per year - a decent rate of growth.Knowing how a company has performed in the past is important in order to evaluate management's past record in running the business. But more important to us is how profitable the company will be in the future because we are investing going forward, not backward. And it's the forward-looking metrics that should really get you excited about HON.I like to use two measuring sticks to gauge the future growth potential for companies: forward P/E and forward rate of return.I prefer to use the forward P/E ratio (current stock's price over its ""expected"" earnings per share) rather than historical P/E to gauge a company's expected future earnings power. A high forward P/E ratio means that investors are anticipating higher growth in the future and are willing to pay more for future earnings - momentum investing is all about following the trend (perceived or real).HON has a forward P/E of 18.66 compared to a 17.10 forward P/E for the S&P 100. The forward P/E for HON is higher than that of the index, suggesting that the market is expecting a higher growth rate for the company than the broader markets.The forward rate of return for a stock (created by Donald Yacktman) is one of my favorite quotients for gauging the market's expectation for future growth for a company. Yacktman defines forward rate of return as the normalized free cash flow yield plus real growth plus inflation. In simple terms, the forward rate of return can be thought of as the return that investors buying the stock today can expect from it in the future.The forward rate of return for HON stands at 11.24%. This implies that an investor buying the stock today should expect a 11.24% return over the next 12 months. The average forward rate of return for the S&P 100 as of the end of October was at 8.03%, so HON has an implied potential rate of return that is 1.39x greater than that of the index.The risk inherent in the forward rate of return is that the calculation is reliable only if the company can grow at the same rate in the future as it did in the past. If the growth rate falters, the projected returns will not materialize. But we are willing to accept this risk as part of the difficult process of forecasting earnings and growth momentum.As per my ChartMasterPro Daily Trade Model, there is a high probability of a rally to the $154.00 level from here, which would equate to a gain of 6% for the shares: I will buy call options for HON to participate in the anticipated run to $154.00.

For longer-term investors, I believe HON is a solid addition to any growth portfolio over the next 12 months.When looking for companies to invest in, I like to find ones with a management team that has outperformed its peers in the same industry with regard to growing earnings and generating higher than average returns for shareholders.Management EffectivenessSource: ReutersThis is a company that's posting a much higher earnings growth rate than its peers with a management team that's very good at generating higher than average returns than its competitors. The price drop in the shares over the two months presents an excellent opportunity to initiate a position in HON.The chart below shows the company's revenue on a TTM basis - you can see that although revenue has been steadily increasing though 2018, the share price has retreated recently and been flat for 2018. With the company's long history of being able to convert rising revenue into higher earnings and returns for shareholders, the recent pullback in price is an excellent opportunity to pick up these shares for their future growth potential. When I go long a stock, I want to invest in a company that provides superior future growth potential, but I also want to time the entry into any position to try to maximize my return.So, I use fundamental analysis to identify shares with a strong future growth rate, and then I apply technical analysis to identify ideal entry points.In my opinion, HON is a compelling buy at these levels from both a fundamental and technical perspective."
4233214,79675,2019-01-14T11:35:44-05:00,"Honeywell's stock has underperformed the broader market over the last year, but I believe that HON shares are a great long-term buy at today's price.Additionally, the recent spinoffs have the potential to be a major catalyst for Honeywell's stock over the next 12-18 months.I am long Honeywell, and I have plans to grow my position in 2019.","Honeywell (HON) is a core holding in the R.I.P. portfolio, and the stock has performed well over the last 3 plus years. More recently, however, HON shares have underperformed the broader market by over 6 percentage points.HON data by YChartsThe recent underperformance for HON shares has created a long-term buying opportunity because, in my opinion, this industrial conglomerate is well-positioned for 2019 and beyond. Moreover, the recent spins could potentially be a major catalyst for the HON shares in the current year.In late 2018, Honeywell spun off its Transportation Systems business, Garrett Motion (GTX), and its Homes and Global Distribution business, Resideo (REZI). If investors remember correctly, Honeywell's management team remained believers in the long-term business prospects of both spin-off companies, but, as they put it, Honeywell is better positioned without the two businesses in the fold. It is a classic case of addition by subtraction. For example, Honeywell raised its full-year 2018 guidance after the spin-offs were announced.Source: 2018 Outlook PresentationThe spins will not only allow for Honeywell to allocate capital in a more efficient manner to core businesses but, more importantly, they will also give Honeywell the potential to return a tremendous amount of capital to shareholders.In addition, Garrett Motion and Resideo entered into agreements related to legacy liabilities, so Honeywell's management team will be able to better manage/plan for future expenditures. Simply put, Honeywell is better off without Garrett and Resideo. Honeywell's business has been transformed, and, if you ask me, the company is better positioned for 2019 and beyond. It helps that the recent results (and guidance) support this thought.Full disclosure: I hold positions in both Garrett Motion and Resideo in the R.I.P. portfolio. Honeywell has a track record for beating expectations, as shown by the fact that the company has beat the consensus EPS estimate in six out of the last eight quarters.Source: FidelityHoneywell's recent results were more of the same. The company reported better-than-expected Q3 2018 EPS of $2.03 (beat by $0.04) on revenue of $10.76B (in line with analyst estimates). The company's Q3 2018 financial results were also significant improvements from what Honeywell reported in the year-ago quarter (revenue and adjusted EPS were up 7% and 17%, respectively).Source: Q3 2018 Earnings PresentationAnd more importantly, management raised their full-year guidance for the fourth time over the last year:Source: Q3 2018 Earnings PresentationThere was a lot to like about Honeywell's fiscal 2018 results so far (the Q4 2018 results are expected to be released on February 1, 2019) but, in my opinion, 2019 has the potential to be an even better year from an operational standpoint.The long-term bull story for Honeywell has not changed: this conglomerate has great businesses in industries that have promising long-term prospects. Moreover, Honeywell appears to have the right management in place and its focus on software (i.e. Industrial Internet of Things) is already paying huge dividends. Lastly, this company should continue to benefit from the strong tailwinds within aerospace.Most economists think that GDP will slow in 2019 when compared to 2018, and current estimates are for GDP growth to remain above 2%.Source: stlouisfed.orgGDP growth will likely not be as high as the past 12 months, but many experts are guiding for stocks to perform well in the new year. Additionally, many pundits are concerned about equities at this point in time, but, as reported by Nuveen, stocks have actually performed well in environments similar to what we are in today.Source: Nuveen, Fall 2018 ReportAt the end of the day, I believe that Honeywell will benefit from a promising backdrop. The economy is not on fire, but, in my mind, Honeywell operates in industries that have strong tailwinds (most notably, Aerospace and Performance Materials & Tech.). Moreover, analysts expect for the companies of the S&P 500 to report strong earnings growth for Q4 2018, after reporting impressive 20% growth in each of the last 3 quarters, so stocks should see some upward movement in the near term, barring weaker-than-expected guidance for 2019.Source: FactSet, January 7, 2019, ReportIndustrials (including Honeywell) will likely be punished if the U.S. has a major economic slowdown, but, in my opinion, a recession is likely not in the cards over the next 12 months.Honeywell's stock is trading at an attractive valuation at today's price.HON PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts17x forward earnings is not cheap, but I believe that Honeywell is in a position to outgrow its current valuation. Specifically, I have a 12-18-month price target of $160 per share; so, in my opinion, HON shares are attractively valued at today's level.A global recession is the most significant risk to my investment thesis, at least in the near term. I do not believe that a recession is not likely to happen over the next 12 months, but if one were to materialize, Honeywell's businesses would be negatively impacted in a major way. Furthermore, investor sentiment is extremely bullish for Honeywell at this point in time, and it largely revolves around the prospects for the aerospace division, so a slowdown in this industry would likely result in shares selling off.Additionally, Honeywell disclosed that the SEC opened an investigation into its accounting for asbestos-related liabilities. Management recently increased its estimate for the potential liabilities for these liabilities, so the SEC is looking into the previously communicated (and booked) estimated charges. I view this as noise, but obviously, it is never good when the SEC comes knocking.This company may not get a ton of coverage, but Honeywell is indeed firing on all cylinders. The company is better positioned today than it has been in years, and, in my opinion, the stock is trading at an attractive valuation (the Street agrees - see this recent upgrade). As such, I believe that investors should treat any significant pullbacks, especially if they are caused by broader market concerns, as long-term buying opportunities.Disclaimer: This article is not a recommendation to buy or sell any stock mentioned.

4215911,65113,2018-10-30T13:41:05-04:00,"Honeywell International has seen a significant dip in price as a result of the broader market selloff.
        However, free cash flow growth remains strong and my prior target price estimation of $227 continues to look realistic.
        While costs might rise as a result of Chinese tariffs, Honeywell International has adequate cash flow to weather the storm.
        I see the selloff of this stock as irrational and the current price could represent a valuable buying opportunity for the long-term investor.","Back in August, I made the argument that Honeywell International (HON) could see an upside to $230 on a free cash flow basis.However, we have recently seen that price has dipped back down significantly to $150.60 at the time of writing:Source: investing.comIs this a sign of concern for the stock, or a significant buying opportunity?Firstly, let’s clarify if this drop is due to the company itself or significantly market-related. We see that while the stock is down by 6.45% since August, the S&P 500 is down by just over 7%:Source: investing.comBased on price action alone, Honeywell International appears to have been a casualty of the broader market sell-off that we have been seeing on U.S. equity markets more generally.Moreover, when looking at recently released 3Q 2018 results, we see that free cash flow conversion has continued to increase. Specifically, free cash flow conversion increased from 89% to 119% compared to 3Q 2017, while in the second quarter free cash flow conversion was up from 87% to 108%. In this quarter, adjusted free cash flow itself was up by over 50% from $1,195 to $1,809 (figures in millions):Source: Honeywell Earnings Release 3Q 2018In this regard, with my prior assumption of a target price of $227 given annual free cash flow growth of 20% and a P/FCF ratio of 21, this company looks to be on track to meet the target price.Moreover, with a current price of $150, this would mean an over 50% upside to the estimated target price. Additionally, note that the P/FCF ratio has gone down slightly from a prior 21x to 18.43x at the time of writing. Granted, the P/FCF ratio has trailed somewhat lower as a result of the price drop, and target price might be somewhat lower at a range of $200-220 if the ratio were to stay at current levels. However, the fact that Honeywell is now cheaper on a P/FCF basis while free cash flow itself has continued to rise is a welcoming sign, and an indication that the company trades at a cheaper value to that of last quarter.As regards business segment performance specifically, the Aero segment continued to remain strong, with organic sales up 10% from a prior 8%, and a segment margin change of 22.1%. While there has been speculation that trade tariffs exchanged between the U.S. and China might affect Honeywell’s Aero segment, there has been no evidence of this so far.Source: Honeywell Earnings Release 3Q 2018Moreover, Safety and Productivity Solutions was bolstered by Honeywell’s Intelligrated, with double-digit sales growth having been driven by large system orders for the first half of the year.Additionally, a significant portion of this growth has come from India and China, which drove growth of more than 20% in sales. With this being said, the company acknowledges that tariffs could have an effect on China growth going forward, with the CEO stating, “We grew the Chinese market but not at the double-digit pace that we saw earlier in the year”. In this regard, with costs expected to rise from “tens of millions” this year to “hundreds of millions” in 2019, there is a chance that we could see somewhat of a strain on cash flow going forward. With that said, free cash flow growth for this segment has been quite impressive, and my overall judgement is that Honeywell continues to have upside to my target price range of $220-230.To conclude, Honeywell International appears to be dropping in line with the broader fall in U.S. equity markets, and my opinion is that investors are selling irrationally. Honeywell International has continued to show strong performance. Granted, Chinese tariffs may lead to a significant rise in costs, but Honeywell International has adequate cash flow to be able to weather this. I see Honeywell as undervalued on a free cash flow basis at this point in time."
4225122,24361,2018-11-28T12:56:31-05:00,"Honeywell is likely to focus on further cost reductions in 2019 as well as redeploying capital into M&A.Automation, particularly in software, controls, and measurement, is likely to be a key M&A focus, but another deal in aerospace could make sense.Honeywell isn't especially cheap, but it does still have some near-term upside as well as long-term appeal.","As multiple short-cycle industrial sectors appear to be slowing, Honeywell (HON) looks like a pretty good option going into 2019. This conglomerate’s third-quarter earnings had a lot of moving parts, but the aerospace, safety, productivity, automation, and specialty chemical operations all appear to be in good shape, and the company continues to make progress with its free cash flow conversion. With management taking renewed aim at fixed costs and very likely to deploy significant capital into additional M&A in 2019 and beyond, I like Honeywell’s positioning as both a shorter-term safe haven and longer-term winner.While Honeywell’s third-quarter earnings last month didn’t offer a lot of pizazz in terms of beat-and-raise momentum, there were nevertheless some solid positives in the report.Organic growth of 7% was perhaps not so exceptional this quarter, but still a good outcome, and Honeywell was hardly alone in seeing some erosion in reported gross margin (50 bps on a reported basis). While revenue was slightly ahead of expectations, the 10% growth in segment-level income drove a 2% beat at that line, with a modest beat in segment margins.Aerospace and Safety and Productivity (or SPS) were once again the growth leaders, with 10% organic growth in Aero and 12% growth in SPS. Aero growth was driven by a strong 19% jump in commercial original equipment revenue, as Honeywell is seeing improving demand for engines, avionics, and APUs, and that demand improvement includes the business jet business. The defense segment was also quite strong (up 14%), and while the commercial aftermarket didn’t do as well in growth terms (up 6%), it still saw broad-based demand growth across transport, regional, and business jet customers.Within SPS, Honeywell had a solid result in Safety (up 6%, in line with the 5% growth reported at 3M (MMM)), and double-digit growth (up 16%) in Productivity on another double-digit growth performance from the Intelligrated automation business.Home and Business were less impressive (up 3% collectively), and Honeywell has completed its Resideo (REZI) spin. Performance Materials grew 4% overall, with good 6% growth in Advanced Materials on ongoing strength in Solstice, but a somewhat underwhelming (at least to me) 4% growth number for Process Solutions at a time when at least some process automation companies like Emerson (EMR) (up 9%) are doing a little better.Margin performance was solid but not spectacular, with a nearly one-point improvement in Aero and a 150 bp improvement in SPS, but only a slight uptick in Home and Business and a 70 bp decline in PMT on an unfavorable mix at the UOP business. Management continues to aggressively target cost reductions (particularly fixed costs), and is creating a new role of Chief Supply Chain Officer.With the spin-offs of Resideo and Garrett Motion (GTX) done, I believe Honeywell is at least somewhat better-positioned going into a 2019 and 2020 that look rougher for shorter-cycle industries. Aerospace is still accelerating with room to run, companies are just starting to make large investments in warehouse/logistics automation, and non-residential construction has stayed stubbornly (if not surprisingly) healthy. Process automation also looks relatively healthy, though the moderation seen at Honeywell and ABB (ABB) is a little curious to me.Along those lines, I’m slightly concerned about whether oil prices will throw some chaos into oil/gas/petrochemical investment plans. Honeywell is less leveraged to upstream spending than Emerson, but it could still take some wind out of the sails.In the short term, Honeywell is going to see dilution from the Garrett and Resideo spin-offs. That is not surprising in and of itself, and management finally put a final price tag on it (about $0.90/share on an annualized basis). Management will move quickly to address stranded costs, and the asbestos liability offsets will be helpful, but there was always going to be an earnings impact from the moves.Given Honeywell’s healthy balance sheet and FCF generation capabilities, as well as a clear desire on the part of management to continue transforming the business, I believe additional M&A is a virtual certainty. Guessing what Honeywell might buy is a cottage industry all on its own, but I’ve highlighted names like Datalogic (OTC:DAGCY), Hexagon (OTCPK:HXGBY), and Spectris (OTCPK:SEPJY) in the past, and I think it is at least plausible that Honeywell will make another attempt at a meaningful deal in the aerospace sector.Speaking more broadly, I expect Honeywell to continue to invest in expanding its capabilities in automation, and I expect the company to remain focused on software and controls, though there are opportunities to add complementary assets that are more on the machinery side. Data capture, measurement, and machine vision could also be areas of focus, though, and I wouldn’t be shocked to see Honeywell consider a name like Cognex (CGNX).Thinking more speculatively, I wonder if Honeywell would consider getting involved in the expected consolidation of the HVAC space. I don’t really feel like that’s an area where Honeywell wants to be, but management may see more synergies here than I do.I’d been modeling Honeywell on an ex-spin-off basis, so nothing about my model changes in any meaningful way. I expect long-term FCF growth in the mid-single digits, and I continue to believe Honeywell is priced for a mid-single-digit return on a DCF basis. An EV/EBITDA approach is more favorable, and I believe post-spins Honeywell can command a higher EBITDA multiple on the basis of higher margins and ROIC, as well as its status as a leader/safe haven in the space. At a mid-teens forward EBITDA multiple (that excludes prospective M&A), a fair value range from the low-to-mid $150s up to about $170 makes sense to me.I’ve liked/preferred Honeywell for a while, and I see no compelling reason to change that position. I believe Honeywell is relatively well-positioned for this next phase of the economic cycle, and I believe management’s positions with respect to costs and remaking the business toward software, automation, measurement, and control are the correct ones. Although I don’t expect outsized absolute returns at this point, I think Honeywell remains a relatively attractive pick in its peer group."
4225727,23998,2018-11-30T17:43:12-05:00,"Barclays analyst Julian Mitchell noted recently that Honeywell was one of eight industrials whose earnings could be at risk due to declining oil prices.In the event that leads to a significant decline in Honeywell shares over the next several months, I present two ways bullish longs can limit their downside risk.Both of these hedges are cost effective, while one has a negative cost.","Honeywell leads with seasonal content (image via Honeywell's website).As Seeking Alpha news editor Carl Surran reported on Wednesday, Honeywell (NYSE:HON) was one of eight industrial companies Barclays analyst Julian Mitchell warned would be at risk if oil prices continued to drop:With that in mind, below are two ways Honeywell shareholders who are still bullish can limit their downside risk in case Mitchell's negative scenario comes to pass.For these two examples, I'll assume that you have 500 shares of Honeywell and are willing to risk a decline of 20% over the next several months, but not one larger than that. As a reminder: these hedges are designed for bullish longs: if you think the stock is going to decline significantly over the next several months, you shouldn't be long the stock.The images below are screen captures via the Portfolio Armor iPhone app.Uncapped Upside, Positive CostAs of Thursday's close, these were the optimal, or least expensive put options to hedge 500 shares of HON against a >20% drop by late June.As you can see above, the cost of this protection was $1,195, or 1.64% of position value. Bear in mind that this cost was calculated conservatively, using the ask price of the puts. In practice, you can often buy and sell options at some price within the bid-ask spread.Capped Upside, Negative CostIf you were willing to cap your possible upside at 9% over the same time frame, you could have used this optimal collar to protect against the same >20% decline as in the previous hedge.The put leg of this collar used the same strike as the previous hedge so the cost was the same: $1,195, or 1.64% of position value (calculated at the ask). But the income generated by selling the call leg, $1,650, or 2.26% of position value (calculated conservatively, at the bid) more than offset the cost the put leg.So, the net cost here was negative, meaning you would have collected a net credit of $455 when opening this hedge, assuming you placed both trades at the worst ends of their respective spreads.One of the nice things about hedging as in the examples above is that you will be protected as specified if the stock declines significantly, regardless of why it declines. So, it doesn't matter if the decline is due to softness in the oil market or not. Maybe oil prices will firm up, benefiting Honeywell's related industries, but Honeywell shares will slide as part of a broad market decline. If that happens, you'd be protected as well with one of the hedges above. Something for risk-averse Honeywell longs to consider."
4224867,99196,2018-11-27T14:33:58-05:00,"The October sell off has created an attractive opportunity to pick up shares at value levels and a potential 18% return opportunity.Honeywell has been focusing on all things Aerospace and making an effort to grow their defense product lines.The company has repurchased $2.3 billion in stock during 2018 and will continue accelerating the buyback at depressed share levels.Honeywell completed the spin-offs of Homes and Global Distribution named ""Resideo"" and transportation Turbocharger divisions named ""Garrett"".","Honeywell (HON) fared better than peers during the October sell off and only traded down by 13% from all time highs recently reached. The stock is undervalued and the sell off has created an opportunity for shareholders to pick up shares at a great value. Honeywell is growing their top line in the high single digits ~8% and trading to a 19 times forward price to earnings ratio, which appears below fair value of $170 per share. Based upon my share price estimate of $170, the stock has an 18% return potential.The company finalized the spinoffs of Resideo (REZI) and Garrett (GTX) with 1:6 and 1:10 share disbursements, respectively. The spin-off was to allow Honeywell to focus on core competencies and acquire company's that are within their wheel house.The most recent acquisition of Transnorm for ~$480 million will complement Honeywell's portfolio and target parcel delivery market that has supported growth in the European e-commerce industry. Transnorm will be incorporated into the Safety and Productivity Solutions division and it is a synergistic acquisition in nature. The company has a Connected Distribution Center product which uses sensors and software management to ensure packages arrive in the proper conveyors and destination before shipment.The company announced on their Q3 earnings organic sales growth of 7%, while the annual revenue growth rate is 8.2%. The top line growth has been in the low single digits historically and the company is benefiting from economic tailwinds to capture new organic growth opportunities in core competences of Aerospace and Defense. With US GDP moving full steam near 3% and world economic conditions holding for the time being, the environment is favorable across Honeywell business lines. The company is growing faster than GDP, which has been a benchmark for growth and executing operationally. The company is achieving record EBT $1.85 billion, which is a 4.2% expansion over the same quarter last year. EBITDA margins are near 21% and the highest they have been in the last 5 years. The company is executing on margin expansion and growth initiatives.The company announced a 10% dividend raise to $0.82 per share quarterly payable in December. The cash dividend paid dropped to $553 million in Q3, because the company is accelerating share repurchases. The dividend in Q3 was paid on 752 million shares, compared to 771 million during the same period in 2017. The dividend gets paid on fewer shares outstanding, thus saving the company cash. The company bought back nearly $604 million in shares during Q3. The share repurchase was front loaded with $1.7 billion bought back in the first half of 2018 because of the €425 million or ""~$482"" million acquisition of Transnorm. I expect the Q4 share repurchase to accelerate over Q3 levels and approach $3 billion for 2018 because of the rapid share-price decline (-13%) and management mentioning on their Q3 conference call they were aggressive in the buyback of shares at attractive prices.The company is justified in receiving a 21 times price to earnings valuation metric because of their above average sales growth of 8.2% YoY and the company's ability to expand margins with a more focused business model after the Garrett and Resideo spin-offs nearing completion.Based on 2019 earnings estimates of $8.10 and a price to earnings multiple of 21 times, I find fair-value for the stock at $170. From 2019 on I forecast free cash flows to grow at a 2.61% annualized rate, while net income grows at 2.73% and EPS at 4.26% driven by share repurchases reducing the outstanding by 1.4% a year. I used a moderate share count reduction assumption, I raised my share repurchase assumption to $2.5 billion of stock annually, which lines up with 2017 and 2018 share repurchase activity. I lowered my annual rate of return assumption from 10% to 7% annual stock price increase when calculating the the average purchase price in my share count reduction. My financial model calculated a share count reduction of 10 - 13 million shares annually.I think Honeywell used the spin-offs of Resideo and Garrett to realign their business and prepare to go on a shopping spree of more synergistic companies in desirable higher growth markets. The new Honeywell will become an Aerospace and Defense contract machine with above industrial industry growth >5%.The commercial aviation and defense sectors grew 19% and 14% respectively (with Garrett Turbochargers included in Aerospace). The Aero/Defense sectors will continue growing rapidly with an expansion of the Department of Defense budget, growth in the business jet market and record backlog at Boeing in their commercial aircraft wing. The aerospace/defense is benefiting from a ramp of sensing and guidance systems in F-35 and Sikorsky CH-47 Chinooks, while having a steady order stream for repairs which helped propelled aftermarket growth to 6%. Strategy: Vertical Bull Call SpreadThe share price decline below the $150 pricing level is allowing investors to be more risky in their bullish views and capture close to a 1 to 1 risk to reward call spread. I believe a $10 dollar gap for a bull call spread should provide a limited risk and reward opportunity that I find likely to work in the traders favor. The purpose of this trade is reduce the capital outlaid to only $690 at risk and have the potential to capture a $446 gain. The stock is undervalued based on fundamentals and if the market trends positive for a Santa Claus rally, you will have a return of nearly 64% on the capital risked. Honeywell is undervalued based on their mid single digit growth rate, which has outpaced GDP/historical growth rates. The company has continued to focus their business on higher growth segments of Aerospace and Defense, while organically growing other core competencies. The company continues to accelerate share repurchases in excess of $2.3 billion and return nearly $760 million dollars a quarter. As long as the economic tailwinds maintain, Honeywell will continue to have upside potential.Options trading is not for everyone, and this strategy is for experienced investors. I highlighted this strategy to show a unique perspective capturing upside in Honeywell shares.

4232141,25120,2019-01-08T14:41:26-05:00,"Resideo is the latest spin-off from Honeywell which has been divesting quite some assets under this structure.I like the appeal of Resideo, that of the positioning, modest valuation, manageable leverage and organic growth.With many of Honeywell's spin-offs not having done that well, and still requiring a good insight into the real numbers following the spin, I am keeping a close eye.","Resideo (REZI) is quite a large spin-off from Honeywell (HON) which in the last few years has built up quite a reputation for spinning-off non-core assets. Resideo has effectively been separated from its former parent for quite a few months now, but I simply forgot to check on the business and its prospects upon the actual spin-off.With 2019 coming up, let's see if the spin-off provides opportunities, with shares now trading at $20, the lower end of the $20-$25 range at which shares have traded since the spin-off in October. I see the appeal of the spin-off, but given that we still have to get a insightful clue on the corporate cost allocation, and the fact that recent Honeywell spin-offs have not fared too well, I am placing shares on my watchlist, on a prominent spot, however.Resideo provides critical residential comfort and security solutions; in fact, it generates about $4.5 billion in sales doing so. Those sales are split equally between both actual products and distribution of products, with the distribution activities (of course) having much lower margins. The business is about two-thirds focused on the US, complemented by a large European business and some smaller international businesses as well.So what products are we talking about? Products offered by Resideo include outdoor cameras, heating controls, boiler controls, humidification treatments, leak and freeze detection, thermostats and of course apps and cloud-based solutions to monitor all of this. Most of these solutions actually fit right within the ""Smart Home"" concept. Not only is this market growing and large, like many housing related stocks, Resideo too believes that the housing cycle is only approaching ""average"" levels at best.The product business generates $2.5 billion in sales on a trailing basis (at the end of 1H 2018) on which it reported $408 million in segment profits. Most of these goods are focused on comfort & care, and while the majority is still not connected, smart solutions are rapidly gaining ground.Distribution is a $2.6 billion business on a trailing basis with $141 million in segment profits and is more heavily skewed to both the US and security market with the ADI distribution business. Not certain is where the sales discrepancy between the sum of both segment sales and the reported $4.5 billion trailing sales numbers comes from, so let's focus on the outlook.In the spin-off presentation, the company suggested that 2018 sales would rise by 6% to $4.77-$4.83 billion, suggesting that this is a large business. This is the easy part as the margins are a more complicated story, impacted by indemnification payments, among others.Buried in the appendix is an agreement in which Resideo will compensate Honeywell for up to 90% of costs associated with remediation of sites, capped at $140 million a year, with a maximum duration of 25 years. So far, the company has recognised a $640 million liability, which is the best estimate. It might be reasonable to assume the maximum liability for the foreseeable future, with average payments having come in at $215 million in the last three years.If we take the 2017 adjusted EBITDA number of $583 million and reduce this by $140 million in remediation costs, the adjusted number comes in at $443 million. Using the same methodology, the 2018 guidance calls for EBITDA at $495-$505 million (thus after accounting for the remediation payments). The more realistic EBITDA number is reduced by another $30 million to $465-$475 million as the company believes this is the most likely outcome from a Trademark License Agreement.If this is correct, net earnings power of $465-$475 million only has to be reduced by about $50 million in D&A expenses (with capital spending running at a similar amount), for an EBIT number of $415-$425 million.Upon the spin-off, it was communicated that Resideo would hold $75 million in cash and operate with $1.15 billion in net debt (excluding environmental liabilities). Based on a realistic EBITDA number of around $470 million, that suggests a very manageable 2.5 times leverage ratio. The company is aiming to leverage down to 2 times but is willing to allocate excess capital to boost organic growth through bolt-on M&A as well as through a dividend which is equal to a 20% payout ratio.With the spin-off taking place at a ratio of one-to-six, that is six shares of Honeywell giving right to one share of Resideo, the company has 123 million shares outstanding. At $20, that gives the company a market value of $2.5 billion and an enterprise valuation of $3.6 billion (excluding environmental liabilities).Using the $420 million midpoint EBIT number and assuming $50 million in interest costs and a 25% tax rate, I see earnings at $277 million on the bottom line. That works down to $2.25 per share in earnings per share, for a mere 9 times multiple, which looks very appealing given the decent organic growth of the business, solid positioning and relatively manageable leverage situation.The third-quarter results, including a conformation of the guidance for 2018 and 2019, as well as nearly a million share purchases by executives in December, did little to create enthusiasm among investors. This comes as the market has seen some turmoil as well of course.With multiple of Honeywell's spin-offs looking very good on paper, the actual performance of these names, including AdvanSix (ASIX) and Garrett Motion (NYSE:GTX) has been mixed, as Resideo is not a winner out of the box as well.Given this, I am naturally a bit cautious, although Resideo looks very good as well. Nonetheless, I will take a few quarters to see how the real numbers look like as some costs will be duplicated and weigh on margins (think of a public listing, for instance) as management is naturally optimistic in spin-off deal presentations. That being said, Resideo looks quite attractively valued at this point in time and at this valuation, which gives it a prominent place on my watchlist. Hence, I am looking to initiate a position once the numbers become more clear."
4209728,24361,2018-10-03T18:11:33-04:00,"Honeywell has remained consistent to the vision management laid out for a higher-growth, higher-margin company, and has acquired Transnorm for a little less than $500M.Transnorm has a strong presence in conveyance systems used to automate warehouses, distribution centers, and other logistics/fulfillment facilities, and particularly in the e-commerce space.Between growing opportunities in automation and safety, complementary opportunities in refinery catalysts, and the aerospace cycle, Honeywell still looks like an attractive name to hold in the multi-industrial space.","Honeywell (HON) management has made no secret of its game plan for the future, nor its desire to be a leader in markets with above-average potential for revenue growth, margins, and returns on capital. In keeping with that plan, the company has already spun out Garrett Motion (GTX), will be spinning out Resideo, and just announced another promising acquisition for its warehouse automation business.Between its very strong process automation business, its rapidly-growing warehouse automation business, underrated operations in specialty materials/chemicals and safety, and a solid (if generally well-understood) aerospace business, I find it hard not to like Honeywell. Valuation is not exactly low, but with the company consistently repositioning itself toward higher-growth, higher-margin businesses, and particularly ones where it's establishing strong market share, I continue to like Honeywell as a long-term holding.Honeywell recently announced that it would acquire Transnorm for a little under $500 million in cash, buying the business from a private equity owner.Transnorm focuses on engineered conveyor solutions and offers a wide range of conveyor belt systems and solutions for moving products through warehouses, distribution centers, and other logistics facilities. Around 80% to 90% of Transnorm’s revenue comes from e-commerce-related business, and the company has seen its revenue growth accelerate from the low-to-mid teens in recent years to 30% expected growth in 2018 as more and more companies automate their warehouse and fulfillment operations to reduce their operating costs and keep up with ever-increasing e-commerce volumes.Assessing Transnorm’s position/scale in the market is tough, largely because the data on conveyors and conveyor systems is noisy. In many cases the revenue generated by companies like Transnorm is blended together with that of companies like FLSmidth (OTCPK:FLIDY) and Fenner (acquired earlier this year by Michelin (OTCPK:MGDDY)) that supply conveyor systems for mining, or companies that focus on systems aimed at manufacturing production lines. As far as I can tell, though, Transnorm does have a meaningful presence in the warehouse/logistics side of the business, and I’d note the installed base of more than 160,000 units.Honeywell is paying multiples similar to what it paid for Intelligrated (around 12x EBITDA), and is likewise getting a company with meaningfully higher margins (EBITDA margins around 35%) and revenue growth prospects than its corporate average. Admittedly, $41 million in near-term EBITDA is not going to make much of a dent in a company with roughly $7,500 million in post-spin-off EBITDA, but like Intelligrated this is an opportunity to improve a fast-growing business (warehouse automation) where Honeywell is making a strong land-grab early in the cycle.Like Emerson (EMR), Honeywell continues to benefit from healthy demand across almost all verticals in the process automation market. Upstream oil and gas companies continue to boost capex, as do refining and chemical companies, and I believe the high single-digit order growth reported at Emerson is a reasonable proxy for Honeywell, though Honeywell is more focused on midstream and downstream markets relative to Emerson (which is highly leveraged to U.S. onshore upstream oil and gas). Power is a notable exception in terms of its weaker project growth outlook, but even here companies like Emerson and Honeywell are seeing maintenance spending recoveries.Looking out a couple of years, LNG remains a meaningful potential driver for Honeywell’s process automation business. Honeywell already has a place in more than 40 LNG terminal facilities, with good share in DCS (control systems for process automation), safety systems, and controls. In addition to a $30 billion LNG Canada project, Honeywell could benefit from increased investments in U.S. LNG export capacity. There also are significant downstream capacity improvement/expansion plans at various stages of development in Latin America (including Pemex), the Middle East (including ADNOC), and Asia, and Honeywell’s presence in both process automation (particularly controls and safety systems) and refining technology/catalysts in its UOP business gives it an opportunity to “double dip” in these projects.Given Emerson’s recent acquisition of GE’s (GE) PLC/PAC business, not to mention other acquisitions in the automation space, I do wonder if Honeywell has any plans to change its basic approach to process automation. Warehouse automation certainly qualifies as a sort of hybrid automation, and Honeywell has made it clear that it sees this as a key long-term growth opportunity that it is willing to support with M&A investment. I’m not so sure, though, that Honeywell is eager to invest elsewhere in controls or instrumentation for more discrete/hybrid automation markets, though I could see more investments in industrial software as consistent with the company’s long-term growth/margin focus.As I said before, the acquisition of Transnorm doesn’t really represent a change in the trajectory of Honeywell’s business as much as it is a reaffirmation of where the company’s growth and M&A investment priorities still lie. Warehouse automation remains a significant long-term growth opportunity, and Honeywell has made it clear that they want to be a first mover and secure a strong market presence before other automation companies even really get moving (though ABB (ABB) has made some recent investments).I believe these ongoing investments in automation and software are net positives for the long-term valuation potential for Honeywell. With better growth, margin, ROIC, and free cash flow generation prospects than the businesses it is discarding, Honeywell’s overall profile is improving (even if somewhat slowly) and that should ultimately be reflected in higher relative multiples. I can’t say that Honeywell is significantly undervalued on its near-term financials, but I do agree with the vision Honeywell is pursuing and I believe this is still a high-quality long-term investment option, even with some risk/vulnerability to sector-wide and market-wide re-rating."
4211518,98446,2018-10-14T21:21:49-04:00,"Honeywell’s businesses have performed very well so far in 2018.The stock is now flat year to date.After the recent sell-off, I find shares to be fairly valued.We purchase a small amount of Honeywell each month through a share building service.","I’m a big proponent of using share building accounts to build up positions in companies over time. There are many companies that will even let you do this without charging you a fee to buy small allotments at a time. Many of these companies even let you reinvest dividends free of charge. These positions can become quite large after a while just from purchasing small amounts of stock at a time. Purchasing over time allows an investor to dollar-cost-average into a position. I like using share-building accounts for industrial companies because it helps to even out our average purchase price over all phases of the economic cycle. One company that we’ve built a decent-sized position in using just this way is Honeywell International (HON).We purchase a small amount of Honeywell each month through EQ by Equiniti, formerly known as Shareowner Online. There are zero trading or dividend reinvestment fees and just a $25 minimum purchase. I should note that this isn’t an endorsement of EQ Online, just stating what service we use to make our stock purchases. Honeywell’s business model, growth prospects and dividend history make me believe that the stock is a good longer term bet. Let’s look at why I feel this way.Honeywell is a diversified industrial company. The company is composed of four separate segments: Aerospace, Performance Materials, Home & Building and Safety & Productivity. Honeywell generated more than $40 billion in sales last year, with ~44% coming from international markets. The stock has a current market cap of $114 billion.Honeywell has completed several spin-offs in recent months. On October 1st, shareholders received one share of Garrett Motion Inc. (NYSE:GTX) for every ten shares of Honeywell that they owned as of September 18th. Garrett Motion is a low cost producer of highly engineered turbocharger and electric technologies for light and commercial vehicles. It also provides aftermarket services for its products. Garrett produced more than $3 billion in sales in 2017, with 30% coming from Asia. Sales totals represented just under 8% of Honeywell’s total last year. Garrett has seen 7% organic growth in the first half of 2018.On October 29th, Honeywell will spin off Resideo, its Homes & Global Distribution business. Resideo provides residential customers with heating and cooling products as well as security features. Resideo also wholesales products to customers around the world. The Resideo businesses generated $4.5 billion in sales in 2017, more than 10% of its parent company’s total for the year.Honeywell most recently reported earnings results on July 20th. The company managed to surpass its own guidance on many metrics.Source: Honeywell International’s Second-Quarter Earnings Results, page 2.Honeywell earned $2.12 per share during the second quarter, coming in $0.11 ahead of estimates and demonstrating almost 18% growth year over year. The company’s tax rate was 21.7% during the quarter, lower than its planned rate of 24%. This added $0.06 per share. Even with this added benefit, EPS results still managed to top estimates. Revenue improved more than 8.3% to $10.9 billion. This was $120 million above what the market was looking for. Organic sales grew by 6%.Aerospace, which is Honeywell’s largest division, saw sales increase 8% organically. Higher demand for business aviation, aftermarket services and automotive products contributed to this strong sales growth. Honeywell’s FalconConnect, which was launched during the second quarter, allows for connectivity for crew and passengers aboard aircraft. Management stated that it expects many in the commercial aviation industry to spend additional capital in the upcoming years to improve connectivity on airplanes.Performance Materials had 3% organic growth led by demand for Process Solutions and Solstice, the company’s home installation product. Sales were up as Honeywell was able to convert its backlog into actual sales.Home & Building also had organic revenue growth of 3% as residential thermal products and thermostats continue to show high demand from consumers. Commercial products also contributed to this sales growth. Honeywell said that it is piloting a program that allows maintenance personal to use performance data from buildings to help determine where repairs should be focused. This has led to a reduction in total maintenance hours as well as costs.Safety & Productivity posted 11% organic sales growth. Demand was high during the quarter for Honeywell’s products in the Internet of Things and Sensing businesses. Honeywell is providing Amazon (AMZN) with its Intelligrated system for a new distribution center in Canada. The Intelligrated system helps workers more efficiently pick, pack and ship orders.On the strength of the company’s second-quarter performance, Honeywell increased the midpoint for earnings per share guidance for the year to $8.10 from $7.95. If achieved, the new guidance for EPS would represent 14% earnings growth. The company also expects organic growth in the range of 5-6% for 2018, up from its previous estimate of 3-4%.Honeywell is expected to release third-quarter earnings on October 19th.While Honeywell hasn’t cut its dividend over the last two decades, the company has paused its dividend growth on more than one occasion. The most recent pause took place from 2009 through 2010. Given that earnings per share declined 32% from 2008 to 2009, this dividend pause was likely a wise choice by Honeywell. A dividend pause in the midst of a recession is much preferred to a cut. When earnings growth returned, so did dividend growth. In fact, Honeywell has increased its dividend:For industrial companies, I like to see at least 10% dividend growth over the last five and ten-year periods. Since industrial companies are often tied to the health of the economy, these types of dividend growth rates tell me that management is bullish on the company’s future. These growth rates are very close to my target.Honeywell was able to grow its dividend by an average nearly double-digits every year over the last decade even with a pause in dividend growth. Even better, dividend growth has occurred at a higher clip in recent years.Honeywell raised its dividend 10.1% on September 28th for the December payment. This marks the eighth year in a row that the company has increased its dividend. Shareholders will receive $3.06 in dividends in 2018. Based off of expected earnings per share, Honeywell has a payout ratio of 37.8%. According to Value Line, the company’s payout ratio averaged 36.1% over the last ten years. The current ratio is very much in line with the company’s historical average. Shares currently yield 2.13%, which is slightly above the yield of the S&P 500 (1.92%).In addition to dividend growth, Honeywell also returned capital to shareholders in the form of buybacks. The company bought back $800 million worth of stock in the second quarter. For the year, Honeywell has repurchased $1.7 billion worth of shares.Honeywell’s stock, along with the rest of the market, has experienced a steep sell-off over the past couple of days. The stock is now flat year to date. With shares dropping more than 6% in a week, is Honeywell now a buy?If you’re not familiar with how I value stocks, I take the current price and compare it to fair values and price targets from a number of different sources to see how over or undervalued shares are currently. I then take the average of these values to determine a price target. For companies that have increased their dividend by less than a decade, which Honeywell has done, I target waiting until the stock is fairly valued prior to purchasing.First place, I check prior to purchasing a stock in Value Line for its safety and financial security ratings. Honeywell receives a 1 and A++, respectively. These are the highest ratings that Value Line awards and reassures me that the company’s financial situation is strong.Based off of Thursday’s closing price of $153.62 and guidance for earnings per share for the year of $8.10, Honeywell’s stock trades with a P/E of 19. This a 6.2% premium to the stock’s five-year P/E of 17.8. I should note that Honeywell is trading at a discount to the S&P 500 multiple of 22.3.CFRA forecast a one-year price target of $182, which would result in a share price gain of 18.5% from current levels. CFRA’s fair value of $113.63 says that the stock is 26.1% overvalued at the moment. Morningstar estimates fair value to be $168, offering 9.3% upside. Value Engine has a one-year price target of $174.20, which would mean shares are 13.4% undervalued by this metric. Value Engine says fair value is $146.56. This means that the stock is 4.6% overvalued based off of its fair value.Average these values out and I find shares of Honeywell to be 0.72% undervalued. I see fair value for shares at $155. While we add a small amount of Honeywell each month, I feel that the stock is worth considering for purchase at the current levels by those investors wishing to start or add to a position.Honeywell’s business performance has been very strong so far in 2018. All four of the company’s business segments contributed to 6% organic growth in the previous quarter. Honeywell has also increased its earnings per share and organic guidance for the year. While the stock is about where it began the year, I feel the recent sell-off gives investors an opportunity to add Honeywell to their portfolio.What is your opinion of Honeywell?

4213664,79675,2018-10-23T23:29:45-04:00,"Honeywell reported impressive Q3 2018 financial results that beat on the bottom line but was only in line with top-line estimates.Honeywell reported broad-based growth, with Aerospace being a big contributor, but I believe that the company's strong organic revenue growth was the highlight of the quarter.I am long Honeywell and I may add to my position in the months ahead.","Honeywell (HON) reported impressive Q3 2018 financial results last week but shares of the industrial conglomerate finished the trading day down by almost 2%. Honeywell's stock has not performed well over the first 10 months of 2018, as HON shares are basically flat while the broader market is up almost 3% over the same period of time.HON data by YChartsHowever, as I have described several times over the past two years, I believe that any significant pullbacks for HON shares should be viewed as long-term buying opportunities and it is important to note that my thoughts have not changed after reviewing the company's Q3 2018 results. Actually, I am more bullish now than I have been in quite some time.On October 19, 2018, Honeywell reported better-than-expected Q3 2018 EPS of $2.03 (beat by $0.04) on revenue of $10.76B (in line with analyst estimates). The company's Q3 2018 financial results were significant improvements from what Honeywell reported in the year-ago quarter (revenue and adjusted EPS were up 7% and 17%, respectively).Moreover, as shown, Honeywell continues to report strong cash flow metrics and Q3 2018 was no exception as the company's adjusted free cash flow (""FCF"") was up 51% YoY. More importantly, management expects for the improving cash flow metrics to continue through at least the remainder of 2018. Cash is king, right?From an operational standpoint, Honeywell reported broad-based strength across its portfolio of businesses but Aerospace was again the main growth driver.Three of the four operating units reported YoY growth in both revenue and margins but, in my mind, the real story for the quarter was the strong organic revenue growth. During the conference call, management highlighted that 65% of the company's businesses reported organic revenue growth of at least 5% (that is impressive, folks) and mentioned that most of the growth was a result of increased volumes. And as you might guess, Aerospace led the charge (i.e., the most material impact on the consolidated results).There were plenty of positive takeaways from the Q3 2018 results (and management commentary), but in my opinion, Honeywell's strong organic revenue growth was the highlight. Remember, there are a lot of moving pieces to contend with (i.e., small tuck-in acquisitions and the spins) so it is important for Honeywell to report organic results that tell a good story, especially in today's environment. In my opinion, the Q3 2018 results support the thought that management has Honeywell well-positioned for 2019 and beyond.Management has already increased its full-year guidance four different times in 2018, so another update should have come as no surprise.Sales are now expected to come in at the bottom of the previously communicated range (approximately 3%) but organic revenue growth (i.e., the most important metric, especially given the spins) is now expected to hit 6%.At the end of the day, the updated guidance shows just how better positioned management believes the 'new' Honeywell will be (i.e., the guidance for margins, adjusted EPS and adjusted FCF were all raised). The 'smaller is better' theme flowed throughout the earnings material, which makes sense as management prepares for life after Garrett Motion (GTX) and Resideo.Management plans to hold an investor outlook meeting in a few months, but it provided its preliminary thoughts on 2019.The main takeaways - Honeywell's businesses will continue to benefit from strong end markets and eliminating costs will be a focus for the foreseeable future.To start, make no mistake about it, Honeywell is (and has been) the best-of-breed company within the industrial space. The company performed well under its former CEO Mr. Dave Cote, and the conglomerate is currently being guided by another great leader in Mr. Darius Adamczyk. I say all of this to say, Honeywell deserves to trade at a premium valuation when compared to its peers.HON P/E Ratio (Forward) data by YChartsGeneral Electric (GE) is obviously the outlier, and for good reason, but Honeywell is trading at what some may call a 'rich' valuation. I, on the other hand, believe that Honeywell is in a position to more than grow into its current valuation. I have a 12-18 month price target of $175 per share; so, in my opinion, HON shares are attractively valued at today's level.A global recession is the most significant risk to my investment thesis, at least in the near term. I do not believe that a recession is not likely to happen over the next 12 months, but if one were to materialize, Honeywell's businesses would be negatively impacted in a major way. Furthermore, investor sentiment is extremely bullish for Honeywell at this point in time and it largely revolves around the prospects for the aerospace division, so a slowdown in this industry would likely result in shares selling off.Additionally, Honeywell disclosed that the SEC opened an investigation into its accounting for asbestos-related liabilities. Management recently increased its estimate for the potential liabilities for these liabilities, so the SEC is looking into the previously communicated (and booked) estimated charges. I view this as noise, but obviously, it is never good when the SEC comes knocking.The long-term bull story is [still] obvious: Honeywell is an industrial conglomerate that has great businesses in industries that have promising long-term prospects. Moreover, Honeywell appears to have the right management in place and its focus on software (i.e. Industrial Internet of Things) is already paying huge dividends. Lastly, this company should continue to benefit from the strong tailwinds within aerospace.The impressive organic revenue growth across the board shows that this company is firing on all cylinders and, in my opinion, the strong guidance for 2018 and 2019 should not be overlooked. As such, I believe that investors should treat any significant pullbacks, especially if they are caused by broader market concerns, as long-term buying opportunities. The company/stock is down, but it is not out.Author's Note: All images were taken from Honeywell's Q3 2018 Earnings Presentation, unless otherwise stated. I own a sizable Honeywell position in the R.I.P. Portfolio and I am looking to add HON shares on any significant pullbacks.Disclaimer: This article is not a recommendation to buy or sell any stock mentioned. These are only my personal opinions. Every investor must do his/her own due diligence before making any investment decision."
4213830,103012,2018-10-24T12:00:51-04:00,"Honeywell is a ‘best-in-class’ industrial.After the recent spin-offs, the company is leaner and looking to invest in higher growth segments.The company has a pristine balance sheet and impressive free cash flow.It pays a 2.2% dividend and actively buying back shares.Honeywell is slightly undervalued.","Honeywell International (HON) is a high-quality industrial, led by a diverse and young management team. The company has a good mix of cyclical and non-cyclical segments and is diversified geographically. Over the past 10 years, its top-line has been growing consistently at the inflation rate -- nothing sexy but what it has done very well is as it scales it has expanded the operating margins from 9.7% to current 17.6%. Its free cash flow has also doubled over the same period. It’s a solid achievement considering their leverage ratio barely budged.With minimal growth, Honeywell has been using its surplus resource to buy back shares and pay out a 2.2% dividend. Interestingly, it currently commands an attractive FCF multiple compared to the S&P500. We think this company is a solid defensive investment and could add diversification power to ones’ portfolio.Investing in Honeywell is akin to managing a $112 billion diversified portfolio of companies. Honeywell has cyclical businesses in aerospace (Aero) and home & building (NASDAQ:HBT), and it also has the less cyclical and growth opportunities in performance (PMT, automation technologies) and safety and productivity segments (SPS).The portfolio has recently trimmed two businesses, Garrett Motion (NYSE:GTX), a commercial vehicles business, and Resideo (end of Oct, 2018), its homes & global distribution business. It will remain diversified with sales spreads evenly (except Aero) in three categories as shown in the table below.Source: Investor presentation Q3 2018Honeywell is also well diversified geographically. Including exports, more than half of Honeywell’s sales (55%) is generated outside the US, spreads broadly across Europe and Asia.Source: Honeywell 10-K Dec 2017Interestingly, 10% of its annual sales is with the US Government (principally in Aerospace), and we are excited about the link up with Amazon (AMZN) in automation technologies.The management remained tight-lipped about the specifics with Amazon in the conference call but the potential for a very large deal should be watched with great intent.Impressively, all the diversification did not blunt Honeywell’s ability to perform. They have consistently beat market consensus. They had raised guidance each of the last four quarters.Source: Investor presentation Q3 2018What we particularly like the decision to spin-off Resideo, Honeywell will have divested one of the lower performing businesses (low single digit EBITDA and minimal organic growth), this is reflected in the higher FCF guidance for the year, from $5.2-$5.8B to $5.8-$6.2B.Source: Investor presentation Q3 2018We are also encouraged by the optimistic 2019 outlook,Source: Honeywell Q3-2108 CCNo specifics offered by the management, but having investigated the travel space (Yatra (YTRA) and airports operators (CAAP (CAAP), we can concur that e-commerce and commercial aviation traffic will likely continue to strengthen next year. This is crucially important for Honeywell as Aerospace is its biggest segment.In addition, the company grew its backlog by 7%, in which the long cycle segments achieved 14% growth. Even though backlog is not the most reliable indicator of future sales, the figures still show a healthy business demand ahead.Year to date, Honeywell rewarded shareholders a total of $4.5B, evenly spread in buyback and dividend. This year, the company increased dividend payout by another 10% (announced Sept, 2018), and approved a further share buyback programme with a target of reducing the share count by at least 1%.However, at the current share price, we would prefer the company to ease back the share repurchase. We feel the stock price isn’t cheap and the spare resource could be put at better use elsewhere. For example, something like the recent acquisition of Transnorm, a Europe based supplier of warehouse automation solutions, would be exciting to us. Or in areas that are showing the most growth, namely Safety and Productivity Solutions.In the past year, Honeywell has been buying back its shares aggressively between $140 and $155 per share. However, at this range, it is not exactly adding value. With higher base interest rates environment in the coming years, we would prefer Honeywell to reduce its debts obligations and explore higher growth M&A areas.Having said that, for a company that has such a robust business model, and distinguish balance sheet, we think it is undervalued compared to the S&P500. Honeywell has a P/E of 19x and FCF of 18x, slightly lower than the S&P 500, 22x.Moreover, as an established business, FCF should be a more important metric to value a business. Like Buffett, we think no metric conveys a business’ pricing power better. Incidentally, it is the best thing about Honeywell. Since 2008, Honeywell’s FCF and FCF margin has not stopped growing. Base on this metric, Honeywell is undervalued.Source: Author’s calculations, MorningstarNo investing strategy will work all the time, in time of exuberant and confidence, growth stock will do very well, and in time of pessimism, value will do better. At the moment, it is not great fun for bargain hunters; most stocks are rich in valuation, especially in the US. On the other hand, growth investments in the FAANGs are also under pressure.Honeywell offers an uncanny appeal to both types of investors. It trades at a low FCF multiple compared to the broad market, yet also offers defensive quality thanks to its diverse segments and geography. As value investors, Honeywell valuation is slightly higher than our liking, however, at the very least, its active buyback and respectable dividend policy will sweeten the deal for other investors.EndnoteIf you found this article helpful and/or would like to easily refer back to it in the future, please click the ""Like"" button and it will be saved to your favorites.If you would like to stay up to date on our latest analysis, we invite you to follow us on Seeking Alpha (click the "" Follow"" button next to our profile picture at the top) as we continue to cover hidden value stocks."
4207788,104376,2018-09-23T21:56:46-04:00,Garrett is a spin-off which has a very strong underlying business and a number of competitive advantages.The company is more than fairly valued and I don’t believe new investors should rush into buying stock. Consider the firm's asbestos liabilities.I would consider selling Garrett if I was a newfound shareholder. Honeywell has run up significantly in price and Garrett will be fairly valued.,"Honeywell's (NYSE:HON) shareholders soon have a decision to make, should they sell, hold or buy more shares of Garrett's (GTX) stock which is being given to them. The answer might not be as straightforward as it seems. For those of you unfamiliar with Garrett following Honeywell’s spin-off, here is a brief background of the company, right from its Form 10.I was very excited when Honeywell first announced that it would be spinning-off its transportation systems. When I first read Garrett’s Form 10 it was impressive to me, though I had a number of concerns. Let’s start with the positives.Garrett has a number of important competitive advantages which I believe are essential for success in the automotive industry. To begin with, the firm is a low-cost producer. This is essential as the automotive industry is increasingly commoditized and companies look to source for the cheapest. Secondly, I like the fact that the company works with OEMs and has established business-to-business relationships. When companies collaborate on this scale, it usually means that they have strong working relationships and are interested in developing solutions together. For investors, this means strong and predictable income, which usually goes out over a number of years. Indeed, this is exactly what is taking place at Garrett.Source 1: Investor PresentationI was impressed by the company’s technology, forward-looking management and diversified revenue stream. The company is focused on pivoting its business to the electrified vehicle industry, and for a company that operates in the automotive sector, it is not dependent on any customer to a great degree. These were positive signs.Source 2: Form 10Investing in spin-offs is always interesting because there can be a significant amount of volatility when the stock first begins trading. A large number of investors are unwillingly given shares and often don’t want to hold stock in a small-cap company; this often causes the stock price to move sharply downward. I believe this could well be the case for Garrett. Let’s examine why:Honeywell currently has a market cap of ~$123 billion. The company is issuing 1 share of Garrett for every ten shares of Honeywell that trade in the market. Garrett will have a market capitalization of ~$1.2 billion. With the revenue and EBITDA numbers that the company is putting up, I believe that the valuation is still slightly stretched. Garrett is a strong company but it has a number of important liabilities which need to be paid and a mediocre capital structure. I wouldn't pay this price for a company in a low growth space like turbochargers, even if the fundamentals of the business are strong.I believe that the valuation of Garrett is on the high end, simply because Honeywell has been coming out with some amazing numbers recently. The stock has run up in price significantly and the businesses' spin-offs are already priced into the stock. I believe that Garrett needs to dip significantly in price before it becomes an attractive investment from a risk/reward perspective.Source 3: Investor PresentationThe biggest red flag I saw in the Form 10 is that Honeywell is transferring responsibility to Garrett for certain Transportation Systems liabilities in connection with the separation. These are asbestos liabilities which date back to the 1920s.  Honeywell is a defendant in asbestos personal injury actions mainly related to legacy Bendix Friction Materials business. Garrett has entered into an indemnification agreement with Honeywell as a means to create an obligation for Garrett to pay annually while not transferring the actual legal obligation for the liability.This is dangerous, as the settlement amount seems unclear. Although Honeywell will retain legal obligation related to liability and continue to manage claims and administrative processes, Garrett will be required to pay the cost (although it can never be more than $175mm in any given year). Honeywell will only be responsible for 10% of the Bendix liabilities. Given the fact that this newfound spin-off has just had a massive liability lumped onto it, I would be very weary. Lawsuits are unpredictable and there is no way of knowing how much money Garrett could be on the hook to pay.If I was a shareholder of Honeywell I would consider selling off my shares in Garrett if the company sells in the marketplace for a valuation of $12 billion. I think that is too rich of a price for a company with these kinds of growth numbers. Yes, the company has an attractive future ahead, but that does not mean that it is worth its valuation. Additionally, the asbestos liability is a major red flag which carries risk that cannot be calculated."
4202115,79675,2018-08-26T12:51:19-04:00,Honeywell's stock has performed well so far in 2018 and I believe that the outperformance should continue through 2019.Management recently raised their full-year 2018 guidance [again] and announced that the spinoffs were still on track.There are plenty of reasons to stay long Honeywell so I plan to do just that. What are your thoughts?,"Honeywell (HON) is a company that continues to impress the market, and it helped this industrial conglomerate's bull case that management recently raised their full-year 2018 EPS guidance and announced that the spinoffs were still on track for later this year. As a result of this encouraging news, HON shares traded higher by over 2%, which brings the YTD performance to approximately 3%.Honeywell's stock is up big over the last three years but, as I recently described here, this industrial conglomerate is a must own stock in today's environment. It may be hard to make yourself jump in while shares are trading close to the $160 per share range but, in my opinion, Honeywell's stock should continue to fly higher through 2019 and beyond.On July 20, 2018, Honeywell continued its streak of reporting strong operating results when the company released its Q2 2018 earnings report. The company reported adjusted Q2 2018 EPS of $2.12 (beat by $0.11) on revenue of $10.9B (beat by $120M), which compared favorably to the results reported for the same period of the prior year.Source: Q2 2018 Earnings PresentationHoneywell's expanding margins and FCF growth are key components to its long-term story but, more importantly, this company continues to benefit from improving business environments. To this point, each operating segment reported strong top-line growth in addition to expanding margins for Q2 2018.Source: Q2 2018 Earnings PresentationThere was a lot to like about Honeywell's Q2 2018 operating results, but it is important to note that management also struck a bullish tone during the conference call about what the rest of 2018 may bring:Notice that management not only talked up the Q2 2018 results but that they also guided for a strong finish to 2018. Additionally, Mr. Adamczyk raised Honeywell's full-year 2018 for the second time this year. Today, only a few short months after this earnings call, Mr. Adamczyk and team raised their 2018 guidance again and talked up the benefits of the upcoming spins.On August 23, 2018, Honeywell's management team held an investor meeting that covered a wide range of topics with the most notable item being the company's newly updated full-year 2018 guidance.Source: Investor Update PresentationBy my count, management has raised Honeywell's full-year 2018 guidance three times, which is pretty impressive, right? The company has also reported broad-based growth through the first half of 2018 but, in my opinion, the benefits from the spinoffs are the reason why investors should own the stock today (i.e., the most significant near-term catalyst).After the spinoffs, shareholders will own a more-focused Honeywell in addition to holding shares of two businesses that should be well-positioned as standalone entities. Honeywell also expects to receive a one-time dividend of approximately $3B from the spinoffs (and legacy liability relief), which gives management additional dry powder for their capital deployment plans.The Garrett spin, which is the Transportation Systems business, is expected to be completed at the end of Q3 2018 and the Resideo spin, which is the Homes & Global Distribution business, is expected to be completed by the end of 2018. Honeywell already has promising long-term business prospects, which should only be helped by the spinoffs so, as I recently described, the spins should be viewed as icing on the cake. It also helps the bull case that Honeywell shares are not yet priced for perfection.Honeywell is trading at a reasonable valuation when compared to its peer group.YChartsHON shares are trading at a 'rich' valuation of 19x forward earnings but I believe that this company is the best of breed in the industrial space. Plus, the market is trading at (or near) all-time highs so 19x is not as rich as it may seem.Let's also not forget that Honeywell has been extremely shareholder-friendly - repurchased approximately $1.7B worth of stock over the first six months of 2018 and raised its dividend in late 2017 - and, in my opinion, the company has more catalysts (especially from a near-term perspective) than any of its peers. Therefore, I believe that the company is in a position to more than grow into its current valuation.A global recession is the most significant risk to my investment thesis, at least in the near term. I do not believe that a recession is not likely to happen over the next 12 months, but if one were to materialize, Honeywell's businesses would be negatively impacted in a major way. Furthermore, investor sentiment is extremely bullish for Honeywell at this point in time and it largely revolves around the prospects for the aerospace division, so a slowdown in this industry would likely result in shares selling off.Another risk point relates to the company's restructuring plan because there is no guarantee that the spin-offs will go without a hitch. If the company has cost buildups or issues with the formation of the two separate entities, Honeywell's stock could be under pressure in late 2018/early 2019.The long-term bull story is obvious: Honeywell is an industrial conglomerate that has great businesses in industries that have promising long-term prospects. Moreover, Honeywell appears to have the right management in place and its focus on software (i.e. Industrial Internet of Things) is already paying huge dividends. Lastly, the spinoffs have the potential to unlock a tremendous amount of shareholder value over the next 12-18 months.Honeywell's stock has performed well on a YTD basis, and rightfully so, but I do not believe that investors with a long-term perspective have missed the boat just yet. As such, investors with a time horizon longer than 12 months should consider this stock on any significant pullbacks.Disclaimer: This article is not a recommendation to buy or sell any stock mentioned.

4205935,79675,2018-09-12T21:12:06-04:00,"Honeywell was already a must-own company/stock, but in my opinion, the spinoffs are another reason to own the company's shares today.There is a lot to like about the upcoming spinoff, Garrett Motion Inc. However, investors need to consider several major risk factors.I plan to hold onto my Garrett Motion shares once the company gets spun out. What are your thoughts on this soon-to-be standalone entity?","I recently published a bullish article on Honeywell (NYSE:HON) and described why investors should stick with this ""winning"" company. As described in the linked article, Honeywell is well-positioned for 2018 (and beyond), and the company's recent operating results fully supports the bull case for this industrial conglomerate.In this article, I will describe another reason why investors may want to stay invested in Honeywell through at least the end of 2018, i.e., the upcoming spinoffs, and more specifically, the Garrett Motion (NYSE:GTX) spin that will occur in the near future.Honeywell announced that its board declared a pro rata dividend of stock in Garrett Motion Inc. that will be made on October 1, 2018, to Honeywell shareholders as of September 18, 2018 (the record date). According to the company, shareholders will receive 1 share of Garrett Motion for every 10 shares of Honeywell common stock that is owned. And finally, Garrett Motion will begin regular-way trading on the NYSE under the symbol ""GTX"" on October 1, 2018.With the transaction details out of the way, let's focus on what shareholders will receive in early October. During the Garrett Investor Conference that was held on September 6, 2018, management did a great job describing the soon-to-be standalone company's business, financial position, cost structure and investment thesis.Shareholders/prospective investors should definitely review the entire Investor Presentation, but I will provide my top three takeaways below. However, before we jump in, the following is Garrett Motion's business overview from the recently released Form 10:Garrett operates in a highly cyclical industry, and it is subject to significant currency risk (two significant risk factors), but in my opinion, there are legitimate reasons why investors may want to hold onto GTX shares after they begin to trade on the NYSE.(1) Garrett Shouldn't Be Viewed As An OutcastThis company has global scale and it has a promising product portfolio, but more importantly, Garrett already has a solid business with strong operating results/metrics.Additionally, it is a market leader in an industry that has promising prospects.As shown, Garrett's top line grew organically by 7% YoY over the first half of 2018. Also shown, the company operates in areas that are expected to experience strong growth over the next 7-plus years.It is important to note that Honeywell is not spinning off Garrett because it's a bad business, but instead, Honeywell's management team determined that Garrett would operate better as a standalone entity (coupled with the fact that Honeywell is streamlining operations). Simply put, the business makeup of Garrett (highly cyclical) did not fit the core business criteria that Mr. Darius Adamczyk, CEO, wanted for Honeywell for the years ahead. On the other hand, management has continued to talk up Garrett and its long-term business prospects.(2) Financially, Garrett Is Well-Positioned (Sort Of)Let's start with how the company is positioned from a financial standpoint. Garrett has a great cost structure that will allow it to weather downturns, which is especially important for a company that operates in an industry that will always have to contend with business cycles.Garrett Motion's cost structure, coupled with its ability to effectively manage its working capital management (something that Honeywell is known for), has allowed for the company to have a superior margin profile.From a balance sheet perspective, Garrett is in what I would call a ""serviceable"" position (i.e., nothing to really brag about, but nothing to cry about either).The company will have a large net debt position, and its current ratio is below 1 (not good). As shown, the payments on the large liability to Honeywell (""Obligations payable to Honeywell"") are capped on an annual basis, which somewhat limits the financial risk.I say that Garrett is in a serviceable financial position because I believe that the company has the cash flow prospects to deleverage its stretched balance sheet in the next few years. As expected, Garrett is not being spun out with a great balance sheet, but in my opinion, management's long-term financial goals (specifically, deleveraging) are achievable.(3) The Technology Growth Prospects Are StrongGarrett is already well-positioned in the turbocharge space, but its management team has also been laser-focused on the next key growth driver, technology.The company is utilizing technology to differentiate its current products/services, but more importantly, management is also heavily investing for the future. Garrett has a pipeline that has a great deal of promise, of course, in my opinion. For example, the company already has market-leading products for hybrids/electric cars, and it is laying the ground work for connected and autonomous vehicles.I believe that connected and autonomous vehicles are the future for the automobile industry, so it is encouraging that Garrett is fully engaged and already collaborating with its customers in this space. In my opinion, technology changes for autos is both Garrett's biggest market opportunity and risk factor.Please refer to Garrett Motion's Form 10 (linked above) for the risk factors that management identified. In my mind, the biggest risk factor is related to how technology will impact the industry that the company operates in. If Garrett falls behind or fails to meet its customers future needs - it is obviously highly dependent on the OEMs in the automobile industry (accounted for 88% of total revenue for fiscal 2017) - the stock will face a tremendous amount of downward pressure.To this point, while the connected vehicle and autonomous cars are growth areas, a slight wrong turn (i.e., management not properly positioning the company in the ever-changing landscape) could be disastrous for Garrett's long-term business prospects.Lastly, management being able to deleverage the company will be important over the next few years. Investors should closely monitor management's ability to achieve their long-term financial goals.Garrett Motion (and the other spinoff) is not the reason to own Honeywell, but it sure does help the bull case for the stock. Based on Honeywell's recent track record, management knows what they are doing when it comes to spinning off non-core businesses/assets - AdvanSix (NYSE:ASIX) was spun out in late 2016, and the stock is already up over 100%.Additionally, it is important to note that Honeywell's management team views Garrett as a viable (and valuable) standalone entity, but they simply determined that a more-focused and streamlined Honeywell was the best route to take. The auto industry may have already peaked for this business cycle, but it appears that Garrett is properly positioned for the future.As a Honeywell shareholder, I plan to stay the course with both my HON shares and the soon-to-be distributed GTX shares. How about you?Lastly, I plan to do a deeper dive into Garrett Motion once it becomes a standalone public company (especially from a valuation standpoint), so stay tuned.Author's Note: All images were obtained from the Garrett Investor Conference (linked above), unless otherwise stated.Disclaimer: This article is not a recommendation to buy or sell any stock mentioned.

4206792,24361,2018-09-17T19:11:05-04:00,"Honeywell has provided more details on the spinoffs of Garrett and Resideo.Honeywell's late-cycle business continue to perform well, supporting a modest boost to management's earnings forecast.The Street has definitely caught on to the Honeywell story, mopping up the undervaluation I saw earlier this year.","There's an ongoing tug of war in the industrial sector between analysts and investors who believe the end is nigh and that the cycle is going to start showing real signs of slowing next year, and the people who actually run those companies who believe business conditions remain strong. While many short-cycle industrials have picked up a little momentum lately, longer-cycle Honeywell (HON) has remained a strong performer throughout, with the shares arguably replacing 3M (MMM) as the must-own in the space.In relatively short order, Honeywell will become a smaller, more profitable, and faster growing company as it completes the spinoffs of Garrett Motion (GTX) and Resideo Technologies. Spinning these two businesses should, in turn, lead to higher multiples for Honeywell as it will improve the company's margins, returns, and growth prospects. As all of that is going on, Honeywell continues to enjoy healthy demand across many of its businesses, with certain categories (aerospace, UOP, and automation in particular) looking like they have more to give. I've been a steady fan of Honeywell for a while, but given where the shares now sit in terms of valuation, I can't be quite as enthusiastic as before.There weren't many surprises in the Form 10 that Honeywell filed in relation to the spinoff of Garrett Motion, Honeywell's turbocharger business, and the company intends to complete the transaction on October 1st of this year. Honeywell shareholders will get 1 share of Garrett for every 10 shares of Honeywell, and Honeywell will receive a $1.6 billion dividend from the company before the spin is completed. Garrett will also be responsible for indemnifying Honeywell for ongoing asbestos liability payments tied to the Bendix business; Garrett will be on the hook for 90% of Honeywell's liability payments (net of insurance and other recoveries) for 30 years, with a $175 million annual cap on payments.With a little over $3 billion in 2017 revenue, Honeywell/Garrett and BorgWarner (BWA) are neck-and-neck in the passenger vehicle turbocharger market (a $12 billion industry), with Garrett enjoying strong positions across all vehicle types, engine types, and geographies. Importantly, Garrett has been a net share gainer in recent years, with a 45% win-rate over the last three years running above its market share. The business is also solidly profitable, with an EBITDA margin of close to 20% (above BorgWarner's mid-teens margin).Garrett is targeting mid-single-digit revenue growth through 2022, but there's a key ""but"" here - not only does Garrett generate more than half of its sales in Europe (not so surprising, as turbo penetration there is much higher), but close to half of its sales are in light vehicle diesel - a market category that has been eroding quickly since the Volkswagen (OTCPK:VWAGY) emissions scandal.While I believe there is at least a decade of opportunities for BorgWarner and Garrett to gain share in gasoline-powered vehicles (where turbocharging allows OEMs to use smaller, more efficient engines) and in gasoline-electric hybrids, I do believe the ""what happens in an EV world?"" concerns that have dogged suppliers like BorgWarner and Allison (ALSN) could hit Garrett as well. Garrett does have e-compressor and e-turbo products and technology (""e-boosting""), as well as connected car and hydrogen fuel cell technologies, I do expect the company's vulnerability to EV switchover to be a frequent bearish talking point.Honeywell has also filed its Form 10 for the Resideo spinoff, the company's home environmental controls and security products and distribution operations. Like Garrett, Resideo will pay a dividend to Honeywell ($1.2 billion) and largely indemnify Honeywell for asbestos liabilities (for 25 years, up to $140 million a year).This is a less exciting business, and I can appreciate why Honeywell is more eager to spin this one off. Organic growth has been fairly low, around 3% the last couple of years, and low double-digit EBITDA margins (on an adjusted basis) are not all that exciting. A little more than half of this business will be in security, and the company will likely try to complete this spinoff around the end of the fourth quarter.Along the way, Honeywell upgraded its guidance for the year by $0.05, with management citing strength in longer-cycle businesses. That certainly fits the general theme in place today that longer-cycle businesses like Honeywell, Emerson (EMR), Eaton (ETN), and Ingersoll-Rand (IR) are more appealing stocks than the likes of 3M or Illinois Tool Works (ITW).Process automation continues to benefit from improving conditions in energy (oil/gas) and chemicals, with Emerson recently discussing an expanding funnel of greenfield projects at a sell-side conference. Emerson also talked about expansion upgrades from refineries, and that should be a good forward indicator of improving demand for Honeywell's UOP catalyst business.Honeywell is also in place to benefit from an improving aerospace cycle and ongoing growth in discrete warehouse/logistics automation. On the aerospace side, I believe Honeywell is going to start showing the benefits of a taking a different strategic approach to the sector vis a vis peers/rivals like United Technologies (UTX) and General Electric (GE), and I think the company is also well-placed to benefit from defense and business jet spending (though I'm less bullish on bizjets). With automation, Honeywell has already established itself as a significant player in warehouse automation, with Amazon (AMZN) as a significant customer, and I believe this will be a significant area of capex spending for businesses for years to come as they look to wring out further supply chain savings.I do believe that spinning off Garrett and Resideo will lead to higher multiples for Honeywell, but Honeywell isn't going to recapture the lost revenue, EBITDA, and free cash flow overnight. I do believe post-spin, Honeywell will generate better than 4% revenue growth and enhanced high single-digit FCF growth, but I think the share price already reflects this. Likewise, the forward EV/EBITDA ratio doesn't suggest meaningful undervaluation.I continue to like Honeywell as a business, but I can't make the same argument that it's undervalued anymore. Rich valuation doesn't mean it can't go higher, though, and Honeywell offers an attractive mix of above-average revenue growth, improving margins, deployable capital, and leverage to strong late-cycle markets. I wouldn't be in any hurry to sell, and I'd consider trading opportunities if the shares were to stumble, but it looks like the market has largely caught up to the quality of this story."
4198889,99196,2018-08-14T08:59:29-04:00,"The spinoff of the Homes and Global Distribution and Transportation ""Turbocharger"" divisions is expected to be completed this year.
        The valuation is looking attractive with the remaining business segments providing operational focus on Honeywell's core competencies.
        The stock is undervalued by ~10% and the shares are a good dividend income play.","Note to readersI am going to preface my article by indicating my financial model and analysis is analyzing Honeywell with the spun off divisions of Homes and Global Distribution and Transportation Turbocharger divisions included. Honeywell (NYSE: HON) is a diversified industrial conglomerate undergoing a divestiture/spinoff of their Homes and Global Distribution and Transportation Turbocharger divisions to focus their core operations on the segments of Aerospace, Home and Building Technologies, Performance Materials and Technologies and Safety and Productivity Solutions. The company is focusing their core operations on faster growing and better margin business segments, while unlocking shareholder value through the divestiture of the Turbo and Home businesses.The stock looks interesting at these price levels because the valuation is attractive (19 times current year EPS estimates) and the dividend yield of 1.92% is sufficient enough to merit collecting income while the company repurchases shares and increases shareholders overall claim to retained earnings. The company is growing the top line in the low single digits ~ 3% and they have a healthy balance sheet. The balance sheet is strong and not highly levered with a LT Debt to Equity ratio of 0.72. The company has a reasonable debt load with only $12.7 billion in long term liabilities outstanding and remarkably low debt service costs. The AA credit rating is a testament to Honeywell's credit worthiness and likely will remain stable for the foreseeable future. With the announced spin off of Homes and Global Distribution (named Resideo) and Transportation Turbocharger divisions (named Garret), Honeywell may utilize debt financing to make acquisitions and replace the revenue losses from the spin off. Operating margins will likely improve as the company will retain the higher margin business segments in the Aerospace, Home and Building Technologies, Performance Materials and Technologies and Safety and Productivity Solutions. The company's return on equity has averaged around 25% for the past 3 years (excluding 2017 charges for Trump Tax Act) and the bottom line is benefiting from the lower tax rates passed under the Tax Act. The lower effective tax rate of 22% is a net gain of 3 - 4% based on the historical effective tax rates. The new effective rate should create about $300 ~ $400 in tax savings and additional net income for 2018. Honeywell is the top positioned industrial conglomerate and I estimate they will continue growing their top line at annualized rate of ~3.5% because rising US GDP estimates and continued strength in aerospace/defense segments. At the end of Q2, overall sales increased 5.07% quarter over quarter to $10.91 billion. Performance materials and technologies sales increased the most out of all divisions rising 6.47% qoq, followed by home and building at 4.64% and aerospace at 2.04%.The company is focusing their core operations on faster growing segments in aerospace and higher margin businesses. Aerospace sales account for 36% of total revenues as of the end of 2017. This segment is picking up and Honeywell has over ~$17 billion in backlog both in the defense and commercial sectors.Honeywell derives their revenues from both the commercial and traditional defense spectrum. Honeywell's Aerospace segment participates in the Defense and Commercial aircraft segments by selling directly to OEM's, while also providing service and repairs. The trends in both industries are positive and Honeywell is well positioned to capture growth prospects in both. The defense sector is ramping and the largest contractors Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) and Northrop Grumman (NYSE: NOC) revenues are rising increasing defense budget. The Trump administration has favored steadily ramping spending on defense and this is a positive. The commercial aircraft market is showing similar strength and sales are increasing as Boeing (NYSE: BA) revenues have risen 6.2% to $42.3 billion yoy (using the first 6 months of sales). At the start of 2017, the company authorized $8 billion dollars of repurchases on top of an already remaining $7.7 billion authorization. They also pay a $0.745 cent quarterly dividend, which equates to a yield around 1.92%. The payout ratio has maintained in the high 30% range and the company should continue raising the dividend as the EPS increases. The company returned over $5 billion dollars to shareholders during 2017 and they are on pace to return $2.2 billion in dividends and somewhere in the range of $3.4 billion for share repurchases for 2018. The strong operating cash flows and business visibility gives shareholders confidence the company will continue returning increasing levels of capital to shareholders. Taking into account the spin off to make Honeywell a more focused company, the peer group is beginning to sway more towards the aerospace and defense field and is justified in receiving a valuation tailored towards that industry. Currently, Aerospace comprises a third of sales and when the spin off is complete aerospace segment sales are estimated to comprise of ~40% total sales. Using a valuation around 21 times 2018 earnings, I derive a fair value of $168 per share. (The uncertainty around the spin-off transaction will cause my estimates to differ materially). My target share price implies a 10.20% discount to fair value. Based on an industrial industry valuation, Honeywell is trading to a historically high price to earnings ratio. However, the spin-offs of Homes and Global Distribution and Transportation segments should help the company unlock shareholder value and more operational focus. Model Assumptions(With old segments included)From 2019 on I forecast free cash flows to grow at a 2.61% annualized rate, while net income grows at 2.73% and EPS at 4.26% driven by share repurchases reducing the outstanding by 1.4% a year.I used a conservative share count reduction assumption, I modeled the company only repurchasing $2 billion of stock annually (which is significantly less than the ~$15 billion authorized). I assumed a 10% annual stock price increase when factoring the average purchase price in my share count reduction. The model calculated a share count reduction of 8 - 12 million shares per year over the next 4 years. Honeywell is making the right moves to focus their business strategy and unlock shareholder value through the spin off of non core business segments. Valuation multiples in the industrial conglomerate space are elevated, but Honeywell is a company to own because of their increasing exposure to Aerospace and their ability to use leverage and acquire companies that can provide synergies to their core business segments. Honeywell is making the right moves to increase shareholder returns and adapt to the shifting business landscape. Disclaimer: Copper Canyon LLC is a Registered Investment Advisor in Orlando, Florida.

4205196,104650,2018-09-11T07:30:00-04:00,We continue our Spin-off September with a look at two pending spin-offs from Honeywell.Garrett Motion has exposure to the highly cyclical automotive industry - is there enough secular support to make it worth your time?Resideo is a consumer-facing smart homes play. Does it get enough of the pie to be worth it?,"by Daniel ShvartsmanSpin-off September continues with a look at an old favorite - Honeywell (HON). The industrial giant is preparing to spin off two different units, a move announced last October that is only coming to fruition in the last four months of this year. Recent history has shown that Honeywell has both managed its own business well and its spin-off approach. Will history repeat in these cases?Investors looking at Honeywell for some sweet returns. (Source)Garrett Motion is one of two Honeywell spin-offs coming to market this year, at least as of the latest filings. Honeywell was also the parent for the AdvanSix (NYSE:ASIX) spin mentioned above. I owned Honeywell shares from 2011-17, only selling because I was liquidating that portfolio, and missed out on AdvanSix because I was overfocused on quality at the time and missed a chance to buy at a low price. And as is the reality with spin-offs, I couldn't quite believe the market would leave such a bargain on the table, leading me to lower my buy range too far.I bring that up to cite Honeywell's experience in spinning off companies, and GTX looks to fit in with the company's approach - spin off businesses that have different business profiles or cyclical exposure than their core businesses. Their core reason from the filing for spinning off GTX is the spinco's exposure to the automotive market, which is on a more up and down cycle than Honeywell's other businesses. Perhaps implicit in this is the sense that the auto cycle is on the downturn, and so we may be at a cyclical top. But Honeywell wouldn't say that themselves.GTX's business focuses on selling turbochargers to cars, primarily in Europe and Asia (52% and 30% of their revenue, respectively, with all sales figures quoted for 2017, according to the filing above). 88% of its sales are directly to original equipment manufacturers, with the rest in the aftermarket. The turbochargers make diesel and gas engine cars more efficient, and the company has also developed technology to boost hybrid cars.From a secular level, the filing quotes IHS as predicting a 6% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for turbochargers through 2022, with penetration increasing to 59%. GTX calls itself a leader in the industry and estimates that its products are in 100 million cars. The company is less exposed to the US (10% of sales) and so less exposed to the vicissitudes of US climate policy. In theory, Europe and Asia are a favorable regulatory climate for improved emissions, the major secular tailwind. If the IHS's CAGR is accurate, that would seem to allow GTX to grow better than the auto industry as a whole.The company had revenue of $3.1B in 2017, which accounts for 25% of estimated market share per IHS's estimates. ""Our top ten customers accounted for approximately 65% of net sales and our largest customer represents approximately 14% of our net sales."" (page 7). The company is going to be headquartered in Switzerland. It is a weak dollar play, as its revenue is much more exposed to foreign currencies than its payment obligations.As is common with the Honeywell spin-offs I've looked at, the company is taking on debt to then send cash back to Honeywell, to the tune of $1.6B. They will have a $500M credit facility that is undrawn as of the spin. They also are on the hook for 90% of asbestos claims that Honeywell has to pay, or up to $175M a year as a maximum. GTX's exposure under this arrangement would have been $175M, $147.6M, and $144M respectively for the past three years, so it is not a theoretical obligation. They have $1.36B on the liabilities side of the balance sheet reserved for this, as payment obligations to Honeywell.The company has a run rate of $300M in net income for 2018 (based on the pro forma numbers for the first half of 2018). Revenue CAGR in 2015-17 was 3%, and the company is up 15% year over year for the first half of 2018. About half of that is driven by foreign currency (see page 77), and volume drives the rest, as the company is taking mild price pressure. Run rate free cash flow is $465M (page F-40).I like the industry leadership and the secular tailwind. I don't like the cyclical exposure to autos or the exposure to currency, and the limited growth in the years leading to the spin concerns me. This seems like a fine business, and worthy of a market multiple, but the asbestos liability is a concern. GTX should be small enough (compared to Honeywell's enterprise value of $116B) to be subject to classic spin-off dynamics, and the disfavor the market has for the auto cycle could offer an opportunity.So conservatively, slapping a 15x multiple on the net income and free cash flow figures after applying 15% haircut on the numbers for some one-time things like currency, I get enterprise values of $3.8B and $6B, respectively, and a market cap of $2.4-$4.6B.Honeywell announced a 1 share for every 10 HON shares spin-off ratio. So we can compute some initial values. Run rate net income is $4.04/share, and run rate free cash flow is $6.27/share. At the proposed values above, that's $32-51/share (keep in mind my proposed value factors in the net debt and is taking lower net income/free cash flow numbers to start out). That's a wide range for fair value, but I hope it gives some framework once GTX trading starts.Key questions:I like the clarity in Honeywell's reason for spinning off these units. GTX is exposed to an overly cyclical market. Resideo (RSDO)* consists of two related businesses, one of which is Honeywell's only primarily consumer-facing business, and the other which is Honeywell's only distribution business. So they are odd fits in the portfolio. Of course, Honeywell could probably find a clear rationale to spin off any of their units, and this portfolio review may have been spurred by Dan Loeb of Third Point pushing for the company to spin its aerospace unit off, but at least to this point there is compelling rationale for the move.*I am presuming this will be Resideo's ticker, but they don't mention a specific ticker in the filing.Resideo is Honeywell's home management business. Air conditioning, smart homes, security sensors, that sort of thing. Honeywell provides hardware as far as I can tell, and the filing boasts that the company plays nicely with Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOG), and Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) home systems. I should note, by the way, that Resideo has a deal to continue to use Honeywell's name as a brand on their products.The business is about 50/50 split between distribution of products and the products itself. The distribution business has slim margins - 5.6% vs. 19% for the product segment. The product segment is predominantly an Americas business with 68% of revenue from there. Despite the smart-home talk, the business is still predominantly 'non-connected' or traditional systems with 63% of 2017 revenue in the traditional category, though the filing does throw out some big growth numbers. The focus is on comfort & care (66%) over security and safety (34%) on the product side. On the distribution side, 81% of revenue is from the Americas and 70% of revenue is security related. ADI, the distribution arm, boasts leading market share per HIS.The company claims to have 'recently launched Software as a Service (""SaaS"") subscription services to consumers,' and to 'also provide Platform as a Service (""PaaS"") offerings such as AlarmNet and Total Connect as fee-based services to the professional channel.' They even drop Data as a Service in the filing.There are attractive aspects to the financial profile. It strikes me as less cyclical than GTX, and from 2015 to 2017 ""our capital expenditures averaged 1.3% of our net sales."" (page 14) The company expects to pay a dividend, and produced $238M in trailing twelve month EBITDA on $4.7B in revenue.There is hair on this as well, though. As with GTX, the company is going to have debt put on it so it can send a dividend back Honeywell's way, and will have ~$1.15B in net debt. Also as with GTX, the company is spun with exposure to liabilities, specifically home tort liabilities. Similarly, they will owe 90% of these liabilities up to a max of $140M a year (and they would have paid the max in each of the last three years). It almost seems like this was a big effort for Honeywell to remove these liabilities from its own books. And unlike with GTX, the CEO here is new to the company.Still, the pure business profile of RSDO looks fairly attractive. 9% revenue growth last year is solid, and the secular and cyclical tailwinds from connected homes and the homeownership cycle generally are promising. At 12x EV/EBITDA, we can back into a market cap of $1.7B. And if the stock trades anywhere near there, you again have that disconnect where large-cap holders of Honeywell shares are going to be prone to dump their newest small-cap.I'd like to understand how to adjust for that liability exposure. I'm also curious what the relationship is with the Amazon/Apple/Google/Samsung quartet - do the software providers end up taking more of the surplus value, or can Resideo maintain it?Both GTX and RSDO seem like solid businesses. I'm more intrigued by RSDO all things being equal. But we'll have to see how the market prices these two, as either could open up an ASIX-like opportunity. AdvanSix struck me as a well-run company with slim gross margins that was dependent on commodity pricing, which made it seem like it didn't have much value. As my colleague Mike Taylor pointed out to me, ASIX also had environmental-related liabilities due in the time after its spin-off.The stock dropped as far as 15/share and then doubled within 6-12 months. Which is a classic spin-off sort of move.***Thanks for reading the Idea Guide. This is published exclusively to Seeking Alpha Essential and PRO+ readers.

4199761,65113,2018-08-16T11:27:29-04:00,Honeywell International has shown very impressive free cash flow growth.The company could see upside to $225-230 on a free cash flow basis.I take a bullish view on this stock.,"Investment Thesis: Honeywell International (HON) could see upside to the $225-230 level based on an expected 20% annual growth in free cash flow.Back in my last article on Honeywell International, I expressed the possibility that aerospace tariffs could adversely affect the company’s performance ahead of Q2 earnings. Moreover, I cautioned that the upcoming earnings report would be a significant telling point as to whether this company can continue to grow.However, earnings growth was quite impressive for Q2, up by 18% from Q2 2017 to $2.12 per share (including separation costs).Source: Honeywell Second Quarter 2018 Earnings ReleaseIn particular, Aero sales were particularly impressive, with organic sales up by 8% along with a margin change of 22.6%:Source: Honeywell Second Quarter 2018 Earnings ReleaseWhat has been particularly impressive about this company is the rate of growth in free cash flow. For instance, Honeywell International has seen free cash flow up by 42% since 2Q17, and free cash flow conversion is up from 87% to 108%:Source: Honeywell Second Quarter 2018 Earnings ReleaseAs this company has grown, it may well be the case that free cash flow is becoming a more important metric in determining its overall valuation. Free cash flow growth has been particularly impressive, and Honeywell International is also establishing a strong record of growing dividends, while concurrently paying a higher than average yield in its industry while keeping its payout ratio below 50%:Source: dividend.comPreviously, I calculated a target price of $204 based on a 15% per year earnings growth over a 5-year period. To supplement this analysis, I now choose to run a discounted cash flow model, using free cash flow as the primary metric to determine a target price for this company.I make the following assumptions:Source: Author’s CalculationsAssuming 20% free cash flow growth per year, this would yield a target price of $228, which represents a nearly 48% upside from the current price.This is slightly higher than the estimated target price of $204 assuming 15% earnings growth per year.Over the past 5 years, the average free cash flow growth has been just under 17% per year:Source: ycharts.comIn this regard, given that we have been seeing higher rates of free cash flow conversion, I anticipate that a 20% average growth in free cash flow per share is quite realistic.Aside from historical performance, one important caveat to be aware of is that a significant reason for the increase in free cash flow will have been due to spin-offs of its Homes and Transportation business. Therefore, there is always the possibility that the growth we are seeing in free cash flow is inflated due to these spin-offs.That being said, it is encouraging that Honeywell is choosing to withdraw its focus from lower-performing sectors. For instance, we see that Home and Building Technologies showed a lower rate of organic sales growth than Aerospace and Safety and Productivity Solutions:Source: Honeywell Second Quarter 2018 Earnings ReleaseIn this regard, I would expect that continued growth in Honeywell’s strong performing segments could well lift free cash flow to a growth rate of 20% per year. Moreover, the concern regarding aerospace tariffs appears to be unfounded thus far, and is of more concern to aircraft manufacturers themselves such as Airbus (OTCPK:EADSF) and Boeing (BA).To conclude, I continue to remain optimistic on this stock. From a free cash flow perspective, Honeywell International appears to have more upside than I originally anticipated, and the company looks on track to continue seeing strength from its high-performing business lines.Disclaimer: This article is written on an ""as is"" basis and without warranty.

4189320,24361,2018-07-23T22:18:26-04:00,"Honeywell reported strong 6% organic revenue growth, though with some inconsistencies across the businesses and more than a half-point of segment-level margin improvement.Warehouse automation remains a compelling long-term opportunity, while aerospace, process automation and safety can deliver good shorter-term results.In a pricey sector, Honeywell's reasonable valuation seems like a relative bargain, but sector de-rating is still a risk.","In prior articles on Honeywell (HON), I had written that I expected this company’s attractive business mix and high-quality management to deliver above-peer results in 2018. So far, that prediction is looking relatively safe as Honeywell continues to produce strong overall results. Better still, the company’s leverage to aerospace and safety should continue to generate good short-term results, while businesses like process automation and productivity look to have strong long-term potential.Honeywell has lagged the S&P 500 on a year-to-date and trailing 12-month basis, and I can’t really say that the shares are cheap today. The current industrial cycle may not be as late as previously thought, but industrial sector valuations are still pretty high on a historical basis and I am worried that rotation away from the sector could offset the good results from Honeywell. I’m not urging long-term holders to sell, but the price still isn’t at a price that compels me to buy.Honeywell reported organic revenue growth around 6%, more or less on par with Danaher (DHR) despite a much different set of end-market exposures. Gross margin was flat on a reported basis, but declined about two points on an adjusted basis. Looking at the to-date reports (including Atlas Copco (OTCPK:ATLKY), Danaher, Dover (DOV), and General Electric (GE)) that seems more the norm than not, though material costs do seem to be flattening out. Segment-level profits grew a healthy 12% in the quarter.Honeywell’s largest business, Aerospace, saw 8% growth with Defense & Space growing 14%, Transport growing 7%, and Commercial growing 7%, while Aftermarket was down 4%. There haven’t been enough comparable reports to do much with these numbers, though GE’s aerospace business had a very strong quarter (up 13%). Segment profits rose 12%, with modest 30bp margin improvement.Home and Building was a laggard with 3% organic growth. Home was up 7% on strong residential thermal products (not too surprising given residential construction and HVAC trends), but I was surprised that Building was flat given the ongoing strength in commercial construction (and Honeywell’s fire products business did well). Given these results, I’m curious to see what Emerson (EMR), Johnson Controls (JCI), and Schneider (OTCPK:SBGSY) will report for their quarters. At the segment profit level, Honeywell saw 9% growth, with more than a half point of margin improvement.Safety and Productivity was the standout this quarter, with 11% organic growth driven by 15% growth in Productivity (against 5% growth in Safety). I’d expect a good result from 3M (MMM) in safety, but Intelligrated continues to be a great performer for Honeywell in the Productivity space. Profits jumped 25% on a 150bp improvement in margins, and management recently laid out a credible path for meaningful long-term margin improvement as the Intelligrated business grows.PMT was also a laggard this quarter, with just 3% organic growth. ABB (ABB) reported improving conditions in its process automation business, as did Alfa-Laval (OTCPK:ALFVY), but ABB, Alfa Laval and Honeywell have different mixes and Honeywell’s 5% growth was driven more by short-cycle demand (as opposed to ABB’s recovering late-cycle demand). Based on these trends, I’d expect Emerson to have a fairly solid report in its automation business. Advanced Materials was down 1% despite ongoing uptake of Solstice, while UOP was up 3% on okay catalyst demand. Profits were up 8% on a half-point margin improvement.When I wrote about Honeywell’s first-quarter results, I thought there could be some upside to the full-year numbers. Between the healthy second-quarter results and management’s raised guidance (the top of the prior range is now the bottom of the new range, with a 2.5% improvement at the midpoint), that looks to be the case. While tariffs and trade tensions are a risk factor in the second half, management is already moving to address the threat.I’d also note management’s comments at the late May EPG conference that, in their view, their markets are not at a late-cycle point, but rather still at a healthy mid-cycle level. If that’s the case, it pushes a meaningful valuation threat further down the road. Consumer-facing business like auto are staying pretty healthy, as is non-residential construction, and weaker markets like electronics and semiconductors don’t affect Honeywell all that much.I was also encouraged by what I heard management say at its mid-May analyst day with respect to its SPS segment. The opportunity for Intelligrated in warehouse automation is developing really nicely, and I think this is a major (and still under-appreciated) long-term opportunity for Honeywell – and one where it is already among the leaders. I was also intrigued by the comments on Honeywell’s IoT opportunities – particularly the installed base of 4 billion sensors worldwide. Safety, too, remains a major opportunity for the company, as it has leadership across a range of markets worth about $10 billion and growing at a mid-single-digit rate.On the less positive side, the recently-announced joint venture between Boeing (BA) and Safran (OTCPK:SAFRY) isn’t great news for companies like Honeywell and GE. Boeing (and Airbus (OTCPK:EADSF) (OTCPK:EADSY)) have been moving aggressively to garner a bigger piece of the total long-term pie in aerospace, and this move into avionics and APUs could represent a modest long-term threat to a pretty profitable part of Honeywell’s commercial aerospace business.I was already a little above the Street with my 2018 numbers for Honeywell, and I’m not changing much at this point. At the bottom line, I expect long-term growth here in the 4-7% ranges for revenue and FCF, with the potential for higher margins and ROICs in the coming years. Discounted back, I still think the shares are priced for a high single-digit return on a DCF basis, which is okay but not compelling. On an EV/EBITDA basis, using margins and ROIC/ROA to drive a “fair” multiple, the shares do look slightly undervalued.If I had to buy a multi-industrial today, Honeywell would definitely be high on my short list. I do believe ABB offers a more interesting value/late-cycle mix, but ABB has been a long-term laggard whereas Honeywell is a proven top-tier performer. Obviously I’d like to buy in at a lower price, but today’s valuation is not unreasonable though the entire sector is trading above its long-term valuation averages."
4186003,35111,2018-07-09T03:46:49-04:00,"Large-cap Honeywell and Mid-cap Crane are both diversified industrial conglomerates with aerospace exposure.Honeywell is spinning off businesses and Crane just completed a large acquisition, making each a different company by the end of 2018.Crane offers more favorable potential with anticipated 2-yr average annual total returns of 17.8% vs. 12.4% for Honeywell.","Most everyone knows of Honeywell Int’l (HON) and the legendary blues guitarist Eric Clapton, but fewer know of Crane Company (CR) and the upstart blues guitarist Joe Bonamassa. Honeywell is a behemoth of a conglomerate with a market cap of over $108 billion and a current member of the Fortune 100 (at #73) but got kicked out of the DJIA in 2008. Crane is a midcap conglomerate valued at $4.8 billion and a member of the S&P Midcap 400. Clapton has been strumming his way into the hearts of rockers and blues lovers since 1963 as a founding member of The Yardbirds (along with Jeff Beck and Jimmy Page). After hearing him play, B.B. King invited Bonamassa to tour with his band for 20 shows in 1989 – at the age of 12.Honeywell is a diversified company with four operating segments: Aerospace (2017 revenue $14.7 billion, 36% of total 2017 sales), Home and Building Technologies ($11.0 billion, 27%), Performance Materials and Technologies ($9.1 billion, 22%), Safety and Productivity Solutions ($5.6 billion, 11%). Total 2017 revenue was $40.35 billion.Crane is also quite diversified with four operating segments: The Fluid Handling segment (2017 revenue $1.1 billion, 37% of 2017 sales), Payment & Merchandising Technologies ($775 million, 28%), Aerospace & Electronics segment ($725 million, 25%), Engineered Materials ($290 million, 10%). Total 2017 revenue was $2.88 billion.Both companies will look a bit different at the end of 2018 than they did at the end of 2017. Honeywell will spin out about $7.5 billion in revenues into two new companies from its Home and Global Distributing assets ($4.5 billion in revenue) along with its Transportation business ($3.0 billion). Post spin-off, Homes and Global Distribution will include heating, ventilation and air conditioning controls, coupled with security and fire protection products. Transportation will include turbocharging technologies for automobile, truck, and other vehicle engine markets. One spin-out is expected to be completed by the end of September and the other by the end of December. The exact configuration of the remade balance sheets and legacy liabilities is still being determined and share price split/valuations are currently unknown. On a purely revenue basis, these spin-offs amount to about 21% of Honeywell. Investors should expect the value of HON stock to decline in proportion to the value of each spin-off, as determined by the market at that time. Below is a chart of pre and post spin-off for HON, as offered by Forbes.The following comparison of HON and CR will be based on the current un-split composition of HON. The goal of any spin-off is to create investments that will increase shareholder value over time.Crane is currently digesting a large acquisition in its Payment segment that will be a driver for overall earnings growth of 20+% in 2018, 13% average over the next three years, and supports management’s 10% long-term growth projection. The acquisition will add $500 million in revenue to the segment, increasing this business to the majority at 39% of proforma 2017 revenue. According to a January 2018 presentation, Payment’s adjusted margins have been expanding after bottoming out at 7% in 2009 to 21% in 2017. In 2018, Payment and Fluid Handling combined should comprise 70% of Crane's revenues.Honeywell and Crane experienced anemic revenue expansion in 2017, with performance of less than 2% sales growth over 2016 and created their respective strategies to jump-start their businesses.Honeywell and Crane operate businesses in the aerospace sector, with HON’s exposure being a larger portion of their overall business. As currently configured, Aerospace generated 37% of total 2017 sales and after the separation should equal about 47% of the post spin-off Honeywell. For Crane, Aerospace generated about 25% of 2017 revenue, and is projected to decline to 21% with the 2018 expansion of the Payments operating unit. HON’s list of products used in airplanes is impressive and includes the following product groups, per their website: Air & Thermal Management, Auxiliary Power Units, Cabin Management & Entertainment, Cockpit Systems & Displays, Engines, Lighting, Microelectronics, Navigation & Radios, Recorders & Transmitters, Satellite Communications, Sensors, Terrain & Traffic Awareness, Weather Radar, and Wheels & Braking Systems. Crane’s list of Aerospace product groupings is a bit more modest and includes: Cabin Systems, Fluid Management Solutions, Landing Systems, Microwave Components & Integrated Assemblies, Power Components & Subsystems, and Sensing Components & Systems.According to the CEO of Boeing (BA), the aerospace market is changing, transforming from a high-cycle business of years past to a long-term sustained growth business. As an example, BA has a current order backlog valued $488 billion, or about 4.8 years of business at its current pace of about $100 billion in annual revenues. It seems both HON and CR could be poised to take advantage of this new stability in an important segment of their respective corporations. Even though 2017 was not a year of growth for either of the firm’s aerospace businesses, it seems the path towards better growth may lie ahead.Neither company could be considered as undervalued in a current market where value is difficult to find. Below are current fastgraph.com charts for HON and CR, indicating a current P/E above its “normal” P/E, with CR closer to being fairly priced than HON. Both firms' stock prices are below their 20-yr highs of this past January by 15% for HON and 22% for CR.Also from fastgraph.com are the following charts of Return On Invested Capital, an important long-term fundamental evaluation tool. ROIC should be a preferred metric over Return On Equity as it includes debt financing and equity as components of capital. Management at Honeywell and Crane are very close in their generation of long-term returns for shareholders. It appears CR has an edge in its stability of ROIC, especially during the last recession. Both have substantially outdone the conglomerate industry average TTM ROIC of 8.9%, according to fidelity.com.The Industrial Conglomerates Industry within the Industrials Sector includes diversified industrial companies with business activities in three or more sectors, none of which contributes a majority of revenues. Over the past three years, HON and CR have outperformed both the S&P 500 and the Industrial Conglomerates of the Industrial sector of the S&P 500. Below is a 3-yr price-only performance chart of the Conglomerate Industry (-10.2%), the S&P 500 (+31.3%), CR (34.9%), and HON (+41.5%), from fidelity.com.Compared to the current valuation of Honeywell, Crane looks reasonably priced. On a Price to Book Value basis, CR trades at 3.3x while HON trades at 6.1x. CR currently has a forward P/E ratio of 14, while HON has a forward P/E of 18. In addition, CR has a 2019 PEG Ratio of .97 vs. HON at 1.60. HON has a higher SPGMI 10-yr Quality Ranking at A- vs. B+ for CR and higher credit ratings at A for HON and BBB for CR. Crane is rated Full Speed Ahead with a Guiding Mast Investments rating of 80.0 and a broker consensus timeliness of 1.4. Honeywell is rated Neutral with GMI rating of 67.7 and a broker timeliness of 1.8.Crane offers more favorable potential with anticipated 2-yr average annual total returns of 17.8% vs. 12.4% for Honeywell, based on achieving their respective consensus broker price targets over the next 24 months.Crane management has a long history of generating free cash flow and managing share count – and directly shareholder’s returns. Management’s forecast is for free cash flow in the $250 million range for 2018, and about level since 2016. Since 2008, management has generated over $1.9 billion in free cash flow, and is impressive for a firm with a current market cap of $4.7 billion. 10-yr combined free cash flow for CR amounts to 40% of its current market cap whereas HON’s 10-yr combined free cash flow amounts to 32% of its current market cap. Crane’s shares outstanding have been maintained at 60 million since 2008.Crane management has a clear statement of its business focus. From its website:Overall, I like Crane’s diversified products and customers, including currency-focused technologies, aircraft OEM components, industrial values and pumps, and engineered materials. While investor valuations for the different components of Honeywell will be difficult to ascertain at this time, Crane offers a clearer picture of future growth. Honeywell seems to be more of a “techy” company than Crane and will maintain its larger exposure to the aerospace industry after restructuring. However, with its own aerospace exposure coupled with a newer high-tech Payment segment, it would be a mistake to downplay Crane as an “industrial tech” company. I recently took a starter position in Crane as I am looking for more conservative and diversified capital gains-focused selections.As to Clapton vs. Bonamassa, they both get my “Top 10 Guitarist Ever” vote. It is almost as if I came of age on Clapton and have transitioned into retirement with the prodigious talents of Bonamassa. What better way to end this discussion than with a performance of the classic Texas blues number “Further on up the Road,” with both exchanging guitar solos during Joe Bonamassa’s concert at the Royal Albert Hall in London in 2009. At the end of the LP record version, Bonamassa can be heard saying, “Now, that’s the coolest thing I have ever done” – coming from someone who toured with B.B. King at age 12. Enjoy your listen, and don’t forget the volume.Author’s Note: Please refer to my profile page for the necessary disclosures."
4188038,65113,2018-07-18T11:00:48-04:00,"Honeywell International (HON) has shown significant growth in its aerospace segment.
        However, aerospace tariffs could adversely affect growth going forward.
        The upcoming Q2 earnings report will be a significant telling point as to whether this company can continue to grow.","At the end of May, I expressed the sentiment that I believed Honeywell International’s (NYSE:HON) recent decline to be an overreaction based on valuation concerns, and that I saw upside for the company long-term.Since then, we see that the stock has not really moved since then, instead trading in a largely stationary motion:Source: investing.comThis company is set to report Q2 earnings on July 20. In my last article, I expressed my view that even with concerns over price, Honeywell International is a company that will likely see significant growth over time as a result of strong growth in all segments. In particular, I particularly cited the aerospace market as being a particularly attractive growth area for Honeywell. With this market set to be worth 4.84 Billion USD by 2023, along with China set to become the third-largest business aviation market worldwide, I anticipated that growth in this sector would significantly lift price as a whole going forward.Looking ahead, can we expect escalating US-China trade tensions to have a significant impact on Honeywell’s business? Moreover, does this in part explain the apprehension on the part of investors for getting in on the stock?Let’s analyze specifically how the trade war is affecting the aviation industry. China currently exports $950 million worth of aerospace parts and systems to the United States, whereas the latter country exports $16.3 billion of the same to China. Therefore, in the event of a trade war, American companies clearly have more to lose as far as this industry is concerned.China currently has a 25% tariff in place on imports of civilian aircraft sourced from the United States, with Boeing (NYSE:BA) having taken a significant hit to its China business as a result. As far as aerospace parts and systems go, the U.S. has levied a 25% tariff on a host of aircraft parts earlier this year. Should tariffs from the Chinese side be expanded to include aerospace parts and systems specifically, then I anticipate this would have significant consequences on Honeywell’s aerospace segment.For this reason, I will be watching earnings on July 20 closely to determine whether Honeywell is on target to meet its anticipated growth in demand for its aerospace business, which accounted for over 38% of sales in 1Q 2018. Should earnings lag as a result of tariffs, then it could well be a while before we see this company show significant growth.Over the past five years, Honeywell International has grown earnings by just under 78% - or an average of 15.6% per year.Assuming this rate of earnings growth continues for the next five years, let us see what the eventual target price for this company could be.To do this, I decided to run a dividend discount model with the following assumptions:Source: Author's CalculationsFrom the above, we see that the target price of $204 yields a 38% upside from here, or a 6% annualized rate of return including dividend growth.In this regard, investors should expect a minimum of 15% annualized earnings growth from Honeywell to ensure that price growth remains robust.This is realistic for Honeywell given previous trends in dividend and earnings growth. However, should Chinese tariffs affect Honeywell's aerospace business, then this could affect earnings growth going forward.To conclude, I remain optimistic on Honeywell overall, but the upcoming earnings report will be a good indication as to whether this company is on track to see at least 15% growth in earnings this year. Should the company's earnings come in below expectations, then we could see stagnation in price in the short-term.Disclaimer: This article is written on an ""as is"" basis and without warranty.

For a complete set of the guidelines, please see my article ""The Good Business Portfolio: Update To Guidelines and July 2016 Performance Review"". These guidelines provide me with a balanced portfolio of income, defensive, total return and growing companies that hopefully keeps me ahead of the Dow average.Honeywell International passes 11 of 11 Good Business Portfolio Guidelines, a good score (a good score is 10 or 11). These guidelines are only used to filter companies to be considered in the portfolio. Some of the points brought out by the guidelines are shown below.The Good Business Portfolio Guidelines are just a screen to start with and not absolute rules. When I look at a company, the total return is a key parameter to see if it fits the objective of the Good Business Portfolio. Honeywell International total return is higher compared to the Dow baseline in my 53.0-month test. I chose the 53.0-month test period (starting January 1, 2014, and ending to date) because it includes the great year of 2017 and other years that had fair and bad performance. The good total return of 71.40% makes Honeywell International a good investment for the total return investor that also wants a steady increasing income. HON has a slightly above average dividend yield of 2.0% and has had dividend increases for 9 of the last ten years making HON also a good choice for the steady dividend investor. The Dividend is estimated to be increased in September 2018 to $0.83/Qtr from $0.745/Qtr or an 11% increase.DOW's 53.0 Month total return baseline is 49.53%Click to enlargeFor the last quarter on April 20, 2018, Honeywell International reported earnings that beat expected by $0.04 at $1.95, compared to last year at $1.66. Total revenue was higher at $10.39 Billion more than a year ago by 9.5% year over year and beat expected revenue by $360 Million. This was a great report with bottom line beating expected and the top line is increasing and having a good increase compared with last year. The next earnings report will be out July 2018 and is expected to be $2.00 compared to last year at $1.80, a nice increase.HON summary of 1st earnings is shown in the graphic below.Source: HON earnings call slide presentationHoneywell International is one of the largest providers process control related products in the United States and foreign countries.As per Reuters:Overall Honeywell International is a great business with 10% CAGR projected growth as the worldwide economy grows going forward with the increasing need for process control related products. The good earnings and revenue provide HON the capability to continue its growth as the world economies grow.The Fed has kept interest rates low for some years, and on June 13th, they raised the base rate up 0.25%, which was expected. I believe that they will not raise the rates two more times this year but will go slow at one for the rest of 2018, which should help keep the economy on a growth path. If infrastructure spending can be increased, this will even increase the United States growth going forward with better economics for the consumer. The recent market volatility may slow down the Fed.From April 20, 2018, earnings call Darius Adamczyk (Chief Executive Officer and President) saidThis shows the feelings of top management for the continued growth of the Honeywell International business and shareholder return with an increase in future growth. HON has good constant growth and will continue as the world economy grows.HON 2018 guidance is shown in the graphic below.Source: HON earnings call slide presentationHoneywell International is a good investment choice for the steady dividend investor with its slightly above average dividend yield with nine years of dividend growth and a good choice for the total return investor. Honeywell International will be considered for The Good Business Portfolio whenever cash is available. If you want steady growing dividend income and great total return in the process control industrial business, HON may be the right investment for you.The Good Business Portfolio trims a position when it gets above 8% of the portfolio. The four top companies in The Good Business Portfolio are Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) is 7.5% of the portfolio, Eaton Vance Enhanced Equity Income Fund II (EOS) is 8.5% of the portfolio, Home Depot (HD) is 9.9% of the portfolio and Boeing (NYSE:BA)) is 13.2% of the portfolio, therefore BA, EOS, and Home Depot are now in trim position with JNJ getting close.Boeing is going to be pressed to 14% of the portfolio because of it being cash positive on 787 deferred plane costs at $316 Million in the first quarter of 2017, an increase from the fourth quarter. The second quarter saw deferred costs on the 787 go down $530 Million a big jump from the first quarter. The second quarter of 2017 earnings was fantastic with Boeing beating the estimate by $0.25 at $2.55. The third quarter of 2017 earnings were $2.72 beating the expected by$0.06 with revenue increasing 1.7% year over year another good report. The first quarter earnings for 2018 were unbelievable at $3.64 compared to expected at $2.64. I just can't bring myself to sell any more Boeing.JNJ will be pressed to 9% of the portfolio because it's so defensive in this post-BREXIT world. Earnings in the last quarter beat on the top and bottom line and Mr. Market did not like it. JNJ has increased its dividend to $0.90/Qtr which is 56 years in a row of increases. JNJ is not a trading stock but a hold forever; it is now a strong buy as the healthcare sector remains under pressure.

4182355,92166,2018-06-18T12:53:41-04:00,"Honeywell International is an American multinational industrial conglomerate, with annual revenues exceeding $40 billion.The company is largely mature. The company invests heavily in capex and R&D, however these investments are effectively defensive.It is not a growth company. The company's long-term growth rates are constrained by the company's size.Based on the quality of recent earnings and the fairly high valuation, I believe HON stock will probably continue to underperform the broader market indices over the medium term.HON stock is still yielding dividends of around 2% per year, however, and the company tends to be a safe bet over the long run.","Honeywell International Inc. (HON) is an American multinational industrial conglomerate, which produces various commercial and consumer products, provides a variety of engineering services, and sells aerospace systems. Customers range from private consumers to large commercial enterprises and governments.HON stock has performed well over the past year. As shown in the table below, the stock has performed +11.91% over the past twelve months.However, I believe that HON stock offers limited upside at current prices. Base-case assumptions for growth and margins, which I will visit later on in this article, suggest the company is probably modestly overvalued.Nevertheless, for investors who are not particularly interested in medium-term upside on the equity price, HON stock still offers a 2% dividend yield, with the opportunity for longer-term dividend and share price appreciation (well beyond 12 months).The company's four reportable segments, which are consistent with management's view of the overall business (in terms of Strategic Business Units), include: (1) Aerospace, (2) Home and Building Technologies, (3) Performance Materials and Technologies, and (4) Safety and Productivity Solutions. The table below provides an overview of the company's recent record per each of these segments.Together, these segments produce well over $40 billion in annual revenue. It is difficult to summarize the broad size and diverse, global scope of this company.Nevertheless, the Aerospace segment includes businesses that supply OEMs and other customers, in a variety of end markets, with products, software and services for aircraft and vehicles.The Home and Building Technologies business consists of the provision of products, services and software to conventional homeowners, commercial building owners and occupants. Products and technologies include controls and displays for heating, cooling, indoor air quality, ventilation, humidification, combustion, lighting and home automation (and much more).The Performance Materials and Technologies business develops and manufactures advanced materials, process technologies and automation solutions to enable customers to achieve more efficient production processes for gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, petrochemicals, renewable fuels, and more. They supply into a range of industries, including Oil & Gas, Pulp & Paper, industrial power generation, chemicals, life sciences, and metals and mining industries.Finally, the Safety and Productivity Solutions segment provides products and software to help improve and optimize productivity, workplace safety, and asset performance. Safety products include personal protection equipment and footwear designed for work, play and outdoor activities. They also sell gas detection technology, supply chain and warehouse automation equipment, switches and controls for sensing and productivity solutions, and software-based asset management solutions.All in all, Honeywell is a wide, industrial conglomerate, yet it is also high-tech. In each of the fiscal years ended December of 2015, 2016 and 2017, the company invested 5% of annual sales in R&D. This works out to be about $1.8 to $1.9 billion per year. While 5% of sales is not atypical for an R&D-intensive business, Honeywell's scale obviously gives it an edge in this regard, with its ability to scale research and development too.This edge, in an array of physical manufacturing enterprises, makes Honeywell robust and unlikely to be ""disrupted"" by the latest fad or software startup.Note: The company realigned its business segments in July 2016, separating and forming two new reportable operating segments from the segment previously known as Automation and Control Solutions.The newest segments are Home and Building Technologies and Safety and Productivity Solutions (both described briefly above). To avoid any confusion with earlier quarters in 2015/16, I have used numbers for the full fiscal years available for the segment table below, rather than TTM periods.(Profit is based on segment profit, which is measured as segment income (loss) before taxes excluding general corporate unallocated expense, interest and other financial charges, stock compensation expense, pension and other postretirement income (expense), repositioning and other charges, and other items within Other (income) expense.)The Aerospace segment currently contributes around 36% of total revenues from all segments. TTM sales were $14,779m. As the company's largest segment, it has fallen about -1.8% per annum over the past three years.This segment actually includes a number of different businesses, including Commercial Aviation Original Equipment (which is responsible for most of this segment's falling sales, recently), plus Commercial Aviation Aftermarket (which is growing each year), Defense and Space (which is falling 7% per year), and Transportation Systems (which is growing at 3% per year).Overall, this segment tends to grow, but short-term fluctuations can occur due to inherent cyclicalities in demand in its end markets. The businesses are unlikely to continue shrinking over the long term. Though this large segment represents a fundamentally mature and competitive business, it also has strong margins and a firm grip on its end customers/markets. Over the long haul, this is likely to settle into a inflation-level growth rate.The Home and Building Technologies segment currently contributes around 24% of total revenues from all segments. TTM sales were $9,777m. This segment has grown about 1.0% per annum over the past three years. Meanwhile, revenues rose by 3% over the past twelve months. This appears to be a less cyclical and steadier growth segment for Honeywell. Once again, we can expect long-term, inflation-level growth.Margins in this segment might not be as impressive as in other segments, but they are consistent, and generally improving. The segment has contributed 21.5% of total segment profit from all business segments over the past three years.The Performance Materials and Technologies segment currently contributes around 26% of total revenues from all segments. TTM sales were $10,339m. This segment has fallen about -0.4% per annum over the past three years. Revenues fell by -0.9% over the past twelve months.This segment is less stable than others, and is, like the Aerospace segment, exposed to cyclicalities. For example, one of its sub-segments - UOP (Universal Oil Products) - dropped by -17% in 2016, but rose 12% in 2017, meanwhile another sub-segment -- Advanced Materials -- dropped -5% and -16% in those fiscal years, respectively. The other sub-segment, Process Solutions, grew 49%, and then grew 3%.Still, while the Performance Materials segment happens to be more cyclical and hence volatile, its businesses are nevertheless growing over time. They have also produced a strong consolidated margin of around 20%. If there is a (continued) Oil & Gas sector rebound, this segment ought to continue doing well. The segment currently contributes about 29% of total segment profit from all business segments. Profits are increasing, and the segment's margin is improving.Finally, the Safety and Productivity Solutions segment currently contributes around 14% of total revenues from all segments. TTM sales were $5,639m. As the company's smallest segment, it has grown about 5.9% per annum over the past three years. Revenues rose by 21.9% over the past twelve months.Over the past few years, revenues in this segment have been mostly stable, besides the recent surge. The segment contributes about 10% of total segment profit from all business segments.In light of these numbers, we should take care to note organic growth is steadier (as disclosed in the company's FY 2017 10-K): +2% for Aerospace (2016: -3%); +2% for Home and Building Tech (2016: +5%); +8% for Performance Materials (2016: -3%); and +5% for Safety and Productivity (2016: -7%). Overall organic growth is pretty close to 1-2% at the moment.The main takeaway is that Honeywell is strong, diversified, but not a growth company. The company's investments in R&D, capex and acquisitions - each of which we will mention later on - seem to help mainly to further entrench the company's existing market positions, and to diversify its revenues further.This is not a negative point though, as you can generally rest easy knowing that no matter where we are in the market or business cycle, your dividends are going to be largely protected.On a trailing twelve months (TTM) basis, the company generated $41,434m in revenue, with positive EBIT of $7,088m.As you can see in the table below, revenues have grown at a positive rate over the past five years (1.26% per annum, compounded, as compared to an average growth rate of 1.95%). This growth has been largely stable.The company's sales are both increasing on average and trending upward over time.Gross profits vs. total assets is a useful quality ratio for assessing a business's competitiveness and efficiency. As the table above shows, the gross profit vs. total assets ratio has weakened over time (currently: 21.37%), although this is acceptable considering its increased gross margins and expanding balance sheet.In nominal terms, gross profits have risen over the five-year period (by 3.70% compounded). The company's gross profits have been generally more volatile than its revenues, but in a positive way. Honeywell International's gross margin was 31.43% in the past twelve months, versus an average of 29.90% in the past five years inclusive.EBIT (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes), i.e. Operating Income, was +$7,088m in the past twelve months, which represents an EBIT margin of 17.11%. Honeywell International's EBIT margin has clearly strengthened over time. This more recent margin compares to an average five-year margin of 16.17%. These are some strong margins for a company of Honeywell's size, and considering the markets within which the company operates.The company's net margin tends to be around 10-13%. (The recent fall is mainly due to tax changes, so this is not a cause for concern.)Finally, it is worth considering Honeywell International's sales, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, and operating leverage; the ability of the company to generate operating earnings from sales and gross profits. I have measured this over time, by examining the change in Operating Income/EBIT vs. the change in sales and gross profits individually.(Note: I have “winsorized” the data to calculate the final averages for my three measures of operating leverage, which is to say I have removed any large fluctuations/anomalies.)Operating leverage indicates the susceptibility of earnings to rise/fall in response to changes in sales and gross profits. Honeywell's underlying operating leverage is in the region of 4.83x relative to sales, and 2.05x relative to gross profits.For example, using the ratio above for sales vs. EBIT, if sales fell by 20.72%, Honeywell International's TTM EBIT could be wiped out (to zero). Note, this is only indicative as there are too many variables that could affect results in each period. We can at least look back to 2009, when revenues contracted by 15.5%, Operating Income fell by 30.5% (2x leverage).The company is therefore unlikely to suffer a down-year of 20% or more, even in a recession, since its products and services are not fads or simply “nice-to-haves”. And underlying operating leverage is probably, in reality, more contained at about 2x (in terms of sales growth vs. EBIT growth). Overall, Honeywell again appears to be a very stable dividend stock.Additionally (as the table shows), relative to gross profits, SG&A expenses have been roughly stable too. In fact, over the past five years, the company's gross profits have expanded more than overheads. This has coincided with the stronger EBIT margin.Finally, the table below shows the dividends paid by Honeywell International. The dividend yield is currently 1.94%, based on TTM dividends paid. Given TTM net income of $1,767m, the payout ratio was 123% (as shown in the table below), however over the long run (paying less attention to the recent tax-related fluctuation) it is closer to about 35-40% of net earnings.Dividends have increased over time, and the payout ratio has risen too. Nevertheless, it is still good to see the long-term payout ratio under 50%, which keeps the dividend cover safely above 2.00x. That is, especially in light of steadily growing revenues and underlying earnings.Firstly, Honeywell International's operating cash flows (and free cash flows) are improving.In the most recent TTM period, operating cash flows were $6,162m (vs. net income of $1,767m, or in the prior year: $6.1 billion vs. $4.9 billion). Over the past five years, operating cash flow has (on average) equated to 1.6x net income, though it is closer to 1.1-1.25x in typical years.High quality businesses generate cash flows above net income over the long run; the opposite is the case for businesses with low-quality income. With respect to Honeywell, its earnings appear to be of high quality; dividends are not being paid out of 'paper profits'.In the table below, you can see the long-term relationship between Honeywell International's operating cash flow vs. net income (which includes net income to non-controlling interests) over the long term.It is good to see that the three-year average relationship between the company's operating cash flow and net income is positive ($1.95 of OCF for every dollar of net income).Free cash flow ((NYSE:FCF)) can be simplistically calculated as operating cash flow minus net business capital expenditures. Honeywell International's five-year average FCF is $4,404.2m. Its FCF is generally improving over time.The table above also shows the company's FCF margins, which have improved relative to sales (relative to sales, TTM: 11.85%), and remained fairly stable relative to total assets (TTM: 8.06%). This good, since total assets have expanded over time.Additionally, it is useful to examine a company's cash conversion cycle in helping to assess the quality and sustainability of earnings and cash flow.A final note: While Honeywell International does not seem to be using aggressive accounting techniques, what I would mention is that its recent earnings do seem to be more accruals-based than other industrial companies I have looked at recently.What this means is that the net increase in current assets (net of cash movements), minus the change in current trade liabilities (which excludes changes in short-term debts and taxes), and finally net of depreciation & amortization (a non-cash expense), is overall positive. Basically, this means that, in spite of recent positive net income, certain operating assets have accrued at a faster rate (+10%) relative to net income.This is known as the accruals anomaly, can be quite effective in predicting future under-performance.By examining movements in plant, property and equipment-related assets (PPE), and capital expenditures, we can begin to judge a company's investment discipline.In the table below, you can see the book value of Honeywell's PPE value has generally fallen relative to total assets over the past five years. Relative to tangible assets, which exclude (and therefore help adjust for changes in) intangibles, PPE is also falling. This could suggest under-investment, subject to an additional check.A further check involves comparing PPE vs. receivables and inventories over time (current operating assets, in the table above). Honeywell's PPE appears to be increasing relative to both current operating assets and sales. This would suggest it is investing aggressively, and/or its investments are becoming less efficient.Considering that capex as a percentage of sales is increasing, and R&D investments (as noted before) run at about 5% of sales, I would say that these observations are more indicative of aggressive (or perhaps defensive) investing. I think this helps to illustrate my earlier interpretation that Honeywell invests heavily to defend its positions rather than to achieve above-average top-line growth.For context, the compound top-line sales growth rate for Honeywell's revenues since 2013 (five years) is 1.91%, and since 2015 (three years) is 0.79%.The table below provides an overview of Honeywell International's long-term financial performance.It has experienced a couple of volatile years, but over time it has generally increased, as have its returns vs. equity (ignoring the recent, adverse net income drop due to taxes). Free cash flows have also increased, as has its long-term EBITDA-to-total-assets margin.For good measure, the table below shows Honeywell International's recent performance over the past eight quarters.Using the EV/EBITDA valuation measure, the company's EV/EBITDA ratio, as of Jun 15, 2018, is 14.2x. This would suggest the company either has limited upside, or is likely to grow in value at an above-average rate.Bear in mind, this multiple compares to longer-term averages for HON of closer to 2x. Continued, steady growth in earnings could provide some modest upside on the equity, but my opinion is that one should not buy HON for equity upside. This stock is fundamentally for dividend investors.See the table below for further multiples and value ratios.In light of these multiples, I will offer an indicative valuation based on a simple DCF in the next section.My base assumption for Honeywell International's compound annual growth rate for the next five years is 3.00%, before gradually scaling to a long-term growth rate of 2.00% for steady-state growth (to perpetuity).My second assumption is that the company's EBIT margin gradually moves from its current EBIT margin of 17.11% to 20.00% over the next 10 years. I am also giving the company a base discount rate of 8.00%, and I am using the same rate for the terminal value in year 10.All said, this provides us with an enterprise value of $86,614.54m (an EV/EBITDA multiple of 10.2x, compared to the prevailing 14.2x). After adjusting for cash, debt, outstanding options, etc., we find an equity value of $77,190.58m (or $103.34 per share), which represents -31.21% downside from the current share price.These are basic assumptions that account for the fact that Honeywell's businesses are largely mature, and its EBIT margin is unlikely to expand dramatically, given that it is still in tough markets for which it must invest heavily just to eke out inflation-level organic growth rates.Overall, I think Honeywell is probably (at least modestly) overvalued - based on both a DCF and multiples basis. Do not count on ""beating the market"" with HON stock. But do expect to enjoy the stable dividend income, and the opportunity for modest long-term equity upside."
4164873,24361,2018-04-23T13:03:36-04:00,"Honeywell did a little better than expected on revenue and a little worse on margins.The company's end-market exposure is attractive right now, with good underlying health in aerospace, non-residential construction, automation, oil/gas/refining, and commercial vehicles.Shares aren't cheap enough to be a bargain, but they're at a reasonable valuation for long-term investors.","Having more or less tracked the S&P 500 lower over the past three months, the valuation on Honeywell (HON) is looking a little better these days. Not only did the company's recent investor day give more insight into long-term growth initiatives, particularly those concerning software, but also many of its major end-markets are still in attractive stages of their cycle. I wouldn't say that Honeywell's valuation is at a can't-miss level here (particularly for investors focused on the short term), but it looks pretty good to me on a long-term basis.Honeywell's first quarter wasn't without some flaws, but all told I believe the company is off to a good start for FY 2018. Revenue rose 5% on an organic basis, beating expectations by more than 3%.Aerospace revenue rose 8% organically, with good growth in Defense & Space (up 13%), Commercial OE (up 9%), and Transport (up 7%), offset by weaker growth (up 4%) in the Commercial Aftermarket business - a result that surprised me a little bit given overall strength in air traffic (at least as measured in take-offs and landings). Home and Building Technologies was the growth laggard, up just 2%, with Homes up 6% and Buildings flat. Safety and Productivity was up 6%, with 2% growth in Safety and 8% growth in Productivity. PMT saw 3% growth, with Process Solutions leading with 4% growth, while UOP and Advanced Materials grew 3% and 1%, respectively.Margins were not as strong and offset some of the revenue outperformance. Gross margin was surprisingly soft (down more than two points), and this flowed through the income statement. Operating income fell almost 4% yoy, with more than a two point decline in operating margin. At the segment level, margins were steady in Aero, stronger in both HBT and SPS, and more than two points weaker in PMT due to a mix shift and the timing of catalyst shipments.Not many industrial companies have reported yet, but a few trends seem to be emerging.First, demand in the U.S. is looking surprisingly sluggish, while China is very strong. Honeywell doesn't provide much geographical information, but management did say sales in China were up more than 20%. Stanley Black & Decker (SWK) reported that North American sales growth slowed into the low single-digits, and likewise with Danaher (DHR), while ABB (ABB) also saw relatively lackluster growth in the U.S.As far as end-markets go, non-residential construction seems okay for now, and oil & gas spending is starting to pick up - which ought to bode well for Emerson's (EMR) upcoming report and guidance. Automation is looking healthy, with good numbers from ABB, Schneider (OTCPK:SBGSY), and Honeywell (Honeywell saw 4% growth), although factory/""discrete"" seems stronger than process automation at this point - which should be good for Rockwell (ROK). Aero is looking healthy, with good results from both Honeywell and GE (GE), and auto remains confusing - 3M (MMM) lowered expectations during the quarter (and hasn't yet reported), but Stanley Black & Decker did okay and Honeywell's results were good (helped, though, by commercial vehicle markets). Electronics is likewise looking softer - it's not a big part of Honeywell's business and Danaher's comments about Pall's electronics business seemed okay, but other indications have been less positive.All told, I think Honeywell is in a relatively good position to report good results in 2018. I do worry a little that 2018 may be a little stronger and 2019 and 2020 might be a little weaker, but for now Honeywell's business mix fits this part of the cycle. Aerospace, non-residential construction, commercial vehicles, automation, and oil/gas all seem to be either at good places in their cycles or on the way back up (oil/gas in particular). What's more, Honeywell doesn't have a lot of exposure to potential problem areas like auto capex, electronics, or power generation. Healthcare and life sciences are also looking good, but Honeywell doesn't really operate in these areas and that's not likely to change.Honeywell continues to see good win rates in its aerospace OEM business (75% or higher) and aftermarket business should pick up on continuing growth in air traffic. Honeywell is also going after new business opportunities like drones and is looking to push further into software and ""connected"" offerings in the aerospace space. In the PMT business, Honeywell should continue to pick up business in the refrigerants market, and I would expect UOP to benefit from increasing refinery activity and growing production of wet gas.I don't like to make big changes to my models just because of one quarterly report, but I do wonder if 2018 will set up as stronger on revenue and somewhat weaker on margins. I also would expect the company to try to do something on the M&A front, as management has repeatedly said that it is open for business and would prefer to buy companies instead of shares. I've talked a lot in the past about potential targets, and I wouldn't be surprised if the company looked for more automation/control/software assets, but I wouldn't rule out acquisitions in aerospace or specialty chemicals/catalysts either.I'm still looking for long-term revenue growth in the neighborhood of 4% on an annualized basis and FCF growth around 7%.Honeywell shares are still a little above my preferred buy-in price, but offer a decent long-term annualized estimated return in the high single digits. As a strong industrial conglomerate and one that is making progress on its efforts to pivot toward software, connectivity, and IoT, I believe there are still compelling arguments for holding Honeywell's shares."
4144292,65113,2018-02-07T17:04:42-05:00,Honeywell International has seen performance in the commercial aerospace segment rebound significantly.Dividend and earnings growth remain strong.I continue to take a bullish view on this company.,"Back in my last article on Honeywell International (NYSE:HON) in September of last year, I argued that the stock still had room to run, even at a price of $142.We see that in the past five months the stock appreciated to a high of $165, before falling to a current price of $153.73 as a result of the ongoing market downturn.In this regard, does the pullback represent an opportunity to get in at a more favourable price?First, let’s take a look at this stock in terms of its dividend performance.Currently, the company is paying a yield of 1.96%, which is quite reasonable given that the Industrial Goods average stands at 1.12%, and a payout ratio of 37.5% means that Honeywell is still reinvesting a larger portion of its earnings back into its operations.(Source: Dividend.com)We see that the yield has dropped slightly over the five-year trajectory, from prior highs of 2.25%.For an investor to get into this stock at a yield of 2.25%, Honeywell would need to trade at $132 given the current annualized payout of $2.98. If we were to assume that the company were to increase its dividend by another 12% in the next year (the rate of increase in the dividend at the end of 2017), that would give a payout of $3.34 and a yield of 2.17% at the current price.Therefore, I would still see the current price as a good one to buy Honeywell on the basis of dividend yield.Moreover, on a price-to-free cash flow basis, we see that while this ratio has been rising relative to previous years, that of free cash flow per share has also been rising:On this basis, I would still see the current price as a good entry point, as this company has growth to back up the rising price.In my prior article, I commended Honeywell on its earnings growth of 13-16% year on year, and the fact that the company is widely diversified - even with adverse market landscapes in some industries, others have flourished.Moreover, the Aerospace segment, which represents 36% of the company’s total revenue, saw significant margin expansion in Q4 2017. While the company had seen margins come under pressure with a decline in the commercial segment, this has since rebounded with growth of 3% and 8% in commercial aviation original equipment and the commercial aviation aftermarket respectively, while defense and space and transportation system businesses grew by 4% and 5% respectively.The Aerospace segment itself saw growth of 20.8% in net income in 4Q17 from the same period last year, to a value of $893 million - with net income growing at a faster rate than revenue.Also, it is interesting to compare the performance across both Q2 and Q4 2017:Q2 2017 Segment Results(Source: Q2 2017 Earnings Release)Q4 2017 Segment Results(Source: Q4 2017 Earnings Release)We see that in contrast to the second quarter, growth in sales for all segments was up, whereas it had been down in Q2 for the Aero and PMT segments, while margins are up for three out of four segments.I had been arguing that Honeywell remains a buy even as the price goes higher, and that remains the case today. The rebound in the commercial aviation segment, along with growing margins and dividends, make this stock a great long-term play."
4142825,39011,2018-02-02T19:10:15-05:00,"HON's Q4 was terrific.Sales growth is flying and guidance was strong for 2018.The stock isn't as cheap as it was, but it is definitely still a buy.","Image creditHoneywell (HON) has been and continues to be my favorite industrial stock. The company’s ability to constantly improve not only revenue but margins as well has been a boon to the stock price as you can see below. The story is still intact, and after a strong Q4 report as well as a guidance raise, HON looks like it is still reasonably priced to me, even if it isn’t as cheap as it used to be.The only note I’ll make on the chart is that the 50 DMA is still very much in play here even after the weakness from the report. We’re only a couple of percentage points above the 50 DMA so watch it carefully - if we get a break down and HON trades convincingly below the line, we could see a trend change. But until that happens, the trend is still higher.Honeywell’s Q4 was really quite tremendous and speaks to the terrific position it finds itself in heading into 2018. Organic sales were up 6% in Q4 and another 3% from forex translation meant that total Q4 sales were up a whopping 9%. That’s an enormous amount of sales growth from an industrial with the scope of HON as strength in Aerospace as well as Safety and Productivity Solutions, among others, continues to see revenue move higher and higher. Q4 was an improvement upon full-year 2017 organic sales growth, which came in at a respectable 4%, and I couldn’t be happier with the way Honeywell’s revenue is performing. Q4 was more of the same in terms of what we’ve been seeing for some time now – broad-based growth from most of its segments – and that’s just fine.Apart from revenue growth, Q4 showed us more margin expansion and this is critical because it has been the cornerstone of my bull thesis for a couple of years now. While not every segment saw margin expansion, gains in Aerospace and Safety and Productivity Solutions were enough to offset weakness in other businesses and move total margins higher. HON continues to chug away in terms of productivity and efficiency gains as well as enjoying better pricing power in its stronger segments. The margin expansion case is critical for the bulls and I didn’t see anything in the Q4 report that worries me. Indeed, guidance for 2018 suggests further margin upside is ahead so one needn’t worry.Tax reform will obviously help a bunch in terms of allowing HON to keep more of its earnings, but one thing to watch for 2018 is SG&A costs. HON saw its full-year 2017 SG&A costs rise more quickly than revenue. And with the increased 401k match for its employees that was announced during the report, we could very well see SG&A costs creep higher again in 2018. HON accounted for this in its guidance, but it is something to keep an eye on given that the revenue performance we saw in 2017 may be challenging to repeat.Speaking of guidance, HON reckons it will see 2% to 4% organic growth this year. But keep in mind that the weak dollar is going to be a massive tailwind for HON. We’ve already seen the dollar fall off a cliff this year so barring some unforeseen, sizable rally, HON is well positioned to see a tailwind of low single digits just from forex. Analysts have HON at just 4.3% sales growth this year. But considering its guidance for 2% to 4% organic sales growth and what could be a 2% to 4% tailwind from forex, that seems very low.HON also guided for 9% to 13% earnings growth. But again, it seems analysts aren’t listening and have HON at just 8.6% for this year. Given the fact that productivity and pricing improvements are still very much underway and that segment margin was guided to move up another 30 bps to 60 bps, it makes me think HON is in the position to surprise to the upside yet again this year. It is as though analysts and the market don’t believe HON’s guidance. But the past few years have taught us that if anything, guidance may be too low.When HON spins off its Home and Global Distribution as well as its Transportation Systems businesses, we should get a clearer picture of what the remaining business will look like. Spinoffs are almost always beneficial not only to the legacy company’s shareholders but for the new companies as well, and I trust HON’s management given their stellar recent track record. Given this and the continued strong momentum from the business heading into 2018 and a little push from the greenback, HON still looks like a buy to me.At 20 times earnings, it isn’t as cheap as it was, but it is the best industrial stock in the market in my humble opinion, and the tailwinds for earnings growth still exist. You have organic sales growth, forex tailwinds, a small buyback, margin expansion and tax reform all pushing HON in the right direction - what more could you ask for?"
4164812,24491,2018-04-23T10:30:48-04:00,"Honeywell has catapulted into one of our favorite industrials following General Electric's fall from grace.We're huge fans of Honeywell's aerospace businesses, and while it will be spinning off key assets in coming months, the company's outlook remains as strong as ever.Honeywell's pace of free cash flow generation heading into 2018 is fantastic, and the company's coverage of cash dividends paid with free cash flow is excellent.Our fair value estimate is about in-line with where shares are currently trading, but investors can do a lot worse than Honeywell's stock, in our view.","Image shown: Honeywell's equity price performance since the depths of the Great Recession of last decade.By The Valuentum TeamHoneywell's (HON) shares have a been on an upward trajectory since the Great Recession, not unlike that of many other equities, but definitely unlike that of industrial conglomerate peer General Electric (GE), which continues to recover from a number of missteps. Not only has the cyclical economic recovery helped Honeywell's fantastic businesses, but its exposure to the aerospace end market has been a nice contributor. The backlogs at Boeing (BA) and Airbus (OTCPK:EADSY) remain full, and we think deliveries may only accelerate into the next decade, benefiting companies across the supply chain. Organic aerospace sales were up 8% at Honeywell, for example, during the first quarter of 2018 and were the star of the show, in our view.We're generally cautious on companies making big moves with respect to their underlying businesses, and Honeywell is no exception. The company expects to spin off its Homes business ($4.5 billion in sales during 2017) as well as its Transportation Systems business ($3.1 billion in sales during 2017), which could make comparisons a bit more difficult as it relates to evaluating all-in performance at the industrial giant. Though we haven't been as excited about these business lines as we are about its aerospace exposure, during the first quarter of 2018, top-line performance at these two divisions wasn't too shabby at 6% and 7% organic growth, respectively. Honeywell is spinning off some solid and growing business lines, so investors should be aware of that.There's been quite a bit of talk about a trade war between US and China, but we think those concerns are overblown. In some ways, we think President Donald Trump's tough negotiating style may open the door to better deals for the US, and we don't think Honeywell will be on the losing side of things. Though the recent implementation of tariffs on steel and aluminum may impact Honeywell's profitability on the margin, the company has so many things going for it - from operating leverage to ongoing productivity enhancements - that we don't think its long-term guidance for continued margin expansion will be challenged, at least not anytime soon. In any case, Honeywell investors have a lot to consider.Image Source: Honeywell 1Q 2018 Presentation, page 3• Honeywell is a conglomerate operating in the following areas at the moment: aerospace, automation and controls solutions, performance materials and technologies, and transportation systems. Its aerospace products are used on virtually every aircraft, and its warehouse automation business is gaining steam. The company was founded in 1920 and is based in New Jersey.• Honeywell pays a strong and competitive dividend, with a yield that makes its Dividend Cushion ratio a tough one to pass up. Management continues to target high ROI capital spending as it pursues key process initiatives and productivity improvements, a healthy combination for ongoing segment margin expansion. We're huge fans of its commercial original equipment and aftermarket business in light of the massive backlogs at the airframe makers, and there's not much that looks poised to derail Honeywell's dividend strength, at least in the near term. The executive team's 'growth through acquisitions' has served the company well during this economic cycle, and it plans to grow the dividend at a rate above that of earnings per share.• For an industrial giant, Honeywell generates nice margins. The company's 'Performance Materials and Technology' segment boasts its highest segment profit margins in the low- to mid-20% range, followed by its 'Aerospace' segment in the low 20% range. Firm-wide, segment margins advanced during the first quarter of 2018, to 19.2%, up 40 basis points from the prior-year period.Image Source: Honeywell 1Q 2018 Presentation, page 10• Honeywell recently raised its 2018 guidance. Sales are expected to advance to a range of $41.8-$42.5 billion on 3%-5% organic growth (was 2%-4%), while segment margin expansion of 30-60 basis points is expected to help drive EPS to a range of $7.85- $8.05 (was $7.55-$7.80). Free cash flow is expected to leap at a 20%+ rate from 2017 levels to $5.3-$5.9 billion (was $5.2-$5.9 billion).• Honeywell announced plans to spin off its Homes and ADI Global Distribution business ($4.5 billion annual revenue during 2017) and Transportation Systems business ($3.1 billion revenue during 2017) into two independent, publicly-traded companies by end of 2018. Honeywell will then be focused on six key end markets. Though we don't like its Homes business and Transportation Systems business as much as we like its aerospace business, for example, these two divisions aren't weak by any stretch of the imagination.• The first thing that comes to mind with respect to Honeywell's dividend resiliency is the threat that comes with serving cyclical end markets. Though the company is well diversified across the industrial economy and commercial aerospace may be in a prolonged upswing, a downturn is inevitable (even if it may be 5-10 years away or longer). Most of Honeywell's businesses look to perform well in 2018, though UOP may face pressure as a result of challenges in the energy markets. Foreign exchange headwinds may slow the pace of revenue expansion, but free cash flow generation remains robust. Honeywell has made three rather large acquisitions recently (Elster, Sigma Aldrich, and Satcom1), but the dividend remains a priority in management's aggressive capital deployment strategy.Image Source: BAML Global Industrials Conference, March 2018It's hard not to like Honeywell's long-term financial targets, which include 3%- 5% annual organic sales growth, 30-50 basis points of margin expansion per year, EPS growth greater than peers, a cash conversion rate greater than 100%, and the maintenance of investment grade credit ratings.We tend to be conservative when it comes to companies shifting their business lines around through spinoffs, but Honeywell is about as tried-and-true as it gets. With a strong and burgeoning aerospace backdrop offering substantial support to ongoing earnings and dividend expansion, Honeywell looks set to deliver in 2018 and beyond, and tax reform may only increase the company's resiliency. Certainly, cyclical end markets and a net debt position could come back to pressure Honeywell at times, but we don't think the company will make the same missteps that have haunted General Electric.Image Source: ValuentumHoneywell's free cash flow generation of $4.9 billion and $4.4 billion during fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, respectively, and the expected surge to the range of $5.2-$5.9 billion in fiscal 2018 relative to an annual cash dividends paid run-rate is of ~$2.1-$2.2 billion is highly encouraging. Management is targeting dividend growth in-line with earnings growth, and with shares yielding north of 2%, dividend growth investors can do a lot worse.

4157914,44781,2018-03-20T19:11:20-04:00,"I've wanted to increase my Honeywell exposure for some time now.However, HON has traded with a premium ever since the ""Trump trade"" began.Instead of waiting for weakness, I trimmed an overweight (and also expensive) Starbucks position to raise money for a Honeywell purchase.","There are certain companies that inspire a sense of regret every time I see them in my portfolio. That regret isn’t because of losses or relative underperformance; I have a few of those as well, but I can live with that reality (no one gets them all right). No, the biggest sense of regret that I feel when looking over my portfolio is that I don’t own more of certain companies. I understand how wonderful they are and I wish I had bought more when I did. One ticker symbol that always stands out to me in this regard when I’m looking over my holdings is HON. I bought a starter position in Honeywell (HON) October of 2016 at $106.52 and ever since, I’ve been wishing I owned more.As you can see on the chart below, my fundamental analysis proved correct. I was lucky enough to target the bottom to the very day; ever since my purchases HON has been on a fairly consistent ascent.What’s more, it’s not just about price action. The market overreacted to a guidance miss in October of 2016 which pushed the stock down below it’s long-term average P/E ratio of 17.4x. As you can see on this long-term F.A.S.T. Graph below, HON hasn’t touched this valuation since then, having spent the last 6 months or so trading above 20x earnings. (Even using tax reform fueled forward estimates, HON currently trades for ~18.75x earnings which is still well above the long-term historical average.)Source: F.A.S.T. GraphBuying opportunities for wonderful companies are fairly rare. When I build individual positions, I usually do so slowly, spreading my risk out along the time horizon. Most of my purchases are into weakness. I prefer to buy things when I think they’re cheap. My first purchase is typically a 1/3 position and then I like to average in with 1/3 or 1/4 weighted purchases in negative 10% increments as I fill out the position. The only bad part of this process is, more often that not, my first purchase is so conservative that the stock doesn’t often continue to fall 10-20%, meaning that I have a lot of underweight positions in my portfolio.Don’t get me wrong, I realize that having underweight positions because I timed bottoms fairly well isn’t a terrible problem to have. Underweight positions typically mean I’m sitting on unrealized gains and at the end of the day. That’s the goal, isn’t it?In my opinion, there is nothing better than averaging down into a high quality dividend growth name. As I lower my cost basis I’m increasing my yield on cost. I know many traders and momentum investors will say that averaging down is a terrible idea in the markets, but I’ve made a lot of money doing so with a long-term mindset, understanding that I’ll happily collect reliable (and growing) dividends while I wait for a turnaround in the share price.Speaking of high quality dividend growth, let’s get back to Honeywell. This company is one of my favorite dividend growers in today’s market. HON’s yield isn’t very high, hovering right around 2%; however, the company’s $2.98 annual dividend represents a very conservative 37.3% forward payout ratio based upon the current analyst expectation for 2018 EPS of $7.98.I’m not interested investing in HON for the income that I receive in the present, but instead, the income that I expect to to receive in the future. Honeywell’s annual dividend increase streak is only 7 years, but the company’s 19-year dividend CAGR is 8.3%. Making matters even better, HON has rewarded investors with double digit annual dividend increases every year since 2011. Analysts expect HON to earn about $8.00/share in 2018, meaning that the company’s forward looking payout ratio is ~37.5%. Since the great recession, HON has been in the habit of posting solid annual EPS growth (anywhere from 5% to 26%). This strong bottom line growth is what makes double digit dividend growth sustainable over the long-term and I don’t expect either of these trends (dividend growth & EPS growth) to end anytime soon.When targeting dividend growth companies, I’m typically looking for a Chowder Number (current dividend yield + 5-year dividend growth rate). HON achieves this feat, and then some, making it a great income oriented idea, in my opinion. However, when looking to buy equity I’m not just interested in yield and dividend growth, but also the value of the shares that I’m buying. I know that certain DGI investors don’t pay a whole lot of attention to the price that they pay for their high quality income producing assets, but I don’t fall into that school of thought. Reliable income is good, but reliable income generating vehicles purchased at an attractive price with a wide margin of safety will result in both reliable income and strong capital gains, which is great!Using that 2018 analyst EPS estimate of $7.98, we see that HON is currently trading for ~19x on a forward looking basis. This is well above the company’s long-term “normal” P/E ratio of 17.4% shown on the F.A.S.T. Graph above. However, we also see that HON is expected to product strong, high single digit EPS growth over the next couple of years, meaning that a purchase in the $152 range today would represent fair value at the tail end of 2019 as EPS rises to catch up with share price. I think fair value for HON right now is probably somewhere in the $135 area (17x the 2018 EPS estimates). I’d love to pick up some shares in the $120 range (15x $8.00). Typically, I don’t like looking out two years like this, but HON falls right into the sweet spot of tax of the Republican reform, infrastructure plans, and defense spending trifecta. Because of this, I expect to see the stock trading with a premium until the chickens come home to roost with regard to a market wide correction.So, with my premium valuation estimate is play, I was in a bit of a conundrum. Like I said in the opening, I’ve wanted to increase my HON exposure for some time now. In general, my industrial exposure is low. Other than my small position in HON, I have a large, overweight position in Boeing (BA), a full position in Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B), which is primarily a financial stock, but does offer a bit of industrial exposure, and small positions in United Technologies (UTX) and 3M Co. (MMM). To solve this problem, I decided to trim back on another overweight position, Starbucks (SBUX) and use the proceeds to increase my exposure to HON to full levels.From a DGI perspective, I view SBUX and HON in a similar light. Both companies offer investors ~2% yields. Historically, SBUX has provided better dividend growth than HON, though I expect that growth to slow in the near future to levels that are on par with my expectations for HON. In other words, moving forward, I suspect that both companies will provide annual dividend growth in the low double digit range.Source: F.A.S.T. Graphs The major difference was in valuation. Both companies trade with a premium, though SBUX’s is even steeper than HON’s. SBUX is trading for ~24x 2018 EPS expectations while HON is only trading in the 19x range. Both names come with pros and cons. The pros are obvious: both companies are industry leaders, with strong cash flows, even relative to their peers. HON exposes investors to more cyclical forces than SBUX, though SBUX’s growth is slowing and I fear further multiple compression.When it comes to potential negatives for SBUX, I’m also concerned about its reliance on China for growth. The Chinese market is certainly an attractive one, but we’re living in a world where trade wars between the world’s two largest economies are a potential reality and I think this places a shadow over SBUX’s long-term plans. Without strong China growth, I think it’s clear that SBUX is grossly overpriced. (The companies same store sales growth figures have been paltry in the U.S. and this market is so saturated that I don’t think the company can rely on long-term sales growth via further expansion.)With these valuation concerns in mind, I decided that trading out some SBUX for HON made sense. I felt more comfortable trading one expensive stock for another (without damaging my passive income stream) than putting fresh cash to use on HON shares for a premium. While I still believe that SBUX is a wonderful DGI holding, I felt like a vastly overweight position probably didn’t make much sense at these valuations relative to my growth expectations for the company. I’d be happy to go overweight HON at the right price, though I’ll be targeting a price close to $120 when dipping into my cash position.With the swap, SBUX falls from my 4th largest holding to my 7th. SBUX now represents ~2.8% of my portfolio. After the trade, HON jumps into my top 20 position, at #19, with a 1.45% weighting."
4178055,65113,2018-05-30T08:16:33-04:00,"Honeywell International has seen a decline in 2018.However, my opinion is that this is due to fears regarding overvaluation, rather than actual business performance.The company continues to show growth on important metrics and is set for further growth going forward.I take a bullish view on this company.","Back in February, I made the argument that Honeywell International (NYSE:HON) is a buy, and the reversion to the $150 range spells a potential buying opportunity for investors.Fast forward to May, and we see that the stock is still hovering around the $140-150 range. With this in mind, does the stock still have upside from here?When we take a look at Honeywell’s Q1 earnings release, we see that the company has significantly outperformed on important metrics – either exceeding prior guidance estimates or growing significantly above figures achieved for Q1 2017:Source: Honeywell First Quarter 2018 – Earnings ReleaseGiven this, why are we seeing the stock continue to remain low?Since the beginning of the year, a major reason for the sale of this stock has been concerns regarding overvaluation. For instance, back in January it was reported that with a trailing P/E ratio of 23.9x – which is significantly higher than the average of 11.9x – investors could well be selling the stock since Honeywell is relatively more expensive compared to other companies in its industry.Let’s take a look at the forward P/E ratio for Honeywell and its competitors (i.e. the current stock price over the company’s forecasted earnings per share).On this basis, we see that Honeywell is the most expensive stock among its competitors. From this perspective, it is not very surprising that investors have been parting ways with the stock.However, let’s take a look over the past 10 years. We see that of these companies, Honeywell has shown the largest growth in earnings per share on a cumulative basis:From a balance sheet perspective, this company has shown a stable current ratio above 1 over the past ten years, along with a low debt to equity ratio. Therefore, this company appears to be financially stable, with little debt and in a good position to service any liabilities:Holistically, my view is this. Honeywell is one of those stocks where one pays a premium for quality. You may not necessarily find it at a discount like other stocks in the sector, but a strong business model and consistent growth will outperform over the long term.From the latest earnings report, we also see that all segments have grown in terms of sales, and segment margins on the whole have also increased:Source: Honeywell First Quarter 2018 Earnings ReleaseSource: Honeywell First Quarter 2018 Earnings ReleaseFrom the above results, we see that HBT in particular has benefited from backlog conversion for Building Solutions, and within the past year, the company has seen double-digit backlog growth in UOP, Intelligrated, Defense, and Honeywell Building Solutions. Looking forward, I see Honeywell’s targets for Q2 as being quite achievable. For instance, Honeywell’s Homes products can expect to see growth in the United States, as Americans remain optimistic on the housing market – with two-thirds of respondents to a Gallup poll indicating that now marks a good time to buy a house.On the commercial aviation side, Honeywell is expected to benefit from significant growth in this industry. Specifically, the aerospace valves market is estimated to be worth 4.84 Billion USD by 2023. Honeywell has over 50 years in designing engine control valves for the aerospace industry, and thus is in a prime position to capitalise on this growth. In particular, Honeywell is in a good position to capitalise on the growth in the Asian region, with increasing air passenger traffic significantly boosting demand for aerospace valves and actuation solutions as a whole. Granted, this segment may come under short-term pressure as a result of the U.S. Section 301 Proposed Tariffs on Chinese Original Goods which could in turn affect tariffs levied on Honeywell imports into China.With that being said, this would apply to any American company exporting to China, and Honeywell is still in a good position to capitalise on growth. For instance, Honeywell recently enrolled Deer Jet (the largest business aviation provider in Asia Pacific) into its Honeywell Avionics and Mechanical Protection Plans, and existing protection plans are estimated to have saved the company nearly $1 million. With Greater China set to become the third-largest business aviation market worldwide, Honeywell is in a great position to allow companies to save costs by reducing unplanned maintenance. In this regard, I see the company as being in a good place to thrive in China.To conclude, I continue to see upside for this company and see no reason for the recent selloff other than overblown fears regarding overvaluation. Honeywell continues to perform, and I expect that we will see further growth from here. I would take a bullish view on this company even at the current price."

Increased gas consumption and infrastructure investments in high-growth regions such as India and China are likely to drive demand for Elster's gas heating assets.Lack of StabilizationAlthough HON's proactive restructuring initiatives better position the company to outpace its peers, HON has yet to witness stability in many of its major end markets. Changes in U.S. government's aerospace and defense funding could have significant adverse effects on HON's aerospace's defense and space-related revenues. High research and development costs could also decrease margins in the company's high revenue aerospace segment bringing down profitability. In order to stay competitive, HON's escalated research and development costs will result in margin contraction and reduced bottom-line growth.Material Price ConcernsRaw material cost fluctuations could facilitate increased product production costs, particularly in Performance Materials and Technologies (cumene, fluorspar, perchloroethylene, natural gas and ethylene), Transportation Systems (nickel, steel and other metals) and Aerospace (nickel, titanium and other metals) segments. Honeywell is very susceptible to material price inflation, which brings down the company's profitability. HON's product equipment items/raw materials are procured on a single-source basis with various foreign and domestic companies. As a result of this, HON is vulnerable in its supply chain dependency. The existence of so many supply chain components out of the company's direct control makes it difficult to scale production and readjust the delivery of products during times of volatile demand. High material costs/supply chain dependencies could degrade the company's long-term profitability.Foreign Currency VulnerabilitiesGiven HON's strong international presence, the company is often subject to the whims of unfavorable foreign currency price fluctuations which may impede its top-line growth. Global economy slowdowns, particularly after the Brexit referendum or the manufacturing industry as a whole, will adversely affect business and decrease long-term growth potential. Geopolitical deadlock arising from various conflicts and disruptions may further affect international operations in key markets.Although HON does not offer a great value proposition, the company's strong future prospects, adequate financials, and dividend yield make it an attractive investment option. The company's effective management, investment in innovation, and compelling growth potential make it a good industrial conglomerate stock to own. I have high expectations for the company's subsequent quarterly performance and maintain a positive outlook for the stock in 2018.Author's note: Thanks for reading.

4141605,79675,2018-01-31T09:11:13-05:00,Honeywell reported better-than-expected Q4 2017 earnings and management raised the company's full-year 2018 financial guidance.I believe that investors should remain bullish on Honeywell and I will describe 4 reasons I plan to stay long the stock.Honeywell is a long-term buy at today's price.,"Honeywell (HON) is a must own stock in today's environment. The company recently reported better-than-expected Q4 2017 results, and management also raised their fiscal 2018 guidance for this industrial conglomerate. As you can expect, Honeywell's beat and raise was well received by the market.Taking a step back, this company has reported impressive operating results over the last few years, so investors should not be surprised that HON shares have outperformed the broader market by a wide margin over this period of time.HON data by YChartsHON shares were up big in 2017 and the company's stock is trading at a relatively high valuation (more on this below) but, in my opinion, Honeywell's stock will continue to fly higher in 2018 and beyond. On January 26, 2018, Honeywell reported adjusted EPS of $1.85 on revenue of $10.8B, which beat the top- and bottom-line estimates. Not only did the company perform well during the last three months of 2017, but Honeywell was also able to top management's prior year guidance. Other highlights from the Q4 and Full-year 2017 results: I could keep going on with the company's impressive performance over the last year but I will save you some time by simply saying, Honeywell has been firing on all cylinders. In addition, the company's order numbers and growing backlog are two areas that should have shareholders encouraged about what 2018 may bring for Honeywell. It is hard to downplay how strong Honeywell finished 2017 but, more importantly, the company's future looks even brighter. For example, in addition to beating the Q4 2017 estimates, Honeywell's management team also raised their 2018 guidance almost across the board.Largely due to the benefits of the tax reform bill, management now expects for Honeywell to earn somewhere in the range of $7.75-$8.00 per share in 2018 instead of the previous range of $7.55-$7.80. Expectations for higher earnings in 2018 is great but there are 4 other reasons to remain bullish: (1) Market Opportunities - As described in my last article, Honeywell has several significant market opportunities over the next few years but, in my opinion, none are bigger than what the company has in aerospace. Honeywell is projecting for significant aircraft purchases/deliveries through 2027 and a key customer, Boeing (BA) is also forecasting for significant growth in global deliveries over the next few decades. Source: Honeywell's October 2017 Press ReleaseSource: Boeing's Current Market Outlook 2017-2036Honeywell has a significant market opportunity in aerospace but it is important to note that the company also operates in several other industries that have promising prospects. For example, the Safety and Productivity Solutions (""SPS"") division is expected to grow sales by 4%-6% and expand margins by 30-60 bps in 2018. Honeywell is definitely not a one-trick pony so investors should expect big things (i.e., top- and bottom-line growth) from several of the company's operating units in 2018, even if some of the units are not apart of management's long-term plans. (2) Spinoffs - In late 2017, Honeywell announced plans to spinoff the Transportation Systems and Homes And Global Distribution business units into two separately traded companies by the end of 2018, so it should come as no surprise that management took some time during the conference call to discuss how the plan was progressing. As expected, management believes that the plan is on track and the company still anticipates for the transactions to occur by the end of the current year. I previously described the spinoffs as long-term value creators and nothing that I heard/read in the Q4 2017 earnings material changed my mind. (3) Working Capital Management - Honeywell's impressive margins are a direct result of the company's impressive management of its working capital. The current management team has been focused on this area for a while now and they have really produced over the last year. To this point, management stressed the importance of working capital when an analyst asked about how the company would be managing its cash during a period of time when the business will require significant investments: Later in the call Mr. Adamczyk also identified working capital as a top priority for this company: It is fairly obvious how important working capital is to Honeywell and if you want to see a company that has been negatively impacted by not properly managing its working capital management, look no further than General Electric (GE). Let's take a moment to compare Honeywell's Q4 2017 margins to the margins of two direct competitors - General Electric and United Technologies (UTX). Source: Honeywell's Q4 2017 Earnings PresentationSource: GE's Q4 2017 Earnings PresentationSource: UTX's Q4 2017 Earnings PresentationEnough said, right? Honeywell's Q4 2017 margins were significantly higher than both of its peers (and that is putting it lightly) and this has been the case for an extended period of time. This is the reason I described Honeywell as the cream of the crop of the industrial space in ""Honeywell: Margins Are The Real Story Here"". Going forward, I still believe that Honeywell is a margin expansion story in 2018 and beyond. (4) Valuation - Based on trailing earnings and forward estimates, Honeywell is trading at a ""reasonable"" valuation when compared to its peer group. HON PE Ratio (NYSE:TTM) data by YChartsLet's also remember that the broader market is currently trading at a rich valuation. Source: Wall Street Journal In my opinion, Honeywell is (and has been) the best company in the industrial space so investors should not be concerned about the fact that HON shares are trading at a slight premium to the broader market. It also helps that this company has several catalysts in place - e.g., tax reform, potential infrastructure bill, business unit spinoffs - that should propel its stock higher over the next 12-18 months. At the end of the day, I believe that Honeywell's stock is trading at a reasonable valuation with all things are considered. Honeywell's top notch management team has really set this company apart from its peers so any major shake up in the C-suite could have a negative long-term impact on the company (and its stock). I do not anticipate Mr. Adamczyk leaving anytime soon, although I am sure that many other industrial companies would love to have him, but other high-level departures for Honeywell would warrant some attention. Honeywell's stock is trading where it is in large part due to the management team that the company has in place so any significant departure should be viewed as a negative development. Additionally, I mentioned working capital management as a reason to be bullish but, on the flip side, any missteps would likely result in downward pressure for HON shares.If you are long Honeywell, stay long - it is as simple as that. This industrial conglomerate is operating in an improving environment and Mr. Adamczyk has Honeywell firing on all cylinders. Moreover, Honeywell is a best-of-breed industrial conglomerate that should continue to trade at a premium when compared to its peers. The company's Q4 2017 results showed that not only did Honeywell finish 2017 with a bang but also that this conglomerate has a lot of momentum heading into 2018. Honeywell's promising capital return story is another important point to consider, as management expects to return a significant amount of capital to shareholders in 2018 in the form of dividends and buybacks. I believe that Honeywell is as good as it gets in the industrial space, so investors should use any pullbacks as an opportunity to start a long position in this great company.

4139059,39011,2018-01-22T07:58:39-05:00,"HON is due to report earnings later this week.The growth story is still intact but questions remain.And with the valuation stretching even further, it may be time for a consolidation.","Image creditHoneywell (HON) has long been one of my favorite industrial stocks. The company’s insatiable focus on margin expansion has led it on a years-long quest to remove costs from its model and the results – as seen in the chart below – have been pretty spectacular. Honeywell is due to report earnings later this week and going into the report, I’m actually a bit more cautious than I usually am for Honeywell.Honeywell’s first three quarters of this year have been terrific. Even as revenue has grown only very slightly for the year, Honeywell’s focus on costs has lowered its service delivery expenses, improving operating margins from 17.1% in last year’s first three quarters to 17.8% this year. That’s a worthy improvement for any company but in particular, when you consider Honeywell has done it on virtually no revenue growth.That means that basically the entirety of its margin expansion is due to prudent expense management and the beauty of that is that not only does it deliver results today, it means that when revenue growth does occur, operating leverage should come more easily. That will help not only keep margins high but raise them further down the road. This has been the basis of my bull case on Honeywell for years at this point and it just continues to execute.Looking to the fourth quarter, Honeywell is expected to come in at $1.84 on sales growth of better than 7%. That actually implies a bit of margin contraction as the EPS growth figure shows less than 6% growth on higher revenue growth. I’m not reading into that too much because Honeywell’s very strategy dictates that it is constantly investing in new products and services as well as acquisitions large and small, so one quarter of margin deterioration wouldn’t necessarily scare me provided the reason wasn’t operating expenses.By this I mean that if Honeywell misses earnings because of incremental R&D or acquisition integration expenses, for instance, I’m okay because those are things that have finite lives. If, however, Honeywell begins to show that operating expenses have been cut as much as they can, that derails my bull case that is predicated upon higher margins.I’ll be watching closely what each segment does in terms of operating margins and in particular, the Home and Building Technologies group. This is Honeywell’s second largest business but it also has the poorest margins of any in the company. Margin growth has been weak here as well so if Honeywell is to continue to grow its operating margins, it will need to get H&BT on board. If this segment remains stuck in the low-16s in terms of operating margins, Honeywell will have a difficult time maintaining its momentum of margin expansion. Hopefully, Q4 gives us some hope here as the rest of the business is continuing to perform quite well.I mentioned I was cautious in the opening and I am but it isn’t because I think Honeywell’s business is suddenly inferior. For one thing, stocks have been rallying hard of late because of tax reform and while that will certainly help Honeywell, it won’t be as much of a boost as some other companies will experience.Honeywell’s tax rate has been in the low-20s typically so while it may see a small boost to its net income from a lower tax rate, I don’t expect it will be much. The companies that stand to gain the most from reform get all of their income from the US and Honeywell certainly doesn’t fit that bill. It will help, but it won’t be revolutionary by any means.Second, Honeywell is going for 20 times 2018 earnings estimates, which is the highest multiple I can remember since I began covering the stock. The multiple was in the 15 area when I began to like the stock but given the multiple expansion we’ve seen in addition to the fact that margin expansion has slowed, its ability to grow into such a multiple has diminished. Indeed, with 8% to 10% EPS expansion forecast annually for the next few years, Honeywell’s PEG is just over 2.That’s not cheap and while there are more expensive industrial stocks out there with much less compelling stories, it does look like Honeywell’s massive run may be getting to the point where it needs a breather. I’m not saying that the stock is going to crash, I’m just saying that the upside potential looks much lower here than it has in the past.We know Honeywell is going to spin off its Transportation Systems business as well as its Homes and Global Distribution business this year so any guidance on how that will actually look would be helpful. We’re still a few quarters away from it happening so we’ve still got to examine the business the way it looks today, but this will certainly provide the opportunity for investors to pick and choose the remaining conglomerate and/or the two new businesses.Overall, going into Q4 I think we’ll see a nice quarter because Honeywell is a terrific company. I do, however, think the run we’ve seen needs a bit of a breather just because its margin growth rate and the multiple are both moving in the wrong direction. I think if you want to own Honeywell, you don’t need to run out and buy it today; I do think a consolidation of some type is coming and the earnings report may be the catalyst. This is still a terrific company with management in which I have full faith and a bright future ahead; the price you have to pay today for all of that does seem a bit dear."
4141068,24361,2018-01-29T18:39:24-05:00,"Although not all of the company's segments are pulling equally hard on the oars, Honeywell's organic growth looks to be up among the better multi-industrial results right now.Spinning off the turbo and home products and ADI distribution businesses should improve long-term growth prospects, and Honeywell has ample liquidity (and choice) for additional growth-oriented M&A.Honeywell shares aren't cheap, but they look less expensive than many of its peers, and the implied return in the mid-to-high single digits isn't awful.","I don’t exactly think that Honeywell (NYSE:HON) is undervalued right now, but it is probably about as close to undervalued as I’m going to find in the large-cap multi-industrial space, or at least outside those stories that need significant self-improvement. With good growth in safety and productivity, ongoing growth in chemicals, a recovery in process automation, and improving conditions in aerospace, 2018 should be a pretty good year for Honeywell. What’s more, the company’s upcoming spin-offs should improve the overall long-term growth outlook, and Honeywell has more than enough liquidity to make a significant strategic acquisition or two. Like I said, this stock is not cheap, but the implied return is a little more palatable than for many of its peers.With reported revenue growth of 9% and organic revenue growth of 6%, Honeywell had a good top line performance to close out fiscal 2017. Revenue growth ran the gamut, with Home and Building Technologies up just 3%, Aerospace up 5%, Performance Materials up 9%, and Safety and Productivity up 12%. It is still fairly early in the cycle, but I believe 6% organic growth (which was actually a little light of what I expected) will put Honeywell on the right side of average for its peer group this quarter.Margins were more mixed. Gross margin ticked down slightly, as did reported operating margin, but segment margin improved 30bp on double-digit (10%) growth. Here, too, the results were lumpy, with better than 20% growth in both Aerospace and Safety and Productivity and 3% growth in Home/Building and Performance Materials (which was hurt by a mix shift and unplanned outages).Digging a little deeper, Honeywell saw 8% growth in its commercial aerospace aftermarket, continuing a multi-quarter acceleration/ramp in the business. Aerospace original equipment was also up, and that comes ahead of what should be an acceleration in narrowbody jet production later this year.Safety was one of the standouts, and both Honeywell and 3M (NYSE:MMM) showed strong growth here. Between ongoing expansion in construction and recoveries in process industries like oil & gas, chemicals, and metals (as well as general acceleration in the wider manufacturing space), safety is looking like an attractive market for some time to come, and while 3M is a meaningful challenger here, it is also good to remember that the company chose to upgrade its presence in this segment because of the long-term growth opportunities management saw - opportunities that should also benefit Honeywell.I was surprised to see Honeywell’s process automation business log just 3% growth. Not many relevant peers have reported yet, and management didn’t say much about this, but I find it curious next to the improving orders at companies like Emerson (NYSE:EMR) and the generally improving sentiment for automation moving into 2018.Management announced back in October that it would be spinning off its Transportation business (a $3 billion business largely focused on passenger vehicle turbochargers) and its Home products and ADI global distribution businesses (a $4.5 billion business combined). Neither of these moves were all that surprising, and they fit within the vision management has been laying out for the company regarding its growth and market priorities.As Honeywell prepares to jettison two businesses, I also expect that management will be seriously considering additional M&A to augment that progress toward a “software-industrial” company. Although there are some deals in aerospace that would augment and improve Honeywell’s business, I don’t get the sense that it is the major priority. Instead, I could see Honeywell looking at companies like Datalogic (OTC:DAGCY) or Zebra (NASDAQ:ZBRA) to further its efforts in warehousing/logistics automation, or perhaps a company like Hexagon in the industrial software and metrology spaces. Cognex (NASDAQ:CGNX) would also be an interesting possibility, but I’m not sure about the price tag.I believe Honeywell is well-positioned for the next couple of years. Narrowbody jet production should accelerate, and the company has seen good platform win rates (quoted at 75% at the May 2017 Aerospace Investor Day) and posts strong margins within the space.Safety should continue to benefit from improved hiring, and I expect ongoing strength in Productivity, led by Intelligrated (warehouse automation). Given the intense price competition of online players like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), I believe retailers and distributors in a wide range of markets (retail, industrial, etc.) will have to look toward automated solutions as a way of reducing cost and boosting productivity in their logistics and warehouse operations.I also expect ongoing growth from the company’s UOP and advanced material businesses. Although UOP’s core business (technologies and catalysts for refining) isn’t really a natural fit with the rest of Honeywell, it’s a startlingly good business, and likewise with the advanced materials business (which includes fluorine products and specialty fibers). It wouldn’t surprise me if management made a deal or two here (say, for W.R. Grace (NYSE:GRA)), and ultimately spun off the operation.I’m less sure what to think about the process automation business and Honeywell’s migration toward “software-industrial”. Management has already said that it's not going to try what General Electric (NYSE:GE) did with its Predix IoT platform, but there is a wide scope of opportunities for controls and software integration in the automation space over the next three to five years.I don’t believe that my expectations for Honeywell are all that bullish, with long-term revenue growth in the range of 3-4% and FCF margins improving into the mid-teens (supporting a growth rate around 7%). It’s about the same growth I expect from 3M (and a little more than I expect from Illinois Tool Works (NYSE:ITW)), but Honeywell ends up looking a little less expensive on a DCF basis than those two peers. Not cheap, per se, but with an implied total return in that middle ground between “mid” and “high” single digits.If I had to put new money into a space that looks pretty expensive to me, I’d certainly give Honeywell serious consideration on the basis of its relative valuation and the prospects for conservative guidance leading to future beat-and-raise quarters. I also like the fact that the company could still put meaningful sums to work in M&A and acquire additional disruptive technology(ies). Although Honeywell isn’t clearly undervalued to me today, it is at least worth keeping in mind should the markets cool off."
4133396,79675,2017-12-22T01:46:27-05:00,The company's 2018 guidance was well-received by the market.HON is a best-of-breed industrial company that deserves a 'premium' valuation.HON shares are a long-term buy at today's price.,"On December 13, 2017, Honeywell's (HON) management team held an investor meeting where it provided the company's fiscal 2018 guidance to the financial community. The 2018 guidance and management's commentary were well-received by the market. HON shares are up only ~1% since the investor meeting, but shares are outperforming the broader market by a wide margin on a YTD basis.Source: NasdaqThere was a lot to like about Honeywell's 2018 guidance and, in my opinion, the bull case for this industrial conglomerate may be stronger now than it has ever been. Moreover, I believe that Honeywell is as good as it gets in the industrial space, so investors should not be worried about the company's 'premium' valuation.Many people, including myself, were worried when Mr. Darius Adamczyk, CEO, took over for Mr. David Cote in April 2017 but this company has not missed a beat over the last seven-plus months. Mr. Adamczyk has actually done an impressive job winning over the market, as shown by the fact that HON shares are up over 20% since he took over as CEO. More importantly, however, Mr. Adamczyk and team have this company in a great position in a changing industrial environment and it appears that this narrative will likely also play out in 2018.After initially going over the material from the investor meeting, I thought that Honeywell was going to have a lackluster fiscal 2018, but after further review, it appears that management was just trying to tone down expectations. Why do I think this? It's simple. It is hard denying the fact that it appears more likely than not that the U.S. economy, including the industries that Honeywell operates in, will experience growth over the next 4 quarters. Plus, I believe that management was talking out of the other side of its mouth when it stated that several key business units were operating in very favorable environments.For the aerospace division, management only projected for low single digit (1-3%) organic sales growth for 2018. Let's remember that most companies operating in this space are actually calling for significant growth in the years ahead (more on this below). And yes, the tax bill passing (not signed by the President, as of December 21, 2017) will bode well for Honeywell and its business prospects. At the end of the day, I believe that the lackluster 2018 guidance was simply management trying to set the company up for success in the new year. Remember, the market is overly bullish on Honeywell so any type of setback (i.e., analyst estimate miss) will significantly impact sentiment.There was way too much information shared to cover in just one article, so I will spend a few minutes on what I considered the 3 most important points that management made during investor meeting.1) Good - A Strong Finish To 2017The company guided for a strong finish to the current year. For Q4 2017, management expects to report organic sales growth in the high single-digit range and earnings per share to reach ~$1.84 (up from the $1.74 that was reported in Q4 2016).As shown, management also expects to reach the high end of its earnings guidance for full-year 2017, which would translate into ~10% YoY growth for adjusted EPS. Furthermore, Honeywell's improvements in generating cash have not been highlighted enough, as management guided for FCF to be in the range of 5%-7% for full-year 2017. Simply put, this company is projected to cap off a great year with a strong Q4 earnings report.2) Better - A Great Outlook For 2018Next year's guidance is more important than the Q4 2017 results, in my opinion, so it is encouraging that management expects to keep the impressive momentum going through 2018. Management guided for both sales and earnings to grow over the next four quarters, in addition to a nice uptick in margins.These estimates, including the only 2-4% sales growth, are impressive when you consider the backdrop. Fx and restructuring costs are likely to be headwinds over the next 12 months but these factors are not enough to derail the company. In my mind, it is encouraging that management anticipates for the prospects of oil and gas industry to improve in 2018, at least as it relates to the company's operations, because Honeywell's O&G division has been a major drag on the consolidated results. 2018 is shaping up to be a game-changing year for Honeywell. But, it gets better.3) Best - A Promising Capital Return StoryThe most important takeaway from Honeywell's investor meeting, of course, in my opinion, was the capital return numbers that are being thrown around.Honeywell recently announced that its board authorized a new $8B buyback program, which is on top of the already $1.5B that is remaining from a previous program. This is a material buyback announcement because it would allow for the company to repurchase almost 7% of the total shares outstanding. Let's also remember that Honeywell recently increased its dividend by 12% a few months ago.This company's capital return story is not only about buybacks or dividend either, as management expects to also focus on finding strategic acquisitions. Plus, as management described, the tax bill passing will be a positive development for Honeywell's capital deployment plans for 2018.What's not to like about a company that: (1) guided for a strong finish to 2017, (2) expects to report impressive top- and bottom-line growth over the next 12 months, and (3) has a capital return story that has legs? Honeywell has shown over and over again that its bull case is intact and, in my opinion, the company's story actually keeps getting better.To start, getting back to the Aerospace division, I believe that this operating unit will greatly contribute to Honeywell meeting analysts' estimates in 2018. This division has several significant tailwinds that should allow for it to continue the substantial growth that it has reported in the recent past. Honeywell is a key supplier to many players in this industry so it will do well when others are doing well. For example, Boeing (NYSE:BA) (a major customer) is forecasting for significant growth for its business over the next few decades.Source: Boeing's Current Market Outlook 2017-2036In addition to the commercial growth, Honeywell has a defense business that recently reported 7% YoY growth in its backlog. The defense businesses of Honeywell's aerospace portfolio is not the only operations that are performing well, as the company is also building momentum in Commercial Aviation. While Honeywell is projecting for only a “modest pace for near-term orders due to an uncertain economic and political environment along with a very competitive used aircraft market"" for the business jet aviation industry, current forecasts are for 8,300 new business jets worth $249B to be delivered from 2017 to 2027.Source: Honeywell's October 2017 Press ReleaseThe improving prospects in almost all areas of the aerospace segments, including the digital space (i.e., Connected Aircraft), should allow for this operating unit to keep the substantial sales growth going through 2018 and beyond. Moreover, management has implemented several cost-cutting initiatives that are directly contributing to the increasing margin for the aerospace division.Source: Aircraft Supplier Conference, September 2017And it gets better because, in addition to the aerospace division, management has recently pulled two other levers that should create value in 2018. First, Honeywell has made several small tuck-in acquisitions that should add value to the company's business offerings that are already in high demand. The two recent examples are: (1) the 25% stake taken in the Chinese supply chain software company Flux Information Tech, and (2) the acquisition of SCAME Sistemi to bolster its connected building solutions. Both of these acquisitions may not move the needle in 2018, but looking out, these are exactly the type of assets that will bode well for the company's long-term business prospects.Additionally, I believe that the previously announced spin-offs - the Transportation Systems & Homes And Global Distributions units - will likely turn out to be long-term catalysts for HON shares. As described in this article, the restructuring plan will allow management to unlock value, while at the same time streamline operations and focus on the company's core operations (Aerospace, Building Technologies, Performance Material And Technologies, and Safety And Productivity Solutions).The recent investor meeting simply re-affirmed my bullish thesis for this company and it actually caused me to rethink my 12-18 month price target. Lastly, if all of this was not enough, it is important to note that HON shares are also trading at what I consider a reasonable valuation.Honeywell's stock is trading at a reasonable valuation based on forward earnings estimates.HON PE Ratio (Forward) data by YChartsAt 21x forward earnings estimates, HON shares may appear overvalued but I could make the argument that this company has the best prospects out of this peer group. To this point, Honeywell reported above-average sales growth over the last 5 years and the company is projected to significantly grow earnings over the next 5 years.(Source: Data from Finviz; table created by W.G. Investment Research)This is one of the many reasons why Honeywell deserves a 'premium' valuation. Per Yahoo! Finance, Honeywell has a ""Buy"" rating and a price target of $165/share (7% upside from today's price). I, however, believe that Honeywell will not only grow into its current valuation but I anticipate for the company's forward estimates to get ratcheted up over the next two-to-three quarters. As such, I believe that HON shares will be trading north $175 over the next 12-18 months.A global recession is the most significant risk to my investment thesis, at least in the near term. I do not believe that a recession is not likely to happen over the next 12 months, but if one were to materialize, Honeywell's businesses would be negatively impacted in a major way. Furthermore, investor sentiment is extremely bullish for Honeywell at this point in time and it largely revolves around the prospects for the aerospace division, so a slowdown in this industry would likely result in shares selling off.Another risk point relates to the company's restructuring plan because there is no guarantee that the spin-offs will go without a hitch. If the company has cost buildups or issues with the formation of the two separate entities, Honeywell's stock could be under pressure in late 2018/early 2019.My biggest takeaway from Honeywell's Outlook Investor Meeting was that this company appears to be well-positioned for 2018 and beyond. Honeywell is as good as it gets if you are looking to invest in the industrial space. This company is a best-of-breed industrial conglomerate that has promising business prospects, especially if the global economy continues to improve in 2018. Additionally, there are several catalysts - tax reform bill, spin-offs, and potential infrastructure spending bill in 2018 - that are likely to play out over the next 12-18 months, so investors with a time horizon longer than 1 year should view any pullbacks as long-term buying opportunities.Author's Note: Honeywell is a core holding in the R.I.P. portfolio, and I have no plans to reduce my stake in the near future.Full Disclosure: All images were taken from Honeywell's 2018 Outlook Investor Meeting, unless otherwise stated.Disclaimer: This article is not a recommendation to buy or sell any stock mentioned.

4118105,98446,2017-10-30T12:52:59-04:00,"Honeywell's stock has climbed more than 26% this year.Q3 earnings showed that the company had 5% organic growth.The company raised its 2017 sales forecast.The average dividend raise over the past 5 years has been above 12%.With strong dividend and earnings growth, I think Honeywell has more upside potential.","Earnings season is upon us and this gives investors an excellent opportunity to examine the fundamentals of each company. One company that recently reported that I am very interested in owning more of is Honeywell International (HON).Honeywell is composed of four segments. Honeywell's Aerospace division manufactures jet propulsion engines, flight management systems and integrated cockpits. The company's products are found on commercial, space and defense aircraft. Examples of Honeywell's products include those that help airplanes run on time, provide for safer flying and assist with fuel efficiency. Once these systems are installed in aircraft, Honeywell provides after-market services. This means that if something needs to be repaired, Honeywell performs the service for customers, thus giving the company a source of revenue that happens on a regular basis. Morningstar estimates that after-market services are so strong that 2/3 of revenue of Aerospace comes from this type of business.Honeywell's Building Technologies division provide customers with security, fire safety and heating and cooling sensors. Management says that more than 10 million buildings around the world have a smart sensor device from Honeywell. As the company improves upon its technology, Honeywell can pitch current customers on new devices. One example of the company's advanced technology is its Lyric Thermostat. The Lyric Thermostat can use your smartphone location to detect if it should activate the heat or air conditioning. If you're close to home, the system can turn itself on in order to heat or cool your house to your chosen temperature. Wi-Fi thermostats, heaters, fans and humidifiers are some of the other products available to retail consumers.The Safety and Productivity Solutions supplies equipment that allows for automation in businesses and warehouses. As with other divisions, this equipment requires after-market repairs as well as present current customers the opportunity to purchase newer products. One example of products from this division are tracking devices can be used to track the locations of workers in hazardous locations. If something happens to people in these areas, first responders can locate them quickly. Retail products include security cameras, doorbells, safes and water leak detectors.Performance Materials and Technology is made up of three separate divisions that manufacture products that are designed to help industrial facilities operate safely and efficiently. Advanced Materials supplies environmentally friendly refrigerants, plastics and chemicals for a wide variety of products including nylon, pharmaceutical packaging and computer chips. United Oil Product products software services and technologies that are used in refining and gas processing. Honeywell Process Solutions' automation software is used to increase safety as well as allow facilities to operate at their peak level in industries such as refining, mining and pulp and paper manufacturing.Honeywell's stock is having an excellent 2017. Year to date, HON is up 26.18%, while the S&P 500 is up 15.29%. With a gain like this, some investors might be cautious about holding or buying more shares. Let's examine Honeywell's businesses and most recent earnings report.Source: Honeywell's 3rd quarter Earnings ReportNow let's examine the company's most recent earnings report. Honeywell released third quarter earnings on 10/20/2017. Earnings per share were in-line at $1.75, 9% from last year's third quarter reported EPS. If you don't account for tax and divestitures, EPS was up 16% from Q3 2016. HON has only missed EPS estimates once since 2014. Extreme weather was a 2 cent headwind for the company. Revenue for the quarter came in at $10.12 billion, $110 million above estimates. This was up 3.3% from Q3 2016. Sales for the quarter grew 5% organically across the company. This was above the high end of the company's guidance from this past July.Source: Honeywell's 3rd quarter Earnings ReportAerospace accounted for 36% of sales, making the division the company's largest source of revenue. This division saw 4% organic growth during the quarter, with after-market services growing 7%. As I stated earlier, this after-market revenue is from the company having to make updates and repairs to their products. Customers are most likely going to back to the original manufacturer for services. Honeywell knows its own products better than the competition. Management said that part of this organic growth was due to the timing of product shipment to customers.Home and Building Technologies, which made up approximately 28% of sales in the quarter, saw 2% organic growth. Smart sensors were credited with this segment's results. Honeywell's backlog for the division was 20% higher from last year. Management pointed out that Home and Building Products were selected by the Kuala Lumpur airport in Malaysia to update the facility's airfield ground lighting control and monitoring systems. This airport is one of the largest in Asia and is capable of handling 35 million passengers per day and more than a million tons of cargo.Performance Materials and Technologies, 22% of sales, managed to grow its sales 10% organically. The company pointed to the high demand for Solstice as one reason for the growth. Solstice is a Liquid Blowing Agent used to insulate homes. This product is nonflammable and has a low environmental impact. Solstice has lower management costs and is more efficient at insulating walls, so customer's energy costs can be reduced.Safety and Productivity Solutions, 14% of sales, saw a spike in sales of 21% from last year's 3rd quarter. Safety and productivity showed organic sales growth of 3%. Honeywell said there were greater demand for its safety products during the quarter.Honeywell recently announced that the company's will spin off its turbocharger and home heating, ventilation and air conditioning businesses. The company expects this spinoff to be completed by the end of next year.Source: Honeywell's 3rd quarter Earnings ReportFor full year 2017, Honeywell is forecasting 5%-7% sales growth, with 4%-6% of this growth being of the organic variety. Honeywell reaffirmed guidance for the full year EPS of $7.05-$7.10, which would show growth of 9-10% from 2016. If you follow the company, you'll recall that they raised the low end of their guidance by a nickel at the beginning of October. 2017 sales guidance was raised to $40.2 - $40.4 billion. Management said the performance and future sales for Aerospace and Performance Materials and Technologies were a major reason for the increase.Honeywell has only offered investors a dividend raise for the past 6 years. The average raise over the past 5 years is 12.3%. The most recent raise was announced on 9/29/2017 and at 12%, came in close to the 5 year average. As seen in the previous section, Honeywell's free cash flow is expected to be up 5%-7% this year. With a rising free cash flow, the company should be able to continue to raise its dividend into the future.The question of the dividend growth in future years came up during the Q & A session on the conference call. On the call, CEO Darius Adamczyk said Honeywell was committed to raising the dividend faster than their earnings growth through 2018. While Adamczyk said management would discuss the dividend strategy at their Investor Day in February, the CEO did hint that the company's dividend policy in 2019 and beyond would be to grow the dividend at a rate that is ""equal to or greater than earnings"".While the dividend streak isn't the longest, I find the dividend growth to be appealing. Management seems to be committed to growing the dividend. With free cash flow projecting to grow, I feel confident that Honeywell will continue to reward shareholders with dividend growth. Shares currently yield just over 2%. The stock's yield is on the low side, but that is due in part to the gains in the share price.Honeywell as a company is really rolling. Honeywell has raised its EPS and revenue guidance for the full year. If management can deliver on these 2017 EPS figures, then Honeywell is trading at roughly 20.6 PE. That isn't all that expensive for a company that is showing the type of growth that Honeywell is showing. A company that can meet or beat estimates while at the same time raise their own estimates is one whose stock will go up because investors are willing to pay more for the growth. That is why I believe that even after a 26% gain in 2017, Honeywell has a lot more upside potential. And if the company can continue to grow earnings, then the dividend growth should continue to be attractive. That is why I would be more than willing to purchase more of Honeywell at this price. In fact, we purchase a small amount of HON through shareowneronline.com every month.What are your thoughts on Honeywell? Feel free to leave a comment.

4128793,42381,2017-11-30T13:43:27-05:00,"Honeywell has gained 32.37% year to date and was recently heralded as the next multi-industry investment leader. Is it too late to climb on-board this future leader?I explore what analysts are estimating for the next few years as well as how the market is currently pricing the stock.Using several valuation models, I find that Honeywell’s stock price is overvalued and provide my average fair value estimate of $134.57.","With the difficulties faced by General Electric (GE) continuing to garner headlines, Honeywell (HON) quietly continues to move forward. HON recently received additional analyst commentary with a price raise and increased confidence in the company's bull case, even calling the company the next multi-industry investment leader. Investors appear to love the stock as well. HON has now gained 32.37% year to date and does not appear to be slowing down. The question now remains whether investors have driven the company too far or whether there is room to run some more.To answer that question, let's take a look at some of the current valuation metrics and how the company compares to its peers. HON current price to earnings ratio is 23.1. YCharts reports that the 5-year average is 19.1 while Gurufocus.com shows that HON's 10-year median PE ratio is 18.6. The industry median is 23.1x while the market is 21.7x. These indicators suggest that HON is currently overvalued compared to its historical norms, the industry and the market.In one of Chuck Carnevale's articles, he uses the earnings yield to quickly determine the valuation of a stock. The earnings yield is calculated by taking the current earnings divided by the stock's current price. Chuck feels that any value below 6% means that the stock is overvalued. In the case of HON, the TTM EPS is $6.69 and the current price is $152.76. The earnings yield is 4.4% which suggests that HON is overvalued.The infographic below further shows that HON's PEG ratio is 2.8x which is considered poor value based on next year's expected growth and that its price to book ratio which is 5.5x is overvalued based on its assets when compared to the industrial conglomerates industry average and the market. Furthermore, the P/FCF is 24.16 which is nearly 2.5 times what investors typically consider as fair value.Source: SimplyWall.StI have selected GE, Carlisle Companies Inc. (CSL) and 3M (MMM) as HON competition peers. Below is a comparison of some common valuation ratios and where each company compares.Source: Old School Value, SimplyWall.St, table created by the authorThe red cells make it obviously clear that MMM is overvalued compared to all of its peers while GE and CSL are split among the lowest valuations in the group. I would tend to discount GE due to its recent price drop and current struggles. Taking a look at CSL ratios in comparison to HON, they are all lower. In general, HON is in the middle of its group of peers in terms of valuation, not cheap but not expensive compared to the others.At present, there are 18 analysts with buy or outperform ratings, 4 with a hold rating and none with a sell or underperform rating. The current consensus among the 22 analysts is to buy HON and this rating has been in place since at least April 2017.Based on the above findings, HON appears to be overvalued on its own but potentially fair value compared to its peers.The infographic below shows what analysts are predicting as HON's earnings per share over the next few years.Source: SimplyWall.StHON's EPS came in at $6.60 in FY2016. Management originally guided for a FY2017 EPS of $6.85 to $7.10 however the company recently narrowed its EPS to $7.05-$7.10. The company has not issued any statements regarding FY2018 as of yet.Analysts are estimating a FY2017 EPS of $7.09 (range of $7.05 to $7.11), FY2018 EPS of $7.79 (range of $7.70 to $7.90) and FY2019 EPS of $8.45 ($8.20 to $8.65). This represents year over year growth of -7.42%, 9.87%, and 8.47% respectively. HON's future 5-year growth estimate is 9.23% which is about the average that we see for the next few years estimates but it is notably below its past 5-year growth rate of 12.70%. The company's future growth rate is also below the industry's long-term growth rate estimate of 10.90%. This demonstrates that HON is slightly behind in its industry and that its growth is also slowing down in general.If analyst's estimates are accurate, then HON is currently trading at 21.6x FY2017 earnings, 19.6x FY2018 earnings and 18.1x FY2019 earnings. These PE ratios closely follow the 5-year average and 10-year median which may present a tempting entry price based on future earnings. If I use the 5-year PE ratio, based on HON's EPS estimates, the stock would be trading around $135.42 in FY2017, $148.79 in FY2018 and $161.40 in FY2019. This suggests that HON's current stock price could be overvalued by 11.5% if the stock were to be trading around the 5-year PE average.Over the next 12 months, analysts are estimating that HON's median price estimate will be $156.00 which represents 1.7% upside from the current price. The range runs from a low of $135.00 (12% downside) to a high of $170.00 (10.9% upside). This shows that the risk vs. reward is balanced but not advantageous. There is also more downside risk than upside potential at the moment. This kind of situation lends itself to suggesting the HON is overvalued or fairly valued.I used a reverse DCF to determine how much the market expects HON's growth rate to be. With shares trading at $153.02, the market is pricing in earnings to grow at 12.47%. This does not match analyst's estimates, neither the industry estimates. If the company grew its earnings by 12.47%, then HON's FY2017 EPS would be $7.42 which is above management's guidance for this year. This suggests that the market is attempting to price in HON's FY2018 earnings ahead of time and overvaluing the stock based on where it is now.What is my fair value estimate for HON? To answer this question, I calculated the fair value of HON using three models: Discounted Cash Flow, Graham's Formula, and EBIT multiples.The inputs I used for the DCF was a growth rate of 9.23%, a discount rate of 5.56% based on the work of Prof. Damodaren's rates for each industry, a terminal rate of 2% and a starting free cash flow value of $4.4B. This provided a fair value estimate of $122.70.The inputs I used for the Graham's Formula include a growth rate of 9.23%, an EPS estimate of $7.09 and a 20-year AAA corporate bond rate of 3.60%. This provided a fair value estimate of $140.64. Please note that the Graham Formula is not the same as the Graham Number and that the formula has also been modified. The explanations of each can be found here and here respectively.The inputs I used for the EBIT model has a conservative, normal and aggressive case. Based on HON's past 5-year EV/EBIT history, I chose a multiple of 12.62x for the conservative case, 13.93x for the normal case and 17.65x for the aggressive case. Revenue estimates were $40.17B in each case. This resulted in fair value estimates of $106.29, $118.10 and $151.74 respectively.The table below provides a summary and calculations of the estimated fair value of HON.Source: Old School ValueBased on these calculations, the average fair value estimate is $134.57 and the median fair value estimate is $135.42. Based on today's stock price, HON is currently overvalued by 11.40% to 11.50%.Below you will find my risk/reward chart based on the long-term growth rate (9.23%) and the average and median fair value estimates. The red and green lines in the price action chart below represent the trading range of HON based on that growth rate. Obviously, when the stock is near the top line, it is not the time to buy and when it is near the bottom line, it is time to consider buying.Source: Freestockcharts.com (daily view)Source: Freestockcharts.com (weekly view)As you can see in the daily view chart, HON is not in the buy price box. I also found this particular risk/reward chart difficult to draw. I would say that the 9.23% growth rate was fitting the price action just fine until about this year when the stock broke through my line. This is fine and to me merely suggests that the stock is considerably overvalued. However, I find that since 2011, a better fit for the price action appears however the slope suggests a growth rate over 15% which I find overzealous but it would make more sense in terms of where the buy box is placed and how the price would be in the middle of the two lines. Also, there appears to be an ascending slope since 2011 that has provided support with any pullback. It will require a little more time to determine which of these risk/reward lines make sense for the stock.Finally, here is a quick table to show various margins of safety based on the estimated fair value.CONCLUSIONI believe that the overall analysis shows that Honeywell is currently overvalued. With GE's present challenges, HON may see more interest as a portfolio rotation takes place. HON continues to offer double digit dividend growth as well as a growth plan that appears to be well executed. HON is part of my list of supportive stocks for my Accelerating Dividends Portfolio however, I will have to patient in order to purchase HON at a price that will help me have a margin of safety.I hope you enjoyed this article.

4117208,79675,2017-10-27T03:25:29-04:00,"HON shares have outperformed the broader margin by a wide margin over the last year, and investors should expect more of the same in the quarters ahead.
        The company reported impressive Q3 2017 financial results and management guided for a strong finish to the current year.
        HON shares are a long-term buy at today's price, even after the recent run-up.","Honeywell (HON) is a company that has been in the news a lot over the last six plus months, and for good reason. The company has reported impressive quarterly results over the last year and the market recently cheered management's plan to spin off two business units by the end of 2018. As a direct result, HON shares have greatly outperformed the broader market.(Source: Nasdaq)The recent run-up has been nice but, in my opinion, HON shares still have a lot of room to run so I would not let the current price tag keep you from investing in a company that has promising long-term business prospects. It helps that the company's most recent results also supports the long-term bull case for Honeywell. On October 20, 2017, Honeywell reported inline EPS ($1.75) on better-than-expected revenue of $10.1B. For comparison purposes, the company reported EPS of $1.60 on revenues of $9.8B in the same period of the prior year. The YoY earnings growth was impressive, but, more importantly, the company also reported improvements almost across the board. This company is firing on all cylinders and it is important to note that all of its operating segments are currently contributing to the impressive top- and bottom-line growth. However, the company's expanding margins are the real story to be told, of course, in my opinion.There were two segments that expanded their margins by well-over 100bps (three if you exclude M&A), with the company's most valuable segment, i.e. Aerospace, leading the charge with margins up 290 bps when compared to Q3 2016. Mr. Darius Adamczyk, CEO, and team have been laser focused on improving operational performance over the last year and their focus has already yielded strong results.Prior projects to improve margins are coming into play but let's also remember that software is a key driver to expanding margins. This is actually a topic that Mr. Adamczyk covered during the conference call when asked about Honeywell's transition to an industrial software company: In ""Honeywell: Becoming A Software-Industrial Company"", I touched on the benefits of the Sentience platform (i.e. improving the cost structure) but, more importantly, I touted Mr. Adamczyk as the perfect guy for Honeywell in today's environment (the ""software guy""). So far, so good. Management also mentioned that previous divestitures are having a real impact on margins and they fully expect for margins to improve as we head into 2018. This is actually one of the main reasons why I am bullish on the upcoming Transportation Systems and Homes And Global Distribution spinoffs. This management team has a proven track record of being able to squeeze out costs and get rid of businesses that pressure margins, so I anticipate for the 2018 spinoffs to be more of the same. Looking forward, I do not see Honeywell slowing down anytime soon and management is on the page, as the full-year EPS guidance of $7.05-$7.10 (a range that has been raised several times over the last two quarters) was re-affirmed. Management expects for Honeywell to report strong results from top to bottom. As shown, the company is expected to report 2%-3% sales growth while improving EPS by 9%-10%, as share buybacks and cost reductions are going to have material impacts. But again, margins are the real story as we progress through Q4 2017. For full-year 2017, margins are expected to come in at 19%, which is very impressive for an industrial conglomerate. As I previously described, Honeywell's story continues to get better and I do not see anything getting in the way anytime soon. Therefore, investors that have been shying away from HON shares because they are trading close to a 52-week high should consider this, Honeywell is well-positioned for 2018 and beyond. Based on current year estimates, Honeywell is trading at a slight premium compared to its peer group. The company is trading at a slight premium to United Technologies (UTX) and General Electric (GE), a company that is going through some things, so I believe that the premium is more than warranted. Additionally, Honeywell has shown the ability to increase earnings over the past five years so the company will likely outgrow its current valuation in short order.(Source: 2016 10-K)The company's capital return story - increasing dividend and large buyback program - is another reason for shareholders to stay long. There was a lot to like about Honeywell's Q3 2017 results, but, in my opinion, the real story is the company's expanding margins. This company has squeezed out costs and has reported improving margins since Mr. Adamczyk took over for Mr. Cote, so it appears that Honeywell has the right guy leading it. Plus, the beat is expected to go on as management guided for a strong finish to the current year. The long-term bull story is obvious: Honeywell is an industrial conglomerate that has great businesses in industries that have promising long-term prospects. Moreover, Honeywell appears to have the right management in place and its focus on software (i.e. Industrial Internet of Things) is already paying huge dividends. Need more? If so, Honeywell also has a growing dividend (recently increased by 12%) and a board that is committed to buying back shares. Lastly, the upcoming spinoffs have the potential to create a tremendous amount of value. Therefore, investors should treat pullbacks as long-term buying opportunities. Full Disclosure: All images were obtained from Honeywell's Q3 2017 Earnings Presentation, unless otherwise noted.

4129350,101935,2017-12-04T06:49:46-05:00,"Software industrial giant Honeywell International has enjoyed a stellar run in 2017, is firing on all cylinders, and is priced at the high end of the valuation spectrum.Double-digit dividend and earnings growth fueled by a well-diversified portfolio epitomize the investment case.Investors need to decide whether Honeywell's stock has done well or in fact too well. Here is my take on it.","Software industrial company Honeywell International (NYSE:HON) has enjoyed a fabulous run in 2017, climbing from $115 to as high as $156.7, or more than 34%. During that ride, management has significantly upped the lower end of its full-year EPS guidance from $6.85-7.10 to $7.05-7.10.The company now trades at almost 24 times earnings, posted flat revenue for the first two quarters, and recorded a 3.3% Y/Y revenue increase for Q3.Source: Honeywell Investor DayFollowing such a rally, at least at first glance only modest fundamentals, we should explore if Honeywell has done too well already.Throughout fiscal-year 2017, Honeywell's three earnings reports showed the following key developments:Over these three quarters, Honeywell's organic sales growth certainly gained a lot of momentum as it expanded from 2% to 5%. There is also a lot to like about segment margin expansion and double-digit EPS growth rates as well. The latter is also in line with Honeywell's double-digit dividend growth rate, with the most recent September dividend announcement representing a 12% hike.Turning to Honeywell's four business segments of Aerospace, Home & Building Technologies, Safety & Productivity Solutions as well as Performance Materials & Technologies, we'll see that the company is currently firing on all cylinders.Across all segments, Honeywell had compelling highlights. For instance, in Aerospace, key airlines, KLM, Brussels Airlines and Air Serbia, adopted the GoDirect Fuel Efficiency Software while in Home & Building Technologies (HBT), Honeywell secured a contract with Kuala Lumpur International Airport to upgrade lighting control and monitoring system.Honeywell's portfolio has demonstrated exceptional strength, as organic sales growth accelerated throughout the year due to various drivers.Source: Honeywell International - 2017/Q3 Results - Earnings Call SlidesAll segments are performing very well, although given its size, the PMT segment with 10% organic growth and 23.3% segment margin change clearly stands out.With such results, it is no surprise that the earnings call for Q3 has been full of positives as well. Here are my highlights from the call:These are some very strong comments and further highlight how well Honeywell is doing in 2017. The 18% rise in free cash flow currently translates into a cash dividend payout ratio of 48%, down almost 4pp year over year. This is very healthy and comes despite a 12% dividend increase.Honeywell is a real dividend growth machine with no signs of stopping. Over the past five years, the company raised the dividend as follows:HON EPS Basic (TTM) data by YChartsAs such strong double-digit dividend growth is supported by even stronger earnings growth, Honeywell's payout ratio (as mentioned above) has remained stable and even slightly decreased currently. Thus, the key question is whether Honeywell can continue that momentum.On its latest Investor Day, the company made a very surprising and bold statement by mentioning ""the idea of raising the dividend faster than the earnings growth"" as part of the five-year plan. From 2012 to 2016, Honeywell increased its EPS by 47%, whereas its dividend grew by 62%, leaving the company with an EPS payout ratio of 42.2% (EPS of $7.06 as base). That five-year period has now come to an end, but management is confident to continue to grow the dividend greater but at least equal to earnings. More clarity will be provided at Honeywell's next Investor Day in February 2018.Given Honeywell's strong portfolio, where it commands mostly industry-leading positions in all segments, we can expect low-to-mid single-digit organic sales growth in the long term, which means that the current run rate of 3-4% organic growth is expected to further increase. Similarly, there is a high chance that earnings will continue to grow at double digits, which also means future double-digit dividend growth.For a long-term dividend investor, this is exactly the stock to be invested into. Despite the strong run in 2017 and the stock's multiple expansion to almost 24 times earnings, there are a lot of returns to be made.Honeywell's stock chart is a thing of beauty with hardly any meaningful dips as the stock just careens uphill, similar to industry peers United Technologies (UTX) and 3M (MMM).HON data by YChartsFinding an entry opportunity in such a stock is difficult, but occasionally with markets reacting irrationally to strong results, investors are granted with such rare but welcome dips. For instance, Honeywell dropped a staggering 7.5% on October 7, 2016, following a weak guidance. This was just a blip in Honeywell's success story, but it took roughly two months for the stock to fully recover and set a new high.Right now, such a dip would be highly welcomed, but as it is impossible to time such a stock, I am slowly building my position here buying in regular intervals and keeping some fire powder in case the stock corrects meaningfully.According to simplywall.st, the stock is overvalued based on its current price and is trading at fair value if measured in terms of future cash flow value.Source: Simplywall.stThis is an assessment I can share, but still for a long-term dividend investor, given Honeywell's dividend growth rate and its starting yield of 1.91%, even the current stock price can be a solid investment. Projecting a 9% dividend CAGR (since 2007, the dividend CAGR stands at 11%, so we go slightly more conservative here) for the next five years would result in a YOC of almost 3%.The current margin of safety with Honeywell's currently elevated stock price in a market setting new highs almost every day is rather low. As such investors are advised to slowly build their position in this leading industrial software companyHoneywell has been doing exceptionally well in 2017, and over the last six years outperforming its peers and the broad market by quite some distance. The product portfolio is full of highlights, and the company is really firing on all cylinders to keep the momentum going and accelerate further.Honeywell is a large company but remains flexible enough to quickly align its businesses to favorable market trends. It is actively seeking investment and divestment opportunities as deemed appropriate and focusing on driving value creation for shareholders.There are no signs in sight that growth has peaked, and with the company's aggressive capital allocation in terms of buybacks and dividend growth, dividend investors should love this stock.And while the company is not doing too well (there is more ahead), its stock may have gotten ahead of itself. Despite being overvalued, a long-term investment in Honeywell should pay off, particularly if investors accumulate a position in increments. At this stage, the current run of the stock paired with impressive business results looks almost too good, and a slight miss in market's expectations may provide investors with a rare dip.Bearing a major market correction, which looks more and more unlikely as the tax bill takes more shape, such a dip may be months away. However, tax legislation may also help to further strengthen the balance sheet as Honeywell has more than $6B in overseas cash it could be eyeing to repatriate back into the U.S.Still, the stock has been doing too well, and as such, despite continuing my monthly robotic stock investment plan, I am waiting for a dip for a more meaningful investment. Honeywell will announce its 2018 outlook on December 13, and anything below 5% organic growth and double-digit earnings growth is likely to disappoint the markets and create a buying opportunity.Long-term, this is a stock worthy of a full position, but the road to get there with some margin of safety will require some patience.What do you think about Honeywell? Is it doing too well or do you still buy the stock at current levels?"
4112921,23973,2017-10-11T12:05:47-04:00,"Honeywell has at last revealed the substance of its strategic review, and it will result in spinning off businesses that contribute 18% of its revenue.This is unlikely to be the end of Honeywell’s transformation. Acquisitions are definitely on the cards, and in the longer run disposals probably are as well.Honeywell is becoming more focused, more profitable and more capable of increasing both revenue and margins.The prospect of a judicious restructuring is partially baked into Honeywell’s share price, but only partially. The shares should have significant upside.","When I last wrote about Honeywell (NYSE:HON), I titled the article “Better Together,” and argued that the activist investor Third Point’s pressure on the company to spin off its aerospace division was misguided. However, I suggested that, if all Honeywell’s divisions were performing strongly, then their aggregate valuation as independent companies would be higher than what they receive as members of a conglomerate, and that individual operations might well receive very favorable market reception. In other words, and despite my title, I saw scope for disposals or spin offs, just not the one that Third Point was suggesting.After a considerable and apparently quite thorough portfolio review, Honeywell’s new CEO seems to have come to a similar conclusion. In a presentation released Oct. 10, he announced that two operations will be spun off in tax-free distributions to shareholders by the end of 2018. The home thermostat and electronic security businesses will be combined with ADI, Honeywell’s distributor of low voltage and security devices, and Honeywell’s automotive activities, most notably its supercharger business, will be separated from the aerospace division. The businesses have revenue of some $4.5 billion and $3 billion respectively and strong positions in their fields. They can be expected to be greeted favorably by the market, especially since both of them will be potential takeover targets.The spin offs account for nearly 18% of Honeywell’s current revenue, but their severance will have very little effect on the geographic distribution of the new, slimmer Honeywell’s revenue. Without these businesses, it can expect more rapid organic revenue growth, higher margins from day one and an enhanced ability to improve them further. It will become a less diversified conglomerate, largely eliminating any exposure to single-family residential construction and the automotive industry. Most of its remaining businesses will have synergies with each other that they lacked with the spin offs. The new companies will debut with high-yield credit ratings, bolstering legacy Honeywell’s investment grade (Moody’s A2) rating in the process. Although Honeywell indicates that the aggregate dividend of the three companies will remain comparable to its current payout, this suggests that legacy Honeywell’s dividend will be reduced. Apart from the effect on its dividend – and Honeywell is not a great income vehicle − this sounds more like what a program of portfolio restructuring is intended to do, as opposed to the suggestion that Honeywell should hive off its aerospace division.Investor reaction to the announcement was somewhat muted: On a day when the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.23%, Honeywell’s shares retreated by 0.20%.However, their relative performance has been exemplary over the last several months, largely as a result of a solid Q2 earnings, but no doubt also in anticipation of just such an announcement (see here). If there is anything to be disappointed about, it may be the delay until the new companies are spun off, but my suspicion is that Oct. 10's (hardly dramatic) price action is more a matter of “selling on the news.” With the Q3 report only ten days away, it might also reflect some caution about hurricane effects on Honeywell’s business.In my earlier article I also noted the surprisingly strong correlation between Honeywell’s shares and the broad market, despite their significant outperformance, and suggested that this resulted from the company’s diversity and investors’ resulting tendency to treat it as a proxy for the economy. Since then, this correlation has broken down, perhaps because investors anticipated some sort of reorganization that would refocus the company on its growth businesses. Honeywell’s shares have become more volatile than the broad market, and the gap between their performance and that of the S&P 500 has widened fairly steadily since May 19. There is no obvious piece of news that would have caused this: Third Point’s involvement became public knowledge at the end of April.I am skeptical that Third Point’s involvement had anything to do with this restructuring. Over the fourteen-year tenure of the new CEO’s predecessor, Honeywell had made numerous acquisitions, and had, as I suggested previously, become somewhat amorphous. This is by no means meant to imply criticism of that executive, whose contributions to Honeywell (and whose services to its shareholders) were enormous. But a more focused business, which investors can relate more directly to discernible trends in specific economic sectors, and one that has shed some of its more cyclical exposure to auto/truck manufacture and house construction, makes a good deal of sense, both from a management and a valuation standpoint.The dependence of Performance Materials and Technologies (31% of post-demerger revenue) on the energy industry for nearly 50% of its revenues will continue to weigh on the valuation investors are willing to give to that segment. If the fashion for creating large, diversified specialty chemical companies continues − for instance from the eventual breakup of DowDuPont (NYSE:DWDP), the possible merger between Huntsman (NYSE:HUN) and Clariant (OTCPK:OTCPK:CLZNY) or the expected spin off from AkzoNobel (OTCQX:OTCQX:AKZOY) – then sale of all or part of Honeywell’s nearly $9 billion Materials unit may create shareholder value. Safety and Productivity may also be ripe for trimming.Recovery in the business jet market – for which there are, at last, a few hopeful signs – will, when it eventually occurs, amply justify Honeywell’s decision to retain its aerospace activities. This is not to say that there is no room for trimming this division’s activities; it is likely that mechanical systems could find a buyer at a good price, freeing Honeywell Aerospace to pursue engine and avionics activities. The CEO’s presentation makes it clear that acquisitions will continue to be integral to Honeywell’s growth strategy, and it will certainly have the resources to make significant purchases. Targets that would expand the Aerospace or Building Technologies divisions are the most likely candidates.All of which amounts to an enormous range of strategic options, and as yet the new CEO has indicated only the criteria by which he will select strategies, rather than what they will turn out to be. My guess is that Honeywell will concentrate ever more of its attention on connectivity, software and systems, which suggest which of the possible disposals I’ve mentioned is most probable.Accompanying Tuesday’s presentation about the spin offs was quite positive guidance as to what to expect from Honeywell’s Q3 announcement, due on October 20. The analysts’ consensus – which does not yet reflect the consequences of the spin offs – calls for 7.4% eps growth this year, followed by a 9.4% increase in 2018 and 9.8% in 2019. This seems rather ungenerous, as does a valuation of 18.5X what seem to be conservatively estimated 2018 earnings. This, the transformation that Honeywell is undergoing, an increasingly favorable world economic environment and specific incentives for several of its businesses suggest that Honeywell’s strong performance over the last twelve months can continue into 2018."
4113274,41741,2017-10-12T19:45:11-04:00,"Honeywell ""defies"" activist Dan Loeb.However, it’ll still unlock shareholder value.Will this be enough to keep Loeb’s Third Point at bay?","Honeywell (HON) has completed its portfolio review. Recall that Dan Loeb’s Third Point hedge fund is an activist investor here pushing for the company to spin off its aerospace business. The company announced the results of its ‘review’ and instead of embracing Loeb, it’s decided to keep the aerospace business and dump two much smaller businesses.The company has decided to spin off the home/ADI global distribution and the transportation business into separate (publicly traded) companies by 2019. The two collectively generate $7.5 billion in sales - compared to the $40 billion the entire Honeywell company generates.The move will likely be enough to keep Loeb at bay. It isn’t the full-blown aerospace spin off but it at least unlocks some value at the company. Which comes at a time where shares are still trading at all-time highs.The idea is to get a higher valuation multiple now that the business is more streamlined. Of note, Honeywell still trades at a discount relative to its major industrial peers. Honeywell is at 22x earnings, while GE (GE) clocks in at 27x and 3M (MMM) at 25x. Meanwhile, the likes of Danaher (DHR), which did a break up in 2015, trades at 28x. Loeb argued that the aerospace business keeps Honeywell at a discount. Still, that is Honeywell’s biggest business and profit maker. The big overhang remains that the aerospace business could face headwinds - especially as the business jet engine market could slow.I think Honeywell continue to trade at a discount for the foreseeable future given the aerospace overhang. Now, could Honeywell get aggressive and do a deal to merge that business with another industrial giant’s aerospace business? It’s possible. GE has shaken up its C-suite and is doing a portfolio review, so they’ll likely be looking to make a ‘big’ deal to reshape their business. But something like that likely wouldn’t take place until 2019 or 2020.In the interim - Honeywell still looks undervalued, but it’s likely because it still has a lot of exposure to the aerospace market. Last year, aerospace generated over 40% of the company-wide profits. After the upcoming spin-off of the two businesses, aerospace will generate close to half of the company-wide revenues.Thus, if anything, the spin-offs will unlock some near-term value, gaining about $3 billion, in the longer-term the increased exposure to the aerospace business could end up putting downward pressure on its valuation multiple. Again, trading 22x earnings, Honeywell is at a premium to the more aerospace-heavy companies like United Technologies (UTX) at 18x. So don’t be fooled by the ""value-unlocking spin-offs."" The near-term is exciting but long-term Honeywell will need to find a merger partner for its aerospace business or get used to a discounted valuation multiple. Meanwhile, Loeb may or may not stick around for a year or so to make another push to get Honeywell to merge its aerospace business with the likes of GE or United Technologies.

4098813,76785,2017-08-15T09:15:00-04:00,"Honeywell became a target of activist investor Dan Loeb's Third Point hedge fund earlier this year.The fund cut its stake as of its most recent filing - a sign that management is not too keen on an aerospace spin-off?Shares shrugged off the news, but the company trades at a substantial premium to its historical valuation. End markets are improving, but perhaps not enough to justify the cost.United Technologies has its own problems but remains my favored large cap industrial play versus Honeywell and other peers.","Investor favorite Honeywell (HON) has had a healthy run thus far this year, bolstered by continued interest in companies exposed to aerospace and defense, as well as news that activist hedge fund Third Point (headed by Dan Loeb) had built a hefty little stake in the company in order to push for change. With the news that the fund had already begun reducing its stake less than a year after its initial investment, it seems that any activist-driven move to supposedly unlock value (spin-off, larger shareholder returns) seems less and less likely. Given that Honeywell now trades near all-time highs on trailing valuation multiples, are the expectations that have been baked into the company’s share price attainable? Or is this another case of a high-flying large cap that simply is too expensive for its own good?Honeywell is an industrial technology company, one that (like many other large cap industrials) has been trying to pivot itself more towards high-end, niche product lines that are deep technologically. The story here is the software/hardware blend, where the reality is that many smaller market participants simply do not have the access to capital to provide anything anywhere close to Honeywell’s product suite and diversity of offerings. With competition limited, by and large, the company generates extremely healthy margins. There are downsides, as with any large company, it can be tough to turn the company on a dime in response to market actions, and its high growth days are behind it (at least from a consolidated sales picture).Honeywell breaks itself down into four reportable segments: Aerospace, Home and Building Technologies (“HBT”), Performance Materials and Technologies (“PMT”), and Safety and Productivity Solutions (“SPS”). Given SPS is such a small facet of the story (<10% of operating profit) and also has no compelling growth story attached to it (3% organic growth guidance from management), I think it's safe for investors to put that aspect of the business aside in order to keep the thesis simple – don’t lose the forest for the trees. Each and every one of these segments has not seen much growth, on both the revenue side or within margin, over the past several years (once you back out acquisition-driven growth in the HBT segment). At the risk of getting ahead of myself a bit here, it is important to remember why Dan Loeb got involved in the Honeywell story for a reason: stagnancy. That can’t be forgotten when it comes time to try and value this business, or when it comes to looking at segments.AerospaceHoneywell and Aerospace are basically synonymous, and I don’t think you can mention Honeywell without digging deep into the aerospace side of the business. This is a core competency for the company, with products made up primarily of electronic solutions (including avionics), engines and power systems, and high-end mechanical components. In many instances, Honeywell has established a near monopoly presence in several product categories, such as cockpit safety system products, where the company has 90% market share. The story is similar within auxiliary power systems. Win rates on bids are high, which is a testament to the payoff of the company’s heavy investment approach; 15% of segment sales re-invested into research and development, well ahead of peers. As Honeywell continues to churn out new products (likely increasing content per aircraft), the hope is to finally spur some growth in the segment, which has stalled (sales down 5.5% since 2014). Commercial aerospace has been stronger than other end markets (both original equipment [“OE”] and aftermarket) over the past several years, with these two end markets making up 49% of the business mix. The bias to aftermarket has helped segment margin, given the lack of pricing concessions that are typically found in OE bids. A weakness has mostly been found in defense sales (nearly wholly domestic), as well as within the transportation systems sales market.Key drivers in a turnaround here likely fall in some changes in trends. The commercial business will remain solid, although a return to growth will likely necessitate some improvement in the business jet OE space, which has remained weak, particularly internationally. Most in the industry blame weak commodity pricing as a driver, given international wealth (Russia, China, Middle East, South America) is generated on strength here. Obviously, we’ve seen oil pricing improve marginally (down in 2017 however), and iron ore has seen a few pricing spikes that point to some improvement there. A defense turnaround also is key; international has been solid lately, but most of the defense revenue generated by Honeywell is domestic. Recent harsh North Korea rhetoric has bolstered the medium-term case here; if there is one thing the President and Congress agree on, its continued defense spending investment. Honeywell will need to be firing on all cylinders to reach its long-term segment margin target of 25% ( currently 21.1% at mid-point of 2017 guidance); historically Honeywell has seen margin in the 20% range, give or take 100-150bps each way.Performance Materials and TechnologiesPerformance Materials and Technologies (“PMT”) develops and manufactures advanced materials, as well as providing process technologies and automation solutions, primarily within chemical, petrochemical, and industrial power generation markets. As the AdvanSix (ASIX) spin-off is now complete, sales mix has shifted drastically towards higher margin technology solutions, accentuated by the acquisition of Elster (smart metering technology in natural gas), and likely will be again given the acquisition of Nextnine, a leading provider of cyber security solutions for industrial sites. There are positives within the materials businesses as well; Solstice has been a big focus for management, which is a global-warming replacement for fluorocarbons.While the segment has admittedly seen margin improvement since 2014, a lot of this has been mix-related rather than typical hard-fought margin expansion from production efficiencies or operating leverage, going beyond the AdvanSix spin-off impact. Honeywell UOP, a large contributor to segment earnings, has seen its revenues nosedive as a catalyst and absorbent sales to refiners have fallen off a cliff. Process Solutions, the higher margin business, has remained steady. Investors should keep that in mind given guidance of 23.7% segment margin fiscal 2017, which when taken at face value looks amazing given prior segment margin of 17.9% in fiscal 2014. I don’t want to downplay the turnaround here too much; Q2 2017 order rates were up north of 20%, and that followed into Q3 as well (management expects high single digit). Overall, management is quite pleased with the track of the business here, especially relative to other segments.Home and Building TechnologiesHome and Building Technologies is the second-largest segment at Honeywell (trailing Aerospace in both revenue and bottom-line earnings). Within the segment, Honeywell provides hard products and software designed to help both residential and commercial building owners ensure their property is both safe and operating efficiently. Products include controls and displays for controlling HVAC systems (as well as monitoring air quality), lighting, video surveillance, and ventilation, but the products are far-ranging. Chances are, if a customer wants to monitor a specific aspect of a building, Honeywell makes a sensor with the capability.Margin expansion has been trailing management expectations. Given the scale of the segment, margin expansion here is the low-hanging fruit. While the segment has been growing ahead of market rates, particularly within residential, that ends up being a minor headwind to margin (residential margin trails commercial). Investors looking for an easy scapegoat can blame acquisitions, which likely have eaten up a lot of management time. Honeywell bought Intelligrated in August of 2016 for $1,488M, a supply chain and warehouse automation provider. This followed the acquisition of Xtralis, perimeter security and smoke detection, for $515M. The Elster acquisition ($4,899M purchase) also saw some assets integrated into the HBT segment – so management has definitely been busy on integration.Going forward, look for SmartEnergy to help aid growth, as well as growing Chinese sales (up 20% in HPT y/y in Q2). There are a lot of margins to pull here, and management has set expectations pretty low (just 30bps of margin expansion this year at the mid-point). Given the segment generates substantial revenue ($11B in guidance this year), every 10bps of margin expansion is good for $110M pre-tax income, all else equal. Every little bit that can be squeezed out here can be immensely accretive to the top line.Honeywell trades at 13.9x EV/EBITDA on a trailing basis, and 12.9x on a forward basis. Given the company has spent the better part of the last five years trading in the 10.75x range, there is substantial premium built in today. Sure, the shareholder return program has been a solid one, but there are better places to park your money than a company yielding less than 2%, and the company has not been taking out a meaningful amount of the share float via buybacks in recent quarters (616M of net repurchases this year, trailing $1,390M this same time last year). While that sounds high, remember this a company with a $105B market cap; a billion or two in share repurchases is barely accretive to shareholders. While I try not to read into it too much, Honeywell had $9,821M in cash and cash equivalents at the end of Q2; there is plenty of availability if they truly saw value in shares at current levels. Overall, I think the price of safety is too high here. If you’re actively seeking large cap safety, United Technologies (UTX) looks much more compelling. While United Technologies is certainly not devoid of its own problems, I think the valuation difference here is just a touch overdone."
4109207,65113,2017-09-25T11:14:45-04:00,"Honeywell International has continued to grow strongly.The growth may not be over yet, with 3Q earnings expected to rise by 13-16% on a year-on-year basis.I am highly positive on this company.","Honeywell International (HON) is a company that I predicted would continue its rise last February. Indeed, it has done so, from a price of $120 at the time I wrote my last article, to a price of $141.75 at the time of writing.Among the factors that had contributed to the success of Honeywell the last time I covered the company were the acquisition of Intelligrated, which led to a 14.3% increase in margin in the Sensing & Productivity Solutions segment. Among this was also general improvement in the O&G and construction sectors, which also helped boost margins across Honeywell’s Environmental & Energy Solutions division which relies on customers in such industries.This is quite an interesting company from the point of view that – with the exception of the occasional dip – has been growing pretty much consistently since 2009.That being said, Honeywell did see drops in margins across certain business lines – particularly that of the aerospace segment. A significant reason behind this was due to a continuing trend of subdued demand across the business aviation sector.However, in spite of continuing weakness in the business market, Q2 2017 proved to be a lot more positive as a whole - with margins for Aero rising by 22.3%, attributable to a strong commercial market and continued upticks in U.S. Defense Volumes.Source: Honeywell Second Quarter 2017 Earnings ReleaseEven though sales in certain segments were down, margins broadly remained stable with the exception of SPS which saw margins down by 15%. However, given that overall sales increased and that this segment represents the company’s lowest contributor to revenue, I am not overly concerned about this.In the third quarter, the company is expected to bring in EPS of $1.70-$1.75 which is up by 13-16% year-on-year.Source: Honeywell Second Quarter 2017 Earnings ReleaseThe thing I particularly like about Honeywell is that as a conglomerate, the company has its foot in many industries and can appropriately diversify itself to thrive in a range of environments. For instance, even with sectors such as the Environmental & Energy Solutions division serving a range of clients in the O&G industry, the company was practically unfazed when oil prices had bottomed out and business was very weak in this sector.Moreover, with an average dividend growth rate of 12.20% over the last five years along with a yield of 1.88%, the company is quite a respectable play as an income stock.Currently, the P/E ratio is nearing a peak of 22 that was previously reached at the end of 2013.Source: stockrow.comHowever, when looking at past price, we notice that even when the P/E ratio dropped, price continued to grow which indicated high growth in earnings at the time. Should this trend continue, then I would still see the current price as being suitable to get in on this company even in spite of the rise.Honeywell International is a company with a highly diversified business that lends to a distinct competitive advantage, and this shows in the company’s financials. I am quite positive on the future of this company, and it’s on my watchlist for stocks that I might potentially go long on in the future."
4111363,101959,2017-10-03T12:55:47-04:00,"Honeywell recently hiked its dividend by 12%, continuing its strong history of double digit hikes.The company is well positioned in several key markets.Although Honeywell doesn't take the cake in all operating metrics among its peer group, it holds its own and is a strong candidate for investment, at lower prices.","Honeywell (NYSE:HON) is a best-in-class industrial conglomerate that I have admired for a long time. I wrote an article last October calling the stock a buy on a sell-off that put the stock down near $100 and close to its lows from the early 2016 correction. It wasn't long before the opportunity disappeared since the company is up 33% from the time of writing. I knew HON was a solid company to buy on weakness, but this return was not predictable, and it has made it tough to keep adding to my position. With the solid dividend hike recently, I would like to take another look at the company's prospects and how it ranks out against its peers.Source: Company PresentationA quick overview of the company's prospects shows strong growth in the aerospace market. HON continues to win new business, with 25 long-term service contracts and a growing backlog. Additionally, improvements in connection technology like JetWave, a 50 Mbit/sec air WiFi utilizing KA-BAND technology should continue to improve sales per aircraft going forward.HON's motto is ""the power of connected"" and so it makes sense that they are leading the way in several categories of the internet of things within the home, as well. From home security to thermostats, air purification, smoke and gas monitoring, etc., HON is making its presence felt in the new connected home. These technologies are utilized in commercial buildings, as well, and the addressable market should see strong macro trends with the growing middle class worldwide.Additionally, HON has a significant amount of technology used in manufacturing and warehouse processes today. Its innovations in clean fuel, air and water filtration, and connected warehousing gives the company a significant and growing share, especially in e-commerce distribution centers. It's well documented how quickly that industry is growing, and this should prove to be a strong tailwind for HON going forward.Source: Company PresentationSource: Company PresentationLike I stated above, HON has plenty of macro tailwinds that should support company results well into the future. Overall growth in the aerospace industry combined with HON improving its penetration and product mix gives that segment a very strong outlook. E-commerce sales should drive significant gains for the company's warehouse connectivity technology as well, as shown by the exploding sales across the sector. Additionally, petrochemical demand and growth in the urban population will support the other 2 segments, albeit at a slower growth rate.The following graphs use data collected from various sources, including Morningstar and Gurufocus, to compare HON to its peers, 3M (NYSE:MMM), United Technologies (NYSE:UTX), General Electric (NYSE:GE), Illinois Tool Works (NYSE:ITW), and Carlisle Companies (NYSE:CSL). I wanted to take a look across the industrial sector to see how HON stacks up to some of its peers. Being a conglomerate, these industrials are not all necessarily perfect comparisons, and this is especially true in margins where, for the most part, these companies are focused in different areas. However, the trend of margins is interesting to me, because comparing a company to itself in this regard is much easier. 3 of the 6 companies stand out to me here, and it doesn't really surprise me when I look at the names.HON, ITW, and MMM all stand out as not only the 3 highest margin companies, but those with steadily improving margins over time. GE has seen deteriorating margins as a rule, and CSL/UTX have held relatively steady over time. I know the CSL addition may seem random, but I just did a write-up on the company, and the mid-cap industrial operates as a decentralized conglomerate and I think it merits a place here.This checks the box for me with HON regardless of its third highest margin since it has steadily improved it, one of the marks of a strong industrial company in my view.Looking at returns on equity, HON doesn't quite keep up with the other 2. CSL and GE drag anchor again here, and MMM/ITW have improved their returns considerably over time to be essentially tied for first place. I'm not looking to sound the alarm here, as debt loads can have a significant impact on ROE, and HON's return that remains steady in the mid 20% range is nothing to sneeze at.Another metric I want to look at is return on invested capital. In GE's case, I would want to look at its weighted average cost of capital for sure because there is a good chance that shareholder value was destroyed in the years its ROIC was so low. CSL's recent ROIC was low, and only slightly above its WACC, which I addressed as a key risk for the company in my recent article. ITW's ROIC surpassed HON in 2016 and now MMM and ITW hold down 1st and 2nd place again. Just like with the return on equity, HON's ~20% level is solid, but it has fallen short of MMM and ITW.MMM PE Ratio (TTM) data by YChartsI included this graph to show whether or not there is a valuation gap based on the metrics above. GE has had very intermittent earnings, which explains why it doesn't have a P/E ratio and why it is now at 30X. Besides that, ITW and MMM trade right next to each other, with HON slightly cheaper and UTX pretty significantly cheaper. As far as earnings growth estimates go, the companies are ranked basically the same. This puts HON in the middle of the pack, but not far off from the leaders, just like the other metrics, which makes sense.HON Total Long Term Debt (Annual) data by YChartsHON has taken on some debt in the last few years, although I see it as very manageable, with interest expense actually decreasing and a LT debt/equity of 0.55. Free cash flow hasn't grown significantly over time, although it has been consistent and strong enough to provide for impressive dividend growth.HON Total Interest Expense (TTM) data by YChartsThe recent hike of 12% is in-line with the strong growth HON has seen in its dividend over the past 10 years. Its payout ratio today only stands at ~40%, with its FCF payout ratio at 38.7%. This leaves plenty of room for continued growth in the dividend, and with strong sales and earnings growth, I have no doubt that it will continue.Looking at the long-term valuation graph for HON, it appears that the share price has gotten ahead of itself since the last time I wrote about the company. The current P/E ratio of 20.3 is well above the long-term average of 17X, and the current dividend yield of 2.1% is near the low end of the company's average over time.Looking at a more recent graph, HON still appears to be overvalued, as the average P/E ratio is basically the same.Based on analyst estimates and a return to its average valuation, an investment in HON today would yield only about 3% annualized. However, there is no guarantee if or when HON will return to 17X earnings. Based on the metrics analyzed in this article, HON tends to hold its own among its peer group, but ITW and MMM look to be the highest quality companies in the sector. That being said, I really like the growth prospects of HON and the industries it is involved in. The connectivity technologies it specializes in have a bright future, and HON should have no problem continuing its strong dividend growth well into the future. However, today's valuation is pretty prohibitive, so I don't recommend initiating a position at these levels. I plan on adding to my HON position on any weakness.If you liked this article and would like to read more like it, please click the ""Follow"" button next to my picture at the top and select Real-time alerts.

By 2020, it expects that number to have more than doubled to 7.6 billion.By 2020, companies will spend an additional € 250 billion on IoT (over and above their normal technology spending).The IoT market has several layers and only the top two layers of the technology stack, namely services, and IoT applications and analytics, are expected to see the biggest growth and capture the bulk of IoT spending.Source: Boston Consulting GroupThis could explain why industrial companies have been ramping up software capabilities, spending billions in the process. Siemens (OTCMKTS:OTCPK:SIEGY) has spent $15 billion on US software companies since 2007 and has 21,000 software engineers. German engineering giant Bosch has more than 20,000 software engineers, of which 4,000 are focused solely on the internet of things. GE (NYSE:GE) has 14,000 software engineers and is planning to hire 6,000 more technical and support staff for its digital operations.Honeywell has also focused on software in an effort to capitalize on this digital shift. Half of the company’s engineers are dedicated to developing software. The company’s new CEO wants to invest in software capabilities to drive growth. Software is a growth opportunity for the company; HSBC Global estimates that stand-alone software products will account for roughly 22% of total sales by 2020, more than double the level in 2015.Of Honeywell’s four operating units, aerospace, one of its highest margin divisions, is the largest, accounting for 37% of revenue and 40% of profit. While IoT-based “connected cars” have been making headlines, Honeywell has positioned itself in aviation IoT by offering software services for “connected aircraft” with its big data-driven software solution Go Direct which is a suite of more than 50 connected aircraft services which includes solutions for cabin connectivity, flight support services, fuel efficiency services and predictive maintenance.The company demonstrated its array of connected aircraft technologies when it conducted a worldwide tour of its “Connected Aircraft” this year.While the company's Go Direct software exposes Honeywell to several areas of the ""connected aircraft"" opportunity, the exposure to predictive maintenance, which leverages on Honeywell's position as a top supplier of aircraft equipment, could be a particularly profitable opportunity.Among the many use cases for B2B IoT, predictive maintenance is expected to be a major growth driver.Source: Boston Consulting GroupPredictive maintenance is expected to grow seven-fold by 2022.Source: FT.comCivil aviation is one of the most asset-intensive industries in the world. Even the slightest improvements in asset functionality and maintenance (notably by reducing fuel costs and maintenance costs) can yield substantial cost savings.For instance, the Airlines for America (A4A) industry trade association collected financial data for nine U.S.- based carriers - United (NYSE: UAL) , American (NASDAQ: AAL), Delta Air Lines (NYSE: DAL), Southwest Airlines (NYSE: LUV), Alaska Airlines (NYSE: ALK), JetBlue (NASDAQ: JBLU), Hawaiian Airlines (NASDAQ: HA), Spirit Airlines (NASDAQ: SAVE) and Allegiant (NASDAQ: ALTG) — and found they collectively reported a pre-tax profit margin of 11.4% ($9.2 billion) for the first half of 2017 which is down from a collective 15.5% pretax margin ($12 billion) during the first half of 2016. The reason for the decline was due to a “surge” in expenses in the first half of 2017, which outpaced revenue growth. The biggest increases in expenses were from fuel costs, labor and maintenance.Record low oil prices, capacity discipline and increasing demand for air travel have helped airlines reach record profitability for their fifth consecutive year, according to PwC. To sustain this growth, airlines can implement additional measures to improve operational efficiency by cutting costs and improving reliability.For airlines, cancellations and delays are a huge and expensive problem. Up to 30% of the total delay time is due to unplanned maintenance, hence predictive maintenance solutions which take advantage of IoT, are a compelling business case for the airline sector. Last year, in the U.S. alone, the cost of maintenance related delays was well over half a billion dollars.Leveraging on its existing install base of aerospace hardware such as brakes, wheels, APUs and sensors, Honeywell has an opportunity to establish a position for itself in the promising predictive maintenance market. Honeywell has an array of aviation and aircraft components making it one of the top aerospace companies in the world.Honeywell dominates the market for Auxiliary Power Units (APU) with a 76% market share for commercial aircraft. Its market share in military and private planes is even higher. An APU, a critical component of an aircraft made by companies such as Honeywell and Hamilton Sundstrand (NYSE:UTX), is a small gas turbine engine which provides electrical power for starting an aircraft’s main engines and runs air conditioning and other systems while the plane is on the ground.In 2009, when a US Airways A320 flight that had just departed New York’s LaGuardia airport struck a flock of geese, both of the aircraft’s GE Aviation/Snecma-designed CFM56 turbofans were damaged and the associated electrical controls malfunctioned. It was the APUs during the final seconds that came to the rescue, providing the power needed to keep the flight controls, displays etc functioning to allow the pilot to touch down in the Hudson River.In May this year, Hainan Airlines China’s largest privately-operated airline, became Honeywell’s first customer for its data-driven MRO (maintenance, repair, overhaul) service. Honeywell signed a deal with Hainan to provide predictive maintenance for Hainan Airlines’ current fleet of 50 Airbus A330s as well as 40 more A330s when they are delivered in the future. Honeywell’s Go Direct Connected Maintenance will be used to support auxiliary power units (APUS) by collecting APU data which will be used to predict possible issues and thereby reduce downtime.After the Hainan Airlines deal in May, the following month, Honeywell won a contract to provide predictive maintenance for Cathay Pacific A330s. Honeywell’s Go Direct Connected Maintenance program will be outfitted on more than 60 of Cathay Pacific’s and Cathay Dragon’s Airbus A330s. Cathay Pacific had been using the technology in a trial program which proved it can reduce inoperative systems by up to 35%, cut maintenance and operation costs amounting to several hundred thousand dollars, reduce delays (APU-related delay minutes were reduced by 51%) and aircraft downtime.Building on this early-stage success, Honeywell is now eyeing the prospect of carving a bigger slice of the predictive maintenance market by broadening the scope of its Go Direct Maintenance services to other components (such as wheels, brakes and environmental control systems) including non-Honeywell components.To conclude, the B2B IoT market is growing. A report by London-based research firm Techanvio expects aviation IoT to grow to US$ 14 billion by 2021 from nearly US$ 6 billion in 2016, representing a CAGR of 19% between 2017 and 2021. According to the firm, the prime driver propelling airlines to upgrade to IoT-enabled systems and architecture is to improve efficiency and reduce operational expenses. As a leading supplier of aerospace components and equipment, this is a growth opportunity for Honeywell, which derives over one-third of its total revenue from its aerospace segment which amounted to US$ 3.67 billion in the second quarter of 2017 with a profit margin of 22.3%.To tap the opportunity, Honeywell has been expanding its software capabilities and with its Go Direct software, the company offers a suite of technologies for the era of “connected aircraft”.Predictive maintenance is a promising growth area, and this is particularly applicable to the airline industry where fuel and maintenance are two of the biggest operational expenses. Leveraging on its wide install-based of aircraft components, Honeywell has the opportunity of carving a new revenue stream by offering big-data driven predictive maintenance services for its array of aircraft components.Honeywell’s Go Direct fuel efficiency software has also found success, bagging two new clients in August this year - Brussels Airlines and Air Serbia. The software uses data analysis, reporting and monitoring tools to identify fuel saving opportunities that make flying more cost-efficient, for instance, by communicating flight efficient paths to pilots. 20% - 40% of an airline’s operating cost is associated with fuel expenses. These two airlines join a list of over 30 airlines using the software including Jet Airways, Lufthansa (OTCQX:DLAKY), Etihad, Finnair, Japan Airlines and Turkish Airlines.Going forward, there is potential for margins in Honeywell’s aerospace segment to improve, driven by the growth of connected aircraft which offers an opportunity for the company to add scalable software solutions to its existing install base of aircraft hardware. Higher software sales could have a particularly favorable impact on margins."
4112679,69125,2017-10-10T11:06:06-04:00,Honeywell’s highly diversified portfolio bodes well for accelerated growth in 2017.Honeywell continues to expand its footprints in high-growth regions for attracting more opportunities.Honeywell raises annual cash dividend by 12% to $2.98 per share.,"With earnings season around the corner, investors are expecting aerospace-focused technology and manufacturing conglomerate Honeywell International Inc. (NYSE: HON) to deliver market-topping third-quarter results. Although Honeywell's new CEO Darius Adamczyk has been criticized for being too conservative on earnings guidance, Wall Street analysts anticipate $1.73 earnings per share, up 3.59%, from $1.67 in the same period last year. Honeywell's short-cycle business within the home and building technologies (NASDAQ:HBT), safety and productivity solutions (SPS) and performance materials and technologies (PMT) segments, which together make 60% of its total revenue, continue to remain on a growth trajectory amid challenging macroeconomic environment.Honeywell's highly diversified business portfolio has strong potential to generate consistent above-average returns and mitigate operational risks. In addition to this, the company's diligent focus on working capital management, free cash flow generation and a conservative balance sheet bodes well for investors. Year-to-date, Honeywell has generated an average market return of 23.62% (see chart below), outperforming its industry peers General Electric Co. (NYSE: GE), United Technologies Corporation (NYSE: UTX), Johnson Controls International (NYSE: JCI), BASF SE (OTCMKTS: BASFY) and even the S&P 500 (NYSEARCA: SPY) index. Today, Honeywell's stock reached all-time high of $143.92 with a market capitalization of $109.46bn and still has a price target of $153.84. If the $153.84 price target is achieved, the company will be worth $8.67bn more.Source: MorningstarNow, let's dig a little deeper to see how Honeywell is gearing up to improve its top line and why investors should care for it.Honeywell has a balanced mix of long- and short-cycle businesses witnessing decent organic growth in new products and expansion in high-growth geographies over the years. With a controlled focus on cost and productivity, the company continues to expand its footprints in high-growth countries due to rise in their population, urbanization and infrastructure development. In addition, Honeywell is building a robust pipeline of new products to expand its portfolio. Quite recently, the company launched a new flight planning application for the Connected Aircraft, GoDirect Flight Bag Pro, which can be used to create and file flight plans, calculate and compare aircraft cruise modes, and access real-time weather updates.Industrial powerhouse Honeywell has continuously fine-tuned its portfolio by selling and acquiring businesses since 2002. Honeywell is planning to acquire private-equity firm AEA Investors LP owned water filtration company Evoqua Water Technologies, which is worth around $3bn, including debt. Evoqua helps municipalities and industrial customers with wastewater treatment and claims to treat more than 70% of municipal wastewater capacity in the US. Last month, Honeywell also collaborated with Lear Corporation (NYSE: LEA) to provide automotive software technology and infrastructure solutions to address potential threats associated with emerging connected and autonomous vehicle development.However, the business jet aviation industry is facing a modest pace for new jet purchases due to an uncertain economic and political environment along with a highly competitive used aircraft market. The Global Business Aviation Outlook projects approximately 8,300 new business jet deliveries worth $249bn between 2017 and 2027, down 2 to 3 percentage points from the 2016 10-year forecast. As a result, Honeywell expects aerospace sales to grow by 3% to 4% annually over the next five years, and earning operating profit margins of 25%.Honeywell currently trades at a substantial discount to its industrial peer group with an average P/E multiple of 22.3x. Also, the company anticipates to deliver strong earnings growth in the upcoming quarters by continuing to invest in new products and technologies and increasing footprint in high-growth markets across the world.Last month, Honeywell's management announced a 12.0% increase in regular annual cash dividend (from $2.66 to $2.98 per common share), showing explicit commitment to grow its dividends faster than earnings. At the current share price, it would yield 2.1%, slightly above the average yield of 1.9% for dividend-paying stocks on the S&P 500. Meanwhile, trailing-12-month FCF is just under the $5bn mark, providing sufficient coverage for both the dividend distributions and share buybacks.Source: Morningstar"
4100410,103547,2017-08-19T08:07:10-04:00,"Honeywell has doubled revenues and EBIT over the last decade.There is a good possibility that the company will increase their dividend payout in October.Although Honeywell represents a strong company with growth potential, the current stock price appears generous based on free cash flow.","Honeywell (HON) released their Q2 results on July 21, announcing earnings per share of $1.80. The company also updated guidance for the rest of the year, calling for earnings per share of $7.00 to $7.10. The forecast also called for increased margins across all four business segments. The quarter represented a strong start to new CEO Darius Adamczyk's tenure. Honeywell achieved a total shareholder return of 579% during the 15-year tenure of the previous CEO, David Cote. With new leadership in place, now is a good time to take a closer look at Honeywell's future.Honeywell is a diversified business that generated $39.3 billion in sales in 2016. Although Honeywell is primarily a manufacturing company, they have increasingly turned to software to fuel growth; the company now employs over 11,000 software engineers. Honeywell is organized into four operating segments: Aerospace, Home and Building Technologies, Performance Materials and Technologies, and Safety and Productivity Solutions.Aerospace supplies a variety of parts, software, and services to customers throughout the aviation and automotive industry. The business unit produced 38% of Honeywell's revenues in 2016. Major products in the aviation industry include avionics and aircraft engines. Aerospace products include propulsion engines, communications, and navigation systems. Turbochargers used to improve fuel efficiency are the primary product sold into the automotive industry.During the 2017 Paris Air Show, Honeywell signed a deal to install their GoDirect Connected Maintenance products in Cathay Pacific's planes. The monitoring and predictive analytics product reduced downtimes by up to 35% and saved several hundred thousand dollars in expenses during a trial program with Cathay. GoDirect could be a major driver of growth going forward if other airlines experience similar savings.Major competitors for Honeywell Aerospace include General Electric (NYSE:GE), Thales (OTCPK:THLEF), Rockwell Collins (NYSE:COL), and United Technologies (NYSE:UTX). Recent news reports suggest that United Technologies might be in talks to acquire Rockwell Collins in order to be better positioned to negotiate with plane manufacturers. The rumored deal comes after United Technologies declined a 2016 proposed merger with Honeywell. If the deal were to go through, it might prompt Honeywell to consider a deal of its own.Home and Building Technologies markets a variety of controllers, meters, air treatment, and monitoring technologies for residential and commercial buildings. On the Q2 earnings call and accompanying slides, the company highlighted their new Wi-Fi enabled security camera and $80 million in smart meter sales to utility providers. Major competitors for the Division include Emerson Electric (NYSE:EMR), Johnson Controls (NYSE:JCI), and Siemens (OTCPK:SIEGY).Performance Materials and Technologies sells process automation technologies and specialty materials/chemicals. The specialty materials line includes UOP catalysts and adsorbents that are used across the chemical industry, particularly in petrochemical production. The company recently announced the acquisition of Nextnine, a company specializing in cyber security and remote service capabilities. Nextnine is a natural fit for Honeywell's process automation business. Further, industrial infrastructure security looks to be an area that will experience major growth in the coming years as companies look to protect their operating assets from hackers. Competitors for this business unit include Albemarle (NYSE:ALB), BASF (OTCQX:BASFY), Dow (NYSE:DOW), DuPont (NYSE:DD), and Emerson.Safety and Productivity Solutions sells personal protective equipment and footwear, gas detection technology, warehouse automation equipment, and a variety of other products. During the Q2 call, the company highlighted sales growth of their senor tag technology that enables real time monitoring of products as they move along the supply chain. Other companies marketing products in this space include 3M (NYSE:MMM), Mine Safety Appliances, Kion Group, and Zebra Technologies (NASDAQ:ZBRA).Prior to ascending to the CEO position, Adamczyk held roles in several of the Honeywell units. He previously served as President of Honeywell Performance Materials and Technologies, Honeywell Process Solutions, and Honeywell Scanning and Mobility. His familiarity with the automation and monitoring sides of the business should serve him well, as the company is looking to focus on differentiating technologies and software.Honeywell's share price appreciation has closely mirrored EBIT growth over the last decade, with both more than doubling over the last decade. The earnings growth has been fueled by growth in revenue and operating margins.During the Q2 earnings call, CFO Tom Szlosek announced that the company had achieved organic growth of more than 3% during the quarter. Margins were up in both Aerospace (140 bps) and Performance Materials and Technologies (200 bps). Safety and Productivity Solutions margins were down 70 bps, but up 90 bps when adjusted for mergers and acquisitions. Home and Building Technologies had no change in margins. Heading into Q3, the company anticipates further margin expansion on the order of 120 to 160 bps and earnings per share between $1.70 and $1.75.Last year, the company spent over $2.1 billion on R&D to help maintain organic growth. Honeywell has used acquisitions to supplement their organic growth and they indicated during the Q2 earnings call that additional acquisitions are being considered, but they will not acquire a company if the valuation is not compelling. The company went on to say that they were leaning towards purchasing overseas assets given the uncertainty of domestic tax policy, but they didn't rule out the purchase of an American assets. Going into further detail, they mentioned that there is close to $10 billion that could be deployed for an overseas purchase without having to rely on a debt issuance.A significant portion of Honeywell's sales are subject to cyclical market demands. Changes in new construction, commodity chemical prices (e.g., oil), and government budgets all have the potential to significantly impact the company's revenue and profit in any given period. In the 2016 annual report, the company stated that it anticipates spending $546 million on asbestos claims and $250 million on environmental remediation in 2017. There may be additional product and environmental claims in the future. Honeywell sponsors pension plans that assume a somewhat generous rate of return of 7.75%. A 0.25% decrease in the return on pension assets would increase 2017 pension ongoing expenses by $40 million. The company stated during the Q2 call that they have hedging positions to protect foreign earnings from exchange rate fluctuations.Honeywell updated their earnings guidance for 2017 to $7.00 to $7.10 per share during the Q2 call. They also revised the free cash flow estimate to $4.6 to $4.7 billion for the year. With a current market cap of $103 billion, that would equate to a price to free cash flow of 21.9 if they reach the high end of the estimate. Although the company has a share repurchase plan, it is primarily used to offset dilution by stock-based employee compensation and savings plan contributions. With shares currently priced at $135, the company would have to achieve ~7% compounded annual growth in free cash flow over the next three years in order to get the price to free cash flow down to a more attractive level of 18. Below is Honeywell's price to free cash flow over the last decade. Alternatively, the stock would have to fall to $111 per share to reach a price to free cash flow of 18 based on the high end of the free cash flow guidance.Dividends have grown from $1.00 per share in 2007 to the current $2.66 per share, resulting in a dividend yield of 1.9%. The current forward dividend payout represents just over $2 billion. Since 2011, dividend increases have been announced in the fourth quarter, so shareholders may see another increase announced in October. Honeywell has stated that they are looking to increase dividends at a faster rate than EPS growth.Honeywell was authorized to grant over 46 million shares through the 2016 Stock Incentive Plan and Directors Plan, as of December 31, 2016. If the company continues the current share repurchase rate in the second half of the year in order to offset share dilution, that would account for nearly $2 billion of the remaining free cash flow. That would leave Honeywell with ~$600 million to provide shareholders with a healthy dividend increase in Q4.Honeywell has averaged 14.1% return on invested capital over the last decade. The company spun off their resins business last year, which should help the company to focus capital investments on higher return generating projects in their remaining portfolio. Given their high return on capital, shareholders would likely be better served if the additional cash flow was directed to internal investment instead of another double-digit dividend increase.Honeywell has demonstrated consistent earnings growth over the last decade, more than doubling EBIT. The company has returned the earnings to shareholders by more than doubling dividends over the same time period. Honeywell is well positioned to continue growing, as secular trends in process automation and internet connectivity are well aligned with Honeywell's strengths. Value investors looking to establish a new position in Honeywell might be better served waiting for a better entry price, but current shareholders will likely be rewarded with another dividend increase."
4091122,79675,2017-07-27T06:36:44-04:00,"The company reported better-than-expected Q2 2017 financial results and raised full-year 2017 guidance.The top and bottom line beats are nice, but the real story here is the increased guidance.Honeywell is a long-term buy at today's price.","On Friday, July 21, 2017, Honeywell (HON) reported Q2 2017 financial results that beat analyst estimates on the top- and bottom-lines. The company reported quarterly adjusted EPS of $1.80 (versus $1.77 estimate) on revenues of $10.1b (versus estimate of $9.8b). For purposes of comparison, Honeywell reported adjusted EPS of $1.66 on revenues of $9.9B in the same period of the prior year.Honeywell not only reported impressive Q2 2017 results, but management also increased the company’s full-year adjusted EPS guidance by 8%-10% (to a range of $7.00-$7.10). Honeywell’s quarterly beat and raise was well received by the market, as shares are up ~2% since the results were released. This may not seem like much but let’s not forget that HON shares ran up going into earnings and have greatly outperformed the broader market so far in 2017. (Source: Nasdaq)HON shares are trading close to a 52-week high but I stand firm by my belief that investors with a long-term perspective should continue to add to their positions in this industrial conglomerate. Why? It’s simple: Honeywell’s story is intact and the most recent quarterly results (and commentary) tell us that the story is likely to get better in the quarters/years ahead.Honeywell has had a strong start to 2017, as the company has been able to increase its net income and adjusted EPS by ~7% over the first six months of the year by focusing on cutting out costs.The company did not miss a beat over the last three months, which is shown by the fact that Honeywell reported improvements almost across the board (i.e. sales, segment margins, EPS, and free cash flows).Honeywell’s quarterly results were just as impressive when looking at the YoY comparisons for the operating segments.As shown, three out of the four segments saw their margins expand or at least stay flat - all four did if you exclude M&A for Safety And Productivity Solutions (""S&PS"") - and the company reported strong organic sales growth for all segments. Furthermore, Honeywell’s restructuring efforts are already bearing fruit, as the each segment is projected to cut out additional costs and improve margins through the end of 2017.The S&PS segment is small but it is gaining steam. The acquisition that closed in late-2016, Intelligrated, is already having a positive impact on the company's results and digital revenue continued to be a bright spot, as described by management during the conference call. Looking ahead, the S&PS segment has great growth prospects, especially with Intelligrated in the fold, and should continue to become more and more relevant to Honeywell's consolidated operating results. The Q2 2017 results were impressive but, more importantly, Honeywell is projected to finish fiscal 2017 with a bang. Management expects for the company to have a strong third quarter (EPS of $1.70-$1.75, up 13%-16% YoY) and they also increased the full-year 2017 guidance -- EPS in the range of $7.00-$7.10 (from $6.90-$7.10) and revenues in the range of $39.3B-$40.0B (from $38.6B-$39.5B). Management also expects improvements in both margins and free cash flow (“FCF”) for the year.This company is firing on all cylinders, even in a challenging operating environment, so long-term investors should focus on the real story – Honeywell is well-positioned for 2017 and beyond – instead of worrying about whether or not HON shares are now overvalued based on the recent stock performance.Honeywell is trading at a premium when compared to its peers.HON PE Ratio (Forward) data by YChartsIn my opinion, however, the premium is warranted because Honeywell is one of the few companies that still has a good story to tell about the next two quarters of 2017 and beyond. Remember, General Electric (GE) just guided for the company's full-year 2017 EPS to hit the low-end of management's guidance and 3M (MMM) recently laid an egg when it reported Q2 2017 results. Moreover, Honeywell's management team has shown that they are committed to returning capital to shareholders – e.g. the company has steadily raised its dividend over the years and management bought back ~$1B in shares so far in 2017 – so investors are being paid to be patient, even if HON shares appear slightly over valued at today’s price.I was a little nervous when Mr. Cote (former CEO) retired, but it appears that Mr. Adamczyk (current CEO) is more than capable of running this industrial conglomerate. It helps that Mr. Adamczyk was dealt a good hand to play. There was a lot to like about Honeywell's Q2 2017 financial results and I believe that investors should be extremely encouraged about the company's business prospects when considering the backdrop - GE, MMM, and United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) all recently reported lackluster results.HON shares are up big so far in 2017 but they are up big for a reason. Looking ahead, there are three main reasons why I believe Honeywell is a long-term buy at today’s price: First, and most importantly, Honeywell has great businesses prospects and the company is well-positioned in the industries that it operates in. Secondly, Honeywell pays a respectable dividend and the company has the wiggle room to increase the payout through the next few years. Lastly, let's not forget that Dan Loeb's Third Point is still watching Honeywell's every move (this is a positive, in my opinion), which should create a floor in the stock price. In light of this, investors should treat any pullbacks as long-term buying opportunities because this company's story continues to get better and better.Full Disclosure: I have a full Honeywell position in my R.I.P. portfolio, so I do not plan to add HON shares in the near future. However, I plan to stay long HON for the foreseeable future.Author's Note: All images were from Honeywell's Q2 2017 Press Release and Earnings Presentation, unless otherwise stated.If you found this article to be informative and would like to hear more about this company or any other company that I analyze, please consider hitting the ""Follow"" button above.Disclaimer: This article is not a recommendation to buy or sell any stock mentioned.

4112892,79675,2017-10-11T10:11:27-04:00,The company announced plans to spin off two businesses by the end of 2018.Is it a case of addition by subtraction? I think so.Honeywell is a long-term buy at today's price.,"On October 10, 2017, Honeywell (HON) announced plans to spin off assets that are expected to bring in approximately $7.5B of revenue in fiscal 2017. Management has decided to spin off the Transportation Systems and Homes And Global Distribution business units into two separately traded public companies by the end of 2018. The transactions are expected to be tax-free spin offs and management believes that the new structure will allow for them to better manage the remaining businesses - Aerospace, Building Technologies, Performance Material And Technologies, and Safety And Productivity Solutions - while also putting the newly created companies in a better position to unlock shareholder value. HON shares finished the trading day slightly down on the restructuring news but it is important to remember that the stock has been outperforming the broader market by a wide margin so far in 2017.(Source: Nasdaq)I believe that the restructuring plan is a great long-term decision by management and that the transactions will most likely unlock a tremendous amount of shareholder value so, in my opinion, investors with a time horizon longer than one to three years should seriously consider adding HON shares on any dips.While I am not overly bullish on the SpinCos, I believe that the spin offs will create a significant amount of value for Honeywell shareholders because it accelerates management's long-term strategy of streamlining operations and focusing on high-margin, core-assets.(Source: Portfolio Update, October 10, 2017)As described above, the two soon-to-be spun off business units are expected to bring in approximately $7.5B in revenue. More importantly, these units are low margin businesses that have experienced top-line pressure over the last three years. (Source: 2016 10-K)Therefore, I believe that management is smartly thinking ahead by spinning off these assets now in order to put the SpinCos in a better position to focus on their core businesses and allocate capital accordingly. Furthermore, the remaining businesses under the Honeywell umbrella already operate in high-growth industries that have promising long range prospects so the ""new"" Honeywell will be in a position that will allow for the company to significantly expand margins and grow earnings.Additionally, Honeywell's decision to not listen to Third Point's recommendation to spin off the aerospace division has somewhat flown under the radar but, in my opinion, this is great news for existing shareholders because the aerospace division will be a key growth driver for this company over at least the next few decades. Lastly, management expects for the dividend to remain intact (in aggregate) so shareholders will be paid to be patient, even after the portfolio shuffle is finalized.Honeywell has greatly outperformed its peers group over the last few months.HON Year to Date Price Returns (Daily) data by YChartsThe outperformance is largely related to an improving investor sentiment, but it has helped that the company has at least met the consensus EPS estimate in each of the last eight quarters.(Source: Fidelity)In addition to the restructuring plan, management also raised Honeywell's full-year EPS guidance to $7.05-$7.10 from $7.00-$7.10, and guided for strong Q3 2017 results (EPS of $1.75 on revenues of $10.1B). Let's also remember that management recently raised the full-year guidance to the $7.00-$7.10 range (increase by 8%-10%, see here for more detail) so this is the second time in the last four months that the current year guidance has been raised. Simply put, there is a lot to like about Honeywell's business prospects as we head into fiscal 2018.Honeywell is trading at a premium when compared to its peer group, with the exception of 3M (MMM).HON PE Ratio (Forward) data by YChartsIn my opinion, Honeywell deserves to be trading at a premium so investors should not think that HON shares are overvalued at ~20x 2017E earnings. Moreover, investors should expect for adjusted earnings to continue to grow through 2018 and, in my opinion, the spin offs have the potential to unlock a lot of value in 2018 (full disclosure: this is hard to quantify at this point in time).The recent spin off announcement should be viewed as icing on the cake because Honeywell was already in a position to outperform the market through at least 2018, as I described in ""HON: Management Did Us All A Favor"". Honeywell's long-term story keeps getting better so investors that are now sitting on a nice gain should stay the course, in my opinion. Additionally, prospective investors should not be scared of the company's current valuation because Honeywell is a best-of-breed industrial conglomerate that has great long-term business prospects.It is a little early to quantify the true impact of the spin offs - stay tuned because I will be writing more about it in the future - but, when taking a step back, it is hard not to like the prospects of the announced restructuring plan. HON shares are up big in 2017 for a reason and I do not see why this would change any time in the near future. Therefore, investors should treat any pullbacks as long-term buying opportunities.Author's Note: Honeywell is a core holding in my R.I.P. portfolio and I have no plans to reduce my position in the near future.If you found this article to be informative and would like to hear more about this company, or any other company that I analyze, please consider hitting the ""Follow"" button above.

4090388,39011,2017-07-25T16:13:33-04:00,HON's Q2 report was very strong.Bullish momentum had been waning heading into the report but new all-time highs are here again.HON is getting pricey but the bulls are firmly in control.,"Honeywell (HON) has been on fire in the past year or so in terms of not only growing revenue at a decent pace, but also continuously improving its margin profile. I said going into the Q2 report that I was cautious, but the stock has continued its trek higher, currently trading for a new all-time high. My concerns surrounding the valuation and the lack of strong bullish momentum don’t appear to be shared by market participants, and HON is off to the races again.First off, my concerns over bullish momentum appear to have been at least partially answered by the immediate reaction of the stock. The RSI is moving higher along with the stock price, and while the MACD is still at a subdued level, a bullish cross in the shorter term MA over the longer term one adds some credence to the idea a further rally is coming. In addition, the obvious bullish fact is that the stock is trading for a new high; that is never a bad thing. In short, then, it looks like market participants are picking up the bullish conviction once more, something I was on the fence about going into the report.Now, as far as the actual report goes, it was a very good one. That has become a normal thing for HON, but still, we must give credit where credit is due and here, it certainly is. Total sales were up just 1% on a reported basis but 3% on an organic basis, with the lion’s share of the difference coming from divestitures. That number exceeded HON’s own guidance for Q2 and indeed that of the investing community as well. Home and Building Technologies as well as Performance Materials and Technologies posted very strong organic revenue growth in Q2, carrying the weaker Aerospace and Safety businesses. This is the beauty of Honeywell’s diverse revenue base; we see strength in one offset relative weakness in the other, but lately, there has been only strong and stronger. The 3% organic revenue gain in Q2 was really quite the start to the report.On the margin front – the bit that I’m really interested in – results were quite good as well. Segment margin rose 50bps to 19% as Performance Materials and Aerospace carried the team to a good result. Home and Building was the weakest with flat margins, and while Safety and Productivity had a reported negative margin growth number, that was due to M&A. Excluding one-time costs, its margins rose as well. In other words, the main thrust of my reason for being bullish on HON – expanding margins – is still very much intact. HON has been on this road for a long time and the massive investments it has made with respect to growing capacity – and growing it efficiently – have really paid off. In addition, the reasons for HON’s higher margins are still in place and thus, there is no reason to think the margin party will stop anytime soon. I continue to expect higher margins from HON, and its guidance raise suggests that is coming as well.This was another very good quarter in a string of them that HON has put together in the past couple of years. Analysts have bumped their estimates for this year and next slightly, but I have a feeling that by the time we get to 2018, estimates will be even higher. HON continues to surprise to the upside in terms of what it can do with revenue and margins, with the latter providing the bulk of its EPS growth potential.Even at new highs, we are still at 19+ times this year’s earnings, so we aren’t talking about an egregious valuation by any means. Given its high single-digit EPS growth rate, I wouldn't say it’s particularly cheap, but it isn’t expensive either. There are many other stocks in this market that are more expensive with dimmer outlooks than HON, so on that front, I’d posit the rally certainly could continue.I do think that at $15, the difference between the stock price and the 200DMA is getting a bit stretched, but that’s what happens when a stock doesn’t pull back. HON is currently dancing along the rising 50DMA and until that stops happening, the trend is certainly up. I thought the Q2 report might be a catalyst for a pullback to occur, but HON came through and it is once again moving higher. Given the report and the guidance raise, the only thing that makes me cautious is the fact that it hasn’t pulled back for so long. At some point that needs to happen, but buyers are still out in force and that’s good enough for now."
4086014,102254,2017-07-06T08:27:20-04:00,"Honeywell International generated solid returns and the company’s business strategies are working.The proposed spinoff could create big value for shareholders and this strategy will enhance its sales and earnings growth potential.Aside from aerospace, the company is in a position to generate double-digit earnings growth.It’s a perfect investment for defensive investors and shares are trading at a fair price.","Honeywell International (HON) continues to impress investors with its strong operational performance, innovation, and the potential to make smart changes in the company product portfolio according to the business requirements. Consequently, the company’s return on equity ratio is currently standing around 25, significantly higher than the industry average of 16. Its management has also successfully sustained investors’ confidence over the last five years, resulting in a share price appreciation of 123%.However, the company now plans to make a big gamble by separating its aerospace business into a new company. The aerospace segment was Honeywell’s largest revenue generating segment in FY2016 with $14.75 billion in annual sales. Unfortunately, this segment has been under pressure over the last couple of years, creating pressure on the performance of the entire business. Here's a brief description of Honeywell's history in all things outer space related.In the first quarter of this year, the aerospace segment generated negative sales growth of 4% compared to the same period last year. There was supposed to be a better performance from the aerospace segment considering the past record of the last two years, forcing the company to review their spinoff strategy.Chairman David Cote says CEO Darius Adamczyk is reviewing the business with the company's board and it appears there will be discussions held with investors at some point.At the same time, the hedge fund industry has been sending positive signals in favor of the proposed spinoff as it could increase shareholder value by up to $20 billion. In addition, it would allow both companies to strengthen their core businesses and expand their global penetration.Aside from the aerospace business, the company looks in a position to generate strong growth from the rest of the business segments, including Home and Building Technologies, Performance Materials, and Technologies and Safety and Productivity Solutions. In the latest quarter, the home and building business segment generated sales growth of 3% year-over-year thanks to strong performance in distribution and the impact of new product introductions.Moreover, the company’s investments in high margin products along with improving demand and operational efficiency allowed it to expand segment margin by 70 bps to 15.2% in the latest quarter. Moving forward, prospects for the home and building segment look strong, due to the company’s strategy of expanding its penetration in Chinese markets and supporting their revenue base from acquisitions and introduction of new products.In addition, the market fundamentals also appear strong, as the IMF expects economic activity to pick up the pace in 2017 and 2018, especially in emerging markets and developing economies.On the other hand, its remaining two segments, performance materials and safety and productivity, are also on a strong momentum. In the latest quarter, performance material segment generated sales growth of five percent compared to the year-ago period, while segment margin enlarged massively by 260 bps to 22.8 percent, supported by commercial excellence and higher sales volume. Its safety and productivity solutions segment is likely to generate a mid-single digit growth in sales and a high mid single-digit growth in operating profits. In ConclusionOverall, Honeywell is well set to enlarge shareholder returns in the coming years thanks to their smart business strategies. The company’s strategy to invest in high-margin areas that have the potential to return hefty cash flows is working. Its first quarter results highlight that trend, as its free cash flows were 6 times greater than the year-ago period. The company is likely to make a double-digit dividend increase in the third quarter, due to the strong free cash generation potential and earnings potential in the range of $6.90 - $7.10.Our discussion clearly suggests that Honeywell is a solid company for long-term defensive investors who seek steady growth in cash returns along with a solid capital appreciation. At the same time, it is also important to pick the stock at the right time to expand the return on invested capital. Usually, investors like to buy the stock on dips, but in the case of Honeywell, we do not see any big price correction in the coming days. An expected spinoff could boost the share price further, as big hedge fund managers are in favor of the separation. Thus, trading around 22 times to earnings compared to the industry average of 24 times, Honeywell appears like a good bargain for long-term investors."
4089501,33291,2017-07-21T15:26:58-04:00,Coverage initiation of HON following inquiries.A discussion of earnings with a focus on segment performance and expenses.Shareholder-friendly policies.Rating assigned.,"Honeywell (HON) has just reported its earnings and is surging to new 52-week highs on the back of the news. This action in turn has caused the stock to appear on our radar following reader inquiries, and thus are compelled to respond. While we have looked at the name in the past and have owned the stock years ago, this column serves as our initiation of coverage.As many know, this company operates in four key segments which include Safety and Productivity, Performance Materials and Technologies, Home and Building Technologies, and finally Aerospace. The company is relatively fairly valued at nearly 22 times trailing earnings when considering sales and earnings growth, but the question is, should you book profits here? Let us turn to the performance of the company to answer this question.The stock is spiking on better than expected headline results from the company. Honeywell sales for the second quarter were up over 3% on an organic basis and up 1% on a reported basis compared to last year. They came in at $10.08 billion and surpassed estimates by $190 million. What is interesting is that every segment saw sales improvement. Safety and Productivity Solutions sales for the second quarter were up 1% on an organic basis as a result of higher volumes in industrial safety products, sensing controls, and voice-enabled workflow solutions.Aerospace sales for the second quarter were up 2% on an organic basis driven by strength in commercial aftermarket sales, growth in U.S. defense, and a continuing recovery in commercial vehicles. Performance Materials and Technologies sales for the second quarter were up 6% on an organic basis while Home and Building Technologies sales for the second quarter were up 4% on an organic basis.While sales were up across the board, expenses to generate those sales increased only slightly. Total expenses were $8.3 billion, driven by $5.6 billion in costs of products sold, followed by $1.4 billion in selling and administrative expenses, as well as $1.2 billion in costs of services rendered. Taken as a whole, income before taxes was $1.78 billion, and $1.4 billion following taxes. This translated to $1.80 per share on a diluted basis, beating consensus estimates by $0.02, a direct result of slightly better than expected sales and strong expense management. Speaking on the quarter, Darius Adamczyk, President and CEO, stated:This last portion of commentary above is why the stock is moving higher. The company has raised guidance. Honeywell now sees 2017 earnings per share to be between $7.00 and $7.10, up 8-10%, versus last year excluding items. Further 2017 sales are now anticipated to be between $39.3 billion and $40.0 billion, up 2-4% on an organic basis. When we factor this guidance in with the shareholder-friendly nature of the company, a buy is compelling even at these valuations. Just this quarter another $682 million in stock was repurchased and $546 million in dividends paid. I do expect higher dividends in the future.

4082847,101543,2017-06-21T08:39:55-04:00,Activist investor Daniel Loeb is pushing for Honeywell to spin-off its Aerospace segment.From a peer valuation the company looks slightly undervalued.Honeywell International will make a decision by the fall for the possible spin-off.,"Spin-Off ScreenAbout two months ago Daniel Loeb of Third Point made the case that Honeywell International (NYSE: HON) should spin-off its Aerospace division (Link). With the company being under pressure from an activist, it's now on my potential spin-off screen and an analysis is warranted to see if there's an investment opportunity. I would like to note though, I'm not advocating for the spin-off or that the spin-off is likely to happen.Honeywell International is a diversified technology and manufacturing company whose main focus is in the industrial market. They now operate through four segments: Aerospace, Home and Building Technologies (HBT), Performance Materials and Technologies (PMT), and Safety and Productivity Solutions (SPS). Sales have reached in excess of $39 billion and management has used an M&A strategy to accomplish this.Organic growth still hasn't materialized throughout the businesses. In 2016, Home and Building Technologies segment was the only segment that showed improvement, which was driven by new product introductions. The biggest headwind to topline growth has been currency and I anticipate this to ease going forward.Exhibit 1: Historical Operating Results by SegmentSource: Company ReportsThe Aerospace segment makes up 37% of the revenue base with the second highest operating margin profile at 20%, implying less competition within the segment compared to HBT and SPS, which have the lowest operating margins. The Aerospace segment supplies commercial aviation equipment, system and service solutions, and products and services to aircraft operators in the defense, military, and space industries. With the segment having the largest revenue base, synergies across the organization are there, but it does operate in a very different market (see Exhibit 2).Exhibit 2: Competitor MappingSource: Author's ResearchThere is no overlapping competition for the Aerospace segment compared to the other three segments, so separation does make some sense from this standpoint.ValuationThe company has continued to generate large amounts of cash flow, and increase it annually over the last 5 years. This cash flow has been used to pay dividends, buyback stock, and make strategic acquisitions. All of these cash uses have benefited shareholders over the years, but organic growth has started to slow, along with operating margin expansion. These factors could be the main driving factor as to why the company sells at a discount compared to peers (See Exhibit 3).Exhibit 3: Peer AnalysisSource: Gurufocus, Company ReportsWith an average EV/EBITDA multiple of 15x, a re-rating shows at least 15% upside. I don't know though if a separation of the Aerospace segment would close this gap. Portfolio wide organic revenue growth has been none existent, not just restricted to the Aerospace segment.Concluding ThoughtsI do find this push for a spin-off an interesting development, especially because Honeywell is at a crossroad. Should they stay being a large industrial conglomerate or separate one of their largest revenue base segments to provide focus and fresh strategic initiatives? I don't know the right answer, I do know that Honeywell sells for a lower EV/EBITDA multiple than its peers, and has already gone through one spin-off in the past year with Advansix (NYSE: ASIX), which can serve as blueprints for management if they wish to pursue this corporate action. Honeywell's management has announced they will make their decision by the fall of 2017.To read more research on stock spin-offs, micro-mid cap companies, and special situations please consider following me (by clicking the ""Follow"" button at the top of this article next to my name) to receive notification when I publish research next."
4084655,102581,2017-06-28T15:11:17-04:00,"Honeywell remains the leader of this pack.GE is undergoing a change, will the stock undergo a reversal?What exactly is UTX's story?","The stock performance of the industrial (XLI) trio – Honeywell (HON), General Electric (GE), and United Technologies (UTX) has diverged after the initial jump following the election of Donald Trump. While Honeywell and United Technologies have reached higher highs, GE has been in the red falling 13.9% year-to-date. The recent quarterly performances have influenced the divergence to great extent. Given the staying power of these companies, a couple of bad quarters may, in fact, be an opportunity and a good quarter does not necessarily mean a lost chance at picking these stocks. If I were to make an investment at current prices and the troika were up for consideration which one would I choose? I take a closer look at this question in this article.And why these three stocks in particular? No two industrial conglomerates are similar but these three come quite close and they form an exhaustive set in my peer group. Additionally, Honeywell has unsuccessfully, tried to merge with GE and UTX in 2001 on competing bids, and also tried to acquire UTX recently in 2016. In 2001 the GE and Honeywell merger failed at the European Union Competition Commission on account of similarities in their businesses. And UTX thwarted the recent attempt at its acquisition citing similar regulatory hurdles. It, therefore, makes sense to look at them as competing investment opportunities with similar risk factor exposures.Honeywell: Not Cheap but bestLet’s start with the obvious. Honeywell is a better company compared to GE and UTX on all parameters. Its operating margins is at least two percentage points higher than GE and UTX and the company has historically logged an increasing trend in margins since 2011. The company’s free cash flow conversion is better than both UTX and GE. Even during a bad year when you’d expect a high margin company’s numbers to deteriorate substantially, Honeywell’s operating margin dipped from 17.7% in 2015 to 17% in 2016 (Company filings). In contrast, if we look at UTX, when the Otis Elevator segment was facing huge competitive pressures in the tumbling Chinese real estate market, operating margins tanked from 16.6% in 2014 to 13% in 2015. Honeywell’s trailing 12 months return on invested capital of 15.1% is also substantially ahead of UTX (11.7%) and GE (5.5%). Excess returns over cost of capital is often associated with richer multiples and that indeed is the case here. Additionally, the company has made several key acquisitions in the last few years and as they come under the ambit of Honeywell Operating System, their margins will improve. I also like the kind of core-satellite approach which the company has with its current portfolio. With software and solstice products, which are growing in double digits, as the satellite to its core industrial portfolio, which is growing at slightly higher rates than the end-markets.General Electric: Time for the stock to turn around as wellAn equity analyst friend of mine used to say, “If you can model GE, you can model any company in the world. It is so complicated!” The good news is it has become less complicated in the last couple of years. Although I believe he was unfairly blamed, the Immelt era is over. As Flannery takes over, I think he has two options. The first is to break up GE so that the firm is more agile. This will also create the highest amount of value for shareholders as the company loses the conglomerate discount on its head and individual entities trade at richer multiples. The second approach and the most likely one initially is that he tries to improve operations and makes the company more nimble without breaking it up. Eventually, if the second option were to fail, I think he will be forced to take the first alternative. There is more downside if the second option were to fail but how do you determine the probability of the event? It isn’t possible. Therefore I think this is the right time to gradually start accumulating on this stock.United Technologies: Find the catalystUnfavorable macros are a pain point with each of the three companies. But Honeywell has digital, General Electric has transformation, what exactly is United Technologies catalyst for the next five years? I am yet to find a clear, convincing answer to this question. Based on the statements provided by Greg Hayes, Pratt & Whitney is expected to record $10 billion in negative margins over the next decade. The aftermarket will come, yes, but meanwhile, there are other units which have their own unique problems. Exposure to the Chinese elevator market through Otis is definitely a key concern. The Finnish elevator maker - Kone Corporation (OTCPK:KNYJF), is the market leader in China and a perusal of its earnings in the last two quarters gives little reason for comfort. Much like the jet engine business, companies bid aggressively for new installations in the elevator market. Larger the installed base, larger is the lucrative aftermarket revenue. However, since customers can switch operators for maintenance contracts annually, Otis like Kone can expect significant headwinds in this price sensitive market.In Conclusion...Despite the recent run-up, I think Honeywell is the best hunter among the three. The company’s restructuring is not of mammoth proportions as is the case with GE. This reduces risks and the broad trajectory of the portfolio is very convincing. With GE, there are risks involved but I think the price point is what makes it really attractive. Much of the recent debate around dividend was overblown because of significant cost outs which are normal during a restructuring of this scale. And finally, due to the lack of any discernible catalyst, I remain bearish on United Technologies.Note 1: If you find the article interesting, hit the follow button on top, right next to my name.

4088426,39011,2017-07-18T11:50:05-04:00,"HON has experienced a tremendous rally in the past several months.At some point, the stock needs a breather and this report could be the catalyst.The chart is saying bullish momentum is waning and the valuation is getting somewhat stretched.","Photo creditHoneywell (HON) has quietly continued to move higher over the past couple of years in an environment where many large industrials have stagnated. HON is due to report earnings in just a few days and heading into the report, the setup for bulls is a bit more challenging than last time around. In this article, I'll take a look at the stock going into the report as well as what I'll be looking for from the report itself on a fundamental basis.We'll begin with the technical picture as it really couldn't look much better for HON for the past several months. The stock bottomed at $103 back in October of last year and hasn't had more than a $5 pullback since, having made a run all the way to $135 today. The trek up has been impressive but the downside is that one wonders just how much short or intermediate term upside remains given the levels we're talking about.The momentum indicators largely haven't confirmed the continued move higher as higher highs in the stock have been met by lower highs in the MACD as well as the RSI, as pictured above. That doesn't necessarily mean the stock is ready to fall off a cliff but it does mean that bullish momentum is waning, meaning that buyers aren't stepping up in the same force they were earlier in the rally. This is totally normal given the length of the rally here and one must be cognizant that this rally isn't going to last forever. Price action hasn't confirmed the momentum relative weakness just yet, but it is certainly something to watch. Until then, the stock is still using the 50DMA as support and as long as it remains above that line, the rally seems to be in good shape. A poorly received report could obviously derail the rally, but we'll just have to wait and see.In terms of the report, obviously, we want to see revenue growth. HON isn't a fast-growing startup but rather, a lumbering industrial behemoth so a couple percentage points of top line expansion is good enough. Analysts have headline revenue coming in at a 1% loss but keep in mind that number includes acquisitions, divestitures and forex translation, all things that muddy the water when looking at organic performance. Those things still matter and they count, but I'll also be looking at organic revenue growth, which was very strong in the first quarter, with every major segment but one producing a gain. HON should be able to replicate that sort of performance but if it cannot and organic revenue is weak, that will be a potential trigger for a selloff.More importantly for me, however, is HON's margin growth story. This company has been on fire in the past few years in terms of squeezing more and more margin from each dollar of revenue, something it continued in Q1 as well. What was interesting about Q1's gain in margins was that the entirety of it - and more - came from reductions in input costs. SG&A costs actually rose 5% during Q1 so if HON were to be able to keep SG&A increases in check, it could do some pretty powerful things with operating margins. I still think we'll see strong input cost deflation as that has been a long term theme for HON, but watch SG&A costs as well; this is the opportunity for HON to continue to improve margins going forward.The only note of caution on the fundamentals is that since the stock has performed so well, the valuation has become a bit stretched. We are talking about just over 19 times this year's earnings and 17.5 times next year's earnings so while the price isn't egregious, the stock was much cheaper a few months ago. Shares are now going for about 2X its EPS growth rate and typically, that's about the max I'd want to pay for any company because after that point, you're getting into some very frothy territory relative to growth. I don't doubt that HON has a very bright future in front of it but I also know that at some point, it has to stop going up in a straight line. Are we there yet? We don't seem to be but with bullish momentum seemingly waning and an earnings report coming up, that could certainly provide the catalyst for what I'd consider a much-needed consolation and/or pullback.I think HON's report is going to show us much of the same that it has for the past few quarters; revenue growth will be decent and margins will move up substantially. There is room for improvement with respect to SG&A costs and hopefully HON is addressing that area. The only thing that worries me is the price of the stock given the valuation against expectations of EPS growth; I worry the stock needs a pullback here and that if the report isn't perfect, investors will take the chance to lock in some profits. If that happens and the stock pulls back, it is certainly worth a look. For now, I'm cautious heading into the report."

4069544,23973,2017-05-05T03:28:33-04:00,"The proposal to break up Honeywell into an aerospace group and a rump consisting of the rest is unlikely to raise the aggregate value of its parts.Honeywell's valuation problem is not its Aerospace Division.Its conglomerate valuation may inhibit temporary realization of value, but in the long run it probably underwrites a higher valuation of the whole.","There has been much discussion about Honeywell's (NYSE:HON) valuation, which is allegedly at a discount to that of its peers, and has motivated an activist investor to suggest that the cure for this is to spin off its aerospace activities. These are the valuations of companies that Honeywell lists among its principal competitors (see its Form 10-K, p. 4):While it is unarguable that Honeywell's valuation is on the cheap side of those companies with which it reports to the SEC it is most comparable, it hardly stands out as a blazing bargain. United Technologies (NYSE:UTX), the company that is most obviously similar to it (with its large aerospace business and its big commitment to HVAC) is deservedly cheaper.Aerospace (37.5% of 2016 revenue) has unquestionably been a disappointment to Honeywell recently, but it has hardly been a disaster:Last year's operating margin of 20.3% is certainly no indication of distress, even if it is lower than that of 2015. It is also notably higher than the 18.0% earned by Honeywell less its Aerospace Division.Over the last ten years, Honeywell's aerospace activities saw a compounded 2.1% increase in revenue compared to 1.0% for the rest of the company but its operating income rose 3.5% annually compared to 6.7% for the rest of the company. Clearly, there is a problem with Aerospace: it is not responding as well to Honeywell's disciplines as its other divisions. However, unless we believe that Honeywell management has, unaccountably, failed to apply them as diligently to Aerospace as to its other businesses, this suggests that the (comparative, but hardly acute) problems of Aerospace have to do with industry conditions.Spinning it off is unlikely, in such a situation, to raise the total value of Aerospace plus Honeywell-ex-Aerospace. I believe that it is unlikely that, if Honeywell is undervalued relative to its peers, Aerospace has much if anything to do with it. Its valuation has been an issue for Honeywell far longer than the recent weakness in its Aerospace division.I believe that Honeywell suffers from the low valuation that markets generally assign to chemical manufacturing and related engineering activities, which are its most profitable businesses, contributing 23.6% of its 2016 revenue and 27.7% of its operating income. Note, however, that with the October spin-off of AdvanSix (NYSE:ASIX) this division will not bulk so large in future: its revenues were reduced by 12.5% and its operating income by 2.6%. Honeywell's slimmed-down Performance and Materials Technologies division will have even higher operating margins than the 22.1% it achieved last year: it is obviously not engaged in commodity businesses. But whether justifiably or not, it attracts a valuation more typical of the basic materials sector. Note Dow's (NYSE:DOW) valuation.Chemical companies receive low valuations because they manufacture consumables and are capital-intensive. Because of the former, they seldom build significant order backlogs, so revenue changes rapidly when demand does. The latter has a constellation of consequences for them. They cannot cut costs quickly when demand declines. They cannot operate economically at low utilization rates, so weak demand results in inventory build, absorbing working capital and depressing the prices that future production might otherwise command. Since scale is essential to efficiency, capacity is 'lumpy,' coming on stream in large increments that create temporary supply shocks.How hiving off Aerospace would solve the problem of investors' justifiable prejudices about businesses that account for the second-largest share of Honeywell's operating income is mysterious to me. A spin-off is more likely to create the worst of both worlds: an aerospace business that would continue to suffer from a temporary downturn and a rump Honeywell that would rely on chemicals for roughly half of its operating income and would be valued accordingly. Market conditions for Aerospace will eventually improve; stock market perceptions of the value of chemical operations are unlikely to, and will continue to foster the perception that Honeywell is undervalued.It is unusual to find a share that maintains an R2 relative to the broad market as high as Honeywell's 0.6107 over any length of time. R2 is the 'coefficient of determination,' and that reading indicates that the performance of the broad market supposedly 'determines' 61% of the share price behavior of Honeywell.Obviously, this does not mean that Honeywell's shares have performed in lock-step with the Index: over the period of twenty-one quarters shown above, it has outperformed the Standard & Poor's 500 Index by forty-eight percentage points. None of the more obviously comparable companies have anything like the correlation to the S&P 500 Index that Honeywell International exhibits:It is one thing to examine the smoothed results that come from series comprising more than 1000 data points, but over the short-term[1] Honeywell's correlation with the Index has been strong and surprisingly consistent, as these things go ─ short-term correlations tend to be quite volatile, as the chart indicates, but usually more volatile than Honeywell's were until quite recently.Honeywell's correlation reached an inflection point on October 6 last year, when management released surprisingly, and as it turned out, unrealistically pessimistic guidance for the rest of 2016 and 2017. Up until then the R2 was even higher at 0.6393.It is noticeable that, of the companies that Honeywell itself thinks are most comparable to it, 3M (NYSE:MMM) has the correlation with the S&P 500 that is closest to its own. It is unlikely that there is no systematic explanation for this.I think that the correlation between these shares and the S&P 500 Index is because they are so diversified that investors have no obvious way of pinning their performance expectations to anything other than their outlook for the total economy. Both companies have strong operating cultures and histories of fairly reliable earnings growth. So, provided that they do not do something to disturb this perception - such as unexpectedly downbeat guidance (of which 3M has also been guilty, viz. its December 15, 2015, press release and accompanying 6% decline in its share price) or a bid for United Technologies - investors seem content to grant them a performance premium over the broad market. For both shares, this has amounted to nearly eight percentage points' annual performance premium over the S&P 500 Index.Within limits, investors are clearly willing to give these companies the benefit of the doubt. Those limits are, on the one hand, punitive treatment if they depart from the prevailing perception of them. On the other hand, the benefit of the doubt only goes so far: neither are likely to outperform dramatically in any given year.Yet 3M enjoys a very noticeable valuation premium over Honeywell. A higher dividend payout ratio - 52.9% versus 37.7% - and consistently higher margins across most of its businesses probably account for a lot of this. Honeywell has had some troubled history that, while in the relatively distant past, investors have not entirely forgotten. And I think that 3M, being even more diversified and consequently even less readily analyzable, receives even greater benefit of the doubt from investors than Honeywell.It is in this respect that, in the long run, a more focused Honeywell might achieve a higher valuation. Benefit of the doubt will never trump highly visible, strong earnings growth. If Honeywell's four divisions were firing on all cylinders, the aggregate valuation of each of them separately is likely to be higher than that assigned to the conglomeration of them. But over the course of a cycle the separately valued parts are unlikely to maintain a premium over the whole, which has demonstrated that it can use its diversity wisely. Honeywell may opportunistically divest itself of various activities: AdvanSix is not the only possible candidate for sale, as has been suggested elsewhere. But it is likely that the company will remain a conglomerate with big aerospace and materials components.[1] The statistical error in statistics such as R2 is high, so a series of 90 components is about as short as is statistically meaningful. Even so, it has a high standard error."
4076802,41741,2017-05-26T09:42:13-04:00,"Dan Loeb is taking on Honeywell.
        This comes after Trian Partners showed up at GE .
        Stacking the two industrial giants up - one clearly has more upside .","Activist investor Trian Partners has a stake in General Electric, (NYSE:GE) while Dan Loeb's Third Point has a stake in its counterpart, Honeywell (NYSE:HON). When it comes to who'll see the best returns, in their respective stocks, over the next few years - Loeb might well win this battle.I've talked about both activist targets in the past. For General Electric, the company is intriguing if it becomes apparent that Immelt is no longer fit for the job. For Honeywell, it's about giving the relatively new CEO a chance. But Loeb is hoping the $100 billion industrial giant, Honeywell, will spinoff its largest business - the aerospace division - and unlock $20 billion in value. Aerospace generates over a third of the company's annual revenues. The problem, as Loeb sees it, is that aerospace is a laggard with growth. Over the last five years, the aerospace average sales growth is less than 1% annually.The biggest part of that $20 billion value unlock will come from a valuation re-rating. Without the lagging aerospace business, Honeywell would trade more in line with industrial peers that don't have an aerospace business - i.e. Emerson (NYSE:EMR), 3M (NYSE:MMM), Rockwell (NYSE:ROK) etc. Combined, those rivals trade at 23 times next year's earnings, while Honeywell is stuck at 17 times.Honeywell has bought some timeHoneywell CEO Darius Adamczyk says the company is reviewing Third Point's proposal. They won't have a decision until the fall.However, I'm betting the decision will be to keep aerospace. CEO Adamcyzk has agreed that Honeywell needs change - more specifically, simplification. Yet, unlocking Loeb's $20 billion isn't as easy as spinoff. Many of the peers that Loeb uses in its valuation comparison are companies that have superior margins or growth in its other (non-aerospace) businesses. The bigger opportunity for Honeywell is to right-size its other businesses and margins.The likely path for Honeywell come the fall is to spinoff one of its other lower-margin business, including either the auto group and vehicle turbocharger operations or the UOP petrochemical business.By all accounts Honeywell will keep the aerospace business. It's one of its few businesses that will actually grow over the next few years - Honeywell expects aerospace to grow 3%-4% annually over the next five years, plus it's the company's largest revenue and cash generator. The likes of new aircraft demand, rising defense budgets and an overall rise in flight hours across the globe bode well for aerospace.It's invested a lot in aerospace, with aerospace R&D spending (as a percent of sales) double what its closest competitor shells out. The company could start to see a decent return on that investment in the coming years. And based on the chart, and Honeywell's solid 2% dividend yield, Loeb will likely have a tough time convincing other major Honeywell shareholders to back his proposal."
4081095,41741,2017-06-13T12:01:47-04:00,"Activist investor Dan Loeb is pushing for a spinoff of the aerospace business at Honeywell.
        The company will take until the fall to access the plan.
        However, HON shareholders have already voiced their concerns.","Honeywell (NYSE:HON) is the Dan Loeb and his activist hedge fund Third Point target. The company is quietly pushing back against Loeb's push to breakup the industrial company. As I mentioned last month, Honeywell will likely fend off the activist by pushing back against the aerospace unit spinoff. After all, it's in the company's best interest to keep this business and to reap the rewards of its 'investments.'Gaining momentum for Dan Loeb won't be easy either, as shares continue to hit new all-time highs.And Honeywell shareholders are already resisting calls for the breakup. Honeywell said it'd make a decision this fall on whether to consider a breakup. Honeywell Chairman David Cote has said that certain HON shareholders are already pushing back against Loeb's aerospace spinoff plan. The big thesis, Honeywell has invested a lot in the aerospace business over the past few years, if the company does the spinoff, current investors would miss out on these investments. Then there's the fact that some investors wouldn't be able to keep their Honeywell shares if the aerospace unit was spunoff.As Cote notes, ""That is a big part of what we're getting on investor reaction. 'Gee, I helped you invest all this money. Now you're going to split this off. Based on my ownership charter, I'm not going to be able to own that company anymore.""'The aerospace business is cyclical and a long-cycle business, so seeing the payoff takes time. Honeywell is rolling out broadband for aircraft internet service this year, just one of the Honeywell's new services that should start hitting the market in the interim. Then there's the potential for a turnaround in aircraft demand with rising defense budgets and an increase in flight hours.Honeywell needs to keep the aerospace business. Instead, the key catalyst will be an overhaul of the other lower-margin and underperforming businesses. I'd expect a spinoff of one of the lower-margin businesses like autos or petrochemicals before the aerospace unit. Dan Loeb says that spinning off the aerospace business unlocks $20 billion, but over the long-term, Honeywell can easily outperform that number with its aerospace investments."
4068004,24361,2017-05-02T16:04:45-04:00,"Honeywell's performance should look better as the year moves on, but right now, there is more chatter about whether the company should consider separating the aerospace business.There are numerous options for restructuring Honeywell's portfolio of assets, with the turbocharger, HBT distribution, advanced materials, and aerospace segments all possible targets for disposal and numerous potential acquisition targets.Honeywell shares are one of the more reasonably-priced options in a generally expensive industrial sector and sentiment could improve as the comps get better and management makes strategic portfolio decisions.","To hear some talk about Honeywell (NYSE:HON), you'd think this is a lousy business, never mind the solid margins and returns on capital. There are nits to pick with respect to organic revenue growth and free cash flow generation, I'll grant, but it's interesting to me to see what companies get a ""pass"" and what companies don't. Now with a new CEO in place, one who hasn't earned the benefit of the doubt from investors and analysts, there could be more pressure on Honeywell to remake the business in a more dramatic fashion.I don't know whether or not Honeywell will restructure itself in a major way, up to and including separating from the aerospace business, but management has at least validated it as a talking point in response to a letter from an activist investor. Relative to my cash flow expectations, Honeywell shares are trading at an implied return in that space between ""mid"" and ""high"" single digits, which isn't bad, and could still offer some upside as comps get easier and the company considers its strategic options.Not Great, But Better Than ExpectedHoneywell's first quarter was not exemplary compared to other industrials like 3M (NYSE:MMM), Dover (NYSE:DOV), and Parker-Hannifin (NYSE:PH), but the results were more on par with the likes of ABB (NYSE:ABB) and United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) and ahead of expectations. All things considered, it wasn't a bad quarter at a time when expectations seem to be running high in the sector.Revenue rose 2% on a core basis, but would have been up closer to 4% excluding the flat results in the Aerospace segment (where weak business jets weighed on results). The HBT and SPS segments saw 3% core growth, while PMT was up 5% on flat performance in process automation, 3% growth in UOP, and double-digit growth in Advanced Materials.Margins improved, with gross margin up close to two points and segment margin up about 70bp with better performance across the board.There were positive signs elsewhere in the report. Process orders were up 10%, while orders in the UOP business were up 15%. While the underlying trend in commercial aerospace aftermarket isn't superb, low-to-mid single-digit growth isn't bad and the comps get easier as the year goes on.Time To Shuffle The Deck?Honeywell's March investor meeting was a chance for new CEO Darius Adamczyk to take the stage and try to quell some of the rumblings around the company and the stock. Reading between the lines always has its drawbacks, but Adamczyk sounded more aggressive/amenable to looking to cull out underperforming segments, with ""underperforming"" perhaps also including those businesses that aren't strategic and can't be run all that much better than they presently are.What that will mean in practice remains to be seen. Honeywell's turbocharger business is a good business, quite competitive with BorgWarner (NYSE:BWA), Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, and IHI, but there's no real operating synergy as is (there may be scant synergies with the aerospace business, but not major ones). As I don't see Honeywell looking to expand further into other auto parts, spinning this business out could make sense (as an outright sale could create meaningful tax leakage).The HBT Distribution business could also be a target for disposal, and Honeywell management has been rumored to have looked at a disposal in the past. While there are some synergies here with the HBT Product business, the margins aren't great.Last and not least is the Advanced Materials business. Although Honeywell probably doesn't want to sell when the Solstice product is doing so well (and repaying past investments), I'm not sure this collection of flourine products, specialty fibers, and specialty electronics chemicals is really a core business for a company that talks about wanting to play a bigger role in automation and the convergence of hardware and software in the industrial space.I don't think there's any rush to sell, but I would note that specialty chemical companies often get pretty attractive multiples and this business could be a more interesting operator as a standalone entity (it could reinvest and/or expand its operations in ways that Honeywell presently won't).The bigger question is whether or not Honeywell wants to stay engaged in the aerospace business. The aerospace business has been a tricky one for Honeywell, as improving win rates haven't translated to better revenue growth and the company has actually lost share in a few places. A merger with United Technologies could have meaningfully changed the outlook for the business, but this could be another example of a potential spin-off where both parties do better apart than together.Time To Buy Again?Honeywell could deploy a significant amount of capital toward remaking its business mix, with or without raising capital by disposing of those aforementioned operations. Allegion (NYSE:ALLE) would meaningfully round out the company's building controls business, while Halma (OTCPK:HLMLY) would likewise build out its safety and detection capabilities. Spectris (OTCPK:SEPJY) would add valuable instrumentation capabilities (relevant to automation), and I've written before about the possible synergies in a deal for Meggitt (OTCPK:MEGGY) if Honeywell wants to build its aerospace business further.I'm more interested in whether Honeywell might take the plunge on a bid for Rockwell (NYSE:ROK). ABB has historically been the ""suitor of choice"" in the rumor mill for Rockwell, but ABB's recent acquisition of B+R likely takes a bid for Rockwell off the board. Schneider (OTCPK:SBGSY) has been rumored to have interest as well, but Rockwell's strengths seem to align best with Honeywell and Emerson (NYSE:EMR) and like ABB, Emerson has made other decisions with its M&A strategy. Rockwell would certainly fit with Honeywell's stated goals (including industrial software), but a deal would be expensive.The OpportunityAlthough I can follow the line(s) of reasoning that say Honeywell's aerospace business would do better as an independent company, I'm not really down on that business. Aerospace isn't contributing a lot of growth today, but the segment margins are healthy and growth should pick up in the coming years as design wins and new builds convert to aftermarket sales (where the real money is usually made).I'm expecting long-term revenue growth of around 4% from Honeywell, which is basically on par for what I expect from the likes of 3M, Dover, and ABB. I do think there are opportunities for the company to do better on margins and free cash flow conversion, and I expect the FCF margins to grow from a historical level in the high-single digits to the low-to-mid double digits over the next decade.The Bottom LineHoneywell shares are now about 10% above my fair value, but the implied total return from here isn't bad. On a relative basis, the shares do look a little undervalued and I think that's particularly true when factoring in the quality of the company and the options management has to create more value. All told, I'd still be a willing holder of Honeywell here and I'd likely consider buying on pullbacks."
4045059,65113,2017-02-11T02:35:46-05:00,"Honeywell International still has upside potential.While the business jet market has seen a decline, a rebounding energy sector holds promise for this company.4Q16 segment performance was strong.I take a bullish view on this company.","I have been optimistic on Honeywell International (NYSE:HON) for quite some time. When I last covered the stock back in August, HON was trading at $116 and has since rise to $120.I still see value remaining in the stock as the market seems to be taking a somewhat risk-averse approach to Honeywell International - investors might well be reserved of investing heavily in the stock at this time given its exposure to oil and gas prices, which have not fully recovered. Moreover, weakness in the business jet sector might also be giving potential investors second thoughts.However, Honeywell International delivered a very strong fourth quarter from a margin perspective, even if sales of certain segments were down. The acquisition of Intelligrated, which I had anticipated would be a significant opportunity for Honeywell to expand into the supply chain management industry, has shown higher than expected performance - which has helped contribute to a 14.3% increase in margin in the Sensing & Productivity Solutions segment. Moreover, Segment Results for 4Q 2016 were highly encouraging:Source: Honeywell 4Q 2016 Earnings ReleaseAs I mentioned, with this level of performance - there is a good chance that we will continue to see further upside from here. With improving sentiment in the O&G and construction sectors, the company is in a good position to grow its key business segments. While business jet weakness has persisted, we see that this has not affected the company's overall performance on a holistic basis, and improving energy sales are likely to give the company a boost going forward.Moreover, the company continues to trade at relatively attractive valuations compared to its peers on both earnings and free cash flow basis, while having shown the most growth in these metrics over the past five years.EarningsPrice to EarningsFree Cash FlowPrice to Free Cash FlowTo conclude, I see hesitance on this stock as an opportunity to exploit uncaptured value, from a company that is set to see significant upside from an improving energy sector, as well as improving margins across the business as a whole."
4057639,97486,2017-03-23T20:57:26-04:00,"Honeywell has been an excellent industrial performer for many years, but 2016 was more a solid than spectacular year for the company.2017 represents a year of a number of changes including, hopefully, a return to strong performances, especially regarding margins and FCF figures.The company remains a high-quality business with a fairly generous, strong and growing dividend and a fair valuation.","Earlier in 2016, I was following Honeywell (NYSE:HON) far more closely than I have done in the latter part of the year. Largely, this was because my portfolio saw a number of industrial stocks join its ranks, and so, I have started following other industry peers less closely. Nonetheless, after the company released its FY2016 results back in late January and given Q1 2017's results are fast approaching, I thought it high time to take another look at this industrial giant.2017 will look a different year to 2016. Long-term CEO David Cote is moving aside after 15 years at the helm to be replaced by Darius Adamczyk. The company has also restructured the business from the previous segments into four new ones (of which two, Aerospace and Performance Materials & Technologies, have remained unchanged). What remains the case is that Aerospace is the largest segment for the business. The remainder is fairly evenly shared amongst the other three, as shown in the chart below:Organic revenue remains fairly lackluster across the segments, however:And this has been the case for the entirety of 2016, after a comparatively more impressive organic performance in 2015:Reported growth was, however, chiefly fuelled by acquisitions. Honeywell has been a fairly consistent net acquirer of companies for most of its life. Yet, in the last couple of years, this has accelerated considerably:Although this is entirely acceptable over the short term, eventually, Honeywell needs to be able to prove that its mature business as well as those fresh acquisitions can start to produce consistent organic growth.Cash FlowOf course, Honeywell remains attractively cash generative. It is chiefly for this reason that the company's rather exaggerated acquisition record is something more to be watched for long-term progress than worried about for long-term prospects.Such is the level of FCF generation in recent years that it has generally managed to continue to acquire businesses, whilst simultaneously expanding shareholder returns without relying too much upon leverage (though, as we will see later, the company has leaned on debt to some extent):Nice-looking growth since the 2011 FCF nadir, certainly. Yet, its improving FCF generation efficiency did take a little hit in 2016 compared to 2015.This becomes clear when we look at Honeywell's CROIC, or cash return on invested capital. Calculated by dividing the FCF by total capital invested (that is, total debt and shareholders' equity), it tells us just how much FCF a company generates for each dollar of capital invested in the business. In Honeywell's case, despite a fall in 2016, it remains a compellingly high 12.5%:This remains comfortably ahead of the 10% target, which I consider a particularly attractive CROIC. Yet, it is clear that part of this drop in CROIC is due to the company's acquisition program (boosting equity and debt levels) alongside struggling underlying growth progress.Debt is a particularly interesting one, just as I highlighted earlier, as this has impacted upon CROIC performance in recent years.Debt LevelsDebt levels have been growing fast in recent years. In particular in 2015 and 2016, when Honeywell's net acquisition level was particularly elevated, debt has grown to over twice that seen a decade ago:With equity levels not exactly keeping pace with this growth since 2015, naturally its debt-to-equity levels have also lifted significantly too:As it happens, Honeywell's debt-to-equity level is far from the worst out there. It will, however, be interesting to see what direction Adamczyk takes the company on from an acquisition and debt perspective in the future.Nonetheless, the debt situation is perfectly fine as it stands. For instance, David Cote highlighted in the company's Q4 2016 results that:That is nice to hear. What's more, despite the rapid growth in debt in recent years, it still remains a very well-covered level of total debt from an FCF perspective:With an FCF-to-Debt ratio of nearly 28%, it means that the company could - theoretically, at least - repay its debt from FCF alone in a little over three and a half years.Shareholders' YieldInvestors have also benefited from Honeywell's cash flow record in recent years. Through a combination of share buybacks and dividends, the company has distributed a fairly impressive shareholders' yield over the last few years (especially in 2015 and 2016):More impressive still is that this has largely remained within the bounds of the company's FCF generation record:Even after the recent share price gains Honeywell has seen, the dividend yield has still stayed around the 2% mark. With its recent record of sticky cash flow and sizeable dividend hikes, it is little wonder that analysts believe another 10% annualised dividend growth can be expected over the next two years:This suggests a two-year forward yield around the 2.3% mark, which looks set to continue to be more than twice covered by FCF (using my FCF predictions, which, as we will cover in a moment, are more conservative than the company's own).All told, this suggests Honeywell should remain a pretty generous company with regard to investor returns.Cash Flow PredictionsDespite this, it is abundantly clear that Honeywell is asking an awful lot of its cash flow. Even though it may be an impressively cash generative business, the company is still asking it to service its sizeable acquisitions, buybacks and dividends all at once. As the growing debt levels in the last couple of years have shown, it is at present struggling to do just that, despite impressive levels of cash generation.Cash flow predictions are, therefore, important to keep an eye on going forward. For 2016, Honeywell's FCF actually came in lower than its (and my) predictions for the year. Whilst the company retained the belief that between $4.6 and $4.8 billion would enter its coffers across the whole year, only $4.4 billion actually did so. Hardly terrible, of course. Yet, it does make me look at the company's $4.6-4.7 billion FCF prediction for 2017 a little closer.Part of the reason for 2016 slightly falling short of its predictions is reflected in the flat FCF-to-Revenue performance:Since 2011, the company has seen it progressively expand, which helped to turbocharge FCF growth. In 2016, this expansion stopped. Interestingly, with Honeywell currently at 11.2% FCF-to-Revenue, and comparing it to the company's performance over the last decade, it may be that this is the fullest extent to which it can expand FCF conversion from revenue at present.Assuming an FCF-to-Revenue figure of around 11% for the next couple of years and using revenue predictions of around a 1.75% annualised growth over the next couple of years suggests the FCF may come out closer to $4.35 and $4.5 billion for 2017 and 2018, respectively.Nonetheless, Honeywell may well be right to predict higher FCF in 2017 than based on historical performance. Chiefly, this revolves around the company's targeted margin gains. After progressively expanding margins for several years, 2016 saw them stuttering:(Data sources: Company Quarterly Reports and Q4 2016 Results Presentation)However, Honeywell expects to be able to expand margins to over 19% - specifically between 19% and 19.4% - in 2017. That is perhaps ambitious on the face of it. Yet, a large part of its success will hinge on what any future acquisitions do to margins (for instance, 2016 would have seen margins sit at 18.9% instead of 18.3% if no M&A activity had occurred). For me, this is something to watch closely as the year unfolds.ValuationBack in April 2016 (when organic revenue figures were looking healthier), I estimated a fair value for the company at a little over $127. Since then, the share price has indeed lifted to just shy of that figure:Consequently, based on my previous assessment, right now Honeywell is fairly valued, having closed up the 10% discount. So the real question is whether or not my fair value figure emerges any differently than what it was back then. As it happens, running my three-part valuation method against Honeywell today does not lead to much in the way of fair valuation movement.Using my own FCF predictions rather than the company's own slightly more generous ones throws off a fair value of $125.50. Using Honeywell's predictions, however, does see the fair value just about cross the $128 mark. This seems a reasonable fair value range for the company today. As such, there still appears to be a very modest scope for further share price gains over the short term. Should Honeywell be able to extract some organic growth again, I think there is plenty of potential for further gains in its valuation, however. Yet, I suspect we would have to see a sustained period of genuine organic growth before that could occur. In the meantime, Honeywell looks fairly valued with a decent dividend yield and good dividend growth prospects.ConclusionThe company clearly found 2016 a tough year on the organic growth front. With margin expansion also slowing, its full-year results were perhaps only ever going to appear solid rather than spectacular. Nonetheless, its high-quality, cash-generative reputation remains very much intact, even if the company continues to place a lot of demands on that cash flow in regard to acquisitions and shareholders' returns.Judging from its own guidance for 2017, this year looks likely to be equally challenging:(Source: Q4 2016 Results Presentation)Nonetheless, if margin improvements can help shift FCF levels higher still, as the company believes, Honeywell should be able to continue to handle the immense demands on its FCF without having to continue to build debt levels. As noted earlier, however, the company continues to have a strong balance sheet which could easily handle further debt builds in the short term.Right now, Honeywell continues to look like a particularly high-quality cyclical play in an investing environment which is becoming increasingly welcoming to cyclical stocks. Risks remain, of course, yet Adamczyk is inheriting a company which still has plenty of growth levers to pull (not least of all, acquisitions, which it has historically proven very adept at choosing and integrating well). In the meantime, Honeywell continues to interest me around what I see as a fair value share price. With its safe, growing and fairly generous dividend yield as well, this is even more true.NotesAll graphs, tables and the calculations contained within them were created by the author unless otherwise noted.

4052121,79675,2017-03-05T04:52:12-05:00,"The company's incoming CEO presented at Honeywell's 2017 Investor Conference.
        I will focus on the two key priorities that will create the most shareholder value in 2017 and beyond.
        Honeywell is a long-term buy at today's price.","During Honeywell's (NYSE:HON) 2017 Investor Conference, the company's management team reaffirmed guidance for both Q1 2017 (adjusted EPS of $1.60-$1.64) and for full-year 2017 ($6.85-$7.10). Some pundits previously expressed concerns over Honeywell's long-term growth story, but I believe that management put these concerns to bed by again confirming that the company is expecting to report mid-single digit earnings growth in the current year, after the company just reported high single digit earnings growth in 2016.In addition to reaffirming the guidance for impressive earnings growth, the incoming CEO, Mr. Darius Adamczyk, communicated his four key priorities to shareholders and the financial community.(Source: 2017 Investor Conference Presentation)Investors should be encouraged about Honeywell's anticipated earnings growth for 2017, but, in my opinion, the most important takeaway from the investor conference is the fact that management has a well-defined long-term plan to create a tremendous amount of shareholder value for many years to come. To this point, the two key priorities that have the potential to create the most shareholder value through 2019, in my opinion, are: (1) Honeywell becoming a software-industrial company and (2) management aggressively deploying capital.1. Become A Software-Industrial CompanyMr. Adamczyk is currently servicing as the company's Chief Operating Officer and he will take over for Mr. David Cote as CEO on March 31, 2017. Mr. Adamczyk is being touted as the ""software guy"" so it makes sense that he spent most of his time during the conference highlighting the impact that digital will have on Honeywell and its businesses.(Image Source)The common theme throughout the presentation was the impact that software will have on most (if not all) of Honeywell's businesses, as the company is already guiding for double-digit growth in stand-alone software sales for the current year. Similar to General Electric's (NYSE:GE) Predix platform, Honeywell is putting a lot of time and effort in establishing itself as the go-to provider for industrial connected offerings by heavily investing in the Sentience platform. Also similar to GE, Honeywell is already widely viewed as a leader in the Industrial Internet of Things, or IIoT, industry.It is well-documented that I am a long-term bull on GE's digital business (see here for a recent article), but I believe that there is room for more than one winner in this space. For example, Accenture (NYSE:ACN) conservatively estimates that IIoT spending will reach $500b by 2020, which is tremendous growth from the estimated $20b spent in 2012. I believe that the changing industrial-digital space has the potential to be the next big thing, so there is a real market opportunity for Honeywell to significantly grow its business over the next decade.2. More Aggressive Capital DeploymentThis company has been able to outperform its peers over the last five years and the management team expects for more of the same in the years ahead.Not only does Honeywell have well-established businesses in key growth industries but management also intends to aggressively deploy capital in order to build on the company's already strong foundation. The company's deployment approach includes domestic and foreign mergers & acquisitions (""M&A"") in addition to buybacks and dividend increases.On the conservative side (i.e. without factoring in tax reform), Honeywell anticipates to return $6b to shareholders in the form of dividends and another $6b in the form of share repurchases and/or U.S. based acquisitions. Additionally, the company plans to deploy another $12b of capital towards non-U.S. based acquisitions over the next three years. To put these numbers into context, Honeywell spent ~$1.9b in dividends payments and ~$2b in share repurchases in 2016.As I discussed in this article, Honeywell will be a big beneficiary to any type of pro-business tax reform. It is still too early to know how President Trump's policies will eventually shake out, but any positive momentum toward enacting tax reform should viewed as a positive development for Honeywell.Disclosure: All images are from Honeywell's 2017 Investor Conference (linked above), unless specified otherwise.Bottom LineThe financial community liked what they heard from management during Honeywell's 2017 Investor Conference, as shown by the recent analyst upgrades, but I believe that 2017 may a break out year for this storied company. Mr. David Cote will be missed, especially by long-term HON shareholders, but it appears that Mr. Darius Adamczyk may be the right guy for this company in today's environment. The digital space will be the focus for Honeywell and most other industrial companies over the next few decades so promoting someone with experience in this area is a plus, in my opinion.Moreover, Honeywell is focused on aggressively returning capital to shareholders while also focusing on small tuck-in acquisitions, which has been a winning combo for this company for many years. You will likely not get rich by holding Honeywell shares in 2017 but I believe that the company's outperformance should continue through at least 2019. There is a lot to like about Honeywell's long-term business prospects so, in my opinion, long-term investors should treat any pullbacks as buying opportunities.Full Disclosure: I have a full HON position in my R.I.P. Portfolio but I have no plans to sell, or add to, my position in the near future.If you found this article to be informative and would like to hear more about this company or any other company that I analyze, please consider hitting the ""Follow"" button above.Disclaimer: This article is not a recommendation to buy or sell any stock mentioned.

4065904,79675,2017-04-27T01:40:53-04:00,"Honeywell reported impressive Q1 2017 results that beat the top- and bottom-line estimates.Additionally, the company raised the full-year 2017 guidance by $0.05.Honeywell is a long-term buy at today's price.","On April 21, 2017, Honeywell (NYSE:HON) reported Q1 2017 financial results that beat the top- and bottom-line analyst estimates, as the company reported adjusted EPS of $1.71 on revenues of $9.5b. In addition to reporting strong Q1 2017 results, Honeywell's management team also increased the company's full-year 2017 EPS guidance to $6.90-$7.10 (an increase of $0.05 on the low-end).Honeywell's Q1 2017 beat and raise were well-received by the market, as HON shares are up ~6% over the last five days.(Source: Nasdaq)Honeywell's stock is currently sitting right under its 52-week high so investors may now be asking themselves if this industrial conglomerate is still worthy of investment dollars. In my opinion, Honeywell is obviously not as attractively valued as it was in late October 2016 - I recommended for investors to purchase shares while they were trading around $110 as a result of the pullback that was created by management's guidance blunder. But I still believe that Honeywell is a buy at today's price based on the company's long-term business prospects that are in place.(Image Source)Q1 2017 Results, Good From Top To BottomHoneywell had a strong start to 2017, as all operating segments contributed to the impressive Q1 consolidated results. For the quarter, the company reported growth across the board, i.e. sales, segment margin, EPS, and free cash flow (""FCF"").The sales and EPS growth were better-than-expected, but the company's most impressive quarterly feat, in my opinion, was the strong growth reported in segment margins and FCF, especially after considering General Electric's (NYSE:GE) poor Q1 2017 results for these same two metrics.All operating segments reported margin expansion for the quarter but the Performance Material and Technologies (""PMT"") segment lead the charge with margins up 260bps.PMT's expansion in margins was largely driven by an uptick in productivity but management also mentioned during the conference call that the 2016 spin-off of the resins and chemicals business had a positive impact on the YoY comparison.Honeywell's significant YoY FCF growth is a direct result of a renewed focus throughout the company on improving its working capital performance. The 6x YoY improvement in FCF is impressive, but it is even more encouraging that management still anticipates further improvements to made over the next three quarters.The new CEO, Darious Adamczyk, has been laser focused on improving Honeywell's margin profile and FCF generation prospects and it seems like he already has this company heading in the right direction. Furthermore, management mentioned that the company's prior year productivity and restructuring initiatives are already starting to bear fruit so this should bode well for Honeywell (and its shareholders) through 2017 and beyond.Expect For More Of The Same Over The Next Three QuartersAs mentioned above, management lifted the low-end of the full-year 2017 EPS guidance but the company also did a great job at helping the financial community establish expectations for several other metrics.The guidance shows that management still expects this company to face headwinds in 2017, as organic sales are only projected to be up slightly. But it is important to note that Honeywell will be in a great position from a cost structure standpoint if these estimates are achieved. To put Honeywell's margins into context, GE's full-year 2016 industrial operating margins were well-below 17% so it would be a positive development, in my opinion, for Honeywell to achieve even the low-end of the guidance (19%).Honeywell is well-positioned in today's environment so I believe that the company should be able to create a tremendous amount of shareholder value over the next two-to-three years, even before trying to factor in the potential benefits of President Trump's recently released tax plan. Plus, investors are still able to pick up HON shares at a reasonable valuation, even after the recent run-up in the company's stock price.HON PE Ratio (Forward) data by YChartsMoreover, Honeywell has the necessary wiggle room to increase its dividend for years to come so investors should not be scared off by the company's low dividend yield.HON Dividend Yield (NYSE:TTM) data by YChartsBottom LineI am more bullish on Honeywell after reviewing the Q1 results and, as I described in this article, 2017 has the potential to be a breakout year for this great company. Investors should not expect to get rich off of HON shares in 2017 (or 2018) but Honeywell's long-term growth story is definitely still intact. In addition, Mr. Adamczyk will have a real opportunity to return a significant amount of capital to shareholders over the next few years.Honeywell has been (and will continue to be) a best-of-breed industrial company so, in my opinion, long-term investors should treat any pullbacks as buying opportunities.Full Disclosure: I have a full Honeywell position in my R.I.P.

4067262,41741,2017-04-30T22:36:26-04:00,"Dan Loeb wants to break up the $100 billion company because it trades at a slight discount to industrial peers.However, that looks to be a premature move considering HON is one of the best operators in the industrial space.Instead, it might be more beneficial for HON shareholders and management to give its new CEO a chance.","Honeywell (NYSE:HON) is the $100 billion market cap industrial conglomerate that Dan Loeb and his Third Point activist hedge fund wants to break up. Honeywell is a maker of HVAC control systems and other industrial products and has proved itself an efficient operator through the years. Its margins are above many other industrial operators, leaving a breakup as the only reasonable thesis that Loeb can put forth. With that, there could be $20 billion upside if the spinoff came to fruition - according to Loeb.In Dan Loeb's 1Q investor letter, he praised Honeywell for doing all the right things, from acquisitions to an effective turnaround to capital allocation. Compared to the S&P 500, Honeywell has done great. But relative to ""industrial peers,"" Loeb thinks more can be done.Now, for Loeb's big thesis, he notes: ""Third Point believes that a separation of the Aerospace unit via a spin off transaction would result in a sustained increase in shareholder value in excess of $20 billion. Spinning off Aerospace would transform Honeywell into an industrial growth company with a focus on automation and productivity.""In terms of valuation, Honeywell trades at 17x forward earnings, which Loeb contends is a hefty discount to its peer base - which includes Emerson Electric (NYSE:EMR), 3M (NYSE:MMM), Illinois Tool Works (NYSE:ITW) and Rockwell Automation (NYSE:ROK). Compared to that peer group, Honeywell is cheap - but not enough to justify spinning off the aerospace business. Honeywell has not historically traded at a discount; this is just a near-term issue. Thus, jumping to a spinoff seems premature. Does this chart scream ""break me up""?The thesis.Loeb wants to spin off the Honeywell aerospace business into its own public entity. Instead, if Honeywell does have interest in separating the aerospace business, the more beneficial move could be merging it with another player in the aerospace field - possibly B/E Aerospace (BEAV).Or even a spinoff of one of its other divisions, perhaps its HVAC business, which could be merged with United Tech's HVAC business and run as a standalone company. Or a potential push to get Honeywell to make a large transitional acquisition. Note that it failed to merge with fellow industrial giant United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) last year. Regardless, there are better opportunities for Honeywell, versus spinning off one of its highest margin businesses. Plus, some of its other businesses don't make sense without the aerospace arm.The company has done well in its focus on profitability and consistent earnings growth. In fact, its stock price has outperformed its major peers for the last half decade. Shares of Honeywell are up 114% in the last five years, while General Electric and Danaher (NYSE:DHR) have managed just half that return.Breakups in the industrial space are nothing new. It's somewhat of a right of passage once companies start underperforming. The likes of Tyco (TYC), Ingersoll-Rand (NYSE:IR), Danaher and ITT (NYSE:ITT) have all gone through the industrial breakup process. However, it might be too early for Honeywell. There are other industrial companies in much worse shape. Hopefully, Loeb takes a more passive approach and lets this industrial leader do its job. And at least gives relatively new CEO - Darius Adamczyk - who took over last month, a chance to close the new, and still small, gap in valuation relative to peers. The aerospace business has struggled of late, but it's a minor setback relative to the interim weakness in business jet demand. Thus, Honeywell will likely look to double down on aerospace and the opportunities it has in software for this business instead of spinning it off."
4065068,39011,2017-04-25T15:16:09-04:00,"HON produced a very strong Q1 report.That is more than GE can say during the same time period.With HON's sales and margins moving in the right direction, it looks poised to continue to win.","I've long thought Honeywell (NYSE:HON) to be perhaps the best industrial money can buy. After GE (NYSE:GE) disappointed me with its plan to divest Capital and attempt to buy back stock, I became a Honeywell man after largely ignoring the stock for years. However, I've come to see the light and with results continuing to come through like Q1's report that featured yet another guidance raise, I'm not going back anytime soon. Honeywell seems to be an underappreciated gem - if there is such a thing for a $100B company - and Q1 has done nothing but bolster the bull position in my view.Honeywell has been better than GE for the past couple of years because it has been able to do two things that GE has not. Those two things are growing sales at a meaningful rate and improving margins and while that sounds simple enough, it is the honest truth. GE's been mired in a transition to a pure industrial that isn't really going all that well while Honeywell has continued to chug along unabated. GE's dreadful Q1 and Honeywell's rather terrific Q1 are further evidence of that.Total sales were flat in Q1 on a reported basis but on an organic basis, it was rather much better at +2%. The difference between the two is a combination of acquisitions, divestitures and currency translation, but on the whole, HON's segments performed very well. The only segment that didn't produce a sales increase was Aerospace and it was flat against +3% for Home and Building, +5% for Performance Materials and +3% for Safety and Productivity. More so than the headline revenue number, these results give you an idea of just how hot Honeywell is right now and the thing is, this isn't new. These kinds of results have been compounding over time and it is why the stock is at new highs again. Honeywell is doing what other industrials are struggling to do and that is grow in this environment.But the growth doesn't stop with revenue; margins are an even bigger story. Segment margins on the whole were up 70bps against last year's Q1 while each of its businesses contributed. Aerospace was up 90bps, Home and Building was up 70bps, Performance Materials was up a staggering 260bps and Safety and Productivity was up 50bps. These numbers are tremendously bullish and it means that, even after a strong 2016 for margins, the party hasn't ended and there are even brighter days ahead for margins. Honeywell's steady revenue growth is certainly a reason why it's a winner but margins are far more important to the bull case and Q1 is further evidence it isn't slowing down in the least. As Honeywell continues to fine tune its business mix, I expect margins will continue to rise over time and boost EPS well in excess of the rate of revenue growth, as we saw in Q1. All of Honeywell's margin growth (and then some) came from reductions in the cost of delivering goods and services as SG&A expenses were up about 5%. I don't like money being spent on SG&A anymore than the next guy but at the same time, I take solace in the fact that SG&A that clearly isn't optimized can leave the door open for further margin gains down the road. I wouldn't say that's likely anytime in the near future but it is something to keep an eye on for certain.At just over 18 times this year's earnings Honeywell is still relatively cheap, which is kind of amazing considering how good it has been for years. Admittedly, the yield isn't that great and it isn't like it is scorching higher in terms of earnings growth. But this company has produced time and again and that is good enough for me. With high single-digit earnings growth for years to come, 18 times earnings looks reasonable to me and particularly, in light of all the expensive stocks that are floating around these days, GE included. Honeywell is easily the superior choice given that it isn't in the middle of an expensive and jumbled turnaround effort, its sales continue to grow and its margins are tremendous and moving higher. That makes Honeywell the best large industrial in the market right now and after Q1, the future is brighter than ever as Honeywell wins in a tough environment."
4041086,24361,2017-01-31T13:05:04-05:00,"Honeywell's fourth-quarter results weren't stellar, but they weren't meaningfully worse than its peer group's and there are signs of improvement in several important end-markets.Pivoting toward the new CEO's vision of Honeywell as a ""software-industrial"" company will take time, but IoT and automation can be meaningful drivers and there is meaningful M&A capacity.Honeywell doesn't look remarkably undervalued on an absolute basis, but mid-single-digit growth can support a double-digit total annual return from here.","Honeywell (NYSE:HON) hasn't done badly since I last wrote about this conglomerate. In fact, among what I'd consider to be its peer group (including names like 3M (NYSE:MMM), GE (NYSE:GE), Dover (NYSE:DOV) and so on), Honeywell has done okay, with a nearly 10% improvement in its share price. That's not as good as the double-digit improvements at Illinois Tool Works (NYSE:ITW) or Dover, but it's not exactly a disgrace either.Honeywell doesn't have the same upside to a near-term turnaround in the industrial economy that I would expect from ITW or Dover, but it is nevertheless well-positioned for long-term growth trends like automation, civil aerospace, industrial software and specialty chemicals. What's more, there's more than the normal level of negative chatter around Honeywell, with investors fretting about the CEO change and an entrenched (although not really supported, in my opinion) belief that Honeywell has underinvested in R&D and innovation. Provided that Honeywell can deliver mid-single-digit growth over the long term, I think a double-digit total return is possible from here, and I think Honeywell is still worth consideration as a potential buy.Not A Great Close To 2016… But Not The WorstHoneywell's fourth-quarter results weren't great, but then the same could be said of 3M and GE for various reasons, among others, so it's not as though Honeywell was notably worse than the norm.Revenue was down 1% on a core basis, with both the Aerospace and Safety and Productivity Solutions segments down 5%, Home and Building Tech up 2%, and Performance Materials and Tech up 5%. The commercial aerospace original equipment business continues to take a thumping (down 12%) from weaker business jets and incentives, while the aftermarket business was up about 3. While Honeywell lacks the same magnitude of exposure to the auto market as 3M and Illinois Tool Works, the company's turbocharger business is doing quite well. As far as other components go, UOP remains weak due to lower gas processing volumes, but Solstice continues to see strong demand. Process automation remains weak, which is not surprising at this point in the cycle.Honeywell saw a little leverage on the gross margin line, and management to eke out a small improvement in segment profits (up 1%), with double-digit growth in three of the four segments offset by a high teens decline in Aerospace.2017 Likely Won't Be The Big TurnManagement tempered guidance going into 2017 back in December, and didn't see fit to alter that in a meaningful way after the fourth-quarter earnings. While that mid-December revision was negative, it was probably a good move to clear the deck for the new incoming CEO; Honeywell is certainly not the only company that disappointed the Street in 2016 with lower-than-expected revenue, but it seems to be sticking with sell-side analysts as a point of contention/irritation moreso than for many of its peers.In any case, I don't think 2017 is going to be a banner year for the company. The business jet business is expected to be down double-digits, and that's a meaningful chunk (about 20%) of the aerospace segment. What's more, incentives will continue to weigh on the commercial OE business and won't let up meaningfully until 2018 - as a reminder, these incentives are basically ""give backs"" that component suppliers like Honeywell, United Technologies (NYSE:UTX), and GE surrender to the major aircraft companies to get placed on new platforms, with the idea being that the future revenue from aftermarket parts more than compensates them for it.Non-residential construction appears to be slowing, which could be an incremental headwind for the HBT business. The oil/gas and petrochemical sectors do seem to be recovering, but Honeywell is more leveraged to downstream projects and those are lagging the upstream recovery.But Look Down The Road A Bit...I don't mean to suggest that 2017 will be awful. The UOP business should start to recover, Solstice should see ongoing demand growth, and there could be upside in areas like defense, turbochargers and building retrofits. But I don't think you buy Honeywell today because you think 2017 is going to be significantly stronger than expected.As I see it, the appeal with Honeywell is in the ongoing transformation of the business. The incoming CEO has made it clear that he wants to make Honeywell a ""software-industrial"" company. GE has already taken some significant steps in this direction, and Rockwell (NYSE:ROK) has done quite well for itself with industrial-oriented software. What's more, it's not something that companies like Dover, 3M, or ITW are pursuing to any significant degree. Although Honeywell doesn't have a great reputation with respect to R&D, with more than a few sell-side analysts suggesting they underspend on R&D to perk up margins, the actual spending comparisons with companies like 3M don't really support all the grief Honeywell takes on that particular issue.Longer term, the ramp-up in civil aerospace deliveries (and the follow-on demand for parts) should be good for the aerospace segment, and Honeywell has shown that it can leverage its specialty chemical capabilities to develop and launch innovative products. I also believe Honeywell has legitimate reasons to be bullish about the future of IoT within automation. While I have often written that I think too much has been made of IoT, Honeywell happens to line up well with those areas where I do believe IoT makes sense (commercial building automation (like HVAC and security), process automation, warehouse automation, etc.).I'd also note that Honeywell has the financial wherewithal to be more active in M&A. While the indications at this point are that the company is looking for bolt-on deals, I think they have to say that - the market didn't like it when the company expressed interest in United Technologies, so I believe management is going to be tight-lipped about the potential for large-scale M&A … even though I do think there are multiple potential targets in the $5 billion to $10 billion range that would be appealing, and a larger deal for Rockwell could make sense.The OpportunityLike 3M, I don't see Honeywell as a huge beneficiary of the likely and/or possible policy changes from the new administration in Washington. A low corporate tax rate would help (and Honeywell is a net exporter), but losing/reducing the deductibility of interest would pinch, as would a stronger dollar. Like 3M, I don't see Honeywell as a big beneficiary of large-scale infrastructure spending initiatives.Not much has changed in my fundamental view of Honeywell - 2017 won't likely be a stellar year, but it should be one where the quarters see momentum building toward a stronger 2018 and beyond. Longer term, I think Honeywell can deliver free cash flow growth on the higher end of ""mid-single-digits,"" supporting a double-digit total annual return.The Bottom LineHoneywell's cheapness is more relative than absolute, but I do think the total implied return is still good enough to consider this name for long-term portfolios. Sentiment on Honeywell still seems to be more negative than the actual results would support, so perhaps this is a story that can rerate higher as new management delivers the goods and restores investor confidence in this conglomerate."
4032067,102581,2016-12-21T16:49:47-05:00,"Margin improvements are likely to be slow going forward.
        End-market weakness for several businesses could potentially offset growth in other areas.
        Valuations appear to be stretched.","Honeywell (NYSE:HON) has been on a post-election roll off late and not even a disappointing 2017 earnings outlook has managed to dampen its enthusiasm. To be honest, I would have bought the dip even with speculative intentions, had it managed to stay that way for a tad longer than it did. I looked at the numbers, and looking at the pre-market felt the stock was being punished excessively much like the reaction to its business update on October 7. At current prices however, I see diminished benefits if any, from accumulating the stock. I would keep my existing holdings for the dividend but wouldn't expect a lot of returns from capital gains.Benefits from margin improvements are drawing to a closeAfter its botched attempts to merge with General Electric in the early 2000s, Honeywell has largely been on the right track. It integrated several meaningful acquisitions and by fine-tuning productivity under the Honeywell Operating System, the organization became quite nimble. Due to margin improvements, the company's earnings increased dramatically even as sales grew at a compounded annual growth rate of just ~2% (including acquisitions) since 2006. However, after several years of operating margin improvements, the company's margin base is now quite high. Therefore, upcoming improvements from the rollout of HOS Gold are likely to be slow and marginal.End-market weaknessThere are question marks over whether the aggravated weakness in some of the end-markets are a sign of long term stagnation or instances of a one-year dip. For example, the company does not see a case for inflection in the business jet market even in 2017. Elsewhere, players such as Bombardier have cut projections for 10 year deliveries by 700 jets from 9,000 to 8,300. And there are precedents to this trend. Total business jet shipments were 1,313 in 2008 and 870 in 2009 based on figures published by General Aviation Manufacturers Association. Since then total annual shipments have never crossed the 800 shipment mark. In the helicopter business housed in the Defense & Space unit, sales have suffered due to ongoing weakness in the oil & gas industry. These helicopters are used to ferry people and equipment to distant oil platforms. Even here I do not see industry conditions reversing to pre-2014 levels at least in the next couple of years.Potential in the company's new productsThe company repeatedly drums up its software presence in earnings calls and conferences. Based on the figures provided in its investor conference in March this year, standalone software sales were responsible for roughly $1 billion in sales in 2015. Software sales in most segments are expected to grow in double digits through 2020. Management estimates also peg sales from the solstice program extending to $1 billion in 2020, $600 million higher than the sales estimate for 2016. That's a compounded annual growth rate of 20%. Therefore it's not all bad news for the company but some of the software end-markets especially in building automation are expected to be very competitive.ValuationsSeveral industrial stocks have seen their multiples expand post Trump's election. Much of it is on account of talks related to tax breaks and infrastructure spending. How exactly this is likely to pan out in Honeywell's favor is anyone's guess. For now I know that discount rates are increasing and growth rates are declining. Since both these factors inversely impact valuations, I am a little wary about the high prices some of these stocks are sitting on right now."

        Honeywell is still expected to report Q4 2016 earnings that are in line with the previously communicated EPS guidance.
        Honeywell is a long-term buy at today's price.","Honeywell (NYSE:HON) was in the news late last week for the company's so-called ""downbeat"" Q4 2016 guidance. As described in this article, Honeywell is now expected to report Q4 2016 and full-year 2017 results that are below analyst estimates:On December 16, 2016, HON shares were down by almost 10 points in pre-market trading after the company released this updated guidance, but the stock actually ended up finishing the day flat (up 0.03%). Therefore, I believe that the market was trying to tell investors that all is well with this company, even if the upcoming earnings are impacted by short-term headwinds.(Source)The Q4 2016 Guidance, Downbeat Or In Line With Expectations?Management guided for Honeywell to report Q4 2016 EPS of $1.74, which is at the low end of the previously communicated EPS target of $1.74-$1.78. I covered Honeywell's Q4 2016 and full-year 2017 guidance in this article (posted in mid-October 2016), and I want to stress the fact that not only is the updated guidance still within the previously communicated EPS range but, more importantly, this company will achieve double-digit YoY earnings growth if the ""low"" $1.74 target is met.(Source: Honeywell's Updated Guidance, December 16, 2016)There is no denying that Honeywell will have to contend with short-term headwinds throughout the remainder of 2016 and well into 2017, but I believe that the company's long-term story is still intact. Let's not forget that Honeywell is still expected to grow earnings by double-digit figures in the upcoming year and this is after the company has been able to report impressive earnings growth throughout 2016. Additionally, there are potential catalyst that could help propel the stock price higher over the next three-to-five years.Will Honeywell Be ""Trumped"" (In A Good Way)?There is a lot of uncertainty related to how president-elect Donald J. Trump's anticipated policies will impact the economy, and more specifically, Honeywell and the other industrial conglomerates, but the one thing that is for sure going to happen is major change will be occurring. If Mr. Trump follows through on some of his campaign promises, there are two significant policy changes --(1) infrastructure spending and (2) lower taxes --that will play out as long-term catalysts for Honeywell. Mr. Trump is quoted as saying that he will usher in a new ""Industrial Revolution"" by increasing infrastructure spending and making significant changes to trade policies. In addition, Mr. Trump wants to fuel the economy by lowering corporate tax rates, which will have a material impact to the earnings potential for most U.S. companies.No one truly knows what policy changes Mr. Trump and team will implement, but it is appearing more and more likely that infrastructure spending will indeed be going up and that U.S. companies will be paying less in taxes at some point in the near future. Both of these trends will benefit the industrial companies (yes, including Honeywell), so what's not to like about a company that is expected to grow next year's earnings by double-digits in addition to having the opportunity to benefit from the changing political environment? Plus, Honeywell's stock is attractively valued based on several different metrics.ValuationBased on Honeywell's current price-to-earnings (""P/E"") ttm ratio and price-to-book, the company's stock is attractively valued when compared to the industry averages.(Source: simplywall.st)Moreover, HON shares are attractively valued when compared to the company's peers based on forward P/E ratios.HON PE Ratio (Forward) data by YChartsBottom LineHoneywell's earnings will be under pressure for the next four-to-five quarters, at least, but, in my opinion, the company has operations in industries that will be relevant for many years to come. As such, investors should not be overly concerned about short-term headwinds because, as I described in this article, Honeywell is well-positioned for 2017 and beyond.Investors should take a wait-and-see stance when trying to determine what type of impact Mr. Trump's policies will have on Honeywell's business, but, in the same breath, I believe that long-term investors will be rewarded for investing in a best-of-breed industrial company that has great business prospects in place.

4031223,85096,2016-12-18T10:48:12-05:00,Honeywell total return greatly outperformed the Dow average for the 47.6-month test period by 43.34%.Honeywell cash flow is $3.625 billion after paying its average dividend leaving plenty of cash for more growth investments.Honeywell CAGR of 9% is good and will give you good growth going forward.,"This article is about Honeywell (NYSE:HON) and why it's a great total return growth investment that's being considered for The Good Business Portfolio. Boeing (NYSE:BA) is the largest position in The Good Business Portfolio and I wanted to take a look at one of its suppliers and saw Honeywell. When I scanned the 5 year chart it was obvious that Honeywell had a great past 5 year record. Honeywell is a diversified technology and manufacturing company. Fundamentals of Honeywell will be reviewed in the following topics below The Good Business Portfolio Guidelines, Total Return and Yearly Dividend, Last Quarter's Earnings, Company Business and Takeaways And Recent Portfolio Changes.I use a set of guidelines that I codified over the last few years to review the companies in The Good Business Portfolio (my portfolio) and other companies that I am taking a look at. For a complete set of the guidelines, please see my article ""The Good Business Portfolio: Update To Guidelines and July 2016 Performance Review"". These guidelines provide me with a balanced portfolio of income, defensive, total return and growing companies that keeps me ahead of the Dow average.Good Business Portfolio Guidelines.Honeywell passes 11 of 11 Good Business Portfolio Guidelines. These guidelines are only used to filter companies to be considered in the portfolio. Some of the points brought out by the guidelines are shown below.Honeywell is a large-cap company with a capitalization of $88.6 billion. The large size of Honeywell gives it the muscle plus its large cash flow to increase the business going forward. The next biggest company in the industrial conglomerates sector is Koninklijke Philips (NYSE:PHG) at $27.5 billion capitalization 1/3 the size of Honeywell. There really is no company that compares to Honeywell's diversity of products.Honeywell has a dividend yield of 2.3% which is about average for the market. The dividend has been increased for nine of the last ten years and its dividend is very safe. Honeywell is therefore a average choice for the income investor. The payout ratio is fair at 38% over the past five years. After paying the dividend this leaves plenty of cash at $3.265 billion remaining for investment in new company purchases, business expansion and dividend increases.Honeywell total yearly cash flow at $5.561 billion is strong allowing the company to have the means for company growth through buying of bolt on companies. This good cash flow makes the dividend very safe with room for increases each year as the industrial sector continues to grow.I also require the CAGR going forward to be able to cover my yearly expenses. My dividends provide 3.2% of the portfolio as income and I need 1.9% more for a yearly distribution of 5.1%. The three-year CAGR of 9.0% (S&P Capital IQ) easily meets my requirement. This good future growth for Honeywell can continue the uptrend benefiting from the growth of the working population and increasing growth in the airplane and auto sectors.Looking back five years $10,000 invested five years ago would now be worth over $23,200 today. This makes Honeywell a good investment for the growth investor looking back, that has future growth as the need for its products increases.Honeywell S&P Capital IQ rating is three stars or hold with a target price of $118.0. Honeywell is 1% under priced at present compared to the target. HON is a fair buy at the present price for the investor who wants above average growth that does not need a large income stream.Total Return And Yearly DividendThe Good Business Portfolio Guidelines are just a screen to start with and not absolute rules. When I look at a company, the total return is a key parameter to see if it fits the objective of the Good Business Portfolio. Honeywell beat the Dow baseline in my 47.6 month test compared to the Dow average. I chose the 47.6. month test period (starting January 1, 2013 and ending to date) because it includes the great year of 2013, and other years that had fair and bad performance. The total return of 94.12% makes Honeywell a great investment for the total return growth investor. YTD total return for Honeywell is at 13.01%, below the market by 2% short term. Honeywell has increased its dividend for 9 of the last 10 years and presently has a yield of 2.3% which is average for the income investor but the total return is great which makes HON a pick for the total return investor.DOW's 47.6 month total return baseline is 50.78%As seen in the 5 year price chart below Honeywell has a good chart over 2012-2016 YTD, that shows a steady long term growth going up and to the right. The chart is great because it shows the strong steady growth over the 5 year period beating the DOW when the DOW average is up 50%.HON data by YChartsLast Quarter's EarningsFor the last quarter on October 21, 2016 Honeywell reported earnings that were at expected at $1.60 compared to last year at $1.60 and expected of $1.60. Total revenue was higher at $9.8 billion and higher than a year ago by 2.0% year over year. This was a fair report with bottom and top line staying the same. The next earnings will be out in January 2017 and are expected to be $1.74 compared to last year at $1.58. This leaves cash available for dividend increases, buying bolt on companies and business expansion.Business OverviewHoneywell is a diversified technology and manufacturing company. The Company operates in three segments: Aerospace, Automation and Control Solutions (ACS), and Performance Materials and Technologies. It's the Aerospace segment that supplies aircraft engines, integrated avionics, systems and service solutions, and related products and services for aircraft manufacturers, airlines, aircraft operators, military services, and defense and space contractors that I like as a supplier to Boeing and the airplane business. The ACS segment provides environmental and energy solutions; sensors, switches and controls for sensing and productivity solutions; security and fire safety products; industrial safety products, and building solutions and services for homes, commercial buildings and industrial facilities. How many of you have a Honeywell thermostat in your home?You can see from the graphic below the strong diverse industries that HON supplies, especially the airline and auto sectors.Source : HoneywellOverall Honeywell is a good business with 9% projected revenue growth as the economy and industrial sector continues to grow. The good cash flow provides HON the capability to continue its growth with addition of more bolt on companies. As the economy grows so will the sales of Honeywell's many products.The U.S. economy is showing moderate economic (about 2%) growth right now and the FED has raised rates this week (December 2016) with future rate increases dependent on the economy. The FED projects for 2-3 increases in 2017. I feel when it does raise rates it will be fewer, maybe 1-2. They don't want to trigger a slowdown in the economy.From the last earnings call CEO Dave Cote said: This shows the projection of the top management to continued growth of the company and its business.Takeaways and Recent Portfolio ChangesHoneywell is an investment choice for the total return investor with its average yield of 2.3% but has great total return over my test period. Honeywell will differently be considered for The Good Business Portfolio when an open slot is available. Honeywell's industrial business is using its good cash flow to buy bolt on companies and expand its business. HON has solid growth potential for upward earnings as the auto and airplane sectors continue to grow. If you want a steady growing company that also provides a fair income HON may be the right investment for you.Trimmed position in Harley Davidson (NYSE:HOG) to 5.1% of the portfolio. I will eventually sell the HOG position since sales have become stagnant and the stock price is high because of take over rumors.Added to position of Texas Instrument (NASDAQ:TXN), now at 2.6% of the portfolio. I intent to keep adding to TXN until it is 4% of the portfolio a full position.Added to position of Ingersoll-Rand (NYSE:IR) now at 4.0% of the portfolio a full position.Added to position of Digital Reality Trust (NYSE:DLR) now at 0.93% of the portfolio. I feel the computer industry facilities business has nowhere to go but up and DLR pays an above average dividend. I wrote an article on Digital Reality Trust in September of this year if you are interested.Trimmed Cabela's (NYSE:CAB) from 2.6% of the portfolio to 1.3%. They have received a bid of $65.50 cash for their shares, which to me is a fair price. I want to take a bit off the table in case the deal does not go through. I also would like to deploy the proceeds to increase the dividend paying companies in the portfolio. The last earnings report was not good and it may be time to take a good profit while I can in case the deal does not go through. Management is spending too much money to keep revenue up causing earnings to decrease.Increased Omega Healthcare Investors (NYSE:OHI) from 4.8% of the portfolio to 5.0% of the portfolio, I needed a little more income and OHI will give that to the portfolio. The portfolio has filled in the open portfolio slot with PepsiCo Inc. and will be followed by Kellogg (NYSE:K) or Ventas (NYSE:VTR) when the next slot is open.Sold some covered calls on Harley Davidson, sold January 6, 59's. If the premium gets to 20% of the sold premium price, I will buy them back with the hope that HOG goes up so I can sell the calls again in the same month for a Double. The HOG price is presently above the strike price and I will move the calls up and out if this situation is the same closer to expiration.The Good Business Portfolio generally trims a position when it gets above 8% of the portfolio. The four top positions in The Good Business Portfolio are, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is 7.9% of the portfolio, Altria Group (NYSE:MO) is 7.5% of the portfolio, Home Depot (NYSE:HD) is 7.7% of portfolio and Boeing is 9.0% of the portfolio, therefore BA is now in trim position with Home Depot, Johnson & Johnson and Altria getting close.Boeing is going to be pressed to 10% of the portfolio because of it being cash positive on individual 787 plane costs at $151 million.

4030354,23899,2016-12-14T02:49:58-05:00,"Honeywell International has been underperforming recently, but strong fundamentals and future governmental growth prospects could lift the stock.
        Investors have been weary of changes in management and recent guidance cuts.
        The company's established presence in the market will help it recover from rough market conditions.","By Richard SaintvilusShares of Honeywell International Inc. (HON) have underperformed the rest of the market over the past six months, languishing in negative territory for most of the fall. This decline has been driven by a combination of factors, including investor nervousness regarding the company's upcoming leadership change and some weakness in the aerospace segment that has pressured Honeywell's profit margins.But looking out over the next four to eight quarters, shares of the New Jersey-based industrial conglomerate certainly look attractive. HON stock is priced at just 15 times fiscal 2017 estimates, compared to a P/E of 18 for the S&P 500 Index. And not only do those estimates imply an 8% year-over-year increase in earnings per share, but Honeywell stock will also pay an attractive 2.4% dividend yield for your patience.What's more, the economic and fiscal policies that could be implemented under President-elect Donald Trump can also boost Honeywell's standing within the industrial sector. With the investments the company is making in areas such as technology and automation, Honeywell stands to recoup those investments in the form of lower costs and operating efficiencies that can boost long-term earnings per share. Put all of these ""what ifs"" together, and suddenly you have a cheap stock that pays a strong yield that can surprise investors in 2017. But how sweet is Honeywell, really?Where Things Stand TodayHoneywell failed to excite investors with breathtaking third-quarter earnings results, which came in at $1.67 per share on revenue of $9.8 billion (up 2% year over year). Depending on the metrics you follow, the company either missed third-quarter EPS by a penny or reported in-line results. From my vantage point, however, and understanding the company's history, Honeywell's third-quarter results were just as expected.Like its closest peers, which are also struggling, Honeywell is working to navigate a weak pricing environment. In the weeks leading up to the announcement, management lowered guidance, which the company attributed to a combination of a sluggish economy and the ongoing weakness in the oil and gas industry. These were, and continue to be, familiar headwinds and not much of a surprise, and led to third-quarter revenue falling about 3%.Each of Honeywell's business segments suffered declines except for the home and building technology business, which grew 5% on an organic basis, thanks to better-than-expected results in the distribution segment. As expected, the Aerospace business underperformed as revenue declined 6% year-over-year. The Aerospace business also suffered margin erosion of more than three percentage points, falling to 18.4% from 21.8% a year ago. But Honeywell, founded more than 100 year ago, has been through these issues before. One weak quarter does little to suggest that this company is in serious trouble.The Change At The Top Won't Change StrategyInvestors are understandably nervous about the upcoming change at CEO and the potential disruption it may cause in terms of business approach and, frankly, whether the new CEO can carry the torch effectively. David Cote recently announced he would retire as CEO in 2017, which isn't much of a surprise given the various stages of restructuring Honeywell had undertaken over the past several quarters. Nor was it a surprise that Darius Adamczyk was appointed as the next CEO.Investors, however, were surprised by the timing of the announcement, particularly because Honeywell has yet to complete Cote's planned move towards automation and software. It is not yet clear whether Adamczyk will maintain that course or decide to put the company on a different path.That said, I'm willing to bet Adamczyk will keep the company's focus on automation and software. This would be Honeywell's quickest path towards higher profit margins, given that the company already has invested heavily in digitizing not only its factories and buildings, but also several of its core segments. What's more, Adamczyk, a former software engineer, is likely better suited to lead Honeywell through this transition than Cote. And investors shouldn't be surprised if the outcome of the move towards automation and software arrives quicker and delivers higher-than-expected returns.Can Honeywell's Returns Overflow?The CEO transition will pose a near-term challenge, but the market overlooked the fact that Honeywell's management, despite lowering Q3 guidance, said that the company is in a position to deliver improving results over the next five quarters. Projecting these changes out over the next eight quarters, it's tough to ignore the value.The company is projected to grow earnings at an average annual rate of 9% in the next five years, meaning earnings per share growth will accelerate beyond the projected 8% growth for fiscal 2017. Likewise, I expect Honeywell's revenue to trend higher the 4.5% to 5% range, while growth in free cash flow can reach 6% to 7%. These projections support a fair value of around $127 to $130 per share, or 13% to 15% higher than current levels. My forecast compares to the analyst consensus 12-month price target of $124.These projections may yet be conservative to the extent that the company can successfully execute its move towards automation and software, which can boost Honeywell's profit margins, allowing Honeywell to invest in areas where its R&D can extract significant market opportunities.Risks To Consider: There's quite a bit for investors to digest regarding the CEO change and the company's ability to execute its move toward automation and software. And while the energy sector has rebounded slightly over the past three months, there's no guarantee that oil prices won't remain at a level that will prolong the pressure on Honeywell's core businesses.Action To Take: Honeywell should be kept on the watch list of investors who are looking for an undervalued industrial stock that is trading at a meaningful discount to its long-term potential and also pays a strong dividend yield.This article was originally posted on StreetAuthority.com."
4018101,39011,2016-11-02T08:15:44-04:00,"HON had a very weak Q3.But the problems it faced are transitory and growth should resume into 2017.At 15 times forward earnings, HON is very cheap and expectations are much lower than guidance for 2017.","Photo creditHoneywell (NYSE:HON) has been one of my more favored dividend stocks in the past couple of years as it has maintained a reasonable multiple throughout. Other large dividend payers have been bid up to stratospheric levels despite lackluster growth; HON is quite the opposite. But heading into Q3 earnings the stock had already taken a beating from an ugly pre-announcement so we knew things weren't going to be pretty. But given the commentary and reaffirmed Q4 guidance, is this a chance to buy instead of cause for concern?Honeywell's Aerospace segment was the main culprit for the weak quarter as sales came in at -6% and operating profit fell by 20%. The commercial helicopter business as well as lower volumes and higher incentives all led to the decline in revenue. Given the importance of this segment to Honeywell, posting a -6% showing for revenue is tough to overcome and despite some productivity savings, this segment's margins fell by 340bps, leading to the 20% decline in segment profit.The Elster acquisition helped drive the Home and Building Technologies segment's revenue skyward, gaining 17% in Q3. The organic gain was still an impressive 5% but again, segment margins fell. This time, the decline was 130bps as unfavorable mix, higher R&D and acquisition costs weighed. Segment profit was still up because of the sizable jump in sales but given the weak margin performance here as well, Honeywell certainly has some work to do.Performance Materials and Technologies came in with a -3% organic sales showing but was up 2% on a reported basis as acquisitions aided here as well. Better productivity and higher volumes, however, helped send operating margins higher by 80bps in this segment in a departure from what we saw in the other segments for Q3.The Intelligrated acquisition helped to limit the damage done by a variety of factors that sent organic revenue in the Safety and Productivity Solutions segment down by 8%. Reported revenue was down 2% and margins fell as volume was down and integration costs didn't help. The bottom line with Honeywell's Q3 from a revenue and margin perspective is that there was weakness to be had in a variety of places and this doesn't mesh with what we've seen of late from Honeywell.So what gives? After all, my bullishness on Honeywell has been due mostly to the idea that steady revenue gains would be accompanied by continued gains in margins. Up until this point, that has mostly been the case but in Q3, it certainly wasn't. But does that mean that Honeywell is done growing?Commentary from management would suggest that Q3 is no more than a hiccup as we heard that we should expect low single-digit organic sales growth, margin improvements and a double-digit increase in EPS in 2017. That's congruent with what we've come to expect from Honeywell and assuming management is even close to being right about those items, the stock is setup quite well from here.Guidance for Q4 was strong as well and assumes that HON will get back on the growth track very quickly. But that isn't to say that Q3's struggles should be ignored. Indeed, I'm still concerned by not only the lack of volume in a couple of places but in particular, the loss of margins. HON has proven tremendously adept at growing margins over time and that is what initially attracted me to this stock. There aren't many companies that have been as good at boosting margins over and over again as Honeywell so if that story comes to an end, I would find it exceedingly difficult to continue to like the stock. But I don't think the margin growth story is dead; I just think Honeywell had some things fall into place in Q3 that were unfavorable.Analysts have brought down their forecasts for next year to just over $7 in EPS, meaning the stock is going for just over 15 times next year's earnings. That's very cheap considering not only HON's long term EPS growth but also the fact that it pays a decent dividend. And since analysts are only looking for 7.7% EPS growth next year, there is opportunity for HON to come up with a beat. Guidance is for a double-digit increase and while the difference may sound slight, it signals that analysts are pessimistic and that sentiment is on the bearish side; that creates an opportunity for the bulls to take advantage if you think HON can beat those expectations. After all, would management guide for something it doesn't think it can hit?With sales growth in the low single-digit range and share count reduction of roughly the same amount, we only need to see moderate margin expansion for HON to hit 8% EPS growth next year. It has proven the ability to do this over time, Q3 notwithstanding, and I have no doubts that it will get back on its growth track. Q3 was a perfect storm of negative factors and for that reason, I think HON is a strong buy here. This is a stock you can buy and forget about and nothing about that has changed for me."
4014205,79675,2016-10-24T09:57:10-04:00,"As expected, Honeywell reported lackluster Q3 2016 operating results.
        Honeywell is well-positioned for fiscal 2017, so shareholders will be rewarded for being patient.
        Honeywell is a long-term buy under $110/share.","On October 21, 2016, Honeywell (NYSE:HON) reported Q3 2016 earnings that were in line with analyst estimates but the company's overall operating results showed that this industrial conglomerate is indeed contending with several different headwinds. The lackluster results should have been expected by the financial community because earlier in the month management provided revised (lowered) Q3 2016 guidance, which was largely a result of the sluggish economy and the downturn in the oil and gas industry. However, Honeywell's management team also tried to communicate to the investor base that the company is in a position to deliver improving results over the next five quarters.On another positive note, Honeywell reported quarterly revenue of $9.8b (2% YoY growth) and in line EPS of $1.60 ($1.67 ex restructuring costs), which is impressive results when considering the challenging operating environment. On the other hand, Honeywell's Q3 2016 margins were negatively impacted by restructuring costs, among other factors.(Source: Q3 2016 Earnings Presentation)Honeywell's Q3 2016 results were nothing to write home about, but, in my opinion, I agree with management in that the company's future appears extremely bright.The Results By Segment, Poor For NowAfter reviewing the Q3 2016 results, the biggest takeaway that I had was that Honeywell's entire business is contending with significant headwinds, which is shown by the fact that only two operating segments reported increases in both quarterly sales and profit.(Source: Data from Q3 2016 Earnings Presentation; table created by W.G. Investment Research)*Excludes other corporate activityThe numbers across the board were less-than-stellar but the standout segment was Home and Building Technologies (""HBT""), which reported double-digit sales growth and high single-digit profit growth. Management mentioned that the segment's China and distribution businesses contributed to the quarterly sales and profit growth, and that these businesses are expected to experience growth through the remainder of 2016. Moreover, management expects for the HBT segment to benefit from several other factors (i.e. new product introductions, connected offerings, & installed base expansion) over the next five quarters.More importantly, management is projecting for significantly better results for the upcoming quarter. For Q4 2016, management guided for EPS to be in the range of $1.74-$1.78, which would translate into a 10%-13% YoY increase from the EPS reported in the same period of the prior year.(Source: Q3 2016 Earnings Presentation)From a long-term investor's perspective, it is encouraging that management expects for the company to turn the corner in such a short period of time, but, in my opinion, what is even more important is the fact that management expects solid results through the end of the next fiscal year.(Source: Q3 2016 Earnings Presentation)EPS is expected to grow by almost double-digits in 2017, even in an environment that will result in low top-line revenue growth. If the 2017 EPS target is achieved, shareholders are able to purchase HON shares today at an attractive valuation.HON PE Ratio (Forward) data by YChartsBased on forward earnings, only United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) is trading at a lower P/E ratio. In addition, not only is Honeywell trading at an attractive valuation but management also appears to be committed to maintaining the trend of returning substantial capital to shareholders.A Shareholder-Friendly CompanyHoneywell has been committed to returning capital to shareholders over the past few years, and this will likely continue through fiscal 2017. Honeywell pays an ~2% dividend and the company has spent ~$1.9b so far in 2016 repurchasing shares.(Source: Q3 2016 Earnings Presentation)Honeywell is also putting a great deal of capital to work by making small tuck-in acquisitions, which is a trend that will likely continue in the years ahead. In this type of operating environment, Honeywell has been (and will continue to be) focused on M&A and I believe that long-term investors should be excited about this because management is sticking to their long-term strategy of positioning this company for 2017/2018 instead of trying to just meet the next quarterly earnings estimate.Bottom LineThere is no denying the fact that Honeywell's Q3 2016 results left the company's investor base wanting more, but these results do not change the company's long-term ""story"". Honeywell is still a well-positioned industrial company that has operations in industries that will be relevant for many years to come. In my opinion, long-term investors are being given an opportunity to accumulate HON shares at an attractive valuation in a time that the company is contending with several different headwinds.Honeywell has great long-term business prospects, so investors should consider starting a position in this industrial conglomerate whiles shares are under $110 because the company's future looks bright from here.

4017534,24361,2016-11-01T10:41:57-04:00,"Honeywell's guidance revisions have spooked the Street and increased the anxiety over the impending CEO transition.Aerospace should pay off in the long run, and Honeywell continues to pivot toward higher-margin, wider-moat opportunities in automation and software.A fair value around $114 still seems credible on the basis of 4% to 6% long-term growth.","One of the more common recommendations you see with investment writing and sell-side research is ""consider buying on a pullback"". While it is certainly true that the market will periodically freak out for no particularly good reason(s) and take down good companies/stocks with it, a lot of those pullbacks come when companies stumble and the market overreacts. In other words, buying on dips often requires buying into trouble on the basis of the belief that the trouble is fixable and temporary.I believe that is the case with Honeywell (NYSE:HON) today. Investors are understandably nervous about the upcoming CEO transition, and the new CEO has big shoes to fill. Investors are also troubled by the weakness in aerospace, as Honeywell is seeing program startup costs (OEM incentives) weigh heavily on results. Longer term, though, this is a company that has already cast its lot with a pivot toward automation, software, and R&D/innovation-driven revenue growth. I do see a risk that these shares could chop around for a bit, but I believe this is a good name to consider as a long-term core holding.Third Quarter Earnings Weren't AwfulLooking back at Honeywell's third quarter results, and considering the results that have come in during the intervening time, this wasn't a horrible quarter. Yes, Honeywell spooked the Street when it lowered guidance in early October, yes the updated guidance for FCF conversion was disappointing, and yes Honeywell skewed a little weak compared to its high-quality peers, but this is not a company in serious trouble.Revenue fell 3% on a core basis, as Honeywell is facing the same weak pricing environment as almost everyone else. Only the home and building technology business grew on an organic basis, up 5% this quarter, as the distribution segment was strong. PMT saw 3% organic contraction on a 10% decline in UOP due to ongoing weakness in refining/cracking. Aerospace was down 6% as OEM incentives pushed commercial OE revenue down 25% (although the 8% decline after adjusting for those incentives wasn't strong either) and business jets remain weak. Last and least, safety and productive saw an 8% contraction on a 12% pullback in productivity.Margins did soften on these top-line results. Gross margin declined more than a point, while operating income declined nearly 13%. Segment profits were down 7%, with both home and building tech and PMT up (8% and 6%, respectively), and aero and SPS down double digits.No Quick Fixes For AeroLike Meggitt (OTCPK:MEGGY), a smaller supplier to the aerospace sector, Honeywell is stuck in a transition period in its aerospace business. Majors like Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Airbus (OTCPK:EADSY) are moving ahead with new programs, but that's a mixed blessing for OEM suppliers like Honeywell during the startup phase. The builders are well aware of the lucrative aftermarket revenue streams that come with these programs and they get their vig by squeezing suppliers like Honeywell and Meggitt for concessions/incentives (including basically free parts in some cases) on the original equipment.At the same time, aftermarket sales aren't making up the gap right now. Older aircraft are being retired (taking away those high-margin parts opportunities) and those retirements not only reduce the demand for parts to keep those planes flying, but also represent a rival source of parts. Honeywell has an aftermarket parts service that helps reduce some of the risks of competition from scavenged parts, but it is still a factor. What's more, flying hours and parts demand in markets like Latin American aren't particularly strong right now.Aero is likely to be weak into and through 2017. There is some risk that wide-body production expectations will decline further, but the next few years should see a significant increase in deliveries that eventually support a lucrative long-term cycle for Honeywell.A Different ApproachAs Honeywell sees a transition at the CEO position, it is also seeing a transition in its business approach. Outgoing CEO David Cote has been steering the company more towards automation and software, and I expect that the new CEO, Darius Adamczyk (himself a former software engineer) will continue that process.Giving the growing digitization of factories, buildings, and many other core end-markets for Honeywell, it is a logical decision and one that should also boost margins. At least part of the success, I believe, that Honeywell and Rockwell (NYSE:ROK) have enjoyed relative to ABB (NYSE:ABB) and Emerson (NYSE:EMR) in automation is due to a better skew toward software and controls compared to hardware. With that, I think more acquisitions and internal development in automated systems and industrial software are likely.I also expect Honeywell to continue to invest in those areas where R&D can drive meaningful market opportunities. I've talked about it before, but I believe the company's Solstice refrigerant is a good case in point - developed with Chemours (NYSE:CC) when it was part of DuPont (NYSE:DD), Solstice is a more environmentally-friendly option for applications like auto air-conditioning and it costs more than five times as much as older alternatives. That's a significant incremental opportunity for Honeywell, and this one product should actually nudge overall company growth a bit over the next couple of years (and Honeywell is large enough that single products rarely do that).The OpportunityAlthough the third quarter was disappointing, my long-term outlook for Honeywell really hasn't changed. There is a risk that the commercial aerospace cycle disappoints over the long term, but I believe the opportunities in automation, safety, and specialty materials/chemicals remain compelling. I would also expect to see more divestments in the future with lower-margin business control businesses and more commodity-like chemical segments being prime candidates. At the same time, I would expect the company to be looking for opportunities to acquire in lighting controls, industrial software/controls, and perhaps particular automation niches (like warehouse automation).I still expect long-term revenue growth in the neighborhood of 4%, with FCF a little higher as the pivot toward automation and software improves margins. Discounted back, that still supports a fair value in the area of $115.The Bottom LineCEO transitions are difficult, and the market is certainly worried about this one. The market is also understandably worried about whether 2017 really will be a year of meaningful growth, as a post-election hangover is a possibility and aerospace continues to see a bumpy ramp. Longer term, though, I continue to believe that Honeywell is a quality company that deserves a look on pullbacks and a place as a potential long-term core holding.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

4014208,71185,2016-10-24T10:04:19-04:00,International agreement by almost 200 countries reached to cut HFC by 85% by 2045 to avoid “super” greenhouse gas emissions from refrigerants.Phaseout of HFCs from cooling appliances to start 2019-2028 (depending on country).Agreement results from initial US and Chinese efforts to agree to exit HFCs. India had critical role in final negotiations.Large corporations have provided the solution to closing down HFC use.Honeywell and Chemours Company both well positioned with new refrigerants on the market.,"Source: Chemours CompanyIn an overlooked development that is of big significance to controlling global warming, the Kigali conference in Rwanda has just concluded a binding agreement, with real teeth, that it is estimated will avoid ~0.5 C warming.In an ""out of the frying pan into the fire"" process, the original Montreal protocol successfully led to the phase out of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) for use in refrigerants to reverse the hole in the ozone layer. They were replaced by hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), which while starting to fix the ozone hole, turned out to be super greenhouse gas emitters, being thousands of times more potent than CO2.So began a protracted process to find refrigerants that were not major greenhouse gas emitters and which didn't make the ozone hole worse. This process has lasted almost a decade, but this month, a major international agreement has been reached.The Kigali HFC phase-outThe Kigali phase-out agreement, which is an amendment to the Montreal protocol, involves a three-step approach. Wealthy nations are required to start wind-down in 2019, reaching 85% reduction (2011-2013 base) by 2036. Africa, Latin America and China are required to start phase out by 2024, reaching 80% reduction of 2020-2022 levels by 2045. India, Pakistan and 8 West African countries have agreed to start the exit from HFCs in 2028 and reach 80% reduction (2024-2026 baseline) by 2047.India had a significant role in getting developed countries to increase their ambition in reducing HFCs in return for increasing its own ambitions. India also agreed to eliminate, with immediate effect, emissions of HFC-23, which has 14,800 times greenhouse warming compared with CO2. China and the US then agreed to eliminate HFC-23 with effect by 2020. Developed countries agreed to reduce HFC use by 70% by 2029 and by 85% by 2036.There is an incentive for developing nations to accelerate the timeline. A Public-Private initiative to speed up the transit from HFCs to more efficient and less environmentally damaging coolants already has $80 million pledged from Governments and 19 philanthropy groups.This agreement has a history going back to 2008. It is no coincidence that in 2008, Honeywell (NYSE:HON) and DuPont Chemicals had developed an alternative to HFCs, which they patented. This provided a strong commercial incentive to phase out HFCs. The US (biggest user) and China (biggest producer) agreed to phase out HFCs in 2013. The chemical industries of both China and the US were engaged to find HFC replacements and scale up production.There are several important aspects of the Kigali agreement that might end up being relevant to the COP21 Paris agreement on greenhouse gas emission reductions.Firstly, the US, China and India each had key roles in negotiating the agreement. With these three countries playing a constructive role, a major segment of the problem was at the negotiating table in formulating the agreement.Given the problems of the US Senate, the Kigali Agreement (which is an amendment to the Montreal Protocol), like the COP21 Paris climate agreement, has been entered into by Presidential decree leveraging off the Montreal Protocol which was approved by the Senate in 1988.Secondly, an interesting thing about this agreement is the role played by the corporations, which have been involved with the problem, in helping solve it. The later entry by India in HFC reduction seems to be related to date of expiry of key early patents by Honeywell and DuPont (NYSE:DD) (now Chemours Company), and also presumably a lot of experience in scale up cost reductions.The companies, which will benefit from the Kigali agreementWhile the Kigali agreement has been years in the making and no doubt its success comes from constructive negotiations among key governments (notably the US, China and India), there are two corporations that have been working on the technical side, building new intellectual property, and scale up to capitalise on international agreement.Two companies, Honeywell and Chemours Company, stand out as being interesting from an investment perspective in relation the HFC phase-out, as they have key patents on new HydroFluoroOlefin (HFO) chemistry. New low greenhouse emissions products are significant new market opportunities for these companies and this business will grow rapidly.Chemours Company (NYSE:CC), the recent spinout of the DuPont Co. Chemicals Business, is aggressively commercialising Opteon YF, a HFO refrigerant with 99.9% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to the current HFC-134a used in the automotive industry. Opteon is a significant part of the growth story of Chemours Company and it expects to roll out Opteon YF in more than 24 million vehicles by the end of 2016. The Kigali agreement has come at an excellent time to accelerate the growth of this market opportunity.There are four more Opteon products released, which expands the HFO chemistry beyond automotive use to stationary & transport container refrigeration water chillers (Opteon XP10), supermarkets & cold storage (Opteon XP40), refrigerated trucks & trailers (Opteon XP44) and air conditioning heat pumps & water chillers (Opteon XL55). The reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in the four new Opteon products (51-67% lower) is not as dramatic as for Opteon YF for automotive air conditioning (99.9% lower), but it is clear that these products are part of the exit from HFC use.Chemours Company manufactures its Opteon products in China.HoneywellHoneywell has a series of HFO products, which parallel those from Chemours Company.Honeywell considers its ""Solstice"" line of refrigerants is ready to be a $1 billion business. The plan is to use ""Solstice"" products as ""drop-ins"" to replace existing HFC coolant products. Honeywell already has $3.4 billion of long-term agreements with car companies and appliance manufacturers.Just as Chemours has targeted versions of its products, so too does Honeywell.ConclusionThe Kigali agreement to phase out HFCs is a major step forward in efforts to prevent acceleration of global warming, and it is also an interesting example of how the industry can speed up change. Here I've highlighted two significant chemical manufacturers who have invested heavily in finding alternatives to HFCs well ahead of agreement being reached to phase them out. With the strong Kigali agreement, I suggest that these developments are likely to provide major new profit centers for both Chemours Company and Honeywell.Both companies have HFC replacement products that will receive a major boost with the completion of the Kigali agreement. This is a good example of a specific product area where action on greenhouse gas emissions will have a major positive impact. Worth a look if you are revising your investment portfolio to include emerging products addressing climate change.Chemours Company has had a strong 2016, starting from a low of $3.30 in mid-January to closure at $16.79 in the latest trading. Honeywell has recently experienced close to a 10% correction from a year high of $120.02, on news of profit guidance. It may be starting to recover at $108.96 in latest trading, perhaps due to the announcement about the HFC agreement?I am not a financial advisor.

4012554,79675,2016-10-17T11:42:22-04:00,"In early October 2016, Honeywell provided 2017 financial guidance that was not well received by the financial community.
        The company's CEO recently conducted an interview to help investors better understand Honeywell's long-term growth story.
        Honeywell is a long-term buy at today's price.","During the October 7, 2016 investor call, Honeywell's (NYSE:HON) management team revised the company's Q3 2016 guidance and provided the company's Q4 2016 and full-year 2017 financial guidance. The management team painted a picture of a company that has been contending with headwinds over the last year that have not only impacted the results for the most recent quarter but that are also anticipated to impact results over the next few quarters. Honeywell's investor call left the financial community wanting more (a lot more) and as a result the company's stock price fell off a cliff on the next trading day.(Source: Bloomberg)The revised Q3 2016 guidance was a negative surprise, but, in my opinion, the sell-off was a direct result of the dire picture that management painted for what should be expected from Honeywell over next five quarters. I believe that management actually did investors with a long-term perspective a favor by creating an opportunity to start a position in a storied company that has great long-term business prospects.(Image Source)The Redo, Why The Change In Tone?In response to the significant sell-off for HON shares, Mr. Dave Cote, President and CEO of Honeywell, made an appearance on CNBC's Mad Money with Jim Cramer in an attempt to defend the company's long-term outlook. Additionally, the company filed an 8-k with slides that painted a very different picture for what should be expected from Honeywell over the next five quarters.Management teams usually do not follow up on investor presentations/calls by providing additional information and commentary but Mr. Cote stated that he felt that investors ""missed"" the fact that Honeywell's long-term growth story is still intact. However, in my opinion, management did a poor job highlighting the positives and focused too much on the company's challenging operating environment.Mr. Jim Cramer did a great job highlighting where management fell short and even asked Mr. Cote directly if his team made a mistake by being too conservative in their first presentation:Simply put, Honeywell dropped the ball by spending too much time discussing the headwinds that the company will have to contend with going forward instead of detailing how this company is actually in a position to report impressive future earnings growth. I, too, believe that Honeywell's long-term story is intact and there are two main reasons why I think investors should be looking to start a position in Honeywell while shares are trading below $110. First, the company is still expected to grow earnings (by 10%-13% for Q4 2016 and by double-digits for full-year 2017) even in a challenging operating environment, and, secondly, shares of Honeywell are attractively valued when compared to its peers.Earnings Momentum, The Story Goes onSince 2007, Honeywell has delivered above-average EPS growth and management expects more of the same for full-year 2016.HON EPS Diluted (NYSE:TTM) data by YCharts(Source: Honeywell's October 13, 2016 8-k --linked above)The fact that Honeywell still expects to report double-digit EPS growth for 2017 was lost in the shuffle during the October 7th call/presentation, but Mr. Cote spent a great deal of time focusing on this point during his interview with Mr. Cramer. Moreover, not only has Honeywell performed well in a ""tough macro environment"" in 2016 but management expects for the investments made over the last few years to begin to pay off in 2017.(Source: Honeywell's October 13, 2016 8-k --linked above)Honeywell has been heavily investing in its businesses and the company is anticipated to reap the benefits in 2017, as the company's portfolio realignment has put Honeywell in a position to experience top and bottom line growth in several key industries.At the end of the day, it is hard not to like a company that is expected to grow earnings by double-digits in the next fiscal year so I believe that it was a smart (and necessary) move for Mr. Cote to help the financial community better understand what is really going on with Honeywell's businesses and what should be expected from the company through 2017.ValuationBelow is a slide that management provided for Mr. Cote's interview with Mr. Cramer.(Source: Honeywell's October 13, 2016 8-k --linked above)As shown, Honeywell is attractively valued when compared to its peers --3M (NYSE:MMM), Illinois Tool Works (NYSE:ITW), General Electric (NYSE:GE), Emerson Electric (NYSE:EMR), Industrial Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSEARCA:XLI), Rockwell Collins (NYSE:COL), and United Technologies (NYSE:UTX).Bottom LineHoneywell is a company that has been on my watch list for the R.I.P. Portfolio since 2015, but now may be the time that I finally get a chance to start a position in this company. It is encouraging that management acknowledged the fact that they did a poor job communicating expectations for the remainder of 2016 and for the next fiscal year, but I actually wish that management followed up with additional commentary/details after I had a chance to buy shares around $105 (the stock price shot back up to $109/share in short order after Mr. Cote's interview).Honeywell is a great company that has operations in several promising industries, so long-term investors should treat any significant pullbacks as a buying opportunity. For full disclosure, I plan to build a position in Honeywell over the next few quarters.Full Disclosure: I believe that GE is currently a better buy in the industrial space, which is a topic that I discussed in ""GE: The 'Overvalued' Conglomerate That Is A Buy - The Numbers Prove It"".If you found this article to be informative and would like to hear more about this company or any other company that I analyze, please consider hitting the ""Follow"" button above.Disclaimer: This article is not a recommendation to buy or sell any stock mentioned.

4011529,23967,2016-10-11T15:33:18-04:00,"Honeywell is a well managed industrial conglomerate operating in aerospace, home and building technology, performance materials, and safety and workflow solutions.Honeywell has prospered in the last decade from smart acquisitions and operations management that's among the best in class.With the economy weakening, investors are likely to get a better entry point in the future than the current $107.","This note on Honeywell (NYSE:HON) is likely to be briefer than the typical note that I would write, but I did want to comment on the recent decline in the share price. In reducing current year guidance last week, Honeywell's shares declined to $107 from a recent price close to $116 per share. At the mid-point of the revised guidance of $6.60-$6.64 per share, Honeywell is now trading for about 16x this year's earnings.About 40% of Honeywell's business is from aerospace - selling aircraft engines and turbochargers and other aerospace components. I think this business is the strongest one that Honeywell owns. Half of that business is private and half is from the government. Home and Building Technology, items like thermostats and fire alarms, compose about 24% of sales. Performance Materials and Technologies sells products such as control systems, resins, fibers, additives and chemicals and is responsible for about 25% of sales. Finally, safety and productivity solutions is involved in the business of selling safety equipment and workflow solutions among other things and comprises the remaining 12% of the business.Honeywell is a well-run industrial conglomerate that is able to routinely purchase smaller businesses that fit into the portfolio of businesses that they own and capture both synergies as well as benefits from converting the acquired businesses to Honeywell's strong business processes and culture. The largest recent acquisition was the $5.1 billion of Elster, a UK-based manufacturer of metering equipment for gas, electricity and water. More recently than that, Honeywell purchased industrial software designer Intelligrated for $1.5 billion.With CEO David Cote indicating that the acquisitions will continue, shareholder returns are at the mercy of the decisions of the capital allocators of Honeywell - whether they continue to purchase companies that fit within the existing portfolio and at sensible prices. Their record so far has been a good one.Honeywell revenue and earnings, 2006-2016. Source: Honeywell SEC Filings.But much of the gains over the last decade have come through cost reductions as opposed to top line growth as an extremely disciplined and successful operating system has been built into Honeywell's DNA. While operating margins have expanded from 10% to 18%, revenue has only grown at a pace of about 2% per year. Some of the flat-lining of revenue has more to do with the environment than true progress or lack thereof at Honeywell. Revenue shrunk from $36.6 billion to $30.9 billion in 2009 and lately revenue peaked at $40.3 billion in 2014 before industrial production began weakening and the dollar strengthening. Longer term, there is no reason why Honeywell cannot grow revenue at a rate of 4% to 5%, although margin expansion from a level of 18% might prove to be somewhat more challenging.Capital allocation has been extremely balanced, with 28% of cash flow going to dividends, 26% to acquisitions, 24% to share repurchases and 21% to capital expenditures. Free cash flow conversion has declined from several years ago because of an intentional increase in capital expenditures, but free cash flow has still grown at a 5.4% rate over the last decade.Honeywell operating cash flow, capital expenditures, free cash flow and allocations to acquisitions, share repurchases, and dividends from 2006 to 2016. Source: Honeywell SEC Filings.Honeywell cumulative amounts spent on dividends, acquisitions, share repurchases and capital expenditures, 2006-2015. Source: Calculated by author.There are a couple of different ways you can view the return that the business is generating - the dichotomy being driven by the number of acquisitions made and the accompanying goodwill and intangible assets on the balance sheet.Over the last decade or so, return on tangible invested capital is about 50%, with the recent number of 46% still extremely attractive. If the acquisition related goodwill and intangible assets are included on the balance sheet, then the return on equity is closer to 25%. That is a probably more accurate way to look at future company returns since it seems almost certain that the acquisitions will continue.Honeywell return on equity and ROIC, 2006-2016. Estimated by the author.By my calculations, the average earnings multiple for Honeywell over the last decade has been 17.4x, implying a fair value of about $115 currently. That means the current price of $107 is a discount of only about 7%. Investors in Honeywell should focus their research on a couple key areas and risks. The biggest risk is that the capital allocation of Honeywell could falter in the future. To date, though, they have not behaved in a way that would make you believe that was the case. Additionally, companies that make frequent and smaller acquisitions seem to integrate them with more success than those who do not.I would be more concerned with the environment in which Honeywell operates, which is a global economy whose growth rate is contracting. A strong dollar and 1% GPD growth is not a good environment for Honeywell to operate in. So, while this is a fantastic company with wonderful assets and superb management I would wait for a better entry point. If the stock continues to pull back below $95, then it would became an extremely tempting entry point at about 14x earnings. If the global economy continues moving in the direction it has been, you are likely to get that opportunity."
4013072,24491,2016-10-19T07:58:38-04:00,"Honeywell recently trimmed its full-year earnings per share guidance for 2016 and noted that core organic sales are now expected to be down 1-2% for the year.Honeywell has its hands in a lot of end markets, and as the commercial aviation cycle matures, growth continues to slow.Honeywell pays a strong, competitive dividend, in our view, and the safety of its payout is top notch as measured by its Dividend Cushion ratio.Let's take a look at the firm's investment considerations as we walk through the valuation process and derive a fair value estimate for shares.","By The Valuentum TeamHoneywell (NYSE:HON) continues to be an M&A story, as organic growth trends have been under pressure as a result of a global economy that has failed to stack up to expectations. During the past 15 years, for example, Honeywell has completed ~90 acquisitions and divested ~70 businesses. In 2015 alone, the company spent ~$5.8 billion in cash for the acquisitions of Elster, ComDev, Satcom, Sigma, and Aviaso. In August 2016, Honeywell completed the buyout of Intelligrated (automation solutions business), and unconfirmed reports suggest it is interested in acquiring JDA Software for $3 billion. Honeywell also spun-off AdvanSix (NYSE:ASIX), its resins and chemicals operation, where shareholders received one share of AdvanSix for every 25 shares of common Honeywell stock they owned. It recently sold its government service provider to KBR (NYSE:KBR).Profit taking in Honeywell's shares became more prominent October 2016, as the company trimmed its full-year earnings per share guidance for 2016 and noted that core organic sales are now expected to be down 1-2% for the year. We find the bottom-line revision a little troubling because Honeywell had announced a $5 billion stock buyback program in April 2016 as a strategy to deploy cash. The buyback program in itself was peculiar and may have been the catalyst for CEO Cote's impending departure. One doesn't have to look much further than Cote's 2015 annual letter to shareholders to see that there may have been some disagreement in the board room regarding opportunistic share buybacks:Honeywell has its hands in a lot of end markets, and as the commercial aviation cycle matures, growth continues to slow. Its defense and space end market has also proved challenging, as oil and gas markets continue to be dislocated as a result of the collapse in energy resource pricing through much of the past 18 months. We like the visibility of commercial aerospace in light of the massive backlogs at the commercial airframe makers, but we're less enthused at the prospects of a resurgence in the defense/space and oil/gas markets. New products in homes/buildings should help offset some of the weakness, and prospects in turbo remain strong thanks to increasing penetration rates. Still, core organic growth remains under pressure.Image Source: HoneywellDespite the slowing growth, we think Honeywell pays a fantastic and competitive dividend, with a yield (~2.2%) that makes its impressive Dividend Cushion ratio of 2.9 simply too high to pass up. Management continues to target high ROI capital spending as it pursues key process initiatives and productivity improvements, a healthy combination for ongoing segment margin expansion. We're huge fans of its commercial original equipment and aftermarket business in light of the massive backlogs at the airframe makers, and there's not much that looks poised to derail Honeywell's dividend strength, at least in the near term.Image source: ValuentumImage source: ValuentumHoneywell's Investment ConsiderationsImage source: ValuentumInvestment Highlights• Honeywell is a conglomerate operating in the following areas: aerospace, automation and controls solutions, performance materials and technologies, and transportation systems. Its aerospace products are used on virtually every aircraft, while its building solutions are in over 150 million homes. The company was founded in 1920 and is based in New Jersey.• Honeywell is targeting segment margins north of 20% for each of its four segments. Transportation Systems (turbo) is poised to grow the fastest and experience the largest margin potential. We're monitoring this segment closely.• As part of its five-year plan released in 2013, Honeywell is targeting sales to be $46-$51 billion in 2018 in addition to its segment margin targets. Currency and slow global GDP growth have provided material headwinds to top-line growth, but the firm expects a growth inflection to begin at the end of 2016. Margin enhancing initiatives have worked very well for the company.• For 2016, Honeywell is expecting core organic sales to be approximately 1%-2% due to slow global economic growth. Though it is not expecting a material recovery in the global economy in 2017, the company is anticipating core organic growth to accelerate to 4%- 5% in the year.• We like CEO Dave Cote a lot, and the executive team's focus on investing in high ROI capex is all that stakeholders could ask for. Paying a competitive dividend is icing on the cake, and the company's M&A track record speaks for itself.Business QualityImage source: ValuentumEconomic Profit AnalysisIn our opinion, the best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital with its weighted average cost of capital. The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. Honeywell's 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 36.9%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 9.2%. As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT.In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimateImage source: ValuentumImage source: ValuentumCash Flow AnalysisImage source: ValuentumFirms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. Honeywell's free cash flow margin has averaged about 10.1% during the past 3 years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generation is relatively STRONG.The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. At Honeywell, cash flow from operations increased about 27% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures expanded about 13% over the same time period.Valuation AnalysisWe think Honeywell is worth $106 per share with a fair value range of $85-$127.The margin of safety around our fair value estimate is derived from an evaluation of the historical volatility of key valuation drivers and a future assessment of them. Our near-term operating forecasts, including revenue and earnings, do not differ much from consensus estimates or management guidance. Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 4.2% during the next five years, a pace that is higher than the firm's 3-year historical compound annual growth rate of 0.8%.Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 19.2%, which is above Honeywell's trailing 3- year average. Beyond year 5, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 2.2% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For Honeywell, we use a 9.2% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows.Image source: ValuentumImage source: ValuentumImage source: ValuentumMargin of Safety AnalysisImage source: ValuentumOur discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $106 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future were known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values.Our ValueRisk™ rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock. In the graph above, we show this probable range of fair values for Honeywell. We think the firm is attractive below $85 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $127 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion.Future Path of Fair ValueImage source: ValuentumWe estimate Honeywell's fair value at this point in time to be about $106 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart above compares the firm's current share price with the path of Honeywell's expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate.The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year 3 represents our best estimate of the value of the firm's shares three years hence. This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the firm's future cash flow potential change.The expected fair value of $133 per share in Year 3 represents our existing fair value per share of $106 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.This article or report and any links within are for information purposes only and should not be considered a solicitation to buy or sell any security.

4011148,25120,2016-10-10T08:29:38-04:00,"Honeywell issued a profit warning which was poorly received by investors.The company is seeing a decline in comparable sales despite actively engaging on portfolio management in order to boost exposure to faster growing segments.The strong track record, balance sheet and decent earnings yield should provide some support, making me an accumulator of the shares.","Honeywell (HON) issued a profit warning which sent a small shockwave through its share price.While the actual ¨size¨ of the profit warning is not that large, investors are fearful about the leadership of the company following the retirement of CEO Dave Cote, who delivered on excellent returns in the past. Another shock was the fact that just a month ago, Honeywell anticipated a modest improvement in core organic growth in the second half of the year. That is no longer the case.The reduced sales guidance and departure of Dave Cote creates uncertainty, something which investors simply do not like. The shortfall in sales is somewhat disappointing, after Honeywell has made some relatively expensive bolt-on acquisitions in recent times. These transactions were specifically designed to boost the organic growth profile, while the company divested underperforming assets.In this contest, a decline in sales is disappointing, although a strong balance sheet, diversified operations and decent earnings yield should support shares from here on.A Lot Of Moving Parts, Moving A Bit SlowerThere are a lot of moving parts to Honeywell´s business. The company closed the purchase of Intelligrated in August, it sold its Technology Solution government service business in September, and spun-off the resins and chemicals business under the name AdvanSix (NYSE:ASIX) in October.These moves were all anticipated by investors, having been announced in the past. What was not anticipated was the disappointing performance of the core business, in part offset by a favorable impact following new accounting standards with regards to stock-based compensation.This accounting change retroactively boosted first and second quarter earnings by a combined $0.07 per share. This benefit will be eaten by the headwinds in the core as well as some restructuring efforts. Amidst all these moving parts, third quarter earnings are seen at $1.60 per share, or $1.67 per share if one-time charges are being added back.How Bad Is The Warning?The drivers behind the shortfall in sales growth are widespread which is somewhat concerning. Honeywell cites lower shipments to both businesses and aviation OEMs, program delays in Defense & Space, as well as lower volumes in Productivity Solutions.Amidst these headwinds, third quarter sales are now seen at $9.8 billion, missing the initial guidance which called for revenues of $10.0-$10.2 billion. Comparable sales are now expected to fall by 3%, missing the initial guidance which called for flat to minus 1% growth.The $1.60 guidance misses the preliminary guidance for third quarter earnings of $1.67-$1.72 per share. A ten cent shortfall in earnings per share translates into a profit shortfall of $75 million on the back of a $300 million reduction in revenues. Despite the current turmoil, full year earnings are seen at $6.60 to $6.64 per share, marking healthy growth compared to 2015.I guess the profit warning is serious, as Honeywell guides for a 3% revenue shortfall. On the other hand, some of its aerospace can be volatile at times, offset by some darkening clouds for the wider aerospace complex. This headwind as well as uncertainty with regards to the upcoming election might be the start of something bigger, but it might easily turn out to be a transient factor as well.The Pro-Forma BusinessHoneywell is on track to post sales of $39.5 billion this year, but this number includes the $1.3 billion revenue contribution from what is now known as AdvanSix, the former polymer resins business of Honeywell.The company ended the second quarter with little over $5.0 billion in cash and equivalents while total debt stood at $14.0 billion. This $9 billion net debt load excludes $1.7 billion in pension and asbestos related liabilities. Note that this balance sheet position has not factored in the $1.5 billion purchase of Intelligrated yet. This is in part offset from the $266 million proceeds from the sale of the Government Service business, as well as the modest debt assumption of AdvanSix following the spin-off of that segment.In all likelihood, Honeywell operates with some $10 billion in net debt at this moment, or close to $12 billion if we include all the liabilities. The good thing is that EBITDA runs at roughly $8 billion a year, for a 1.2-1.5 times leverage multiple. These are low leverage levels for a well-run and diversified conglomerate.As shares lost over 7% in response to the profit warning, falling back towards $107, the earnings multiple has dropped towards 16 times earnings. This 6% earnings yield represents the highest earnings yield at which shares have traded in recent times and looks relatively appealing given the low interest rate environment at this point in time.Where Do We Go From Here?Honeywell has gone through an amazing transition under the leadership of Dave Cote who took the leadership role back in 2002. His timing was perfect as Honeywell´s stock has been lagging for quite a while on the back of disappointing margins, among others. Shares have risen from $20 at the time to levels surpassing the $100 mark by now.The main achievement of Mr. Cote has been great capital deployment and margin gains. Revenues have risen by a quarter over the past decade, translating into modest growth of 2% per annum. The real achievement has been the increase in margins, having risen from high-single digits, towards the high teens at the moment. Active portfolio management played a huge role in this process, as Honeywell found the capital to buy back a modest amount of stock as well.This achievement should not be taken for granted as slower growth could easily result in pressure on margins, especially if core comparable sales trend downwards. That is seen in the recent profit warning in which a $300 million sales shortfall hurts after-tax earnings by some $75 million. As Honeywell has made huge margin gains, the company trades at a 50% premium in terms of sales multiples versus its ten-year average. On the other hand, EBITDA and earnings multiples are in line, driven by the margin gains.The latest warning is somewhat of a concern, especially as investors stand to ¨lose¨ their long-term serving CEO. This is certainly the case as there are a lot of developments, following Cote´s failed attempt to acquire/merge with United Technologies (UTX) earlier this year.That said, Honeywell has been very pro-active with regards to change, runs stable operations and margins, is well capitalized, and the current valuation supports a 6% earnings yield. This gives the company a lot of firepower to pursue further growth, both organically and inorganically.This makes me a buyer on dips, although I will only establish a full position if shares fall towards a $90-$100 range."
4011486,101959,2016-10-11T13:10:17-04:00,Honeywell is a large industrial conglomerate that has grown at an excellent pace.Recent weak guidance has spooked investors and caused a sharp sell-off.This is a good entry point around fair value to this best-in-class company.,"Honeywell (NYSE: HON) was founded in 1885 as a thermostat company, and has morphed into the $85B industrial conglomerate they are today. They have operations in about 1,250 sites in 70 countries around the world, with 53% of their sales being generated outside the U.S.They operate in three segments:Source: Today's HoneywellOne of the things that popped out at me when I researched the company is their focus on the ""Honeywell User Experience."" They emphasize the research and effort they put in to understanding how the consumer uses their products, so that they can make them as intuitive as possible. They see themselves as ""the Apple (NYSE: AAPL) of the industrial world,"" in delivering an ecosystem of products that are easy to use and meet consumer needs.50% of forward growth is expected to come from high growth regions (HGR). Their expansion into international markets should be able to spur outsized returns in emerging markets with higher growth rates than the US. Management has projected double digit earnings growth in combination with their 4-6% CAGR in sales. Additionally, investors should expect their dividend growth rate to remain above earnings growth to raise payout ratio into the near future.Going forward, the company has deployed $8B to M&A activities, which should have decent prospects in the difficult environment industrials are facing. Their recent merger talks with United Technologies (NYSE: UTX) obviously fell through, but that has not stopped them from looking for possible deals like their recent $1.5B acquisition of Intelligrated, a supply chain and warehouse automation company. This company is expected to bolt-on to Honeywell's Safety and Productivity Solutions department and increase their offerings into the industrial automation segment with 15%+ sales growth projections in the e-commerce business. They will soon spin-off their resins and chemicals business into its own publicly traded company, called Advansix. Honeywell is pushing towards advanced software and higher margin businesses, whereas their resins and chemicals business had mostly matured and is looking to grow mostly consistent with GDP. Additionally, it is lower margin and that doesn't mesh well with their margin improvement goals.The goal has been margin improvement, and Honeywell has delivered. From a trough in 2011, margins have improved every year for a 128% increase since then. This has been important, with sales figures being soft in the current environment. Higher margins drive earnings growth when revenue increases can't.Sell-Off on FridayOn Friday, Honeywell revised earnings downards for the quarter from an expected $1.70 to $1.60 per share ($1.67 excluding a one-off stock compensation restructuring). This caused a steep sell-off in a well-run company, which may have been overdone. Unexpected revisions downwards for earnings outlooks generally cause a pretty rough dip, which fellow stalwart PPG Industries (NYSE: PPG) felt on Friday, as well. Honeywell's organic sales are expected to decline 3%. Their overall sales will increase 2%, including recent acquisitions, but the core business is hurting some. This seems to be the trend with several industrials and may be a leading indicator of worse to come. David Cote's remarks were about as upbeat as PPG's were on Friday:Impacts from this could be felt in United Technologies, General Dynamics (NYSE: GD), and Boeing (NYSE: BA), to name a few. With the quarter being revised down, Honeywell narrowed full-year guidance from $6.60-6.70 down to $6.60-$6.64. The lower end of this guidance would be a 8.2% increase YOY, which is not bad for a $87B company in rough industrial headwinds. Additionally, their Q4 results are expected to come in at 10-13% growth YOY. For this reason, I believe that the sell-off was likely overdone.FinancialsSource: GuruFocusHoneywell's ROIC-WACC spread has been increasingly positive over time, with ROIC maintained above 20%. This is excellent, and a token of some pride for the company. They mention it more than once in investor's materials, discussing capital allocation into growth prospects. I liked to hear that, considering some companies seem to ignore the poor returns their investments yield for shareholders.As would be expected, Honeywell's return on equity has been stable and increasing, just like their earnings. They are very profitable, and this metric shows their reliability.Honeywell generates a pretty substantial amount of free cash flow. Considering their capex has increased every year since 2009, it's nice to see that FCF has, as well. Their FCF yield using an EV of $95.92B (courtesy of GuruFocus) is ~4.46%, which is about average from the steady, dividend-paying companies I have been looking at recently. It's more than enough to service their $5.5B in long-term debt currently on the balance sheet.Source: CCC ListHoneywell's management has stated that they plan on growing the payout ratio, which will mean outsized dividend growth into the near future. With an EPS growth rate in the double digits, that bodes well for dividend growth investors (and for total returns!). With a payout ratio right now at a conservative 36% and solid FCF generation, I expect Honeywell to continue rewarding shareholders with increasing dividends, like they have for the last 5 years.ValuationSource: FASTGraphsI believe that Honeywell is trading around fair value today. Notice that the price decline brought them down into their normal range of a ~16.5X P/E multiple. With a company like Honeywell that I see as best-in-class, buying at fair value may be as good as it will get barring a recession or bear market. A hiccup in the growth story like last Friday presents an opportunity for the long-term investor to open or add to a position.If you liked this article, and would like to read more like it, please click the follow button next to my picture at the top and select real-time alerts.

3999247,24361,2016-08-12T15:07:07-04:00,"A CEO transition, tough end-markets, and a surprising attempt to buy UTX has shaken perceptions around Honeywell a bit, but this remains a well-run, growth-focused conglomerate.Prioritizing growth markets and deep internal integration (including controls and software) could give Honeywell an advantage if the coming years find growth harder to achieve across the global economy.Fair value remains in the $107-$115 range, suggesting Honeywell is an okay hold now and a stock to consider on pullbacks.","There is plenty to worry about these days, not only in a general economic/market sense but also more specifically to Honeywell (NYSE:HON). Can Darius Adamczyk fill the very large shoes that CEO David Cote will leave behind? How much turnover will occur at the senior leadership levels, and just how deep is Honeywell's management bench? Oh, and while we're at it, what's going to spur meaningful improvements in global productivity and capex investment such that growth can break out of the low-single-digits?If we're in a lower-for-longer scenario, I think Honeywell is a good companion for the journey. The shares are up about 13% from my last article and no longer trade at a discount to my fair value, but I still think the price works out to high single-digit total returns. What's more, if and when that lower-for-longer scenario does become the consensus, I think stocks like Honeywell, 3M (NYSE:MMM), Illinois Tool Works (NYSE:ITW), Danaher (NYSE:DHR), Rockwell (NYSE:ROK) and a few others will become darlings for their ability to drive relatively better performance.If It's Not Broken, Don't Break It!Since I last wrote about Honeywell, investors have had plenty to think about. The announcement that David Cote would retire in 2017 isn't strictly a surprise, though the timing was a little earlier than some might have expected. Likewise, I don't think naming Darius Adamczyk as the next CEO was a major surprise.That said, we're talking about change at the top for what has been a very well-run company. Since the end of February 2002, Honeywell shares have risen about 230%, better than almost all of the companies I would consider peers (Danaher and Rockwell are among the few outperformers). Along the way, the company has delivered good cash flow growth and built itself into an attractive conglomerate.With a new CEO coming in, there's going to be turnover and disruption. Alex Ismail, head of the ACS business, will be leaving the company and I would expect there could be other senior executives leaving as well (it's not uncommon during these transitions). While I think Honeywell has improved the depth of its management talent pool during Cote's tenure as CEO, you never really know until these executives get their chance at an expanded role.Honeywell also surprised a lot of investors when it had a go at United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) just after my last article. Honeywell had been guiding away from large transformative deals, but Cote claimed that the UTX approach was about pursuing a unique opportunity and an ""under-managed asset"" rather than a sea change in its M&A philosophy. I see no reason not to take this at face value; UTX would indeed have been an interesting opportunity and one that would be hard to replicate. That said, I don't quite believe that UTX would be the only large deal they'd consider - I do think a bid for a company like Rockwell could at least be conceivable under the right circumstances.Honeywell has also announced that it will be restructuring its ACS business into Home/Building Technologies and Safety/Productivity and spinning out the Resins and Chemicals segment as AdvanSix. Both of these moves seem logical to me. ACS is practically a conglomerate in its own right, and better arranging the business around sensors/controls and industrial safety and automation makes sense. As for AdvanSix, the outsized cyclicality and lower margins of the business don't really fit, and while there could be some dys-synergies from the spin, I think both entities will be better off post-spin.Will The Growth Come?Relative to Eaton (NYSE:ETN), Honeywell sounds more bullish on its organic growth prospects in the coming years. Business mix certainly could explain some of this, as Honeywell is strong in controls and sensors (versus hardware) and has been significantly scaling up its investments in software.Taking a step back, Honeywell remains a play on growing urbanization, energy efficiency and civil aviation and those trends still seem valid. While the aerospace/aviation market has lost a little luster recently, Honeywell still has contracts coming into play that should support healthy growth in the mid-single-digits. What's more, there's still the capacity to do deals here. So too in controls and automation, and this is where the company's investments in software could really pay off down the line. Weak gas processing is probably going to weigh on UOP (and thus Performance Materials) a little longer, but I believe products like Solstice show that Honeywell can develop growth drivers within this business and the Specialty segment remains focused on growth markets in electronics and fibers.Despite A Fair Bit Of Noise, Not Much ChangesThe last six months have given investors plenty to think about and react to, but I don't think anything has actually changed significantly in the business. I wasn't expecting a big recovery in 2016 back in February and I don't think 2017 is shaping up all that bullishly now. The acquisition of Intelligrated and the spin-out of AdvanSix weren't explicitly in my model, but both actions were consistent with my overall view of the company.Looking ahead, I think Honeywell will continue to focus on bulking up its automation, software, and control capabilities (while also possibly adding scale in aerospace). I also think more shifts in the portfolio are possible - I don't see Honeywell ""de-conglomerating,"" but I think management will be active in trimming away businesses that don't fit with the company's organic growth and/or margin targets (unless they provide vital support for other operations).I'm still looking for long-term revenue growth in the mid-4% area, with FCF growth in the 6-7% range. My DCF-based fair value goes down $0.50 to $107.50, but I don't consider that particularly material, and my ROE-based methodology still points to a fair value in the range of $115 (and maybe higher).The Bottom LineHoneywell is no longer a bargain relative to my expectations, but that doesn't make it a bad company. I think core industrial market growth is going to be hard to come by in the coming years, so Honeywell's focus on growth markets where it has technology and brand leadership should be valuable, as should an ability to consistently convert more revenue to free cash flow. Priced for a high single-digit return, I like Honeywell as a hold and would certainly consider adding shares on a pullback."
3997938,83156,2016-08-09T16:21:33-04:00,"Honeywell is in talks to acquire JDA Software Group.JDA is a supply chain management software company.Acquisition would make sense for HON, and is consistent with the firm's long-term vision for growth.","Honeywell (NYSE:HON) is in talks to acquire JDA Software Group, a supply chain management software company, for approximately $3 billion. With growth sluggish in many of HON's legacy businesses, the company is branching into new avenues of growth. Last month, HON acquired Intelligrated, a leading supplier of warehouse automation technologies, and the purchase of JDA Software would further expand HON's Sensing and Productivity Solutions division, which is shaping up to be HON's next major growth driver.JDA Software Group provides retail and supply chain solutions for more than 4,000 customers worldwide in the manufacturing, distribution, transportation, retail, and service industries. Solutions include category management, fulfillment, manufacturing and retail planning, store operations, and revenue management, which help clients minimize costs and optimize fulfillment efficiency. Earlier in the year, Moody's downgraded the credit rating of JDA's parent company based on the view that its ""debt levels ($2.2 billion) may be unsustainable"". The rating agency also noted risks associated with debt covenants limiting financial flexibility and access to revolving credit, as well as refinancing difficulties (significant debt maturities in 2017). Competition in the supply chain management industry has become more intense, adding to the pressures JDA is already up against. The company would likely be very receptive to a Honeywell acquisition and the cash resources it would bring.Given the mounting debt burden and increased competition, HON could pick up JDA Software at a decent price and further expand its Sensing and Productivity Solutions segment. With rising e-commerce activity creating strong demand for warehouse and logistics services, this division can become a key growth driver for Honeywell and offset sluggish growth in other areas. E-commerce has made companies such as JDA Software popular acquisitions targets, as retailers need to lower costs and modernize their distribution networks. As the percentage of transactions taking place online continues to increase, the market for supply chain solutions is expected to grow at a 10% annual rate through 2019. JDA's supply chain software would pair nicely with HON's growing portfolio of e-commerce based technologies, and would allow the company to expand its footprint in a secular-growth industry.The possibility of a JDA Software purchase provides some transparency into Honeywell's long-term strategy. Honeywell is sneakily becoming a tech company as it looks to expand its portfolio around software-based innovation. Like General Electric (NYSE: GE), Honeywell is seeking to transform how businesses operate by leveraging the ""Industrial Internet of Things."" According to honeywellprocess.com, the Industrial IoT, or ""Smart Manufacturing"", represents a ""digital transformation that shifts the sources of competitive advantage away from physical machinery toward information.""Industrial conglomerates such as Honeywell are often viewed in a negative light due to their sluggish growth nature and high cyclicality. Investors often apply what's known as a ""conglomerate discount"" to these firms due to the observation that such companies often operate a vast portfolio of unrelated businesses with few opportunities for synergies. While Honeywell has chased growth and expanded its portfolio through acquisitions, it has done so in a coordinated manner with a clear vision in mind, and repositioned its portfolio around secular growth trends. It appears that we have entered a new normal period of subdued global economic growth. In weak demand environments, technological advancement and innovation are especially crucial if firms are to boost productivity and growth. It looks like Honeywell is on track."
4011122,67985,2016-10-11T05:30:13-04:00,"Honeywell lowered earnings guidance due to acquisitions/divestitures, accounting changes and weakness in certain markets adversely affecting its businesses.Weakness in some of the company's businesses is due to lower shipments to business and general aviation OEMs and program delays and completions within the defense and space markets.The company stated it is experiencing weakness in emerging markets and that the oil industry has negatively impacted demand for its business aircraft and helicopters.We pointed out previously that Honeywell's failed acquisition of United Technologies was a red flag that the company attempted to cover up slowing growth in its businesses.The company's shares are becoming a greater value and will benefit long term from the business portfolio, improving end markets, product introductions, and high-growth region penetration.","Several months ago, we pronounced in our article relating to Honeywell's (NYSE:HON) failed attempt to takeover United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) that such takeover attempt was a smokescreen to cover up slowing growth at the company. We also noted our belief that the company's shares were expensive. With respect to HON's proposed UTX acquisition, we felt that such an acquisition was a red flag to potential investors that the company foresees slowing growth at some point in the intermediate term that was not yet reflected in earnings estimates. We asked in regard to such acquisition, ""Why else would HON make such an offer?"" We noted that all a UTX acquisition would have done was reward UTX shareholders, while HON would buy UTX to reduce costs through employee layoffs and the sale of lower revenue growth and profit product lines. We concluded that whenever we saw a large-capitalization company attempt to acquire a similar sized company that is typically a rival in many businesses, we are extremely skeptical of the benefits of such an acquisition.We continue to believe that an acquisition of a large-capitalization company by another large-capitalization company is a signal to us of weakness in the acquiring company. The acquiring company's weakness is typically its recognition of slowing revenue and earnings growth in the future. To solve such weakness, the acquiring company acquires a large competitor and then engages in achieving ""synergies,"" which usually means firing a lot of employees and divesting low-margin businesses at the acquired company. We believe that the attempted acquisition of UTX by HON was announced out of weakness and not strength. With our negative opinion of HON's attempted acquisition in mind, we were not surprised by the company's early October 2016 profit warning, which caused its shares to plummet by several percent in a single day. We must admit, however, that we see such investor sell-off of HON's shares as more motivated by profit-taking of expensive shares rather than the ""bad news"" lowering of earnings guidance.HON announced in early October 2016 an update to its previous guidance for the third quarter of 2016 to reflect the separation of its former automation and control solutions reporting division into two new reporting divisions; its acquisition of the leading supply chain and warehouse automation company Intelligrated; the sale of its HON technology solutions business (""HTSI"") government services business; the spin-off of its resins and chemicals business as AdvanSix Inc. (NYSE:ASIX); and lower outlooks for certain of its business divisions. The company also announced it elected to adopt the Financial Accounting Standards Board's Accounting Standards Update 2016-09 for stock compensation in third-quarter 2016. HON now expects third-quarter 2016 earnings to be $1.60 due to lower shipments to business and general aviation original equipment manufacturers (""OEMs""), continued program delays and completions in the domestic and international businesses within defense and space, and lower volumes in productivity solutions (part of the safety and productivity solutions business). It also initiated fourth-quarter earnings guidance of $1.74-1.78 (a 10-13 percent increase from the year-ago quarter), which excludes any pension adjustments and potential debt refinancing charges.The company updated its full-year 2016 earnings guidance, also excluding pension and debt costs, to $6.60-6.64, an 8-9 percent increase from the year-ago quarter. It also expects core organic sales to decrease 1-2 percent, down from a prior expected decrease of 1 percent. As noted above, HON's shares fell over 7 percent upon its announced updated guidance, due to weaker business jet and general aviation shipments. According to the company, weakness in emerging markets and the oil industry have negatively impacted demand for business aircraft and helicopters. Aerospace sales also dropped 6 percent to $3.6 billion in third-quarter 2016, and the company expects continued weakness for such sales into 2017. It noted further that demand for its hand-held scanners from logistics firms has also been weak. While some analysts believe HON's lowered guidance is not as bad as it looks, we believe such guidance gave investors an excuse to sell the company's already expensive shares. We also believe a strong overall market sell-off will give investors a chance to buy HON's shares under $100.While we believe HON's recently lowered earnings guidance should not be overlooked, we also know that the company's strategies, the businesses it participates in and market trends will allow it to drive long-term revenue and earnings growth. HON's future investments include innovative new products and technologies and geographical expansion, which will position the company's business portfolio for continued growth. Further, its balanced portfolio mix of short- and long-cycle businesses, improving end markets, new product introductions, penetration in high-growth regions, and productivity focus will all continue to drive long-term growth. In conclusion, HON will drive growth in its: 1) aerospace division through solid commercial aerospace original equipment manufacturer, aftermarket, and international defense growth; 2) automation and control solutions division through improved residential markets and acquisitions; 3) performance materials and technologies through a strong project backlog and new product introductions; and 4) transportation systems division through increased turbocharger penetration and rising auto sales. While we believe HON will benefit from long-term trends that favor its businesses, we also believe that investors will be able to buy the company's shares under $100 due to its recent lowered earnings guidance, and, as such, potential investors should wait to purchase the shares until a likely strong overall market sell-off.Our viewOur prior theme on HON's shares was that the company's shares were overpriced and that its failed acquisition of UTX was an attempt to cover up slowing revenue and earnings growth. With that in mind, its recently lowered earnings guidance was due to lower shipments to business and general aviation OEMs, continued program delays and completions in the domestic and international businesses within defense and space, and lower volumes in productivity solutions (part of the safety and productivity solutions business). As we also noted above, while the lowered earnings guidance is disconcerting, we also believe investors used such earnings guidance as an excuse to sell off overpriced HON shares. All is not lost, however, as potential HON investors are being presented with a better price entry point to purchase the company's shares. HON investors, when purchasing the company's shares at a more value-oriented price, will benefit long term due to the company's building environmental and combustion controls, and its turbocharger products businesses benefiting from a strong global trend toward energy efficiency. Investors will also benefit from the company's aerospace division excelling due to increasing global aircraft fleet sizes, demand for better fuel economy, and aftermarket demand. Further, the company's cost control efforts will increase its profit growth.HON has increased its revenue and profit growth and has a strong balance sheet that allows it generate substantial free cash flow that can be used for internal growth, acquisitions, and stock repurchases. The company also continues to execute its long-term strategy to expand operations in less costly parts of the world, while decreasing costs in higher-cost countries by closing plants, consolidating facilities, and implementing efficient manufacturing. The current price-to-earnings ratio for HON shares is about 16.90. The company's shares yield 2.1 percent and are due to an increase any day now. HON's forward price-to-earnings ratio is about 17.15 based on 2016 earnings estimates of $6.64 and 15.70 based on 2017 earnings estimates of $7.23. Its average price-to-earnings ratio in the previous 10 years is 16.00. Although HON shares are not expensive based on its 2017 earnings estimates, we recommend that a potential investor should wait for the shares to move into a range of about $97.95-101.25 to establish a full position (a forward price-to-earnings ratio in the range of 14.75-15.25 based on the 2016 earnings estimate).(Click ""Follow"" next to our contributor name at the top of this article to follow our upcoming articles on HON and more.)"
4005179,76785,2016-09-09T10:04:27-04:00,"This is a tiny spin-off that won't create a lot of value for Honeywell as a parent company.However, there could be some selling pressure in the first several days as institutions and retail investors dump shares.Keep an eye out, there could be a bargain come early October.","Recently on September 7th, Honeywell (NYSE:HON) further elaborated on the distribution details for its upcoming AdvanSix spin-off, with HON shareholders now knowing they will receive one share of AdvanSix (pending: ASIX) per twenty-five shares of Honeywell they hold. This announcement was a touch earlier than what most in the investment community expected given that management guided towards an early 2017 close in prior press releases. As a result, there is likely some scrambling going on by Honeywell shareholders to do their last bit of due diligence on the deal, and to understand the ramifications. I'm certain investors are more than a little curious in how this will impact their portfolios, and likely have plenty of questions on what this all means. While we don't know all the details, some granularity has been provided, which can be used to answer most of the simple questions surrounding this deal.Why Spin-Off?Honeywell's core business has been snipped and cut over the last decade, and now revolves around aerospace and automation/control solutions. Like many companies today, it has positioned itself as best it can in high-growth, high-margin business lines that offer some degree of economic moat. That doesn't mean that all of what Honeywell currently holds under its umbrella currently fits that bill, which is where this spin-off comes into play. The AdvanSix business (producing Nylon 6) is neither high growth nor high margin. For those unaware, Nylon 6 is a synthetic polymer used to produce plastics and fibers, and is used in products such as carpets, netting, and industrial packaging - nothing ground-breaking here.This is a business that has matured (annual growth at approximately global GDP growth rate) and is currently facing stiffening competition from international exporters, particularly the Chinese. Unlike some other chemicals product lines, AdvanSix can do little to differentiate itself from the international competition. It isn't surprising then that gross margins have never been strong, with the same story when it comes to bottom-line margins. Nonetheless, that doesn't make it a poor investment, as the entity does generate positive cash flows. Certainly, it might make good fit for value investors.That plays into why a split makes sense. Honeywell doesn't really fall into a ""value"" box - or at least, that isn't the way management is trying to present the company now. Honeywell presentations continue to paint the industrial giant as a business that will reap double-digit revenue and earnings per share growth over the next several years due to its exposure to cutting-edge technology and innovation. Nylon 6 production simply doesn't fit into that story, so it had to go.In my opinion, high-growth businesses and low-growth businesses need (and deserve) vastly different management guidance and strategy execution. Given the relatively small-size (and low-growth) nature of the AdvanSix business, it likely has been getting neglected by senior management, which could be responsible for some of the weakness there. After the spin-off, and with a new independent management structure, AdvanSix is free to pursue its own growth and strategic planning, without being thrust on the back-burner by Honeywell senior management. This very well could improve what looks to be a business in poor shape from a look-back perspective now.Likely AdvanSix Share Price Come October?It is actually pretty easy to back into a likely number here, starting with getting an EBITDA number estimate for the new standalone business. To get there, we need to get a sense of the operating profit of AdvanSix. This was not immediately clear when the spin-off was first announced as AdvanSix was consolidated within another operating segment at Honeywell, but now updated SEC filings have provided that granularity. We now know that the net income for what will be AdvanSix, which has confirmed that the business has been impacted by overseas competition. While the AdvanSix business generated $166M in net income in 2012 on $1.8B in sales, that number had fallen to $64M in net income on $1.3B in sales last year in 2015 as end prices (granted, also input costs) fell. Note that these numbers do not factor in corporate overhead costs associated with operating as a standalone business, which will not be insubstantial. These additional costs are likely balanced out by some light improvement in earnings as the business has benefited from some pricing improvement this year. Given management estimates for those new standalone business costs and what we know regarding effective taxes, full-year 2016 operating income should be in the $120M range.Investors can't forget about debt. The company will not get a clean slate when it starts up operations. AdvanSix intends to raise $270M in term loans, substantially all of which will be remitted to Honeywell. This raises red flags for many investors, but in this case, there is no cash grab; it is simply returning money to the parent company in return for assets being distributed. AdvanSix will also enter into a $155M revolving credit facility, from which it will draw $40M to fund working capital. As a result, net debt will be $310M almost immediately subsequent to the spin-off. Total annual interest costs should be around the $10M range in the first fiscal year (assuming a blended 3.1% interest rate, in line with company expectations). This debt burden is quite reasonable, as the resulting net debt/EBITDA leverage is low and interest coverage is sizeable.EBITDA for the business will likely then be in $165M range ($36M in prior-year depreciation/amortization as a baseline to our $130M EBIT number). Given most peers with similar products and positions in their earnings cycles are currently trading at between 5-8x EV/EBITDA (Ube Industries on the low side, larger, more diversified and profitable BASF on the high side), likely enterprise value here is in the range of $1.2B (roughly a 7x multiple). Back out the net debt position ($310M), and the resulting market cap is in the $890M range. On 30.5M shares (25 to 1 on the 762M current shares outstanding of Honeywell), and I would suspect AdvanSix will open trading at around that $29-30/share level. I'd also call that a solid fair value number. Each turn of EBITDA multiple valuation (either way) would add or subtract roughly $4.00/share from the share price. Shareholders should be aware there likely will be some underlying volatility, given that many Honeywell shareholders may look to dump what they view as a weak asset.An Aside On Honeywell's Share PriceShareholders are likely not to notice this blip. As far as spin-offs go, this is on an incredibly small scale when it comes to the size difference between the parent company pre and post spin-off. The AdvanSix business is such a small portion of Honeywell's earnings (roughly 2% of both EBITDA and enterprise value) that the impact on the underlying share price should result in just a small dip when the business is divested. Given the $270M cash payment that will end up coming Honeywell's way, along with some moderate corporate cost savings and potential perceived ""streamlining"", I wouldn't be surprised if Honeywell shares have little to no reaction to the consummation of this corporate event.The Takeaway - Go Bottom Fishing?The opportunity here, I believe, comes more for those willing to bottom-fish a spin-off that might see some immense selling pressure when opened up for public trading. Selling will be driven by institutional investors who might not want to hold a small-cap position on their books (or flat out are not allowed to), and also from retail investors who, quite frankly, will just push the sell trigger on a business they know little about. Deal-sizing impacts retail investors as well - given the fractional nature of this deal, retail investors might end up with incredibly small lots that they are going to be apt to sell.This could be good news for savvy investors. Backtesting a spin-off buying strategy (especially with some restrictions on avoiding debt/leverage to eliminate the junk) has generally produced fairly positive results in producing alpha, particularly in this size range (around $1B market cap). I think investors should keep a careful eye on potentially picking up AdvanSix as a potential value play - it will certainly be on my radar."
3997893,65113,2016-08-09T15:49:20-04:00,Honeywell International continues to maintain a solid business model in spite of lower short-term sales.The company's acquisition of Intelligrated allows for diversification from the energy sector through a greater focus on the supply chain management industry.I continue to take a bullish view on Honeywell International.,"CURRENT RATING: BUYIn my previous coverage of Honeywell International (NYSE:HON) last January, I had argued the company to be significantly mispriced at the price of $97.11 at the time. The stock has since made significant gains, up to $116.04 at the time of writing:Among the reasons I cited for the evident mispricing of this stock were vibrant increases in earnings and free cash flow while price remained stagnant. Moreover, an expected growth rate of 15 percent in sales in emerging markets (compared to 6 percent growth in developed markets) is due to increasing urbanization in such areas, a trend that is not expected to cease any time soon in spite of some short-term headwinds.In spite of recently lower revenue expectations across both developed and emerging markets, I continue to be optimistic on Honeywell International. One of the major reasons for lower revenue expectations stems from a fall in organic sales in its core business areas. However, I see this as being largely macroeconomic related. For instance, a fall in oil and gas prices has understandably softened demand for the company's aerospace products, in addition to performance materials and technologies taking a hit due to lower gas processing, licensing and equipment sales. In general, a fall in the energy markets has hit sales given that the company's products are largely energy-related.However, I continue to remain optimistic on the long-term outlook for the company. Honeywell has continued to make large-scale acquisitions in order to expand its product line, and I not only see this as widening the company's customer base long term, but also by allowing Honeywell to lower the negative impact of lower energy prices long term. For instance, the company's agreement to acquire material handling and software engineering company Intelligrated for $1.5 billion allows for further penetration into the supply chain management industry by gaining access to expertise in areas such as robotics and warehouse execution systems.From a competitive standpoint, growth in earnings and free cash flow per share on a five-year basis continues to be the highest among its competitors:To conclude, I see Honeywell International as a company that has a solid future ahead. In spite of lower sales figures, I see the company as a strong leader in its industry and any potential weakness could represent a good buying opportunity."
3997736,97486,2016-08-09T12:09:28-04:00,"HON has always been an attractive industrial conglomerate.
        Q2 2016 results were not entirely well-received by investors with organic growth declining and guidance revised down.
        I argue that despite organic growth woes, HON's cash flow strength leave their acquisition-fuelled growth potential in tact even if organic growth continues to struggle.","Honeywell (NYSE:HON) has always been one of my favorite industrial conglomerates out there. With impressive fundamentals and a nice, balanced mix of industrial sectors handled by them it is an attractive company:Yet its recent Q2 results were not entirely received favorably by investors. Consequently the share price took something of a hit on their announcement on 22 July:As we shall see, I can understand investor's frustration with the results. Yet here I explain why I think that Honeywell remains a compelling investment.What's The problem?On first glance it may not be transparently obvious why investors were not entirely delighted by the results. Indeed, the headline reported figures started off well. Honeywell, it seemed, saw further growth emerge:Sure, it is hardly world-beating levels of growth. Yet in the current volatile environment, the ability to pull out mid-single digit growth is an admirable (and valuable) trait. So where's the problem?A large part of the problem emerges when we look at Honeywell's organic growth. Since Q4 2015 the company has seen its organic revenue struggle to post positive results with Q2 2016 seeing a particularly unpleasant looking 2% drop:All the more galling is the fact that the struggling organic revenue performance in Q2 2016 was caused by across the board weak segmental organic performance:This contrasts to when I looked at their Q1 results in which organic revenue weakness was limited to the Performance Materials & Technologies segment.Consequently, the company has felt the need to revise its organic revenue growth predictions for the full-year from between 1% and 2% to simply ~1%. They also issued a revenue warning on the reported front as well. Revising predictions from between $40 and $40.6 billion, chipping off $300 million from both the high and low end of these predictions.All in all, this has meant that Honeywell's acquisitions have served and will continue to serve as important catalysts for growth at the company. Rather than supporting organic revenue growth, acquisitions therefore appear to be disguising organic revenue declines.I can therefore understand investors' concern especially as Q2 2016's performance raises the potential for similar weakness in future quarters driving guidance lower. Yet for me, even if this was the case, this possibility hardly detracts from the long-term appeal of Honeywell. Let me explain why.Cash Flow Remains StrongEssentially Honeywell's growth has always been underpinned by its acquisition activities. For some companies this can be a serious concern especially if it is serviced not by internally generated cash but by external debt.Here is where Honeywell continues to impress even in light of organic revenue struggles. Honeywell's always impressive cash flow generation continues to reveal its strength:Certainly, looked at from the 6-month perspective above it is clear that operating cash flow and FCF was weaker in H1 2016 than in H1 2015. However, this disguises their actual Q2 2016 FCF performance which was much stronger:Consequently, although their reported and organic revenue guidance had to be revised down, they stuck to their $4.6 to $4.8 billion FCF guidance. This, I think, is fair and is in line with my own estimations of Honeywell's FCF generation which would suggest a figure (admittedly) towards the lower end of their guidance.My point is that Honeywell has the FCF firepower to continue to lean on acquisitions to drive their revenue growth over the short term. Certainly, this would not be a happy state of affairs should it continue indefinitely. Yet I have little doubt that Honeywell's record for well-chosen and well-executed smaller acquisitions will continue to serve them and their shareholders well over the long-term despite stuttering organic performance over the short-term.Dividends Not Holding BackWhat is more, shareholders do not look likely to be particularly disappointed in the shorter-term either. Honeywell has offered a pretty compelling shareholder return story over the last few years through a combination of dividends and share buybacks:Yet, here is the thing, despite this generous policy they have not really overly stretched their FCF to date with their combined buybacks and dividends never eating up all their available FCF.Honeywell can therefore continue on its acquisition path without compromising its balance sheets or its generous shareholder-returns policy which should also aid in generating robust EPS growth as well as providing healthy total shareholder returns to investors.Certainly, you may be able to get a more generous dividend yield than Honeywell's ~1.85% in the conglomerate space. Yet it remains very well-covered by FCF with plenty of room for further growth:Indeed, with the current quarterly dividend running at $0.595 per share, the forward yield is sitting at around 2%.ConclusionClearly it is far from ideal that Honeywell is having to lean so heavily on acquisitions to drive growth. With organic growth increasingly hard to come by as we have moved through the quarters so far in FY2016, it appears that acquisitions will become even more important.Yet what is certainly true is that their cash flow continues to provide ample opportunity for this to continue. What is more, their excellent record for well-chosen and well-executed acquisition should steel investors even further.The ride with Honeywell looks likely to be a little rougher in the near-future than it has been of late. Yet it remains a comparatively stable one. Sure, organic revenue is stalling. Sure, a new CEO (Darius Adamczyk) is on the horizon in March 2017 after over 14 years under David Cote.Both matters may well unsettle investors for a little while yet. Certainly negative organic growth is unwelcome and Adamczyk's arrival after such a long-term incumbent despite him being an insider will cause some disruption and change. What I doubt is that it will materially affect Honeywell's cash flow strength or its ability to select and deliver intelligent acquisitions. Organic growth will return, in the meantime Honeywell has more than enough muscle to push reported growth higher and reward investors at the same time.NotesUnless otherwise stated, all graphs and the calculations contained within them were created by the author.

3991446,39011,2016-07-26T09:15:31-04:00,"HON reported another quarter of strong operating margin growth.HON's fundamentals are constantly improving and with them, EPS continues to rise.At just 16 times next year's earnings, HON is a good buy for short term and long term owners.","Honeywell (NYSE:HON) is a stock that has grown on me in recent quarters as my love affair with General Electric (NYSE:GE) ended abruptly after that company decided to get out of the banking business. Honeywell is the epitome of steady growth and it has continued to perform beautifully, both from a fundamental and stock price perspective. With HON hitting $120 prior to the Q2 report, optimism was high. But now that the report is out and HON has dipped a bit, I think it may be another buying opportunity.While a little less diversified than GE, HON is still very much a conglomerate. That means good things for its total revenue as weakness in one area can be offset by strength in another. Certainly, this is part of the appeal to me when looking at HON and in Q2, that diversification paid off. In addition, Honeywell's relentless pursuit of higher margins has quite literally paid huge dividends over time and in Q2, we saw yet more evidence that effort is continuing unabated.The Aerospace segment saw a marginal decline in revenue but its operating margins were up 60bps to 20.9%. PMT saw more pronounced weakness as its sales fell 3% and its operating margins also fell 20bps. This led to a decline in segment profits that were more than offset by huge strength in ACS (which is now being split, starting in Q3). Revenue was up 9% and while reported operating margins were down 20bps, excluding acquisitions, that number was up 50bps. While we can't just exclude acquisitions for reporting purposes, it does give us an idea of just how well HON's margin improvement efforts are working. This strong performance in margins led to a higher profit percentage in this year's Q2 compared to last and this has been the long term story for Honeywell.In Q2, it was business as usual for Honeywell; moderate revenue gains along with excellent cost controls and efficiency efforts produced higher profits. In addition to that, HON's excess FCF allows it to return a ton of cash to shareholders each year via dividends and buybacks. HON's average diluted share count during this year's Q2 was down 20.5 million against last year, good for about 2.6% of the float. That's not earth shattering but every little bit helps and when you combine HON's efficiency efforts with a perpetually lower share count, constantly rising EPS is the result.HON saw fit to warn on sales for the rest of the year, although the warning was ever so slight. HON lowered its sales range by $300 million and while that's a lot of money where I come from, on HON's $40B+ revenue base, it is basically a rounding error. If the reason the stock sold off was because of the revenue reduction, that makes no sense. At any rate, that gives us another chance to buy HON at a little more reasonable valuation, taking full advantage of its ~13% FCF yield.Looking forward, HON's prospects are much rosier than that of General Electric, which is struggling to produce even flat Industrial revenue on an organic basis. Analysts see HON hitting steady mid-single digit revenue growth levels for the foreseeable future, something GE certainly envies given its flat-as-a-pancake revenue outlook.In addition, constant margin improvement and buybacks have HON's EPS trajectory seeing a beautiful upward slope, also superior to GE.Source: Simply Wall St.HON's EPS is slated to grow at a high single digit rate for the next few years but given any sort of meaningful improvement in revenue, that number could move higher. It assumes the same sort of buyback pace - three or four percent - and roughly the same level of revenue growth. But remember that HON is still seeing sizable improvements in its operating margins - 4.5% in Q2 - so there is certainly some upside possible to those estimates. While 5% operating profit improvements can't last forever, there is absolutely no evidence that HON is slowing down in that space and for that reason, it seems the bias to HON's current EPS estimates is to the upside.HON is going for only 16 times next year's estimates - far cheaper than GE - and while the latter is likely going to grow EPS at a slightly faster rate thanks to its huge buyback, HON's fundamentals are superior in virtually every way. And with GE already so expensive, it makes little sense to overpay for a similar stock that has less attractive fundamentals. GE is growing EPS via financial engineering; HON is just growing EPS and that's a big difference.At 16 times next year's earnings and a small sell-off thanks to a meaningless revenue reduction, HON looks very attractive here. The stock still has the support of the rising 200DMA - which is currently at $107 - and to be honest, I want the stock to trade down to that level. Should it do so, it will likely bounce right off of the 200DMA and move higher so I'm hoping for the chance to buy HON at that level. It may not happen but either way, HON is going a lot higher over the long term; this is a stock you can buy for your retirement portfolio and just forget about it. HON is just that good."
3991097,50662,2016-07-25T07:49:43-04:00,"Honeywell saw its net income increase, but adjusted free cash flow decrease in the first semester of this year.This could indicate pricing pressure on a cash flow basis, but it's also possible the company's financial year was front-loaded on capex and pension expenses.Honeywell isn't very expensive (even with the lower free cash flow), but I obviously want to see the cash flow trend reversed.The acquisition of Intelligrated could be a smart move in the longer run, considering that company was able to increase its revenue at a 13% CAGR.","IntroductionHoneywell (NYSE:HON) is one of those household names which rarely disappoint, either in terms of the quality of its products, or its financial performance. It's not very surprising to see the company's share price was trading close to its 52-week high before losing some ground after the announcement of its financial results, wherein it confirmed a lower revenue guidance. Does this jeopardize Honeywell's future? Or is the market overreacting, allowing investors to have another chance to get in?HON data by YChartsThe first half of the year was very decentHoneywell had a decent first half of the year and second quarter. The company's total revenue increased by 2% to $10B. That's very encouraging, but unfortunately this revenue increase was entirely caused by non-organic incremental revenue as the core organic revenue fell by approximately 2%. Despite the total revenue growth of 2%, the COGS increased by just 1%, and as the SG&A and interest expenses also remained within control, Honeywell's pre-tax income increased from $1.66B to $1.76B, a 5.6% increase.Source: SEC filingsThanks to the higher pre-tax income, the company's net income also increased by approximately 6% to $1.28B, resulting in an EPS of $1.68, bringing the total EPS of the first half of the year to $3.22, which is almost a 10% increase compared to the first semester of last year. The higher net income also caused the company's board of directors to hike the dividend by approximately 15%, and Honeywell is now paying $0.595 per share per quarter, resulting in a dividend yield of approximately 2%. Indeed, Honeywell isn't a 'dividend king', but you can be sure the dividend is sustainable, as Honeywell is just spending a small part of its adjusted free cash flow on paying its dividend.Source: Company presentationHoneywell's unadjusted operating cash flow was quite comparable to the results of the first semester of last year, and even on an adjusted basis (which doesn't take the changes in the company's working capital into consideration), the difference is quite small. In the first six months of this year, Honeywell's adjusted operating cash flow was $2.8B versus $2.83B in the first half of last year. That's indeed approximately 1% lower than last year, so this could indeed mean Honeywell's cash flows are a little bit under pressure, especially as the total capex in the first half of the year increased to $475M.Source: SEC FilingsThis capex increase does give you a better overview of how Honeywell's free cash flow has been decreasing. Whereas the company generated $2.42B in free cash flow in H1 FY 2015, this amount fell to $2.33B in the current financial year (still on an adjusted basis). Sure, a 4% drop in the adjusted free cash flow isn't anything to panic about, but keep in mind this year's first semester contained one additional day (February 29th) versus last year, so I would have been expecting a slightly better result than a 4% drop in the company's free cash flow.Should the revenue warning worry you?This doesn't mean Honeywell's dividend is in jeopardy, considering the total cost of the dividend was just $960M, and the more shares the company repurchases (and cancels), the lower the total cash outflow will be on the dividend payments. Even after the 4% decrease in the adjusted free cash flow, Honeywell's payout rate is still just 40%, so the margin of safety is still pretty high.HON Dividend Per Share (Quarterly) data by YChartsHoneywell has also repurchased a net amount of 10 million shares since the end of the previous financial year, which is approximately 1.3% of the total amount of outstanding shares. Should the company continue to buy back stock at this pace, it will be able to retire 2.5% of its share count, further reducing the cash outflow to be spent on dividends.That being said, the company's revenue warning is interesting. Sure, a $300M reduction in the anticipated revenue could easily be dismissed if your total annual revenue is approximately $40B, meaning the guidance is revised by less than one percent, but the reduced operating cash flow and free cash flow does worry me a little bit. Keep in mind that last year, Honeywell generated approximately 54% of its full-year adjusted free cash flow in the first half of the year, so unless there will be some sort of 'catch up' move, I don't think Honeywell will be able to beat last year's results.Investment thesisHoneywell will have to perform very strong in the second half of this year (and I hope the company's focus on projects with a high ROI will continue to yield positive results), but it will be very tough to generate $4.5B in adjusted free cash flow. As the pressure on the revenue is going hand in hand with the lower adjusted free cash flows, it does look like Honeywell is facing increasing pricing pressure on its products.This does create the need to diversify, and that's why the new acquisition of Intelligrated could be a good move, considering Honeywell's management team disclosed it's targeting a market that is growing at a high single digit percentage per year. From the conference call:Honeywell will very likely need Intelligrated to boost its free cash flow again, and with a current EBITDA of approximately $125M per year, this acquisition will immediately start to pay off. Sure, it's not a cheap one (HON is paying 12 times the EBITDA), but Intelligrated was able to increase its revenue by 13% on an annual basis.Right now, Honeywell isn't expensive based on an anticipated free cash flow yield of approximately 5.4%, but the stagnating (actually decreasing) free cash flow in the first half of the year does hold me back on pulling the trigger. I will keep an eye on Honeywell, but I'd like to see the free cash flow result in the third quarter (with a special focus on the pension-related cash flows and the H2 capital expenditures) before making any decisions. I do think Honeywell is a good addition to a value portfolio on a potential pullback."
3989141,96536,2016-07-18T12:45:03-04:00,"Honeywell International traces it's roots back to 1885 and has been growing ever since.Despite this mature business, shares of HON are trading near all-time highs.This article explores the financial trends underlying this business and if the success can continue.","Honeywell International Inc (NYSE:HON) has roots stretching back over 125 years. Incredibly, its inception traces to 1885, when an Albert Butz patented the furnace regulator and alarm. Today, HON is an S&P 500 component conglomerate. It's tough to convey the breadth of their businesses. But if you keep your eyes open, you'll see HON products everywhere, starting with your thermostat.Since its humble beginnings, HON has grown into a global business, operating in 70 countries. Mergers, new product development and acquisitions have helped HON diversify into a wide variety of industrial segments, employing over 22,000 engineers in the process.Over the years, HON has maintained a vision of a secure, comfortable, cleaner and more efficient future. To me, that ideal sounds pretty good. And as you can see below, striving for this aspiration has been good for HON shareholders too. Here's a long-term look, not including dividends:Pretty good, right? I'm always interested in older mature companies that are trading near all-time highs. And the reason I referred to the historic growth record of HON at the outset, is because this longitudinal look is how I like to analyze companies. If there are consistently strong operating trends, as shown by financial results over a multi-year period, then we can quantify the apparent competitive advantages and long-term track record. In the case of HON, I'm optimistic. So let's get into the numbers.Honeywell's Financial History:For starters, let's look at the top line. Revenue numbers provide a look at market demand, and how the company is meeting it. Below are the sales numbers for HON over the last 10 years, and on a trailing-twelve month basis.Overall, you can see that HON has grown sales over the period. But it was hit by the recession, and the performance since 2014 has been less than impressive due to lower US government revenue. And international growth was impacted by currency headwinds. I don't think these challenges present permanent impediments to the business. (source) So I'll be watching to see if the longer-term trend upwards can resume.But sales aren't the whole picture. HON should be earning healthy profits from their sales, especially given their patented and complex products and well-known brand. Here's how the numbers check out:To my eye, the earnings picture actually looks better than the top line. So what's driving the difference? Well, HON management has been investing in efficiency and cost-reductions. The company is also divesting from non-core businesses (source). So we should see improving margins, and therefore earnings. A quick look at the numbers confirms this:The healthy gross margins speak to the competitive position of HON. But even more importantly for me, the margin trends are consistent. This indicates the business is stable and insulated from too much competition. It also means I'm more comfortable projecting the other trends we've seen into the future.Looking ahead, and given the strategic divestitures and management's pursuit of category leadership, I'm reasonably confident these margins, and therefore earnings, can be maintained in the future. The operating and gross margin trends both reflect how the company is focusing on its most profitable segments and getting better at executing these sales more efficiently.Now, it's great the company is making money. But as shareholders with a long-term focus, we're curious to learn what management is doing with those profits. And luckily for dividend-growth investors, HON has been a compelling total return opportunity, over the last 10 years.As you can see, dividends have grown, almost, without interruption. And over the same period, the payout ratio has been relatively steady. The consistency of these trends once again indicates the company will be able to continue growing returns to shareholders in the years to come. The company has also been a buyer of its own shares over the last 5 years, keeping shareholders from being diluted.One potential concern is that HON does have a modest debt load. However, the balance sheet is by no means stretched. And HON has maintained a positive working capital position for all of the last 10 years.So overall, I think the financial trends in HON reflect the stable, profitable and consistent business that we've come to expect. It appears the company does have some characteristics of an equity-bond type business. That said, there are still some risks to be aware of.Risks for HON Equity Owners:Like every investment opportunity, HON comes with risks. For me, I think the biggest risk I see is margin stagnation, or worse, contraction. HON has been consistently driving margins higher and while I don't think it's likely they'll fall much from here, I do think there's risk of a plateau. If top line results don't improve, this could be a big headwind to future shareholder returns.Another risk of buying shares of HON is the valuation. Although I think the company is a slow and steady grower, that doesn't necessary justify a large premium to the broader market and a price tag of almost 18 times cash flow.As you can see, in the case of a sustained economic downturn its likely HON's valuation will fall in-line with the market. So for those of you feeling disciplined about price and patient, or bearish on the economy in general, you may want to hold off on shares of HON right here, right now.Conclusion: Holding HONI'm happy to own shares of HON from lower prices. And I'm happy to keep holding them here. While I believe the stock is fully valued, I don't think there are big strategic risks to the business. Given the strong and consistent operating trends, I'm confident HON can continue to compound capital for shareholders going forward. I would also look to add shares on a broader pullback.But that's just some of my analysis on HON. What do you think about this stock? Are you comfortable having it as a part of your portfolio?"

Therefore, it should offer lower valuation, but actually its P/E ratio is almost 20, which is very high in my opinion.In this article, I will analyze one of its peers, Honeywell (NYSE:HON), and compare it to PH. I intend to show that HON is a better investment than PH, and it is also a suitable investment prospect for dividend growth investors at the current valuation. The company offers strong fundamentals and is valued fairly.Honeywell operates as a diversified technology and manufacturing company worldwide. Its Aerospace segment offers aircraft engines, integrated avionics, systems and service solutions. The company's Automation and Control Solutions segment offers environmental and energy, and sensing and productivity solutions. Its Performance Materials and Technologies segment provides catalysts and adsorbents, equipment and consulting services for the petroleum refining, gas processing, petrochemical, and other industries.FundamentalsThe industrial sector is highly competitive and cyclical, making it complicated to grow revenues. However, HON managed to grow its revenues slowly and steadily over the past five years. In the last two years, the top line declined a little bit, but when looking at the whole five-year time frame, the growth is impressive. On the other hand, PH suffers from declining revenues, which was very steep in 2015. The turnaround the company started sacrifices both its top and bottom line.EPS shows a much clearer comparison. PH managed to grow it modestly until 2015, only to see it plunging steeply over the past 18 months. HON on the other hand showed amazing EPS growth, and the company almost doubled its EPS in the past five years while PH had its EPS declining by 15%.HON is also poised to grow, and according to the guidance issued by the company, the EPS will grow another 10% this year. According to S&P, it will grow its income by 8% annually in the medium term, which sounds great to me.HON Revenue (TTM) data by YChartsThe dividend is probably where these two companies are almost equal. While PH managed to grow its distribution by 70%, which is great, HON grew it by almost 80%. HON also did it without expanding the payout ratio, as its EPS grew even faster. PH saw its payout ratio more than doubling and reaching almost 50%. The yield is where PH dominates. Since mid-2015, HON offers lower yield to investors. However, I still prefer the dividends paid by HON, as it has much more room to grow with some payout expansion and EPS growth.HON Payout Ratio (TTM) data by YChartsPH used more of its cash flow for buybacks. Buybacks help companies boosting their EPS, and they are used ideally when valuation is low. PH is buying its own shares to mitigate the decline in its EPS. HON on the other hand is using buybacks modestly, and I can understand it, as it manages to grow its EPS organically extremely fast. I still hope that it will use some of its capital for buybacks, especially when the dividend payout is pretty low. I believe that I managed to show that HON has superior fundamentals when compared to PH and great fundamentals in general.HON Shares Outstanding data by YChartsValuationAfter showing the better fundamentals, I will show where HON has the biggest advantage over PH; its valuation. The valuation of HON seems compelling. We have a growing company with strong fundamentals with pretty fair P/E ratio. The valuation is roughly where it was over the past year, and the forward P/E for 2016 is just 17.11, seems fair for a company which is forecasted to grow at high single digits. I find it fair, and attractive at any dip in the current volatile stock market.HON PE Ratio (TTM) data by YChartsWhen compared to the valuation of PH, it becomes even more attractive. I expected PH to trade for lower P/E due to its lower growth rate. However, I found out the opposite, and it is hard for me to explain it. The market probably has a lot of confidence in the turnaround that PH is going through. However, I prefer the company with the stronger fundamentals and lower valuation.OpportunitiesThe first opportunity here is not a specific growth prospect, but rather a simple element of investing. Initiating a position with a company that grows pretty quickly and trades for a fair valuation is usually a good deal for the long-term investors. You initiate a position, and let the compounding do its work for you. HON offers exactly that, a company that operates in the growing industry of aerospace, trades for fair valuation, and offers growth.Moreover, as I pointed in my introduction, HON is very diversified in its revenues. Not only the company has different segments, but it is also a leader in many of them, especially aerospace, which is a fast-growing industry. Being a leader allows HON to increase prices and expand its margins and its profitability.United Technologies (NYSE:UTX), one of HON strongest peers, also believe that the company shows great growth prospects. Therefore, it wanted to merge the two companies and offered a premium over the current price. I believe that HON offers a very diversified company with worldwide presence, fair valuation, and growing fundamentals.RisksHON might suffer from several setbacks in the short term mainly due to a strong USD and other unfavorable currency exchange rates. They might damage the EPS over the short term. As much of its top line and bottom line come from outside the U.S., it is more sensitive to forex, but I am not worried about it as it is usually only a short-term background noise that doesn't affect the value of the company.A slowdown in the global economy can offer a medium-term threat to the company's growth. The cyclical nature of this industry makes it more sensitive to the world GDP growth, and therefore, the macro situation should be taken seriously.HON is getting larger and larger, and as it grows, it is much harder to grow through acquisitions. You need to find larger targets in order to influence the top and bottom line. You also have to find them trading at attractive prices. Finding large companies at attractive valuation is a challenge that HON is now facing.ConclusionEven when looking at the risks and rewards offered by HON and PH, PH is riskier. It must have a successful turnaround to grow. It will probably succeed eventually, but it might take longer than expected. Therefore, I believe that HON offers better value for the risks it holds. Combining it with the better valuation and fundamentals, I prefer HON over PH.HON is a great company that grows quickly. It offers stability and leadership in its industry, and all of that trades for fair value. I am interested in initiating a position in this company at any dips. Not every day I can find a growing company for a fair price, especially in the current market."
3985490,101543,2016-06-30T10:34:59-04:00,Honeywell is planning to spin off its resins and chemical business.AdvanSix (spin-off company) will be a much smaller organization and is trying to return to growth.It appears current Honeywell shareholders could get the spin-off company for free.,"Honeywell International (NYSE: HON) is spinning off its resins and chemical businesses and naming the new corporation AdvanSix. It expects to complete this spin-off in early 2017. AdvanSix will be a top manufacturer of Nylon6, which is a polymer resin. Also, it will be the largest single-site producer of caprolactam.AdvanSix filed form 10 on May 12, 2016, with the SEC. The transaction will be a tax free distribution of AdvanSix shares to Honeywell shareholders. More detail will be coming, such as share spin-off ratio and record date. What I mean by share spin-off ratio is this will determine how many shares of AdvanSix will be distributed for owning 1 share of HON. The ticker symbol has yet to be disclosed.Revenue Source OverviewNylon6 is a polymer resin used to produce engineered plastics, fibers, filaments and films; it will in turn help create many different end products, such as automotive components, carpet, industrial packaging, sports apparel, etc. Nylon6 accounted for 24% of total sales at $312 million in 2015.Caprolactam is a chemical compound that is essential for producing Nylon6. The company owns the largest single-site producer of caprolactam in Hopewell, Virginia. The company uses caprolactam internally and sells caprolactam to customers who manufacture polymer resins or produces other nylon products. This is a highly fragmented industry, but with its scale it is able to use operating leverage to produce strong business performance. This segment accounted for $247 million or 19% of total sales in 2015.Ammonium sulfate fertilizer is a co-product in the manufacturing process of the caprolactam. Ammonium sulfate is a fertilizer that is used by farmers around the world. For every 1 pound of caprolactam that is produced, the company produces 4 pounds of ammonium sulfate. The company mostly markets and sells to North American and South American resellers. Fertilizer sales for 2015 were $351 million or 27% of total sales.Acetone and other intermediate chemicals: These are other co-products that are produced during the chemical processes. The largest byproduct is acetone which is used by customers for the production of adhesives, paints, coatings, solvents, herbicides and other engineered plastic resins. Sales in 2015 were $390 million or 30% of total sales.Region73% of total sales were within the United States in 2015. Currency headwinds have been an issue for multinational organizations and AdvanSix will have minimum exposure.Source: Form 10 FilingFinancialsTotal sales for 2015 were $1.3 billion. This was a year-over-year decrease of 26%, mainly due to lower prices of the raw materials used to manufacture intermediate chemicals, caprolactam and polymer resins. Also, the company had some issues with unplanned plant outages.AdvanSix plans to incur indebtedness in the form of term loans, and also intends to enter into a revolving credit facility to be available for working capital needs. This could affect cash flows going forward.Operating cash flow was $107.8 million or a decline of 43% compared to 2014. Most of the decrease was from timing issues and an unfavorable impact from working capital. Also, operating cash flow will have a significant decline when sales decrease by 26%. Total net income was $68.1 million.AdvanSix ValuationCurrently Dow Chemical (NYSE: DOW) sells for 9 times operating cash flow. If we use this same multiple AdvanSix would be worth about $963 million. Before the announcement of the spin-off there were reports that HON wanted to sell the business and could fetch up to $1 billion for the assets. This is right in line with the valuation.Honeywell ValuationHON appears to sell for a slight discount to competitors and the spin-off could unlock this. With HON having 785 million shares outstanding AdvanSix assets only contributed $.09 per share in earnings in 2015. The spin-off shouldn't have a drastic impact on the share price of HON, if any. So basically, shareholders could be getting the spin-off company for free. The only downside is that AdvanSix will only be worth about $1 billion and HON is already selling for $87 billion. This only provides a 1.1% gain, but shareholders can hope this unlocks some value within HON's organization and trades closer to its competitors.Concluding ThoughtsThe spin-off corporation (AdvanSix) is in a highly competitive industry where revenues and operating cash flow have been on the decline this past year. To invest in Honeywell before the spin-off doesn't seem advantageous currently, but we still don't have the full picture. Especially, what does the share spin-off ratio look like and how much debt is AdvanSix raising? Investors should wait until more information has been filed to make a strategic decision. For current shareholders this spin-off could squeeze out a little more value, so I would recommend a hold."
3986600,25120,2016-07-06T10:10:48-04:00,"Honeywell continues to make bolt-on deals after merger talks with United Technologies fell apart.These bolt-on deals and share repurchases please investors who sent shares to fresh highs despite the announced departure of CEO Dave Cote.At current levels, shares are fairly valued; to create real appeal, shares will need to be bought on significant dips.","Honeywell (NYSE:HON) has delivered on excellent returns over the past years under the leadership of Dave Cote. Bolt-on deal-making, solid organic growth, smart portfolio management and margin gains have created a lot of value for shareholders.With Mr. Cote set to leave the company next year, he tried to pull off one last major deal, but talks with United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) have not gone anywhere. In the wake of this outcome, Honeywell is continuing with its much more sensible strategy to make bolt-on acquisitions. The purchase of Intelligrated fits right within this strategy in my opinion.Honeywell's BusinessHoneywell is a diversified industrial conglomerate, which posted sales of $39 billion in 2015. While the company is active in some traditional cyclical industrial activities such as resins and chemicals, it is aiming to spin off some of these more volatile and often lower-margin activities.Instead, it aims to operate in business lines which benefit from the long-term mega trends including urbanization, the Internet of Things and aerospace, among others. The tailwinds provided by being active in such industries, as well as the impact of many internal CAPEX projects, should boost the organic growth profile of the business.The company has split up its activities in three segments. The aerospace segment is the largest business, reporting sales of $15 billion each year, accompanied by attractive margins of 21%.Automation & automated solutions generates $14 billion in sales, as this segment should benefit from continuing and accelerating industrial automation trends. Segment margins of 16% lag compared to the overall business, which leaves Honeywell with some opportunities to boost profits. Key in achieving this is the successful integration of the $5 billion purchase of Elster, as synergies have the potential to make a meaningful impact.The performance materials business generated $9 billion in sales in 2015, but this will drop following the proposed spin-off of the chemicals and resins activities. That transaction is expected to be completed by early next year.An Active Year So FarDave Cote is not sitting still while he is leaving the business to which he brought a lot of success in recent years. The company already announced a few bolt-on deals in 2016. This includes the $480 million purchase of Xtralis, and the purchase of Movilizer for an unspecified amount.The big news came in February when Honeywell announced to be in talks to acquire/merge with United Technologies. Cote was eager to pursue such a deal as he believed that combined costs could be cut by $3.5 billion a year. Those talks died as management of United Technologies saw a bright future ahead as a stand-alone company. In its eyes, a potential deal would not properly take into account the anticipated earnings growth, which UTX expects to realize in the coming years.Following the collapsed talks, Honeywell continued with bolt-on deal-making with the purchase of RSI Video Technologies. To please shareholders, Honeywell announced a $5 billion share repurchase program.Dave Cote furthermore announced that he would step down as CEO of Honeywell in 2017, leaving sufficient time for an orderly transition. One thing is for sure, Cote remains very actively involved with the business as Honeywell recently announced the next deal, this time acquiring Intelligrated for $1.5 billion.The deal will add $900 million in sales to its automation segment and some $125 million in EBITDA. While margins are not very impressive, Honeywell is paying a 12 times EBITDA multiple in order to reflect for the rapid growth of the business. Intelligrated's warehouse logical solutions are in great demand, as the company has grown its revenues by a compounded growth rate of 13% per year over the past three years.The growth in terms of sales and EBITDA, resulting from this deal and some other bolt-on acquisitions, will in part be offset by the spin-off of some other activities. The separation of the resins and chemicals business will reduce sales by some $1.3 billion per year going forward, effective 2017.The Pro-Forma BusinessFollowing the acquisition spree and the anticipated spin-off from tee resins and chemicals business, Honeywell is pretty much a $40 billion business. Deal-making and buybacks have resulted in a slight increase in leverage since the end of 2015. Net debt has risen to $10 billion at the end of the first quarter as the new $5 billion buyback program and continued deal-making will provide upwards pressure to this leverage ratio.The company continues to be on track to post net earnings of more than $5 billion in 2016, with operating earnings seen around $6.5 billion. Net leverage now stands at roughly 1.3 times EBITDA, although buybacks and the Intelligrated deal will quickly push up that leverage multiple towards 1.5-2.0 times.The 777 million outstanding shares have risen to $116 following this bolt-on acquisition strategy, valuing Honeywell's equity at $89 billion. The entire business is valued at $100 billion if we include the net debt position. That suggests that Honeywell trades at roughly 13 times the $7.5 billion in EBITDA being generated each year. These fairly elevated multiples result from the relative capital-light business model of Honeywell, as well as the superior quality of its business.With earnings seen at $6.55 to $6.70 per share in 2016, Honeywell now trades at 17-18 times earnings, supporting a +5.5% earnings yield. These earnings and borrowing capacity allow Honeywell to make bolt-on deals, buy back stock, and pay a 2.0% dividend yield at the same time.Final ThoughtsI guess that investors like the steady path of growth as a mega-deal with UTX would have probably been somewhat disruptive. Not only would a potential deal create a lot of internal disruption, potential divestments would need to be made as well in order to satisfy regulators.The sheer size of a deal would complicate any deal as well. Remember that Honeywell has a similar valuation as UTX. The enterprise valuation for both firms hovers around the $100 billion mark. In terms of size, UTX is actually a fair bit larger. It reported sales of $56 billion in 2015, which is roughly 40% more than Honeywell. It should be said that UTX's margins are lagging quite a bit in comparison with Honeywell.The lower margin profile would probably be the key reason why Honeywell anticipated $3.5 billion in pre-tax synergies resulting from a deal. That synergy number looks fairly aggressive, being equal to roughly 9% of the total revenue base of Honeywell itself.Shareholders of Honeywell are probably better off if the company operates as a stand-alone business and continues to make nice bolt-on acquisitions which have the potential to boost the overall growth profile. At 18 times earnings, the 5.5% earnings yield looks very compelling compared to risk-free rates, certainly if Honeywell manages to grow the business by a couple of percentage points each year.This makes Honeywell probably a predictable grower and value creator going forward, certainly if it sticks to its current sound strategy. The issue is that there are probably few triggers to create imminent value. Following rationalization of the business portfolio, Honeywell has nearly doubled its operating margins over the past decade. This margin expansion has been combined with a modest increase in net debt in recent times, leaving few additional triggers beside the current valuation and organic growth to create value.This creates fair value at the moment in my eyes, but fair value is not sufficient to buy into an investment opportunity. A 15 times multiple, which represents a decent 6.5-7% earnings yield, translates into a targeted entry level at $100 per share. At those levels, shares look appealing given the structural growth and potential for multiple inflation."
3986401,83156,2016-07-05T15:24:41-04:00,Honeywell has agreed to acquire Intelligrated.The purchase provides insight on the company's growth strategy.Honeywell is sneakily becoming a tech company.,"Honeywell (NYSE:HON) has agreed to acquire Intelligrated, a leading supplier of warehouse automation technologies, from Permira for $1.5B in cash (approximately 12x estimated 2016 EBITDA). The company outbid Toyota (OTCPK:TYIDY) for the business, which Honeywell will add to its Sensing and Productivity Solutions division in its Automation and Control Solutions Segment (36.6% of total revenues in 2015). With growth sluggish in many of HON's legacy businesses, the purchase provides some important insight on how Honeywell plans to combat a prolonged period of widespread macro weakness.Intelligrated makes warehouse automation solutions, software and services that result in ""smarter distribution and fulfillment operations."" The firm was founded in 2001, and has operations in the US, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, and China. Intelligrated primarily serves customers in the e-commerce sector, but operators in the retail, wholesale, food and beverage, packaged goods, pharmaceutical and medical supply, and third party logistics industries also use its services. Intelligrated's customer base includes 30 of the top 50 US retailers, half of the top 100 Internet retailers, and a host of leading consumer product companies.Since 2001, Intelligrated has achieved rapid growth through a mix of acquisitions and innovation. Over the past three years, it has grown revenues at a 13% CAGR. Honeywell estimates that the firm will generate $900 million in sales in 2016, which equates to roughly 6.4% of Honeywell's Automation and Control Solutions segment revenues. Honeywell is looking to consolidate its portfolio around sustainable long-term growth opportunities, and the purchase of Intelligrated is the latest example.The rise in e-commerce activity has made companies such as Intelligrated popular acquisition targets as retailers needed to cut costs and ""modernize their distribution centers."" As Alex Ismail, head of Honeywell's Automation and Control Solutions segment explains, ""e-commerce continues to grow at an unprecedented rate and customer demands for faster delivery times have created a need for warehouse, logistics, and fulfillment solutions that can increase productivity and lower costs for customers."" As the percentage of transactions taking place online continues to increase, Kion Group AG (who recently purchased Dematic, a rival of Intelligrated) expects the market for supply chain automation to grow at a 10% annual rate through 2019.The Intelligrated purchase provides some transparency into Honeywell's long-term strategy. Honeywell is sneakily becoming a tech company as it looks to expand its portfolio around software-based innovation. Like General Electric (NYSE:GE), Honeywell is seeking to transform how businesses operate by leveraging the ""Industrial Internet of Things."" According to honeywellprocess.com, The Industrial IoT, or ""Smart Manufacturing"" represents a ""digital transformation that shifts the sources of competitive advantage away from physical machinery toward information.""Through data, HON plans to make companies more productive and more profitable, and the Intelligrated business seems to fit the bill. As John Waldron, president of the Sensing and Productivity Solutions division explains, ""[Intelligrated] complements the existing portfolio of industry-leading workflow performance solutions including cloud connected mobile worker applications, high performance data collection hardware, and other technologies to improve worker productivity.""Industrial conglomerates such as Honeywell are often viewed in a negative light due to their sluggish growth nature and high cyclicality. Investors often apply what's known as a ""conglomerate discount"" to these firms, due to the observation that such companies often operate a vast portfolio of unrelated businesses with few opportunities for synergies.While Honeywell has chased growth and expanded its portfolio through acquisitions, it has done so in a coordinated manner with a clear vision in mind, and repositioned its portfolio around secular growth trends. It appears that we have entered a new normal period of subdued global economic growth. In weak demand environments, technological advancement and innovation are especially crucial if firms are to boost productivity and growth. It looks like Honeywell is on track."
3978480,67985,2016-05-30T00:35:10-04:00,"The company seeks to improve its revenues and margins through greater international business presence, new innovations and a more consolidated product portfolio.

(NYSE:HON) is among those companies that have the potential to generate sustainable growth even in a challenging market environment. The company's business model is broadly diversified and is not dependent on any individual product, service or geographic area. Its business fundamentals are strong, since its end markets are immune to the recent whims of the economic environment.In our recent article, we suggested investors should hold on to this stock, in light of its innovative technologies and smart business strategies. We predicted that the company's share price had significant upside potential and that its dividends could grow at a high single-digit rate. Honeywell's latest results for the first quarter of this year have only affirmed the accuracy of our opinion.The company's strategies of expanding its footprint, diversifying its product portfolio, and investing in growth opportunities have been working. Its earnings per share have increased by 9% to $1.53; this approaches the high end of the company's recent guidance. Its consolidated sales of $9.5B represent a 3% growth over its $9.2B sales from the same quarter a year ago. In addition, its largest business segments - Aerospace and Automation and Control Solutions -providers of 75% of the company's overall revenue, are both growing at a considerable rate.Honeywell is working under a smart strategy of attending to customer feedback when developing new products. Its sourcing organizations and its factories continue to mature, and the company continues to re-engineer its products in pursuit of less costly manufacturing.Recently, Etihad Airways selected Honeywell's Aviaso business, which provides software to track and analyze fuel efficiency. In addition, Honeywell's recently acquired COM DEV, a part of its Defense and Space business, recently launched its world-leading ferrite technology on the European Space Agency's Sentinel 3A satellite.Honeywell has remained highly disciplined in its participation in growth opportunities. It has invested billions of dollars to acquire small companies that align with its business model. In Q1, it completed three acquisitions, including the additions of Xtralis and RSI Video Technologies to its Security and Fire business and Mobilizer to its Sensing and Productivity Solutions division.To top it all off, the company has been aggressively reducing its outstanding shares, a strategy designed to provide a massive boost to its share price, its earnings per share, and its dividends. In Q1, Honeywell repurchased more than $1B of outstanding shares, and it plans to increase its buyback program in the coming quarters.On the back of its successful strategies and innovative technologies, the company has recently raised the low-end of its full-year earnings guidance by 10% to $6.70 a share. In addition, HON is expected to post $4.6B of free cash flows and its dividend payments are expected to be around $1.7B. The company will have plenty of room to realize ongoing double-digit growth in its dividends, thanks to a huge gap between free cash flows and dividend payments.HON's share price has soared by 17% in the past three months, bringing its stock up almost 10% Y/Y. Recently, Deutsche Bank upgraded its price target for HON to $120 a share. The company's share price appears undervalued in my opinion, compared to its future business fundamentals and its approaching double-digit growth in earnings. Despite its recent rally, HON's stock still looks undervalued based on its price-to-earnings ratio of 18, since the industry average is around 36.Shorting Honeywell following its huge appreciation over the last few months is not a good strategy in my opinion; the company is poised to provide a strong financial and operational performance in the coming days. Honeywell's business fundamentals are strong and its end markets are not depressed, despite micro-environment headwinds. The company is only exposed to currency headwinds, which are always deemed to be short-term in nature. Overall, I believe the company's stock is set for a fresh rally, following its strong first quarter results and its expected growth in earnings."
3965841,97896,2016-04-18T04:47:40-04:00,Aerospace division has great long term growth potential.Honeywell is actively improving operational efficiency.Rebound in oil and gas will give Honeywell's energy operations a boost.,"Honeywell (NYSE:HON) has been on a great run since the great recession, as it has managed to return +385%. Honeywell has been actively acquiring companies to improve its various different business segments. Honeywell is a very diversified business which specializes in many different areas such as aerospace, automobiles, chemicals, and industrial controllers. Honeywell has a terrific strategy that drives the synergies of their acquisitions by improving operational efficiency through improving margins and cutting costs. I believe Honeywell's stock has major upside going into the latter part of 2016 due to many tailwinds such as rebounding oil and gas prices, solid long term growth prospects in the aerospace segment, and Honeywell's proven ability to drive efficiencies across all of its segments.Software and industrial internet of things growth will drive aerospace and ACS sales in the long termIn 2020, it is expected that over 60% of aerospace sales and 74% of ACS (automation control solutions) will come from products with embedded software. Honeywell looks well positioned in this department, as almost half of its engineers are software developers. For industrial companies like Honeywell, whoever has the best industrial software embedded in their products will be the ones to thrive in the future, as nearly all new industrial products will have embedded software within them. The performance, materials and technologies division is also expected to get 22% of sales from products with software embedded in them. Honeywell management expects 77% of its growth in the medium to long term to have some software component within it.Honeywell is actively improving operational efficiencyHoneywell is constantly investing in improving its efficiency, and cutting its costs in order to achieve this. Last year, $160 million was spent on restructuring that was estimated to increase operating margin by just 2.2%. Honeywell knows that this investment in improving efficiency will benefit them in the long term, and this is the strategy that has helped Honeywell outperform the market for so long. Honeywell has a great bottom line because of its relentless improvement strategy, and this strength will be what will give Honeywell fantastic earnings going forward, even if sales aren't soaring. Honeywell's guidance sees a 10% improvement to its bottom line through investment in improving operational efficiency.Rebound in oil and gas will give Honeywell's energy operations a boostHoneywell currently has 14% of its sales from its energy division which relies on oil and gas prices. With the current rally in oil prices, it can be expected that Honeywell's energy division will get a much needed boost, which will bump up its earnings in the medium term. Most of Honeywell's energy revenue comes from downstream operations, which is less sensitive to oil prices. Cote predicts Honeywell will earn $200 million in revenue growth in 2017, as oil and gas prices rebound to historical norms this year.ConclusionHoneywell has very promising growth going forward with their focus on including great embedded software in their industrial products. The company realizes that their growth from many of its segments like aerospace and ACS will come from innovations in the software development side, so they have really capitalized on it by hiring a large number of software engineers. I believe Honeywell is poised to outperform for the long term, and their investment in operational efficiency will boost their earnings, even if sales remain flat, which I suspect they will not given Honeywell's impressive guidance. The stock currently trades at a 18.97 P/E ratio, with a 4.8 P/B ratio and a 1.9% dividend yield. The valuation seems very fair at current levels, as its metrics are in line with its historical averages. Honeywell is a very high quality name and would make a great pickup whenever the market experiences a pullback."

With it recently releasing its Q1 2016 results, I thought it was time to delve a little deeper to see what's what and understand how FY2016 is looking so far.Put simply, Honeywell has shown in its first quarter the exact kind of quality performance investors have come to expect. What is more, even setting aside the compelling long-term growth opportunities, there seems to be plenty more to come for Honeywell investors in the near future too.Let's see what I mean.Robust Bottom and Top LineSo what about the headline grabbing results? Well, first of all, Honeywell produced robust revenue and earnings performances. Indeed, on a reported basis it saw 3% revenue and 4% earnings growth:Hidden behind this revenue figures, however, were foreign exchange and acquisition effects. Stripping them out, Honeywell still put together a solid organic revenue growth of 1%.On a reported basis, the stand-out segment performer has to be Automation & Controls:A hefty amount of that A&CS revenue growth came from the recently closed $5.1 billion Elster acquisition (closed on 6 January 2016). Elster is expected to add around $1.8 billion in full-year annualized revenues.Yet, even stepping back from these acquisitions and looking at organic growth the A&CS segment remained the lead performer:What is encouraging to see is that the company's two largest segments continue to see strong organic growth. Acquisitions also continue to boost growth in these areas. Performance Materials & Technologies is clearly still being held back by weakness in its main consumer markets. Ideally we would like to see revenue growth return in that segment sooner or later. Yet what is clear is that, despite this, the company can still grow. Good news indeed.Margins Improvement (and More To Come?)Needless to say, with earnings growing faster than revenue, operating margins have also improved modestly to be just shy of 18%:Honeywell also provided revised guidance suggesting that they anticipated this to grow further as the year progresses. Margins, they suggest, will be between 18% and 18.4% by the end of the year. If achieved (and I have no reason to doubt they can), this would mean that Honeywell has managed to improve margins immensely since 2011:There is very little to complain about on that front. Yet there is more coming out from Honeywell at the moment to make investors take note.Shareholder ReturnsFirst off, take a look at shareholder returns. Honeywell has proven to be a very shareholder-friendly company in recent years with generous share buybacks:This seems set to continue. In Q1 2016 they have already repurchased over $1 billion outstanding shares (up from around $295 million in Q1 2015). What is more, the company also announced authorization for further share buybacks to the tune of $5 billion.Nor is the dividend absent. Even at today's price, Honeywell comes with a well-covered 1.88% dividend yield:All told, between the solid dividend and generous buyback policy, the company could see another strong total yield for investors.Free Cash Flow Strength?Honeywell also decided to sharpen up their revenue guidance a little. From their prior $39.9 billion to $40.9 billion guidance, they have suggested a new $40.3 billion to 40.9 billion revised guidance. Prior to the results announcement, most analysts had already anticipated revenue above the $40.3 billion.All good, so far. On the free cash flow front, however, guidance has remained the same at between $4.6 billion and $4.8 billion. At first glance of the reported cash flow results, this would suggest a certain optimism. After all, FCF in Q1 dropped about 75% on last year:Part of the blame here is a 17.5% growth in CapEx. Yet the biggest influence, however, was a growth in inventory. While in 2015 inventories were just $86 million, in 2016 they were $246 million, which drew down FCF. Without this, FCF would have been at similar levels as 2015.As it happens, I agree with their $4.6 billion FCF guidance. Assuming a similar 11.4% FCF to revenue ratio in 2016 as 2015, we should see exactly that: $4.6 billion. What is more, based on their historical record of improving upon their FCF/Revenue ratio year after year, there may be more upside wrapped up in there:I can't help but be quite bullish on Honeywell's continued FCF growth potential in coming quarters. With the United Technologies bid out of the way too, Honeywell has already set about going on the smaller acquisition trail that has served it so well. I have little doubt this highly accretive policy will continue to bear fruit for the company.Fair ValueI have been very impressed by Honeywell's performance so far. So should I buy into them after their Q1 results?To assess this, I need to put together a fair value prediction. Here I plan to use FCF to ascertain Honeywell's fair value price. I calculate my FCF fair value by using the enterprise value to FCF ratio (similar in some ways to the PE).First I calculate the 5-year average EV/FCF ratio for the company. In Honeywell's case, this is 21:I then use my FCF predictions based on historic FCF/Revenue ratios and consensus analyst revenue predictions for the next two years. Averaging these, I then multiply this by the average EV/FCF ratio for the company.Doing so provides me with a FCF fair value for Honeywell of about $127.25. With the share price currently around the $114.50 mark, this suggests a potential 10% upside on today's price.ConclusionI consider Honeywell a good-looking buy right now up to about $127. As well as the above conservative predictions, there is an additional margin of safety in that the share count should see further falls in coming quarters as the share buyback continues. With a solid if unspectacular yield and robust performance in a tough economic environment, Honeywell is an industrial stalwart. These Q1 results just drive home that point.Long-term, solid organic growth combined with continuing intelligent acquisitions and efficiency improvements should see Honeywell put together robust results in coming quarters and years. Right now seems as opportune a moment as any to start building up a position in impressive industrial conglomerate blue chip.NotesUnless otherwise stated, all graphs and the calculations contained within them were created by the author.

3968265,53422,2016-04-26T17:52:09-04:00,"Honeywell released Q1-16 results last week.Honeywell beat the consensus earnings estimate.Sales increased 3 percent Y/Y, but margins slid modestly on the back of unfavorable currency effects and acquisition costs.Honeywell's margin growth story is still unfolding.","General Electric (NYSE:GE) reported Q1 2016 results last week that beat consensus estimates. Industrial company Honeywell International (NYSE:HON) also reported first quarter results at the end of last week, and the company managed to beat earnings estimates as well. Honeywell International has sort of taken a backseat to General Electric last year whose transformation story captivated investors. General Electric is returning to its roots as an ""industrial-only"" company, selling off financial assets and trying to lose its SIFI designation. That being said, though, Honeywell is an equally interesting growth and margin story that deserves a little more attention than it currently gets.Turning to Honeywell's Q1-16 results. Honeywell International said its sales were up 3 percent Y/Y to ~$9.5 billion, helped by acquisitions. On an organic basis Honeywell's sales were up ~1% Y/Y. At the end of the day, Honeywell raked in $1.53/share in profits in the last quarter compared with $1.41/share a year ago. Analysts were shooting for earnings per share of $1.50/share. So far, so good.Margin Picture Actually Looks Quite GoodWhile the company beat on earnings, a good sign, Honeywell's margins slipped slightly: Honeywell's segment margin decreased 60 bps from 18.7 percent in Q1-15 to 18.1 percent in Q1-16. But though margins dropped Y/Y, the decline is explained by a couple of factors that include unfavorable currency effects, acquisition/deal costs and OEM incentives, which are all special items. If investors adjusted only for the impact of acquisitions, for instance, Honeywell's Q1-16 segment margin would have actually increased 20 bps Y/Y to 18.9 percent. So, while the first glance on Honeywell's presentation materials suggests that the company's margins are falling, that turns out to not be entirely the case here.Unfavorable currency effects and acquisition-related costs have one thing in common: They don't have anything to do with Honeywell's day-to-day performance and are outside of the company's control. Therefore, Honeywell's margin decline in the first quarter is not as concerning as one might think. Honeywell's margin picture, in fact, is solid, and the industrial company's full-year outlook implies modest margin growth compared to last year.Solid Outlook, But Shares Aren't CheapHoneywell guided for earnings per share in the range of $1.61-$1.66 for the second quarter, which is equivalent to a 7-10 percent Y/Y increase.Honeywell further raised the lower bound of its EPS guidance by 10 cents (a sign of confidence), and expects earnings per share of $6.55-$6.70 for 2016, whereas its segment margin is forecasted to fall into a range of 18.9-19.3 percent, implying 10-50 bps Y/Y margin growth.Honeywell's shares change hands for $113.25 at the time of writing, or ~17.1x 2016e earnings, which is rather on the expensive side. On the other hand, Honeywell's segment margins are still expanding, and the industrial company just raised its profit guidance.Your TakeawayHoneywell is off to a good start to the year with core organic revenues up 1 percent and earnings beating the consensus estimate by 3 cents. Importantly, when adjusting for currency effects and acquisition-related costs, Honeywell actually saw its segment margins come in higher compared to last year. Further, Honeywell guided for higher full-year revenues, expanding segment margins, and stronger profits for 2016. Honeywell's strong outlook and ability to achieve margin growth is the main reason why I still like the shares at ~17x estimated earnings. Buy for income and capital appreciation."

3961147,64693,2016-03-27T06:02:43-04:00,"Honeywell’s business model is strong and the company’s strategies have allowed it to consistently sustain sales growth for years.Its focus on targeting high-margin products while expanding its footprint through acquisitions is working.Its share price has upside: the company is headed to post double-digit growth in earnings, despite current macroeconomic headwinds.","Honeywell International Inc (NYSE:HON) has suffered only a barely perceptible impact from recent macroeconomic headwinds. Market uncertainty and tumbling oil prices have barely made a dent in its overall performance over the last couple of quarters. Thankfully, the company has a highly diversified business model with very low exposure to the depressed energy sector.The company's stock price has remained resilient against the headwinds of falling oil prices and an uncertain macroeconomic environment. This success is due to a strong product portfolio and a dedicated focus on innovation.Its share price stood strong against two major plunges in the market, the first in the middle of last year and the second appearing with the start of 2016. Year to date, its share price has surged by nearly 9%, rising to around $112 a share. And that's not the end of it, in my view. Shorting Honeywell is not a good strategy.HON's stock contains even more upside potential this year, on the back of exceptional business strategy, anticipated double-digit growth in earnings and focus on reducing its outstanding shares.The company's business fundamentals are strong and its major business segments including aerospace and performance materials are posting convening profits. Recently, Deutsche Bank upgraded Honeywell over General Electric (NYSE:GE), on its strong future fundamentals. In addition, Deutsche Bank increased the target share price for Honeywell from $105 to $120.Business Strategies For Sustainable GrowthDespite the economy's sluggish growth and other macroeconomic issues, the company has been consistently supporting its growth with innovative products as well as by investing in high-growth high-margin development. The company continues to invest in future products, supported by its continued investment in R&D and a healthy flow of funded restructuring projects.In 2015, the company proactively funded $160 million of restructuring in order to build a robust pipeline of new products. These will enhance Honeywell's margins for this year and on into the next.Innovative Technologies Are Backing GrowthThe company's focus on innovation is allowing it to sustain its sales growth. Its Wi-Fi Water Leak and Freeze Detector was honored with the CES 2016 Editors' Choice Award. This ground-breaking device provides early alerts of frozen pipes and water leaks to avoid costly repairs. In the last year alone, sales for the company's connectable product portfolio increased by almost 30%, evidence of its continued investment in innovations that support growth.Moreover, Honeywell's sale of turbochargers to enhance vehicle performance - both gas and diesel - grew over the past year. The company now estimates that nearly half of all cars on the road will have turbocharged engines by the end of 2020.Honeywell is also equipped to capitalize on growing demand with an ever-expanding global footprint and highly differentiated technology. In the final quarter of 2015, Honeywell signed an agreement to supply its HTF series jet engines, advanced cockpit technologies, auxiliary power units, cabin pressure control systems, and environmental control systems to Cessna's new Citation Longitude business jet.The company is also expanding its footprint and products through acquisitions. Recently, it closed on the Elster acquisition. In addition, the company acquired the remaining 30% stake in UOP Russell, a global leader in modular gas processing technology and equipment.Double Digit GrowthOn the other hand, the company remains cautious, and continues to cut costs while showing great discipline in its spending. For the final quarter of 2015, it posted earnings of $1.58 per share, a considerable increase from $1.43 in the same quarter of the previous year. Their aerospace segment generated growths of 29% while its performance materials segment enlarged by more than 9% in the latest quarter. Its segment margins increased 220 basis points, an accurate representation of its strong execution across the portfolio.For this year, the company anticipates earnings per share in the range of $6.70 compared with $6.10 per share in 2015. The company's dividend growth is safe, firmly resting on the back of strong cash generating potential. In this year, HON is looking to return over $3.5 billion to its shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends. It recently increased its dividend by 15% for this year.Final ThoughtsHoneywell is a pleasing stock for defensive investors who are looking for sustainable growth in sales and cash flows. In the final quarter of 2015, the company's free cash flows expanded by almost 11%. We can expect similar increases this year, amid an anticipated double-digit growth in earnings.The company's strategy of targeting high-margin, high-growth areas with its culture of providing innovative and differentiated technologies is working. Other than some microeconomic challenges and currency translations, the company's growth is exposed to very little risk. Its liquidity situation is strong with debt to equity ratio of only 0.3 when industry average is high around 0.9. Thus, the long-term investors can achieve steady share price appreciation and healthy dividends by holding this stock."
3950096,67815,2016-03-03T02:53:13-05:00,"GE remains a highly appealing buy, with its shift towards being an industrial company being a sound move.However, industrial sector peer Honeywell offers lower risks and stronger catalysts to push its share price higher.Honeywell also has a lower valuation and is a more focused industrial business.","We think that GE (NYSE:GE) has huge long term potential to deliver capital gains, with there being multiple positive catalysts to push its share price higher.For example, we believe that the company's pivot towards industrials will have a hugely positive impact on its long term profitability, with the company seeking to generate over three-quarters of its profit from the industrial division. This is a sound move in our view because the industrial division has a much higher return on capital than GE Capital and so it makes sense to pour capital to where the return is highest. And in time, we think that a higher overall return on capital will have a positive impact on GE's valuation.Furthermore, we feel that there is a lot more opportunity within the industrials space than within GE capital for bottom line growth. For example, between 2014 and 2030, over $70tn is expected to be spent on global infrastructure and GE is well-placed to benefit from that. And with GE disposing of multiple financial assets which have little in common with each other, we feel that a more collaborative company will be formed. This is being aided by the development of the GE Store, a forum where the company's different divisions can better share ideas and best practice in order to create a more efficient and nimble operation.In addition, GE's purchase of Alstom could also positively catalyse its earnings and share price. The two companies share numerous customers and the deal is set to create a significant amount of synergies which should boost GE's profitability. And with GE also making numerous asset disposals (such as the Synchrony split), we think that it is becoming a more focused and innovative business which is focused on the fastest growing niches within the global industrial space.However, we believe that one of GE's industrial sector peers could be an even better buy. That company is Honeywell (LSE: HON) and like GE, it is undergoing a number of major changes which we think will positively catalyse its share price.For example, Honeywell is also engaging in M&A activity in order to boost its top and bottom lines. It made acquisitions of over $6bn last year, with the major one being Elster. However, unlike GE, Honeywell is already an industrial-focused company which does not need to sell down a finance arm which has a return on capital which is lower than the cost of capital. In other words, Honeywell is already much further down the line when it comes to becoming an innovative, nimble industrial player and that means it has greater appeal in our view when compared to GE.Another catalyst which we think will push Honeywell's share price higher is its relentless focus on costs and in generating efficiencies. For example, Honeywell was able to increase its margins by 2.2% in the 2015 financial year as a result of adopting new ideas regarding its business model. And with a further 0.8% to 1.1% in margin improvements set to be recorded over the coming year, the company's bottom line should benefit greatly from what is proving to be a major restructuring.While GE is also becoming increasingly efficient, we see it as a long term project simply because of the sheer size and scale of change which is required. Honeywell is delivering vast margin improvements right now, which we think will cause its shares to rise at a faster rate than those of GE.Clearly, both companies come with risks. They both have divisions which are performing at a less than optimal level. In Honeywell's case, its Automation and Control Solutions business recorded a fall in revenue last year, while GE's Oil and Gas division was hurt by a weak oil price in the final quarter of 2015. In fact, sales fell by 16% and profit slumped by 19% versus the comparable quarter and looking ahead, it would be of little surprise for there to be more pain moving forward.In addition, with both companies making major changes to their businesses, there is a danger that acquisitions fail to deliver on their expected synergies and that forecast efficiencies are not generated from a more integrated business model. On this front, we feel there is more risk at GE than Honeywell since the changes it is making are on a bigger scale and are more ambitious.With GE trading on a forward P/E ratio of 17, we think that it is attractively priced given its capital gain potential and the strength of its potential catalysts discussed above. However, with Honeywell having a forward P/E ratio of 14.6, we think it offers superior value to its industrial sector peer, with it also having lower risk and stronger potential catalysts. As such, and while both stocks are very appealing buys in our view, we think that Honeywell will offer higher returns than GE moving forward."
3946806,23973,2016-03-02T04:37:15-05:00,"When news leaked out that Honeywell might bid for UTX, UTX quickly went public with its view that the deal wasn't a good one, while Honeywell persisted until March 1.The deal environment is very difficult for all large mergers, but the regulatory resistance to HON/UTX would have been strong, and customer resistance at least as strong.Honeywell has done well by sticking to its knitting: steady operational improvement, mid-sized fill-in acquisitions and concentration on margins. It would be wise to stick to this strategy.","News leaked out on February 22 that Honeywell (NYSE:HON) had approached United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) with a proposal to acquire it. The same day, United Technologies confirmed the approach, and dismissed the idea: ""…combining two of the world's largest players in the aerospace and commercial building segments would face insurmountable regulatory obstacles and strong customer opposition."" Yet Honeywell wasn't convinced, claiming that, ""We do not see the regulatory process as a material obstacle to a transaction. In fact, a combination would benefit our customers…"" It wasn't until March 1, and after further concerted opposition from United Technologies, that Honeywell finally abandoned the idea.Honeywell should know how difficult the deal environment isYou'd think that Honeywell's previous experience of large deals would have taught it caution: the unacceptable conditions that the European Union put on any such deal prevented its acquisition by General Electric (NYSE:GE) in 2001. If anything, antitrust policy around the world has become stricter and less predictable in the subsequent fifteen years. It doesn't take much of a look around the deal landscape to see this. A sample of some prominent deals that are in various degrees of U.S. regulatory trouble include the proposed mergers of:· Staples and Office Depot;· Anthem and Cigna;· Aetna and Humana;· Walgreens Boots and Rite-Aid; and· Baker Hughes and Haliburton.None of these would result in a more concentrated market than would result from the combination of Honeywell's aerospace activities with those of United Technologies. The combination of their building industry activities would also raise regulatory eyebrows, regardless of whether Honeywell disposes of its building-solutions business.The Honeywell/GE affair showed that European regulators can stymie mergers between non-European companies if they believe they would affect European markets. For instance, the E.U. is reviewing the Baker Hughes/Halliburton deal. It would certainly believe that European interests were at stake in a Honeywell/United Technologies transaction. Activism by antitrust regulators is increasing worldwide, which cannot help but affect deals among multinationals: the AB Inbev/SAB Miller (British and Belgian companies, respectively) deal could falter on regulatory opposition in South Africa.Customer acceptance is unlikelyHoneywell and United Technologies are both major manufacturers of aircraft components and avionics. While a combination of the two might not quite dominate this business globally, it would be formidable. Despite Honeywell's protestations, its customers will almost certainly oppose any deal with United Technologies. The CEO of Airbus (OTC:OTCPK:EADSY) has already made his opposition very clear. Boeing (NYSE:BA) indicated more diplomatically that it would ""…anticipate taking a very close look at the potential impact…of a Honeywell-UTC merger...""The Pentagon hasn't commented, but it has been concerned about concentration among defense contractors for years. Most such transactions involve bolting new product lines onto existing defense activities ─ for instance, Lockheed Martin's (NYSE:LMT) purchase of the Sikorsky helicopter business from United Technologies. Honeywell/United Technologies would be another matter entirely: their aerospace businesses are quite complimentary, and then United Technologies brings Pratt & Whitney with it as well. The Defense Department can be expected to lobby against it. Between them, Airbus, Boeing and the Pentagon would be very powerful political opponents to any deal they dislike.The companies' building-related customer base is fragmented, and will have a harder time making its opinions heard than their aerospace customers. But European regulators in particular are likely to take an interest in the restraint-of-trade potential a combination of a maker of thermostats with a maker of HVAC (imaginative construal of its remit is a specialty of the European antitrust regulator, as U.S. high tech companies have learned to their cost). Fire safety and access control businesses will probably attract attention in the U.S. as well.United Technologies has done Honeywell and its shareholders a favorHoneywell's investors should be grateful to United Technologies for its realism. The last time Honeywell engaged in major deal-making it nearly destroyed itself: while that doesn't mean the results would be as disastrous this time around, it surely provides plenty of reason for caution. It really doesn't need· months and possibly years of regulatory uncertainty;· the concessions to regulators that would inevitably be demanded if the transaction has any hope of proceeding· to encourage the hostility of very powerful customers;· the internal dissension that large mergers inevitably generate; and frankly, it doesn't need· the challenges facing Pratt & Whitney's losses on every commercial engine it sells and its technical problems with its newest commercial jet engine.Honeywell is doing remarkably well pursuing a strategy of smaller acquisitions, occasional disposals in the interest of portfolio management, and a consistent attention to margin improvement. Its investors should hope that its attentions to United Technology are a momentary aberration."
3956195,88106,2016-03-06T10:54:06-05:00,"Honeywell abruptly ends pursuit of United Technologies following inadequate offer of $108 per share and UTX Board's unwillingness to negotiate.Honeywell is 2 years into a 5 year strategic plan and is at risk of falling well short of its goals; Without a transformational merger, shareholders may face considerable downside.We have a one-year price target of $93 per share or 14% below Honeywell's current share price and we believe there are currently more attractive opportunities for income oriented investors.","Honeywell Abruptly Ends Pursuit of United TechnologiesOn March 1st, Honeywell (NYSE: HON) announced that the company would no longer pursue an acquisition of United Technologies (NYSE: UTX) due to UTX's reluctance to engage in negotiations. We are very disappointed with this development. We believe the $108 per share in cash-and-stock offer for United Technologies was inadequate and a superior offer would have likely brought the UTX Board to the negotiation table. Our view, which is detailed here, is that United Technologies is worth between $116 and $122 per share today and an offer in this range would still make the transaction economical for Honeywell given the substantial synergies and growth potential of a combined firm.(Source: Stockcharts.com)Similarly, at the revised price and significant premium (over 30%) to the recent trading price of UTX, we believe the Board and shareholders would be very interested in selling their shares. To abandon the pursuit of United Technologies at this stage is a mistake and we remain unconvinced that Honeywell's current strategic direction and long-term plan will reward the company's shareholders. With Honeywell's stock trading 24.3% higher than its 52-week low and with a dividend yield of 2.2%, we believe Honeywell is significantly overvalued and the stock has considerable downside at the current price of $108.15 per share. We have a one-year price target of $93 per share.Why Honeywell Will Fall Short of Its Five-Year Strategic PlanThe Honeywell management team unveiled their five-year strategic plan in 2014 and it looks as though they will come up far short of many of the objectives set out in the plan. Total revenue in 2015 declined a staggering $1.73 billion or 4% for the year amid weak organic growth and pricing pressure across all segments. The Performance Materials and Technologies Sales was the hardest hit with revenues declining by $1 billion. Within this segment, UOP had a decline in organic revenue of 6% as fewer customer projects lowered gas processing sales.We believe this trend is likely to continue as a global slowdown continues in many of the end markets that the modular gas technology and equipment serves. While the company has announced recent client wins such as PV Gas, based in Vietnam, and global expansion continues, we are discouraged by the overall weaker demand for the UOP technology that separates liquefied petroleum gas from natural gas. We do not expect a material recovery in this segment overall for at least 18 to 24 months. CEO David Cote attempted to put a positive spin on the deteriorating operating performance at UOP during the fourth quarter earnings conference call:CFO Tom Szlosek also downplayed the performance moments later:(Source: Honeywell Investor Presentation)We remain unconvinced of these explanations for several reasons. First, the comps throughout 2016 will be very challenging and double digit declines in organic revenue may be the norm over the next twelve months. The current valuation of Honeywell does not price in this weakening operating performance. Second, the recent uptick in international orders is isolated and related to two mega projects for gas processing. Beyond these orders, we believe there will not be as much opportunity for top-line growth in the current environment. We expect a very disappointing year for UOP and a recovery may not occur until late 2017 and possibly not until 2018.We do not believe management adequately addressed the substantial risk this segment poses to 2016 estimates and the company's 5-year strategic plan. We are projecting overall revenue of $39.8 billion for 2016 which is $700 million below consensus expectations. Our projection assumes decent growth in Aerospace (to $16.3 billion in revenue) as well as Automation and Control Solutions (to $14.8 billion in revenue) to offset the continued decline in Performance Materials and Technologies. These assumptions are not without risk as each segment faces strong headwinds in organic growth and pricing. It is possible that Aerospace falls short of our growth projection and this will provide only further downward pressure on the stock in 2016. Our concerns are not limited to top line growth.We are very concerned with Honeywell's operating margin going forward and believe further improvement is limited without a significant cost restructuring. In 2015, segment operating margin expanded to 18.8% from 17.0% in the prior year mainly from operational improvements in the HOS Gold program. The HOS Gold program has been effective in consolidating best practices throughout the organization, but we believe incremental gains from here out will be lower and top line pressure will constrain segment operating margins. In our view, the company's 20% operating margin target is very aggressive and we believe the 18.8% achieved in 2015 is a peak given our outlook over the next twelve months.(Source: Honeywell Investor Presentation)ValuationFrom a valuation standpoint, in our view Honeywell is considerably overvalued based on an earnings multiple and on a discounted cash flow basis. Currently, the consensus expectations for EPS in 2016 is $6.61 per share. At the current price of $108.15 per share, this represents a 16.4x PE. As discussed above, we believe there is considerable downside risk in the 2016 EPS estimate and even a miss by as low as 3% could result in a price correction. We are projecting EPS of $6.35 per share in 2016. Additionally, the average PE over the past 8 years for Honeywell is 14.6x. This historical average applied to consensus estimates results in a price of $96.5O per share. Based on projected EPS of $6.35 and a PE of 14.6x, the result is a price of $92.71 per share.Our discounted cash flow model assumes EBITDA of $7.8 billion in 2016 and decent growth through 2020 with EBITDA reaching $9.4 billion in five years. Based on these projections, we arrived at a fair value of $92.88 per share which represents 14.1% downside to Honeywell's current price. The one variable that may allow Honeywell to outperform over the next five years and exceed our estimates is a robust M&A strategy. If Honeywell is able to effectively deploy capital in sizeable and accretive transactions, we may see more growth in EBITDA but we remain skeptical of the prospect of a large and successful acquisition particularly after the failed United Technologies bid.(Source: Author's estimates)In our view, retirement investors and income oriented investors may want to look at other options within industrials over the next twelve months. One company in particular that is better positioned for long-term dividend growth and capital appreciation is Cummins Inc. (NYSE: CMI). In December, we highlighted Cummins as one of our top dividend stocks of 2016, which can be found here. Cummins' stock is up 10.6% since our article was published and we believe the momentum will continue. With a current dividend yield of 3.8%, we believe Cummins is a more attractive opportunity than Honeywell."

UTC is returning capital to investors now.Divestitures would be needed. Grow by attrition? Not likely.Customers are worried and might rebid contracts/look elsewhere for products.,"Industrial giants United Technologies Corporation (NYSE:UTX) and Honeywell International (NYSE:HON), once relatively friendly rivals in the aerospace and building systems industries, now are duking it out in the media after failing to seal a deal first discussed last year and brought to light recently on TV and in print.Some investors, and Honeywell chief executive Dave Cote, refer to it as a merger. United Technologies CEO Greg Hayes, in no uncertain terms, classified it as an unwanted, and unfriendly, takeover that will destroy shareholder value and would unlikely be approved by myriad regulatory agencies involved anyway nor accepted by major customers.Let's take a look on the impact of any deal on some stakeholders involved.I'll be looking at the situation from my perspective as a former employee of the company, having worked there from 1982 to 2014 in both the aerospace and building systems operations, and a current shareholder. I'm also familiar with the Honeywell automotive and farm equipment turbocharger business as well.CustomersBoth companies compete in the aerospace industry and sell the same basic products to the same customers such as Boeing (NYSE:BA), Airbus (OTCPK:EADSY), Bombardier (OTCQX:BDRAF), Embraer-Empressa Brasileira (NYSE:ERJ), and governments worldwide.Some of the overlap includes small/medium jet engines, jet engine controls, aircraft environmental and electric power systems, auxiliary power units, sensors, pilot controls and cockpit equipment, lighting, wheels, and brakes, and various subsystems for space vehicles and satellites.In fact, the majority of subsystems needed to operate the typical commercial aircraft are supplied by both companies today.In addition, there is significant overlap in the building systems industry on products such as security and fire detection and alarm systems.Honeywell is trying to make the case that most customers would benefit from the cost-saving synergies and one-stop shopping opportunities created by a tie-up.However, the company is probably overstating the potential and not factoring in the effects of divestiture that would likely be required by regulators.The Honeywell savings estimate, 8.5% of its current sales, is well above the best-in-class values that have been achieved in the industry recently, which are typically in the 4% to 6% range.UTC management stated that its major customers would be looking at this deal with a wary eye. For example:1) Tom Enders of Airbus was quoted saying: ""I do not see that such a combination would be in the interests of Airbus… I am under the impression that the UTC leadership shares my assessment.""2) A Boeing spokesperson wrote: ""Healthy competition in our supply chain is vitally important to Boeing and our commercial and military customers . . . we would anticipate taking a very close look at the potential impact on us and our customers of a Honeywell-UTC merger or acquisition.""3) Frederico Curado of Embraer indicated: ""I don't think that would be good, at least for Embraer. On the E2 they are major suppliers and if they become one supplier they will have an enormous stake. So that's something we are looking carefully at.""My thought is that the combined entity would have way too much leverage over the rest of the industry and major customers even if a deal is approved. Prices charged to customers would shoot up. Smaller companies could disappear. Innovation and talent would dry up as the incentives to create better products go away. Contracts would likely have to be renegotiated. Companies might look elsewhere for the products needed or bring in the development and manufacturing in-house.InvestorsHoneywell claims that investors would benefit. UTC says no.Several factors back up the UTC position.One involves the revelation from UTC that part of the deal would be funded with cash from its own balance sheet, not from Honeywell.The Honeywell offer of $90.7B grossly undervalues UTC according to management and would result in $36B of debt added to the balance sheet. By comparison UTC took on relatively little debt to acquire the former Goodrich Corporation in 2012.Another factor is the potential that the deal will destroy shareholder value since it is highly probable that it won't be approved by regulators. For example, from 2000 to 2005, during and after Honeywell's attempted merger with General Electrical Company (NYSE:GE) fell through in 2001, HON stock dropped by 38%. European regulatory agencies did not approve the deal because of antitrust concerns. Ironically UTC and Honeywell were in merger talks in 2000 before GE instead swooped in.By contrast UTC is in the midst of returning $22B to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends.The bottom line: A completed deal would likely be a negative for UTC shareholders.Business operationsThe deal would probably be detrimental to the underlying businesses, employees and society at large.Even assuming that the major customers would eventually agree to a deal, and not rebid contracts, many existing operations would have to be divested in order to get regulatory approval.This is usually a long and drawn out process.For example, when UTC merged Goodrich into its aerospace operations it was about two years before the integration was fully completed. Buyers had to be identified and some of the former Goodrich and UTC operations had to be sold off. The buyers probably recognized the lay of the land and UTC likely accepted a lower price than the underlying businesses were worth. Layoffs occurred on both sides. Some communities were devastated as plants were closed.While there might be significant overlap between the two companies Honeywell has no experience in elevators, HVAC equipment and large commercial jet engines and controls, which have been responsible for much of the success at UTC for decades and which comprise the bulk of UTC's current revenue and profit.ConclusionThe proposed tie-up between United Technologies and Honeywell is not friendly on any number of levels. Shareholders, customers and employees probably would not benefit as much as Honeywell claims. I side with UTC and oppose the deal."
3938526,88106,2016-02-28T15:49:42-05:00,"Honeywell offers $108 per share in a cash-and-stock deal to acquire United Technologies. The deal would create a global leader with $97 billion in revenue.The board of United Technologies rejected the offer, citing concerns on valuation and regulatory approval. We believe an improved offer by Honeywell may follow.We estimate a fair value of UTX of $116-$122 per share. We believe the combined firm will pass antitrust scrutiny and provide attractive long-term growth for shareholders.","United Technologies' Board Rejects Honeywell's Buyout OfferOn February 19th, Honeywell (NYSE: HON) made a proposal to acquire United Technologies (NYSE: UTX) for $108 per share in a cash-and-stock transaction valued at $90.7 billion. The proposed transaction would create a world class aerospace, buildings and industrial leader with $97 billion in annual sales. However, on Friday, the board of United Technologies rejected the buyout offer.The board cited that the offer significantly undervalues the company and that a transaction may be challenged on the grounds of antitrust concerns. Leaving the regulatory issues aside for the moment, investors should focus on what the fair value of United Technologies is and how Honeywell's offer compares to our estimate of fair value.(Source: UTC.com)UTX is currently trading at $97.69 and is up 12.2% since the beginning of the month amid takeover speculation. However, the stock has struggled over the past year and trades 21% below its 52-week high of $123.50 per share. Many investors are therefore discouraged by the recent stock performance as well as the outlook over the next five years. It is tempting for shareholders to be uninterested in selling at a $108 per share transaction price; however, shareholders must consider the current prospects of UTX as an independent company. We believe the return for UTX investors under this scenario will be disappointing despite the optimism expressed by management.(Source: Stockcharts.com)Prospects for a Standalone United Technologies are Not as Attractive as Management SuggestsIn the response to the Honeywell offer, UTX's management argued that each of its businesses are in a strong position for long-term organic growth under management's current strategic plan. Management is currently projecting organic growth of over 10% per year from 2016 through 2020 at its Pratt & Whitney business, 5-7% per year at UTC Aerospace Systems, and 4-5% per year at both its Climate, Controls & Security and Otis businesses. We believe such an assessment for the next five years is exceedingly optimistic and has no basis in the projected economic environment in the markets that each business serves.For the full year 2015, organic growth was markedly lower and totaled 1% for the entire company. Pratt & Whitney's performance was particularly weak as organic sales declined 1% for the year amid lower commercial OE and military engine sales. The near-term outlook does not look much better. CFO Akhil Johri admitted on the Q4 earnings conference call, ""I think it's probably going to be more in the 0% to 1% range in the first quarter, it's not back here to be negative. I think there were some tough compares, but close to 0% to 1% I would say.""We believe it is possible that organic growth turns slightly negative in the first half of the year while the second half of 2016 shows only modest gains. A combination of increased pricing pressure and weaker demand has led to total revenue declining at Pratt & Whitney from $14.5 billion in 2013 to $14.1 billion in 2015. We expect this business to remain stagnant amid intense competition in the aircraft engine market, and management's assertion of long-term organic growth of over 10% is unwarranted. In our valuation model, we assume organic growth in the mid-single digits and believe this is a far more realistic assumption but will still require solid momentum in several key markets, including Europe and China.(Source: United Technologies Investor Presentation, 2016)UTX's management's overly optimistic projections are not limited to top line growth. Both Pratt & Whitney and UTC Aerospace Systems businesses have struggled with improving operating margins. In particular, higher negative engine margins at Pratt & Whitney led to an operating loss in the fourth quarter of 2015.Overall, for the full year 2015, Pratt & Whitney achieved an operating margin of 6.1%, down from 13.8% in the prior year and well below industry levels. We believe management will continue to struggle with expanding the margin to its full potential and more aggressive restructuring actions will be required. We are disappointed that the management team has not outlined a clear path to achieving more acceptable margins in this business as well as at UTC Aerospace Systems.In our view, consistent underperformance at Pratt & Whitney and UTC Aerospace Systems will be addressed in an acquisition by Honeywell and substantial margin improvement will be realized at the combined firm. As a standalone, we do not believe we will see measurable and steady improvement in this area, and management's dismissal of the identifiable and achievable cost synergies presented by Honeywell is not entirely credible. We disagree when management claims that its businesses are already operating at ""best in class margins.""(Source: United Technologies Investor Presentation, 2016)Based on our assumptions of only limited margin expansion overall at UTX, we are projecting EBIT of $8.6 billion in 2016 and growth over the next five years to $10.6 billion in 2020. UTX will need to continue to take aggressive actions to achieve these projections, but we believe it is feasible given the moderate success of some of its recent strategic initiatives in simplifying the organization and becoming more efficient and focused.With that being said, we believe the full operating margin potential of a combined firm would far exceed that of UTX as a standalone. Honeywell has an impressive track record of realizing synergies post-acquisition, and the $3.5 billion in cost saving synergies identified in the proposed Honeywell-United Technologies transaction appear conservative and fully realizable. Increased purchasing power leverage for the combined firm should result in well over $1 billion in annual savings in purchasing and raw material spend, as the company will be able to negotiate more favorable terms on electronics, metals and mechanical purchases.Similarly, real estate consolidation and more efficient contract manufacturing and logistics should produce savings of close to $1.5 billion. Corporate SG&A efficiencies will also be realized. There also appears to be significant revenue generating synergies that include channel and geographic expansion. The strategic rationale for a transaction is strong, and we believe the overall earning power of a combined firm will benefit shareholders significantly and allow for greater long-term dividend growth.What is the Fair Value of United Technologies?Based on a DCF valuation, we believe $108 per share to be at the very low end of our fair value estimate for United Technologies. We arrived at a range of fair value of $106 to $122 per share for UTX as an independent company. We believe the higher end of the range is a more realistic valuation and represents an EV/EBITDA multiple of 10.7-11.1. For a global leader in aerospace systems and commercial and residential HVAC systems, the EBITDA multiple is consistent with competitors. In our view, if Honeywell increases its offer of $108 per share by only 7.1%-11.1% to $116.20-$121.50, a transaction will likely be agreed upon by the board of United Technologies and approved by the shareholders of the company.(Source: Author's estimates)For the reasons stated, we believe shareholders are interested in selling their shares in UTX if the price is slightly more attractive and closer to the high-end of our fair value estimate. Additionally, many investors will prefer to become shareholders in the combined firm where there is significant potential for sustained top-line and earnings growth.The regulatory concerns of the transaction raised by the UTX board appear to be significantly overstated and merely a means to discourage a bid from Honeywell. From an antitrust perspective, the combined firm's position in the aerospace market will receive the closest scrutiny, but Honeywell's competitive strengths are in: (1) industrial fire and safety, (2) refining and petrochemicals, and (3) global turbochargers sales. There is not much overlap with UTX in these market leading businesses. Honeywell still has a top aerospace and defense technology platform but is not the global leader in this large and fragmented industry. The antitrust authorities will likely require divestitures of certain aerospace assets, but we believe they will be contained to the aerospace business segments and not impact the overall strategic rationale for the acquisition. In our view, the combination of the portfolios after any divestiture will be significantly value enhancing and provide shareholders with a diverse set of leading global assets.(Source: Honeywell Investor Presentation, February 2016)The TakeawayA combined Honeywell-United Technologies will have far more attractive growth prospects, earning power, and an optimal capital structure for long-term shareholder creation. We believe a transaction is likely to occur if Honeywell raises its offer to $116-$122 per share. We believe UTX's shareholders would receive full value for their shares at this price and will have the ability to participate in a transformational deal as a shareholder in the combined firm with close to $100 billion in annual revenue. Despite the board of UTX rejecting the recent offer, we expect that negotiations will take place and a transaction will be consummated at a higher value."
3948846,97486,2016-03-02T15:10:11-05:00,"HON and UTX recently broke off talks of regarding the proposed $90.7 billion acquisition by HON.Now they are remaining standalone companies, which (if either) should you invest in?HON outperforms its peer in almost every regard: cash flow, revenue growth, dividend strength and growth.HON and UTX are both trading below fair value despite HON trading at a higher valuation.","The $90.7 billion offer by Honeywell (NYSE:HON) to buy rival United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) was formally closed just a few days ago. Both companies now have to focus on returning to ""business as usual."" In light of this, I thought it a good time to take a look at the two to see whether either should attract my money.Industrial conglomerates have interested me in recent months as I look to bulk up what is a underweight sector in my portfolio. Much smaller rival, Roper Technologies (NYSE:ROP), in particular attracted my attention in February.Honeywell has been happily snapping up smaller acquisitions for some time. In 2015 is picked up meter business Elster, satellite equipment maker COM DEV. In 2016 it shows little signs of slowing down with it acquiring fire and intrusion equipment maker Xtralis.In contrast, United Technologies has attracted attention through its divestitures. Most prominently this has included its Sikorsky helicopter and aircraft division.United Technologies has seen investor sentiment sour significantly in recent months, however. Share price weakness therefore threw open an opportunity for Honeywell to make a bid:HON data by YChartsNonetheless, this has gone no further. So, with the M&A excitement passed, what are investors to do? Should you think of investing in the predator or the prey?Let's take a look.Stumbling Revenue GrowthRevenue growth in 2015 had been hard to come by at both Honeywell and United Technologies. Their sheer scale (Honeywell had an enterprise value of $86.5 billion and United Technologies of $93.8 billion) means growth is a little harder to come by: Honeywell has remained by far the most impressive performer in this regard, however. Revenue shrinkage at the end of 2015 may have dented the stunning revenue performance in recent years. Nonetheless, its revenue still remains generously above 2011 levels which is something that United Technologies cannot claim with revenue ending 2015 flat relative to 2011 levels.Being international operations, revenue figures for both continue to be hit hard by foreign currency headwinds. Honeywell and United Technologies saw 4% chipped of revenue growth each in 2015 due to this:Volumes grew for both (if modestly). The only area where the factor effect differed was with regards to acquisitions and divestitures. Honeywell and United Technologies therefore performed quite equally in 2015.A similar trend is anticipated in the near future. Projections suggest revenue growth of 1.66% per annum for Honeywell and 1.05% per annum for United Technologies over the next two years.Honeywell is still expected to grow faster than United Technologies in the near-future. Consequently I would have to favor Honeywell over its peer so far.Operating MarginsRevenue growth is all good. Yet where Honeywell really pulls away from United Tech is with regards to profit growth. Since 2011 Honeywell's profit has almost tripled whilst United Technologies has actually shrunk:More impressive revenue growth over at Honeywell obviously feeds into this greater profit growth. Yet a far larger impact has been derived from Honeywell's impressive focus on operating margin improvements.United Technologies has seen its strong margins sit fairly static in recent years. Honeywell, in contrast, has seen its margins improve by over 10.75% in the last five years:Such margin expansion was helped by a much lower base in 2011 than United Technologies. Nonetheless, Honeywell's incredible success in expanding margins has paid off handsomely. In 2015 Honeywell's margins passed United Technologies for the first time in many years.Margin momentum does not look likely to slow in coming years either. With the United Technologies' purchase set aside, Honeywell can focus on continuing this progress.Personally, Honeywell's historic course of margin improvement combined with smaller acquisitions and disposals was the right one. Evidence through margin improvement and solid financial performance in light of tough economic conditions seems to support this. ""Business as usual"" is exactly what we want to see. Honeywell is performing well. A super-sized acquisition seems likely to throw a spanner in the works.In light of the failed bid, Honeywell has to be given the advantage here.Cash Flow GenerationIn a similar vein, Honeywell has (hardly surprisingly) managed to improve its FCF generation largely in line with profit improvements in recent years:United Technologies has struggled a great deal in recent years to make any FCF generation improvements stick. Issue still persists with some of its core businesses such as Pratt & Whitney engines and Otis elevators. In light of this I see them struggling to reverse this anytime soon.Honeywell's continued pursuit of smaller deals has helped bolster this FCF growth. Yet this has been done so increasingly efficiently. Despite debt growing to assist in such acquisitions it continues to generate impressive amounts of cash from its invested capital:With a CROIC (cash return on invested capital) of nearly 14.4%, for every $100 of capital invested (that is, total debt and equity) it generated $14.37 in FCF. United Technologies, in contrast, pulled in a solid but weaker $8.87.This is important. The more cash it can produce from its current invested capital then the faster the company will be able to grow through acquisitions and other investments internally rather than having to turn to external funds such as debt to fuel growth.Honeywell again looks in excellent health. FCF generation is impressive, efficient and growing. Honeywell has to be favored from this perspective too.Debt SituationHoneywell and United Technologies have both seen their debt levels nearly double since 2011. Yet over that time, Honeywell has also seen its equity almost double as well. United Technologies equity has also grown in that time but at a much more modest rate.Despite this, the companies' debt to equity ratios are fairly equal:Honeywell is clearly more lightly leverage than its peer and I expect this to continue going forward. More important to me though is the FCF coverage of this debt. Unsurprisingly considering the strong FCF and debt position at Honeywell, it again performs better than United Technologies: United Technologies retain a comfortable debt coverage. Indeed, at 20.7% it could (theoretically) pay off its entire debt using its FCF only in a little under five years even in light of weakening FCF in recent years.Honeywell continues to shine here though. With a FCF/Debt ratio of 36.3% it could repay its total debt the same way in less than three years. Very impressive.Honeywell's debt and FCF strength is understandably reflected in its credit ratings (find out more on how I normalize credit ratings here):Honeywell should continue to attract more generous interest rates going forward. Great news for investors as we can only presume Honeywell will continue its accretive acquisition program.Overall, it is hard to argue that Honeywell is stronger from a debt perspective as well.DividendIt is beginning to look like a bit of a whitewash for Honeywell. But wait a moment. How about the all-important dividend?Honeywell actually sits with a smaller yield than its peer at present. With a historic yield of 2.03% compared to United Technologies' 2.69%, yield hunters may be better placed to follow United Technologies after all? Not quite:Certainly United Technologies yields more right now. Yet it also pay out more of its FCF to achieve this yield. From a FCF yield perspective (that is, the dividend yield if all FCF was paid out as a dividend) Honeywell actually edges ahead again of its peer.If Honeywell decided to match the payout ratio of United Technologies it would also yield around the 2.7% mark. Honeywell therefore has more scope to grow its dividend. What is more, in recent years it has been more willing and able to grow this dividend at a faster pace than United Technologies:An investor who received a $100 dividend from Honeywell in 2011 would have received nearly $157 in 2015. In contrast, an investor receiving $100 from United Technologies in 2011 would have received just over $133 in 2015.Honeywell seems happy to retain this accelerated dividend growth going forward, too. In October 2015 the company hiked its dividend 15%. At the same time, Honeywell's CEO, Dave Cote, stated that:Music to the ears of a dividend investor. A fast growing, well-covered dividend from a consistently impressively performing business.ValuationNow we come to the matter of valuation. Surely in light of all the above we should find Honeywell trading well-ahead of United Technologies? You're right. It is:The valuation gap is not as steep as I was expecting, however. Certainly even faster predicted EPS growth fails to entirely close the valuation gap for Honeywell in the next couple of years. The distance in quality between Honeywell and United Technologies does not seem to be fully reflected in their respective valuations in my mind.So what should their fair value's be? Which, if either, are trading below their fair value?Fair ValueI calculate my fair value by taking the consensus EPS predictions for the next two years. I then average these figures and multiply them by the average PE valuation for the companies over the last five years.First let's look at United Technologies. The average PE over the last five years has been 16.6. Using this as my fair valuation multiple provides us with a:I then adjust this by the amount of cash held on their books. Doing so provides us with a:United Technologies trades at just over $95 at present. This suggests it is trading at a 15% discount to its basic fair value and a 21% discount to its cash-adjusted fair value. Good bargain it would seem.But what about Honeywell? Well, over the last five years it has averaged a higher average PE valuation of 18.6. Understandable in light of its impressive performance. Using this as my fair valuation multiple offers us a:Again adjusted for cash throws off a:Honeywell currently trades at just under $106. Consequently Honeywell also trades at a discount to its basic fair value of 17.9% and its cash-adjusted fair value of 22.2%.ConclusionBoth Honeywell and United Technologies are trading at similar discounts to my fair value. Yet for me Honeywell is by far the clear winner as an investment right now. Honeywell outperforms United Technologies from almost every viewpoint. United Technologies is undoubtedly a high-quality operation. However, it continues to underperform its peer.My one worry with regards Honeywell is the United Technologies bid itself. I am not entirely sure that such mega-acquisitions are in the best interests of the company or its shareholders. Honeywell's current smaller acquisition and integration strategy seems to me much more attractive and, judging from the above, lucrative.That being said, the United Technologies bid was opportunistic to say the least. A $90.7 billion bid for a company with an enterprise value higher was always going to be a struggle to get agreement for. Competition concerns-whether Honeywell agreed about their severity or not-were significant and compounded this difficulty. Hopefully this should mean that such mega-acquisitions are not going to be the ""norm"" for Honeywell in the future.Honeywell has a compelling history of efficient revenue, profit and cash flow generation and growth over the last few years. I anticipate this to continue. Teamed with a modest but hardly meager dividend which has and is set to continue to grow rapidly in coming years I'd find it hard to argue against it especially when it appears to be trading at a very fair valuation.NotesUnless otherwise stated, all graphs and the calculations contained within them were created by the author.

3924156,93346,2016-02-24T09:14:50-05:00,Honeywell is doing great but could do even better going forward.The Dow Chemical and Du Pont deal is leading the way for ambitious future deals.Likewise Japanese MHI has forged several champions with different partners in recent years.Honeywell should evaluate options to join forces with the likes of Emerson and Eaton in order to unleash its full potential.,"Dow Chemical (NYSE:DOW) and Du Pont (NYSE:DD) surprised investors with an innovative merge & split deal, seeking to create three focused champions out of two chemical conglomerates.One of the conglomerates with the broadest offering of products and technologies is Honeywell (NYSE:HON). It recently evaluated merger options with United Technologies Corp (UTC).Below, I'll argue that Honeywell could create lots of value by imitating DowDuPont with the right partner.The splitting and off-spinning trendHoneywell is often viewed as a supplier to the Aviation & Defense industry. However, it has also decent market shares in industries as distinct as energy, automotive, chemicals and industrial automation. Many investors don't like companies that lack focus. They prefer players that can fully leverage a certain trend.Therefore, conglomerates are often punished with a lower valuation. It appears to be likely that Honeywell managers are elaborating a plan to change this situation by recombining its business units together with one or more partners.Ideally, Honeywell finds a partner with activities in several of these business areas. The process would be somewhat easier, if it would be a North American group, but overseas options should not be discarded.Even the traditionally hesitating Japanese are slowly opening to more innovative corporate transformation initiatives. The planned merging of personal computing businesses around Vaio comes first to my mind.Besides, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (OTCPK:MHVYF) has created several champions in recent years with partners, among them an offshore wind power company, a steelmaking equipment supplier and a Fossil Power Systems group, and several others.Transatlantic deals of this kind can currently been studied with the General Electric (NYSE:GE)/Alstom (OTCPK:ALSMY) merger that led to the creation of Railway, Wind Power, Grid Solutions, and Fossil Power Generation champions.Essentially, almost every technology group is working on streamlining its portfolio by focusing more on core competencies. Activist investors seem to be pressing for splits and spin-offs everywhere.The fact that Honeywell has been in talks with UTC recently gives evidence that the management might be planning to restructure its conglomerate.Will Honeywell stick to traditional portfolio management?Currently, Honeywell is basically doing some empire building. In 2015 the group spent $8b for its expansion, most of it for M&A transactions: 3 of the deals are for Aero, 2 for ACS, and 3 for PMT. At the Q4-2015 earnings call CEO David M. Cote said that they are prepared to act when new opportunities arise.Another type of opportunity would be to envision a DowDuDont type of deal, alternatively to spin-off its Aerospace & Defense business or to create some MHI-style joint venture champions with several partners.Obviously, options are almost infinite. However, I would like to present some appealing deals that would in my opinion - if done right - benefit investors to a large extent.Idea 1: Creating champions with EmersonEmerson (NYSE:EMR) and Honeywell are two great American companies with much overlap. With a merge & split deal, they could create several champions:All Emerson divisions would go into these new market leaders, each of which big enough to successfully compete in the global market on its own.Competition authorities might have some minor objections, but in general, none of the three new combinations would be a dominant entity, since domestic and overseas competition is strong, as far as I can see.Remaining Honeywell businesses would mainly include chemical, automotive, and aerospace & defense.Idea 2: Do it with EatonSimilar to Emerson, Ireland based Eaton (NYSE:ETN) has much overlap with Honeywell. The company had 2015 sales revenues of $20.9b, has a global footprint and a strong American heritage of 100+ years.Again, three focused businesses could be forged:All activities of Eaton would go into these merged entities, which appear to be viable from a competition perspective. Honeywell's remaining businesses in this case would mainly consist of Chemicals, Consumer & Home, Industrial Process Control and Safety & Security.Idea 3: Creating champions with Japanese partnersThe MHI way is definitely an option for Honeywell to further improve the global market position of its business units.Starting with Aero, we should take note of the ambitious Japanese aviation programme. The same MHI will launch a commercial airplane by 2017 and aims to take 50 % of the regional jet market.The most advanced programs of Boeing and Airbus rely heavily on Japanese technology. Therefore, it might be a good idea to join forces with one of these aerospace suppliers. There are several interesting business units that could contribute a lot of complementary technology to a combined aerospace company, though it's difficult to decide what could be feasible.Process Control could easily find a Japanese counterpart for a merged entity. E.g. together with Mitsubishi Electric (OTC:MIELF), it could forge a top 5 automation vendor. Additionally, Mitsubishi could contribute some of its Energy Management Assets.Concerning Performance Materials, Japan has a lot to off, too. I would like to suggest Sumitomo Chemical (OTCPK:SOMMY) which has a similar market position with a complementary product portfolio. Together they could raise visibility for their innovative specialty products, share R&D efforts, and cover a broader range of applications.The result of such transactions would be three or four focused companies that count among the leading industry players.ConclusionCurrently, Honeywell appears to be a very well managed group of companies with profit margins that are superior to most of its peers. However, going forward there should be a strategy to further create value for all stakeholders. Organic growth is weak and might translate one day into margin erosion, too.Forging focused industry leaders with one or more partners could be a great opportunity for Honeywell and I believe that there is a real possibility that the management will come up with something this year. Accordingly, there is much more upward potential than downside in my point of view.Above, I proposed my favorite combinations. Let me know which are yours in the comments section.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

3877676,39011,2016-02-09T07:07:27-05:00,"HON is grappling with a tough sales environment.
        But its margins continue to post staggering growth rates.
        Guidance for this year is light so I think HON can beat but even if I’m wrong, it’s still cheap.","Honeywell (NYSE:HON) is a really interesting story in this horrible, volatile market we've had in the past few months. It continues to chug along, not moving higher, but not getting killed either, as it continues to produce steady, stable results. Last time I visited HON the stock was trading for $97 and I posited at the time that its long term buy status was intact. The company's very reasonable earnings multiple along with its diversification and sales and margin momentum coincide to form a very favorable environment for earnings growth. That's why I liked HON in the past but is all of that still true?HON's Q4 earnings report was about as expected; strong margin expansion but overall sales underwhelmed. HON's sales overall fell 3% but that is really just the tip of the iceberg with this company. My bullishness in the past has not been due to rapid sales growth forecasts - as those don't exist for HON - but rather its tremendous level of margin expansion that allows HON to make a lot more money on each dollar of revenue as time goes on. HON's margin expansion story is one of the best in the entire market and it continues to show just how good it is at wringing profits from each dollar of revenue.Segment margin flew higher again in Q4, rising 290bps to 18.8% from 15.9% in the year ago quarter. In addition, minus a pension adjustment the company's operating margin was 18%, up from just 14.5% last year. That is an incredible level of margin growth and that is why HON is a buy; even with flat revenue, margin growth like that allows for outsized profit growth and that is all that matters. HON's cost saving initiatives are paying huge dividends (literally and figuratively) and management went so far as to guide for even more expansion in 2016. That is very bullish for 2016 and beyond as HON's operating margins continue to rise and I don't think current forecasts include this.The company's Aerospace business continues to be the star of the show as it was the only segment to post a sales gain and its margins expanded 450bps to 21.5%. Excluding Q4 2014 OEM incentives the gain in margins was a much more modest 50bps but the point stands that Aerospace is HON's pride and joy at the moment. The stories are similar for the other major segments minus the part about sales growing; the sales environment for multinationals is certainly hostile right now but HON's sales declines were very manageable. Again, it's key to focus on margin expansion, not trivial losses on the top line.HON does buy back some stock and while the amount isn't earth-shattering, it is a respectable 1.7% of the float over the last year. That level of share count reduction will roughly offset the lower sales HON is seeing although that pressure on sales is expected to abate in 2016.Given the buyback and the company's expected sales growth of 4% or 5%, the analyst community's estimate of just 8% EPS growth in 2016 is quite achievable. Analysts are right in the middle of both sales and EPS guidance ranges HON provided so no gold stars go out for creativity but I think HON can achieve those numbers.For it to hit 8% EPS growth this year it can get perhaps 1.5% to 2% from buybacks, 4% to 5% from top line growth and more than the balance from margin expansion. Using the lower ends of those ranges we get 5.5% of EPS expansion from the buyback and revenue, leaving just 2.5% needed from margin expansion. Considering the company's operating margins expanded by 18.5% in 2015, that seems like a very reasonable task. With the company's cost saving initiatives still very much in full swing, I think HON's guidance is light and that it set itself up to beat. We aren't likely going to see $7 in EPS or anything like that but I certainly would not be surprised to see $6.75 or $6.80 based upon middle-of-the-road revenue growth but higher margin expansion. That leaves us with some upside potential for 2016 in HON because it is cheap even if it just hits consensus.HON is trading for just 15.4 times this year's earnings and 13.8 times next year's earnings and given that it is slated to grow its EPS at high single digits for the foreseeable future, that's cheap. Its margin expansion alone would justify that level of valuation so if HON can produce even minimal gains on the top line, it should be in good shape.While they aren't exactly the same business, GE is a good comparison to HON and it is trading for 18.7 times this year's estimates despite the fact that it has so many variables surrounding its Capital exit and transformation of its business. HON is stable and steady and you know what you're going to get and what you get is cost discipline leading to tremendous margin growth.HON has held up during the recent market turmoil very well and that is no accident; this is a true blue chip industrial stock that you can buy for your kids and sleep at night. With HON's FCF continuing to grow and dividends and buybacks a priority, HON is a great buy at less than 14 times next year's earnings."
3919776,25218,2016-02-23T09:17:47-05:00,"I examine the potential but unlikely deal between Honeywell & United Technologies.I used multiple methods in my process to determine whether a deal with United Technologies was attractive.I determined that even if a deal would somehow pass regulatory scrutiny, the deal would not be attractive for Honeywell.","In this article, I will be looking at what a combined Honeywell (NYSE:HON) and United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) would look like along with an estimation of what Honeywell would be worth. As I was about done writing this article, there was an update that came out and it stated the UTX did not explore the deal because of ""significant regulatory obstacles, customer concerns and valuation issues."" As I will detail below, even if a deal somehow made it through regulatory issues, etc, Honeywell purchasing United Technologies would not be a very attractive deal in my opinion.Combined Honeywell/United TechnologiesTo start, I looked at each company apart to assess how each of their business segments would fit together. The data in the following table was taken from a recent Honeywell earnings release and a recent United Technologies investor presentation.Sales by Segment[Table data in millions]Combined Honeywell & United TechnologiesWhen looking at combined company sales, I grouped Aerospace, Pratt & Whitney and Aerospace systems in one segment, Automation, control & security in another segment and performance materials and Otis [elevators] in their own segments. The combined data is in the table below as well as visually shown in the chart following the table. The combined company would be a massive player in aerospace as well as in automation, control and security markets. That massive scale in those two segments is the reason why a deal would face extremely tough scrutiny with regulators.[Table data in millions][Chart data sourced from Honeywell's earnings release and United Tech.' investor presentation referenced above]The DealThe deal as noted by CNBC had the following terms ""The discussions occurred within the past two weeks and were focused on a deal in which Honeywell offered a premium, largely in stock with some cash, for the smaller United Technologies."" In determining whether a deal would be attractive, I first looked at the operating incomes for each company, which was sourced from Honeywell's earnings release, the United Technologies' investor presentation and that data. As you can see HON trades at a slight premium to UTX, however, that premium is well deserved given that HON before the news was up about 2% over the last year compared to a decline of nearly 30% for UTX.[Table data from HON earnings release and UTX investor presentation]UTX Purchase PriceThe table below shows the process I went through to determine if the deal would be worth it for Honeywell. The key variables in the table are the UTX purchase price and the cash component of the deal. For a comparable premium for a potential deal, I looked at the premium for the Dow Chemical (NYSE:DOW) and DuPont (NYSE:DD) merger of equals, which had a 15.90% premium from the time when rumors of a deal were first mentioned on November 5th, 2015.Cash ComponentFor the cash component, I looked at the most recent earnings transcript from Honeywell and found a question by Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC that led to the amount of cash capacity that Honeywell has for a deal. ""Can you just clear the air on if something big came up, kind of how far, what do you think your capacity is from a ratings agency perspective? How far would you be willing to go as far as capital deployment, call it, over the next couple of years?""The answer provided by CEO Dave Cote shows that they expect to have $20-$30 billion of capacity as far as cash for potential deals. Being conservative, I used the $20 billion figure, which was the low end of the range given. ""We had something like $20 billion to $30 billion in capacity over the next five years when you looked at cash generation and debt capacity as EBITDAR grew. I'd say that's still the case. We've only deployed about $6 billion, $8 billion out of the $30 billion or so we're going to generate and the capacity that we'll generate over that five-year period.""Deal ResultsThe table below shows that using a 15.90% premium to the current UTX share price and a cash component of $20 billion, the deal would be moderately attractive to Honeywell, with an upside of 9.31%. With ""only"" 9% upside to the current share price, this does not make the deal attractive in my opinion.[Shares Outstanding data from Gurufocus]Long-Term Impact of DealLooking at the long-term impact of the deal in terms of discounted cash flows, I found that HON would not see a large benefit from a deal with UTX. I conducted a discounted cash flow analysis and found that by doing the deal, HON would only see a 5.82% [$105.59-$99.78/$99.78=5.82%] increase in its fair value compared to a current standalone Honeywell.I used data from the table below as well as the following Discount rate calculator and to calculate the terminal growth rate I used this calculator. I also assumed growth would last for five years and level off to the terminal growth rate.FCF/Share & growth rate for combined company[FCF data from Gurufocus, in millions]Combined company DCF vs. Current HONHON/UTX CombinedStandalone Honeywell DCFClosing ThoughtsIn closing, I believe that even if a deal with United Technologies were possible that it would not be in the best interest of Honeywell because the potential upside is limited because of the massive dilution that would occur because of the large stock component of a potential deal. The data shows that Honeywell would be better off by staying a standalone company and continuing to dominate United Technologies. With the news that was reported after hours, it looks like this deal will not be happening anytime soon, though.Disclaimer: See here."
3888876,24361,2016-02-11T15:17:47-05:00,"Honeywell didn't do as well as some peers relative to fourth-quarter expectations, but its revenue and margin performance was superior to that of most comparables in most respects.2016 is looking like a rough year for multiple businesses, but the company remains structurally leveraged to growth in commercial aviation, building automation, and specialty materials.If Honeywell can manage better than 6% long-term FCF growth, a fair value of $108 is in play today.","After a pretty typically Honeywell (NYSE:HON) quarter, I'm a little surprised that the shares are as reasonably priced as they are. Although the market is pretty lousy right now, Honeywell is the kind of stock that I'm accustomed to seeing trade above, if not well above, fair value, due in large part to its (rightly) perceived quality. And yet, the shares still look around 5-15% undervalued.Although Honeywell is not likely to be a dramatic outperformer, I think this is a pretty good price to acquire shares of a company that is more than just ""pretty good"" and could be a cornerstone holding for patient investors.Not Much Drama In These NumbersI guess I could complain that Honeywell didn't beat expectations in a quarter where ABB Ltd. (NYSE:ABB), Emerson Electric (NYSE:EMR), Rockwell Automation (NYSE:ROK), and Siemens (OTCPK:SIEGY) did, but I think that would be pretty unfair considering that a lot of those beats were of the ""less bad"" variety, and Honeywell had some notable positives.Revenue was flat to down 1% on a core basis, with Aerospace up 2%, Automation and Control Solutions (or ACS) flat, and Performance Materials and Technologies (or PMT) down 4%. Gross margin was up strongly on both an as-reported and adjusted basis (up three points on the less flattering basis), and segment profits were up about 14%, with segment margin up almost three points. Operating was up 16% as-reported and 21% adjusted, with pretty much all of that gross margin leverage preserved.Aero Cleared For Takeoff, But There Will Be DelaysNothing has changed to make me think that 2016 won't be a good year for commercial aerospace, and Honeywell reported 9% growth in its Commercial OE business and 3% growth in its Commercial Aftermarket business to close out 2015. Management's guidance for a mid-single digit decline in 2016 stems from incentives it gave OEMs like Boeing (NYSE:BA) to win business, but the underlying business would otherwise grow at a low-single digit rate.Defense was down 1% this quarter, but management is looking for a low-single digit improvement in the coming year. There is comparability between Honeywell and Microsemi (NASDAQ:MSCC) (a semiconductor company), which is looking for better defense sales in 2016 and a long-awaited improvement in the satellite business.Transportation was up 1% this quarter, as Honeywell reported good results in the passenger vehicle space that offset weakness in commercial vehicles. Commercial vehicles are probably going to weigh more heavily in 2016 given the weakening truck market (and management guided for low- to mid-single digit growth), but Honeywell at least has the advantage of being relatively less exposed to Volkswagen (VLKAY) than Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (OTCPK:MHVYF) and IHI (OTCPK:IHICF). While BorgWarner (NYSE:BWA) reported stronger sales growth in the fourth quarter (up 7%), its guidance for the year (org revenue growth of 2.5-5.5%) fits Honeywell's view.Looking past the incentive-related pressure in 2016, Aero (specifically, commercial aerospace) looks like a good market for Honeywell for several years. There's plenty of competition in the market, with United Technologies (NYSE:UTX), General Electric (NYSE:GE), Rockwell Collins (NYSE:COL), and Parker-Hannifin (NYSE:PH), but Honeywell has solid wins, and those incentives should help ensure the company is well placed to leverage increased build rates in the coming years.ACS OkayThere's not a lot to get excited about right now in the ACS business, but it's not exactly a weak business either. Revenue was flat on a core basis, with Energy, Safety, and Security down 1% on weaker sensing product sales, while Building Solutions and Distribution was up 3%. Margin leverage was more modest here as well, as segment profits increased less than 1% and margin improved by 70bp.Honeywell is only looking for low-single digit growth in both ESS and BSD in 2016, and I'm starting to think my expectations of a stronger non-residential market in 2016 are/were too optimistic. Siemens reported 3% growth in revenue and orders for its Building Tech segment, and likewise, there wasn't anything too exciting out of United Technologies. I'd also note that Emerson's Climate business - which is very different than Honeywell, but includes commercial HVAC compressors and controls - has been pretty weak of late.PMT An Odd MixHoneywell's PMT business saw a weaker-than-expected 4% decline in core PMT sales, but profits did improve about 9%, with a nearly four-point improvement in margin. Although ABB, Emerson, and Siemens all reported weakness in their process automation businesses, Honeywell's Process Solutions business saw flat core revenue performance, as lower field instrumentation sales were offset by software. UOP was down on lower gas processing orders, while Advanced Materials declined 12% as a sharp drop in Resins & Chemicals offset better flourine sales (particularly Solstice).It looks like mixed results will continue to be the story for some time here. UOP is forecast down mid-single digits on weaker catalysts, while Advanced Materials is expected to rise by mid-single digits, helped by Solstice. Somehow, Honeywell continues to look for flat performance in Process Solutions despite the ongoing crapalanche in the oil & gas sector (a major process automation end market, but not so much so for Honeywell, given more exposure to markets like pulp/paper and pharma).Keep On Keeping OnJudging by management's comments on the earnings call, there's no reason to expect any major changes in Honeywell's operating plans. It has minimal exposure/risk to the Johnson Controls (NYSE:JCI)-Tyco (NYSE:TYC) deal, Solstice is growing well, and the company is looking to increase its focus on software development (something that ABB wants to do as well, but is starting much further back). Honeywell is also keep its options open with respect to M&A, with the recent $480 million deal for Xtralis (a maker of smoke detectors, security, and video products for buildings) probably a good example of what management is looking for in future deals (albeit probably not at such high multiples, if possible).I'm not really changing much about my model, and I'm looking for revenue growth in the neighborhood of 4% and FCF growth around 7%. Discounted back, that gives me a fair value of almost $108 (versus $106 back in mid-January).The Bottom LineI keep asking myself what I'm missing with Honeywell, as companies with good margins, good ROICs, and a solid reputation on the Street generally trade for more than their cash flow says they're worth. I understand that the market has soured on industrial conglomerates, but this too shall pass, and I think patient investors still have a solid opportunity here today."
3810276,65113,2016-01-14T11:00:14-05:00,"I believe Honeywell International (HON) to be significantly mispriced at this time.The company has developed a track record of significant increases in free cash flow, earnings and dividends.There's at least as much reason to like the stock this year as last year.","In February of last year, I wrote an article on Honeywell International (NYSE:HON) expressing bullish sentiment on the company, arguing that the stock was undervalued with the potential to go higher. In terms of price, we have seen no movement to the upside in the past year:However, the company has otherwise excelled, having expanded EPS to 5-year historical highs on a cumulative basis while significantly increasing its dividend yield:Moreover, with the S&P 500 down by almost 7 percent in the past year, I take the view that lack of growth in share price can be attributed to market risk - i.e., negative investor sentiment has hindered price growth while not serving as an accurate reflection of true financial performance.Additionally, I still take the view that Honeywell International is undervalued on a free cash flow basis:Price to free cash flow still remains the lowest among its peers, while the increase in free cash flow on a cumulative basis is also among the highest. In spite of the fact that Honeywell may not have grown in share-price terms, share ownership has had defensive value in that the stock has fallen far less than its competitors and the S&P 500.Overall, there are three reasons why I continue to be optimistic about this company:1) Net income and EPS growth in compound-annual-growth terms has been consistently higher relative to multi-industry peers:Source: Honeywell 2015 Proxy StatementMoreover, according to the company's five-year plan presentation 2014-18, at current rates of growth in profit margins, the company can be expected to generate double-digit earnings growth over this time.2) The company is in a very good position to capitalize on growth in emerging-market regions. For instance, the company has shown a 9% CAGR outside the U.S. Moreover, while growth in other developed regions was 6% CAGR, growth in ""high-growth regions"" was 15%. Much of this stems from the increasing rates of urbanization in these regions, with demand for industrial products across households increasing. In this regard, the company has been highly effective in expanding capacity to these regions, a fact reflected in these growth rates.3) The company's strong free cash flow position has enabled an increase in dividend growth at a faster rate than earnings per share. For instance, free cash flow at the end of 2014 was $3.9 billion and FCF conversion was 89%. In addition, the dividend rate for that year was increased by 15%, which is the tenth consecutive time that the company has been able to increase dividends by at least 10% over the past 10 years. With strong free cash flow metrics, such growth continues to be sustainable.To conclude, I remain highly optimistic on Honeywell International in spite of its lack of share price growth over the last year. In fact, negative market sentiment as a whole could well have been keeping the share price lower than fundamental value, and this could mark an attractive buying opportunity."

But General Electric is not the only conglomerate that investors might want to keep a close eye on. Honeywell International, Inc. (NYSE:HON) may not offer as compelling a transformation story as General Electric, but the company continues to grow its business at a good clip, but without much headlines. Honeywell's margin expansion trend in particular is worthy of attention and acknowledgement, even though General Electric has been stealing the spotlight from the company so far.Business as usual for HoneywellHoneywell's management could hold its head up high when it released Q4-15 earnings two weeks ago.Honeywell said it pulled in Q4-15 revenues of $10.0 billion compared against $10.3 billion in the year ago quarter. That may have been a decline of ~3% Y/Y but Honeywell's core organic revenues remained flat Y/Y. Besides a slight dent in Q4 revenues, Honeywell had a good quarter in terms of earnings (despite missing the consensus estimate), margin expansion and free cash flow.At the end of the day Honeywell raked in $1.58/share in adjusted profits as compared to $1.43/share in the year ago quarter. Analysts shot for adjusted earnings per share of $1.59.While Honeywell may have missed the consensus EPS estimate narrowly, there were more than enough reasons to like Honeywell's earnings and cash flow picture.For instance, Honeywell's free cash flows climbed 17% Y/Y from ~$1.3 billion to ~$1.6 billion, and the company continued to expand its margins which has been a main value driver for Honeywell in 2015.Source: HoneywellMargin growth story intactThe big takeaway from Honeywell's Q4 earnings, therefore, relates to its segment margin growth.In all its three business segments that separately report operating results, Honeywell saw strong Y/Y margin growth:In total, Honeywell's segment margin expanded a whopping 290 bps Y/Y to 18.8% on the back of a successful restructuring and productivity gains. In an earlier piece on Honeywell I contended that the theme of margin expansion would be a dominating theme in 2015 and beyond. That is still true today.Source: HoneywellGuidance calls for Y/Y margin gains and FCF growth, stock is not overpriced yetHoneywell's guidance for 2016 says that the company expects its total segment margin to expand 10-50 bps in 2016 and settle in somewhere between 18.0-18.4%. Honeywell's 2016 guidance is shown in this image:Source: Honeywell Earnings ReleaseBased on Honeywell's EPS and free cash flow guidance, which was part of its fourth quarter earnings release, Honeywell is not too expensive yet: HON sells for ~15.5x 2016e profits and for a ~6% FCF yield.Your TakeawayHoneywell may not be as exciting a transformation story as General Electric, but the company has had its fair share of successes in 2015. Honeywell's management is carefully controlling costs, which has contributed to robust Y/Y margin growth in its operating segments. Honeywell's 2016 guidance calls for 6-10% Y/Y profit growth and 5-10% Y/Y FCF growth while the company's stock is not too expensive yet on either an earnings or FCF basis. Buy for income and capital growth."
3820646,24361,2016-01-20T04:32:19-05:00,"Honeywell has sold off amidst wider fears that industrial companies will struggle to find growth in 2016.Honeywell's exposure to aerospace and non-residential construction should support one of the stronger growth outlooks in the industrial conglomerate sector.With a fair value in the range of $106 to $116 on the basis of mid-to-high single-digit FCF growth and mid-20%'s ROEs, Honeywell looks priced like a good long-term holding.","American industrial conglomerate Honeywell (NYSE:HON) has a lot of positives going for it - the company is leveraged to several markets that look relatively healthy going into 2016, management has credibility when it comes to margin improvement efforts, and the balance sheet is in pretty good shape. That said, investors are bailing out of industrials left and right, and Honeywell shares have fallen about 10% from my midyear update. What's more, the health of key markets like aerospace, construction, and auto aren't exactly guaranteed and industrial markets look to be in for a weak run.Between the prospects for a recession in manufacturing in 2016 and management's relatively conservative guidance for the year, I suppose I can understand why fund managers aren't eager to hold Honeywell right now. Nevertheless, I think this may well be a case where individual investors can benefit from not having that need to respond/report to clients with hair triggers; buying a dip usually means you're buying into trouble, but unless you think the world is in for a really bad stretch, I think this is the sort of opportunity that investors can exploit to get Honeywell shares at a more attractive price.Can Aerospace Do The Heavy Lifting?I expect commercial aerospace to be one of the stronger markets in 2016 and Honeywell generates about 30% of its revenue in this market (including defense). It's also generally a pretty lucrative business for Honeywell, as it typically competes with the Performance Materials business for the top spot with margins (which have recently been above 20%).And yet, when Honeywell gave guidance for 2016 back in December management guided to a relatively disappointing 1% to 2% revenue growth figure. I think it's first worth noting that management could be putting in a conservative number; there is certainly a risk that economic weakness will lead to lower air traffic and lower demand for aftermarket parts and services, but that's not a given yet. I would also note that Honeywell is going to be at the starting line with some multiyear OEM contracts and the concessions/incentives that Honeywell had to offer are going to weigh on reported growth in 2016.Longer term, I think Honeywell is in a good place with this business. Honeywell generates about half its aerospace business in avionics, a high-margin business that the company generally only has to split with Rockwell Collins (NYSE:COL) and a bit with General Electric (NYSE:GE) and Thales (OTC:THLEY). I'm also looking for improving capacity utilization in the coming years. Honeywell lost some share to Rockwell, GE, and United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) over the past decade due in large part to less competitive bids, but increased activity from new wins should be good for margins. As part of that process, I think Honeywell can also look forward to increased unit content - Honeywell used to make about $1.2 million in revenue per plane in the past decade, but content should improve by 10% or so as new programs like Airbus A350, Embraer L500, and Boeing 737 MAX should carry over $2 million/plane in Honeywell content.A Turbo Problem Revving Up?I think it is worth noting that Honeywell's Turbo Technologies business is reported as part of Aerospace and there are some risks to growth here. A large portion of this business consists of selling turbochargers for passenger vehicles and the Volkswagen scandal has definitely made an impression on the business. It doesn't sound as though Honeywell has any meaningful exposure to Volkswagen's U.S. diesel passenger car business, but over 50% of new auto sales in Europe are diesel and there is a threat that this scandal could decrease demand for diesel turbochargers.Construction Should Help Offset Weak AutomationManagement was likewise conservative with its Automation and Controls business, guiding for just 1% to 2% growth in 2016. The company's process automation business (about 20% of the segment) is likely to be weak; as observed with Rockwell Automation (NYSE:ROK) and ABB (NYSE:ABB), process automation in oil/gas and petrochemicals has fallen off sharply and other industrial process automation markets are starting to slow noticeably.On the other hand, the company's environmental and building controls businesses should fare well in a relatively stronger North American and European non-residential construction market. I think mid-single digit growth is possible in both markets, and I think Honeywell is well-placed relative to Emerson (NYSE:EMR), UTX, and Johnson Controls (NYSE:JCI) on the basis of new products and integrated solutions.Energy, Chemicals, And General Industrial Are Weak SpotsWhile I think aerospace and building controls have the potential to outperform expectations in 2016, I'm not as comfortable or confident with the outlook for Honeywell's businesses in energy, chemicals, and general industrial. On the positive side, ongoing use of natural gas as a fuel for electricity will help part of the catalyst business and the Solstice air conditioning product seems to be performing well.On the negative side, demand for refining catalysts, other flourine products, specialty chemicals, and products for the electronics markets is not likely to improve much if at all. Honeywell is also likely to see ongoing weakness in oil/gas/chemical process automation markets and industrial demand for safety, scanning, and sensing products could underwhelm as part of an overall general industrial slowdown.Sticking To Its KnittingHoneywell management has seemed calm and prepared for what is likely to be a weaker 2016 than investors were expecting around mid-2015. Integrating the large Elster acquisition will keep senior management busy, but here too I think the company has set expectations at a ""beatably"" conservative level. More to the point, I don't see any sign that Honeywell is going to deviate from its long-term plan, and given the results seen to date I don't see why they would want to.On the M&A front, Elster is the big deal that investors wanted to see, and I'd frankly be surprised if Honeywell took another big swing in M&A in 2016 - though they have the resources to do so if the right opportunity falls into their lap. Instead, I think the priority will be smaller deals like the recent acquisition of the outstanding 30% stake in UOP Russell. This isn't a sexy deal, but UOP Russell has been a good business for Honeywell, and this is the sort of deal that has virtually zero incremental integration or operational risk.Instead of big disruptive moves, I expect Honeywell to stick to its long-run focus on global themes like energy efficiency, increased urbanization, and increased air travel. I also expect the company to continue working on operating cost reductions as it targets 20% corporate operating margins, though a lot of progress has already been made here.With the weakness in general industrial and process markets in 2016, I trimmed my expectations for 2016 a little bit, but as I said above I do believe that aerospace and non-residential building will be good markets for the company. My long-term revenue growth expectation is still around 4% and I'm still expecting the company to approach a mid-teens FCF margin over time. That supports a fair value of around $106 today, while a ROE-driven price/book model gives me a target about $10/share higher.The Bottom LineThere are cheaper stocks in the industrial space, but I think Honeywell offers better quality than Ingersoll-Rand (NYSE:IR) and more security than names like ABB, Rockwell Automation, and Atlas Copco (OTCPK:ATLKY). I don't need big discounts to fair value to like high-quality names like Honeywell, and while I don't want to leave a false impression that there aren't risks to this name as well (particularly in aerospace demand), I think this is a good candidate for a long-term holding. That said, investors buying today have to accept the risk that the economic outlook for 2016 (and 2017) is still too high and that Honeywell could sell off further before finding bottom."

Over the years of trading, I've been through several stock research methodologies from various sources. This is how I came up with my 7 investing principles of dividend investing. The first four principles are directly linked to the company metrics. Let's take a closer look at them.Source: YChartsPrinciple #1: High dividend yield doesn't equal high returnsI recently wrote an article on Seeking Alpha explaining why I like smaller dividend yield stocks.Source: data from YCharts.HON can dip under the radar of many dividend growth investors as it just recently showed a dividend yield over 2% despite a strong dividend growth of 9.07% CAGR over the past 5 years. This point leads me to my second investing principle.Principle#2: If there is one metric, it's called dividend growthIn my view, there is no point of purchasing shares that will not come with an increasing payment year after year. This is the core of my dividend growth strategy. Honeywell has shown a strong dividend growth history and management has recently shared their 5-year plan (2014-2018) including dividend growth higher than earnings.Since the company expects EPS growth to be in the low double digits, you can expect a very strong dividend growth trend in the future.Principle #3: A dividend payment today is good, a dividend guaranteed for the next ten years is betterKeeping up with the same train of thought; past dividend growth is interesting, but what truly matters is future dividend growth. If you look at how the dividends paid compare with the payout ratio; you will see there is still plenty of room there:Source: data from Ycharts.As previously mentioned, management had announced last year that the dividend payout ratio will increase in the upcoming 4 years. In 2015, the dividend payment increase was of 15%. I'm not putting on my rose colored glasses and expecting a 15% dividend growth for the next 10 years, but I can appreciate the growth will be significant for several years to come.Principle #4: The Foundation of a dividend growth stock lies in its business modelI like finding companies I could buy today, put it in a box and forget about for the next ten years. I believe Honeywell is one such company. It benefits from a strong income base coming from the U.S. and is able to use its cash flow to seek growth in other markets where it continues to develop its infrastructure.The company has put additional focus on software engineering with nearly 11,000 engineers working on software instead of more classic industrial goods. The software business is better as it enables more combinations of services and drives higher margins. Honeywell certainly has some solid ground for future growth.What Honeywell Does With its Cash?Management has a clear definition of cash management:Source: Honeywell 5 year Plan (2014-2018) videoWith 50% allowed in share buybacks and dividend payments, we can bet shareholders will be kept happy for a while. On the other hand, I also like seeing the company's ability to acquire companies with another 50% of cash flow destined to growth.The company has proven many times in the past its great ability to integrate smaller companies into its infrastructure and generate greater synergies.Investment ThesisAn investment in HON is first and foremost an investment in a very strong dividend growth company. You can expect the company to boost its dividend payment significantly in the upcoming 5 years. Therefore, your dividend yield based on your cost of purchase will definitely hit over 3% in short order.The company's increasing margin will lead to additional profits and definitely an increase in stock price. This is the perfect combination of strong dividend growth and also a stock price growth potential. HON will provide both to investors.RisksWe already see the automation segment suffering from the oil & gas industry slump. This phenomenon seems to be continuing for longer than expected. It may affect short-term results over the next three years if prices don't go back up.There is a big hype around the company's ability to improve its operating margins year after year. We all know this will eventually end as we are definitely getting closer to the maximum margin possible. The market might be disappointed if the company doesn't reach its milestones.Should You Buy HON at this Value?We all know that stock valuation processes are as good as our assumptions. Therefore, it is often seen as borderline between science and art. In order to bring more credibility to my process, I use two different methods to determine if a company is trading at a fair price. The first method is quite simple; I look at the past 10 years of P/E valuation. This tells me how the market valued the stock over various economic stages:Source: data from YCharts.P/E ratio has been relatively stable since 2014 with a few dips. Overall, we can tell HON seems to be slightly undervalued from a P/E perspective. The company traded several times around 20 times its earnings. It seems like a good deal with a P/E of 17.31 at the moment.In order to add more solid ground to my analysis, I use a double-stage dividend discount model. Since Honeywell shows a very strong economic moat leading to steady cash flow generation, I will use a discount rate of 9%. I will use a first dividend growth rate of 8% for the first ten years. This number is slightly under the past 5-year average of 9%. In order to be more conservative, I also drop the dividend growth rate to 7% afterward.Source: Dividend Monk Toolkit Excel Calculation SpreadsheetThe company seems to be trading at a very good discount when we use the DDM. This is often the case when you look at strong dividend growth company. Looking at the dividend growth perspectives only, HON seems like a crazy deal, I'm not that confident the company shares could burst 30% in 2016.Final Thoughts on HON - Buy, Hold or Sell?Overall, Honeywell is a very strong company based on solid ground. I like management's clear portrait of future cash flow and think HON will provide both dividend increases and stock price growth in the future. As I've mentioned in the past, I think a fair value of $138 is probably too generous, but the company obviously has room to grow. HON is a buy.Disclaimer: I hold HON in my Dividend Stocks Rock portfolios. I will definitely buy HON in 2016."
3768196,25120,2015-12-21T09:39:07-05:00,"Honeywell managed to please investors with a decent outlook for 2016.The company has delivered on great margin improvements in recent years, as sales have been hurt by some outside factors.The company and investors have been frustrated with a lack of share price performance in the past 24 months, as shares had a great run in the years ahead.In order for me to buy the shares, I need a margin of safety which makes me a patient buyer at $80-$90 per share.","Honeywell (HON) updated the market with its expected performance for 2016 this week, as the outlook has been well received by the investment community.The company guides for solid earnings growth in the coming year as acquisitions and organic sales growth should overcome the currency headwinds. Combined with another year of targeted margin expansion, Honeywell expects decent earnings per share growth.While the company has been very successful to improve margins, sales have been lagging a bit in recent times for a myriad of reasons. Sluggish sales growth and high valuations from the start have been key drivers behind a disappointing performance of the stock, frustrating management in the process.To see solid future returns, investors should bet on CEO Dave Cote being able to a execute in the years ahead. If Mr. Cote can deliver on continued margin gains, decent returns can be achieved if you are able to buy shares on dips at around the $90 region, or less.A Solid 2016 AnticipatedHoneywell released a decent outlook for 2016 in what can be thought of as very difficult operating conditions. The company has been hit by a fall in industrial production levels, a strong dollar, and the turmoil in the energy sector. Despite these headwinds, Honeywell expects growth as a result of dealmaking and solid execution, seen through an anticipated increase in organic sales growth.The company sees revenues come in at $39.9 to $40.9 billion. This 4-6% sales growth is mainly driven by acquisitions as organic growth is seen at just 1-2%. The company does stress that this sales guidance is based on conservative assumptions.Honeywell anticipates that margin expansion will continue as segment margins are seen up by another 10-50 basis points to 18.9-19.3% of sales, with M&A activity having a mildly dilutive effect. Honeywell has been quite active in dealmaking in recent times with the purchase of Elster, Aero Connectivity and PMT, among others.More deals can reasonably be expected in the future as the company operates with a pretty flattish net cash position, as of the third quarter of this year. It should be said that some announced acquisitions still have to close, resulting in some incremental leverage being taken on.The combination of sales growth and margin expansion supports a 6-10% anticipated increase in earnings per share for 2016. Earnings are now seen at $6.45 to $6.70 per share on the back of a rather flattish share base. It must be said that part of the anticipated $0.35-$0.60 increase in the earnings per share results from a positive mark-to-market impact of the company´s pension fund. This factor will add some $0.15 per share to the anticipated earnings, offset by continued currency headwinds of course.What About The Multiples?Honeywell is a diversified business operating in three major segments. The Aerospace business makes up roughly 40% of sales as segment margins are currently seen at 21-22%, below the long term target of 25%.The automation and control solutions business is generating roughly 35% of sales, as 16-17% segment margins trail its long term target of 20%. The performance materials and technologies segments is the smallest segment, representing a quarter of total sales. Honeywell sees further upside for that segment as well, as margins should be able to expand from a current 21% to 25% in the long run.Being so well diversified in terms of activities, and having high and stable margins, Honeywell´s CEO Dave Cote is frustrated with the relative low multiple at which the stock is trading. At $102, shares of Honeywell trade at 16-17 times 2015s earnings. Based on the guidance for the coming year, the multiple drops towards 15-16 times earnings.While this is more or less in line with the rest of the market, Honeywell is disappointed to see other well-run industrial conglomerates like MMM (MMM) trade at a multiple which is roughly 3 points higher. Even General Electric (GE) has been valued at richer multiples in recent times following the aggressive divestiture of the financial activities.A Solid Performer, As Cote Guides For Further Margin GainsTo gauge if Honeywell´s future plans have any credibility, let´s check out the performance of the company over the past decade. Honeywell has increased sales by some 45% between 2005 and 2015, translating into growth of nearly 4% per annum.The real achievement has been seen in terms of operating margins. Honeywell has long posted margins of around 10% until its CEO Dave Cote has outlined plans to improve these margins to much higher levels. An increased organizational focus, cost savings and shift towards higher value-added activities have all been helpful in order to achieve these margin gains. Following the successful implementation of these initiatives, margins have risen to roughly 16% at the moment.The company claims that segment earnings, with roughly come in 2% above the reported operating margins, should increase by another 3% in the coming years. If Honeywell can deliver on this plan, operating margins are seen at around 19% by 2020.If the company achieves this, operating earnings could improve by roughly a billion, or some $700 million after-tax. This could add roughly $1 per share to the reported earnings in the years to come.The question is if operating margins of around 19% are sustainable in the long run, although Honeywell has clearly moved up in the value chain in terms of its activities.2020 ScenariosAt the moment Honeywell is a $40 billion business as acquisitions and organic growth should support growth in the years to come. If the company continues to grow topline sales by 4-5%, sales of $50 billion should be within reach by 2020-2022.If the company maintains margins at a current 16% of sales, after-tax earnings could come in at $5.7 billion. This is based on an estimated interest bill of $400 million and effective tax rate of 25%. Assuming that the outstanding share base remains roughly flat, earnings could come in at roughly $7.00-$7.50 per share.If the company manages to improve operating margins by three percent, as the company has essentially promised, after-tax earnings could come in at $6.8 billion. This would translate into potential earnings of $8.50 to $9.00 per share.That being said, margins are pretty good at the moment as they come in above their long term average. If a potential recession would crunch margins to 13% of sales, earnings are seen at roughly $4.6 billion. This would be equivalent to roughly $6.00 per share.If I assume that shares would be worth 18-20 times earnings, irrelevant of each of the scenarios above, shares might be worth anywhere between $115 and $165 per share. This depends of course largely on the direction of future margins, as I left the sales guidance equal in all three scenarios for simplicity reasons.In case margins would compress towards 13% by 2021, investors have very low capital gains to look forward to. Shares could be worth $115 by 2021, translating into very modest capital gains of 2-3% per annum. It should be said that this would be complemented by a 2.4% dividend yield, as Honeywell has recently announced a decent 15% increase in its dividend.In the case that CEO Dave Cote manages to deliver on another 3% increase in operating margins by 2021, shares might be worth $165 at the time. In such an outcome, investors could look forward to annualized capital gains of around 10%, to be complemented by a decent dividend yield of course.Final ConsiderationsShares of Honeywell have been tied around the $100 mark for quite some time now as the company and some shareholders grow frustrated with the lack of progress. Part of this results from weaker industrial production and the impact of the strong dollar of course, factors which are not directly within the influence of management.The reality is that shares have had a great run, not necessarily in 2014-2015, but mostly in the years before. Shares of Honeywell rose sharply from lows of $30 coming out of the economic crisis and already hit highs of $90 by 2013. These hugs gains have made it hard for the stock to perform over the past two years. It is comforting to see that Honeywell has made margin progress in the two recent years, as imminent appeal is lacking at current levels following the dismal sales performance.The reality is that I still do not find shares very appealing at around the $100 mark. If the company delivers on further margin gains of 3% in the future, investors can look forward to capital gains of 10%, accompanied by a 2-3% dividend yield. In case Honeywell sees its margins being flat in the years ahead, or worse, if margins were to unexpectedly fall, potential capital gains would be much lower, or even by largely absent.In order for me to buy the shares I would require capital gains of at least 13% per annum in case the bull case scenario of $165 by 2021 becomes a reality. That means that current levels are too high, as only an entry point at $90 per share would provide for such potential returns.As a result there is little to do for me but wait and buy on significant dips like the one seen in October going forwards."
3782206,24491,2015-12-30T01:51:27-05:00,"Honeywell is targeting a long-term compound annual sales growth rate in the mid-single-digits, and it expects segment margins to continue to expand.Management continues to target high ROI capital spending as it pursues key process initiatives and productivity improvements, a healthy combination for ongoing segment margin expansion.Though the company is well diversified across the industrial economy, and aero may be in a prolonged cyclical upswing, a downturn is inevitable (it is part of the economic cycle).Let's take a look at the firm's investment considerations as we attempt to uncover the drivers behind its Dividend Cushion ratio.","By The Valuentum TeamHoneywell's dividend is on solid groundHoneywell (NYSE:HON) is a conglomerate operating in the following areas: aerospace, automation and controls solutions, performance materials and technologies, and transportations systems. Its aerospace products are used on virtually every aircraft, while its building solutions are in over 150 million homes.Honeywell is targeting segment margins north of 20% for each of its four segments. Transportation Systems (turbo) is poised to grow the fastest and experience the largest margin potential. We're monitoring this segment closely.Honeywell's business quality (an evaluation of our ValueCreation™ and ValueRisk™ ratings) ranks among the best of the firms in our coverage universe. The firm has been generating economic value for shareholders with relatively stable operating results for the past few years, a combination we view very positively.Honeywell is targeting a long-term compound annual sales growth rate of roughly 4%-6%, and it expects segment margins to continue to expand. Though we expect continued margin improvement, our forecast for sales expansion is slightly lower than management's goals. This implies upside to our fair value estimate.We like CEO Dave Cote a lot, and the executive team's focus on investing in high ROI capex is all that stakeholders could ask for. Paying a competitive dividend is icing on the cake, and the company's M&A track record speaks for itself.Note: Honeywell's dividend yield is about average, offering a ~2.3% yield at recent price levels. We prefer yields above 3% in our dividend growth portfolio, but the company certainly deserves to be on any income investor's watch list, in our view. Let's have a look.Dividend StrengthsHoneywell pays a fantastic and competitive dividend, with a yield that makes its Dividend Cushion ratio simply too high to pass up. Management continues to target high ROI capital spending as it pursues key process initiatives and productivity improvements, a healthy combination for ongoing segment margin expansion. We'rehuge fans of its commercial original equipment and aftermarket business in light of the massive backlogs at the airframe makers, and there's not much that looks to derail Honeywell's dividend strength, at least in the near term. The executive team's 'growth through acquisitions' has served the company well during this economic cycle.Dividend WeaknessesThe first thing that comes to mind with respect to Honeywell's dividend resiliency is the threat that comes with serving cyclical end markets. Though the company is well diversified across the industrial economy and aero may be in a prolonged cyclical upswing, a downturn is inevitable. Most of its businesses look to perform well in 2016, though UOP continues to face pressure as a result of challenges in the energy markets. Foreign exchange headwinds may slow the pace of expansion, but free cash flow generation remains robust. Honeywell has made three rather large acquisitions recently (Elster, Sigma Aldrich, and Satcom1), but the dividend remains a priority, in our view.From the Comments Section: How to Interpret the Dividend Cushion Ratio -- A Ranking of RiskAs for how to interpret the Dividend Cushion ratio, itself, it is a measure of financial risk to the dividend, much like a credit rating is a measure of the default risk of the entity. Said differently, a poor Dividend Cushion ratio of below 1 or negative doesn't imply the company will cut the dividend tomorrow, no more than a junk credit rating implies a company will default tomorrow. That said, the Dividend Cushion ratio does punish companies for outsize debt loads because in times of adverse conditions, entities often need to shore up cash, and that means the dividend becomes increasingly more risky.We think investors should look at a variety of different metrics in assessing the sustainability of the dividend. Because the Dividend Cushion ratio is systematically applied across our coverage, it can be used to compare entities on an apples-to-apples basis. Dividend payers with significant free cash flow generation and substantial net cash on the balance sheet often register the highest Dividend Cushion ratios, as they should. These companies have substantial financial flexibility to keep raising the dividend.Dividend SafetyWe think the safety of Honeywell's dividend is good. Please let us explain.First, we measure the safety of the dividend in a unique but very straightforward fashion. As many know, earnings can fluctuate, so using the payout ratio in any given year has some limitations. Plus, companies can often encounter unforeseen charges, which makes earnings an even less-than-predictable measure of the safety of the dividend. We know that companies won't cut the dividend just because earnings have declined or they had a restructuring charge that put them in the red for the quarter (year). As such, we think that assessing the cash flows of a business allows us to determine whether it has the capacity to continue paying dividends well into the future.That has led us to develop the forward-looking Dividend Cushion™ ratio, which we make available on our website. The measure is a ratio that sums the existing net cash a company has on hand (on its balance sheet) plus its expected future free cash flows (cash flow from operations less capital expenditures) over the next five years and divides that sum by future expected cash dividends over the same time period. Basically, if the score is above 1, the company has the capacity to pay out its expected future dividends and the expected growth in them.As income investors, however, we'd like to see a ratio much larger than 1 for a couple of reasons: 1) the higher the ratio, the more ""cushion"" the company has against unexpected earnings shortfalls, and 2) the higher the ratio, the greater capacity a dividend-payer has in boosting the dividend in the future. For Honeywell, this ratio is 2.4, revealing that on its current path the firm should be able to cover its future dividends and growth in them with net cash on hand and future free cash flow.Dividend Cushion Ratio Cash Flow BridgeThe Dividend Cushion Cash Flow Bridge, shown in the graph below, illustrates the components of the Dividend Cushion ratio and highlights in detail the many drivers behind it. Honeywell's Dividend Cushion Cash Flow Bridge reveals that the sum of the company's 5-year cumulative free cash flow generation, as measured by cash flow from operations less all capital spending, plus its net cash/debt position on the balance sheet, as of the last fiscal year, is greater than the sum of the next 5 years of expected cash dividends paid.Because the Dividend Cushion ratio is forward-looking and captures the trajectory of the company's free cash flow generation and dividend growth, it reveals whether there will be a cash surplus or a cash shortfall at the end of the 5-year period, taking into consideration the leverage on the balance sheet, a key source of risk. On a fundamental basis, we believe companies that have a strong net cash position on the balance sheet and are generating a significant amount of free cash flow are better able to pay and grow their dividend over time.Firms that are buried under a mountain of debt and do not sufficiently cover their dividend with free cash flow are more at riskof a dividend cut or a suspension of growth, all else equal, in our opinion. Generally speaking, the greater the 'blue bar' to the right is in the positive, the more durable a company's dividend, and the greater the 'blue bar' to the right is in the negative, the less durable a company's dividend.Dividend Cushion Ratio DeconstructionThe Dividend Cushion Ratio Deconstruction, shown in the graph below, reveals the numerator and denominator of the Dividend Cushion ratio. At the core, the larger the numerator, or the healthier a company's balance sheet and future free cash flow generation, relative to the denominator, or a company's cash dividend obligations, the more durable the dividend. In the context of the Dividend Cushion ratio, Honeywell's numerator is larger than its denominator suggesting strong dividend coverage in the future. The Dividend Cushion Ratio Deconstruction image puts sources of free cash in the context of financial obligations next to expected cash dividend payments over the next 5 years on a side-by-side comparison. Because the Dividend Cushion ratio and many of its components are forward-looking, our dividend evaluation may change upon subsequent updates as future forecasts are altered to reflect new information.Please note that to arrive at the Dividend Cushion ratio, divide the numerator by the denominator in the graph below. The difference between the numerator and denominator is the firm's ""total cumulative 5-year forecasted distributable excess cash after dividends paid, ex buybacks.""Dividend GrowthNow on to the potential growth of Honeywell's dividend. As we mentioned above, we think the larger the ""cushion"" the larger capacity the company has to raise the dividend. However, such dividend growth analysis is not complete until after considering management's willingness to increase the dividend. To do so, we evaluate the company's historical dividend track record. If there have been no dividend cuts in the past 10 years, the company has a nice dividend growth rate, and a solid Dividend Cushion ratio, we characterize its future potential dividend growth as excellent, which is the case for Honeywell.Because capital preservation is also an important consideration to any income strategy, we use our estimate of the company's fair value range to assess the risk associated with the potential for capital loss. In Honewell's case, we currently think shares are fairly valued, meaning the share price falls within our estimate of the fair value range, so the risk of capital loss is medium (our valuation analysis can be found by downloading the 16-page report on our website). If we thought the shares were undervalued, the risk of capital loss would be low.Wrapping Things UpWe're fans of Honeywell's conglomerate operations and its competitive dividend prospects. Management's focus on high ROI is a material positive for shareholders, as is its solid M&A track record. The firm's aerospace operations have performed well as of late, and judging by backlogs at major airframe makers, it should continue to do so. However, the end markets that the company serves are cyclical, and a downturn is inevitable. The prolonging of such a downturn may be the biggest threat to the firm's dividend at this point in time.Breakpoints: Dividend Safety. We measure the safety of a firm's dividend by adding its net cash to our forecast of its future cash flows and divide that sum by our forecast of its future dividend payments. This process results in a ratio called the Dividend Cushion. Scale: Above 2.75 = EXCELLENT; Between 1.25 and 2.75 = GOOD; Between 0.5 and 1.25 = POOR; Below 0.5 = VERY POOR.This article or report and any links within are for information purposes only and should not be considered a solicitation to buy or sell any security.

GE has been restructuring its business operations. In November, it completed its offer to exchange GE shares for shares in Synchrony Financial (NYSE:SYF).GE Total Return Price data by YChartsGE expects 2015 dividend of roughly $9 billion and $18 to $21 billion to be used to repurchase 650 to 750 million shares. This will result in GE providing more cash to departing owners via share repurchase than to shareholders via dividends.The decision to transfer $18 to $21 billion of owners' cash will result in less cash available to the remaining shareholders and a more-leveraged firm. Given that the Federal Reserve is expected to increase short-term interest rates, the cost of financing is expected to increase. This will reduce cash available to shareholders.There were 10.109 billion shares outstanding on September 30, 2015, per 10-Q. Therefore, the $18 to $21 billion for share repurchase equals $1.78 to $2.08 per share that owners will transfer to departing owners.GE's short-term borrowings were $4.761 billion on September 30, 2015, an increase from the $3.872 billion on December 31, 2014. Long-term borrowings were $15.895 billion versus $12.468 billion. GE could be debt-free, if it used the funds allocated to repurchase shares to retire debt. Interest and other financial charges totaled $440 million during the third quarter, or roughly 4.4 cents per share. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, it totaled $1.243 billion or roughly 12.3 cents per share.The 10-Q reveals:Given GE's outperformance compared to Honeywell, it is prudent to rethink the trade. The major thesis was that GE reduced debt load and interest expense could see 'cash available to shareholders' increase.However, it now appears that GE may re-lever the balance sheet and that would reduce the cash available to shareholders. Alternatively, management may transfer more cash to former shareholders than to current shareholders. The yield of the $1.78 to $2.08 per share, expected to be used for share repurchase, would total 5.9% to 6.9% at a $30.00 stock price.Investor sentiment has slightly changed.Honeywell had 17 Strong Buy or Buy ratings with 0 Underperform or Sell, compared with GE's 9 Strong Buy or Buy with 0 Underperform or Sell in June. More recently, GE has 10 Strong Buy or Buy ratings and Honeywell has 16 Strong Buy or Buy rating. (Source Yahoo!

3690716,42371,2015-11-17T02:59:57-05:00,"The company has growth opportunities in various product markets and geographies due to its diversification.
        A disciplined M&A strategy has led Honeywell to operational excellence that has resulted in a ten year shareholder return of 210% (excluding dividends).
        Honeywell is capitalizing on the rise of connectivity and big data by integrating their hardware products with exceptional software capabilities.","ThesisHoneywell (NYSE: HON) is a diversified manufacturing and technology company with a market cap of about $80 billion. Over the course of the past ten years, total shareholder return is well above 200% for the company. This has been achieved due to the combination of a disciplined yet opportunistic M&A strategy, continuous improvement through the Honeywell Operating System, and strong leadership positions across various markets/product categories that give the company a scale advantage. Going forward, I expect the company to continue to generate double digit earnings growth through low single digit revenue growth (fueled by catalysts including M&A, High Growth Regions, aerospace, software, etc.) accompanied by further margin expansion. Applying a multiple of 18-20x on conservatively estimated 2015 EPS of $6.00, I arrive at a price range of $108-$120, indicating 8-20% upside in an exceptional company that usually trades for a premium.Company OverviewHoneywell is a massive industrial conglomerate with more than 250 plants globally that make a wide range of products (to name a few: aircraft engines, avionics, navigation and radar, thermostats, industrial automation software, catalysts and absorbents, etc.). The division of revenue for fiscal 2014 by segment, geography, and end market is as follows:Segments:In the end market chart, ""Other"" is made up of Aero OE, Turbo, Residential, and Advanced Materials.Disciplined Yet Opportunistic M&AAs you can see, the company is diversified in various respects, and not too heavily dependent on any one narrative playing out. The strength of Honeywell comes from this robust nature which diversifies their risks while allowing them to capitalize on new opportunities with their massive scale and resources. The exposure to a large number of product categories and geographies also expands the realm for potential M&A opportunities (product adjacencies, old products in new markets, etc.). This aids the long term results of the company's M&A due to the fact that simply having such a large universe to select from allows the company to demonstrate patience and only pull the trigger when they are confident synergies can be realized and value will be created. The company takes an approach to M&A that's adjacent to what many value investors do. They build up relationships with targets and study them over long periods of time, becoming intimately familiar with them. When an opportunity presents itself to purchase the target for a discount, Honeywell is ready to take advantage. As a result of this approach, the company has been able to raise margins through acquisitions with considerable success and consistency.Back in July, the company announced the acquisition of Elster, a global gas technologies and solutions company, for just over $5 billion. This is another example of an acquisition that fits perfectly into Honeywell's current model. Elster expands Honeywell's global footprint and offers significant strategic/financial synergy opportunities given Honeywell's scale, complementary technologies, software expertise, and exposure to High Growth Regions. Cost synergies are estimated at $150 million, about 8% of Elster's annual sales. Also, Elster is likely to serve as a platform for further bolt-on acquisitions. These are likely to be accretive to the bottom line and so should be considered as a catalyst going forward over the course of the next few years.Lastly, it's important to note that Elster isn't just a boring, undifferentiated supplier of meters. The strategic rationale behind this acquisition had a lot to do with the company's use of software in their products (smart metering, safety and efficiency controls/monitoring, etc). As a matter of fact, the company has operating margins of more than 20%.Prior to the acquisition of Elster, management announced that it intended to spend $10 billion or more on M&A through 2018. I think it's very possible that we could see even more. At a Morgan Stanley Industrials conference in September, Vice Chairman Roger Fradin stated that the firm could surpass the $10 billion ""very comfortably"".CatalystsI would now like to briefly make note of some other catalysts:RisksValuationManagement is guiding to 2015 EPS of $6.05-$6.15. Applying a multiple of 18-20x leads to a PT of $108-$120, indicating 8-20% upside. I believe that the 18-20x multiple is justifiable due to the company's strong track record in creating value through M&A (which investors often neglect to model, even if it's in the core of the business strategy), scale advantages, robust growth opportunities, etc. Furthermore, this is the range that the company has traditionally traded in. Over the course of the past ten years, the PE ratio has bounced around, mostly staying between 17.75-22.5x with the exceptions of 2008-2009 and briefly in late 2011."

And the premium could be 30% or more.A $7.2bn price tag would not be prohibitive, of course - neither for UTX nor for HON, given that it would amount to less than 10% of their market cap. But such a tie-up would only marginally be accretive to core operating margins at HON, although it would contribute to a better EBIT margin profile at UTX, according to my calculations, which exclude likely cost synergies for both.MarketplaceThe broker noted that ""2015 has seen a steady beat of M&A"" in the aerospace sector, with aero materials being one of the busiest sectors, ""with RTI, Cytec, Tital, and Noranco all being acquired.""A particular mention deserved TransDigm and Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A) (NYSE:BRK.B).The table below shows some of the most recent deals in the sector, and where they were priced, based on trailing EV/EBITDA multiples.(Source: Royal Bank of Canada)This ""positive perspective on the qualities"" of the aerospace sector has meant that multiples in aerospace have remained high, the analysts argued, and although ""most deals come with minimal financial disclosure, those that have seen public disclosure have averaged 12.2x EBITDA during this upturn, with PCP going for 12.4x EBITDA in 2015.""Prospects for the industry are encouraging, with an implied CAGR of 4.9% into 2020, which is implicit in the projections for aircraft deliveries.(Source: Royal Bank of Canada)Meggitt's wheels and brakes make a good fit for UTX, while the UK-based firm also targets much smaller regional and business jets than UTX. The strategic merits aside, if previous deals are anything to go by I doubt that a takeover of Meggitt could be justified based on the current valuation of the target, even assuming a relatively low premium.Nonetheless, RBC believes that the attractiveness of Meggitt for UTX, in particular, could lead to a deal that on a pro-forma basis would be accretive to earnings - that's hardly surprising in this environment, given that RBC models a takeover fully funded by cash.(Source: Royal Bank of Canada)As far as I am concerned, deal or no deal - well, I think that Honeywell, as I recently argued, is by far a better choice than UTX.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

        Honeywell's trailing twelve month revenue continues to decline.
        Despite revenue weakness, Honeywell's free cash flow and ROE remains strong.","Honeywell (NYSE:HON) beat earnings expectations for the third quarter last week. Despite this, it's trailing twelve month revenues continued to decline. By examining some operational statistics, we see a good bullish case for Honeywell."
3584696,39011,2015-10-20T07:46:49-04:00,"HON reported another quarter of terrific margin growth and negative sales growth.But HON's forex headwind is smaller than other multinationals.And with margin expansion set to continue into 2016, HON's forward multiple is too low.","Back in July, I wrote a piece about industrial giant Honeywell (NYSE:HON) that said its long-term margin growth was the key to its success. The company has seen a relatively light sales growth trajectory but it continues to improve profitability and at a cheap valuation, that made the stock attractive in my view. But shares have dipped along with the rest of the market since August and we now find HON at levels not seen for nearly a year. The company's Q3 earnings report caused the stock to drift lower so in light of all that has happened since my last update on HON, I'll take a fresh look at the valuation to see if the long-term bull case is still intact.HON is subject to the low growth macro environment just like any other multinational but for industrials like HON, the sting seems to be worse. Cyclical customers like automakers - for instance - tend to introduce some economic sensitivity to HON's results. We have certainly seen that in recent quarters and Q3 was no different.The company saw total revenue decline 5% as Services revenue actually posted a small gain but Product sales fell, mainly in the Performance Materials segment. Core revenue growth was about flat for the quarter and forex headwinds removed about 5% from the top line. I always say that reporting currency neutral results is an effort in futility and I'll say it again here. However, HON's currency headwind is much smaller than other multinationals' that have reported high-single digit or even double-digit forex headwinds. HON's currency bar is much easier to step over each quarter and it is a good thing because even if you remove forex, the revenue environment for HON is weak right now.The weak revenue situation is not new but stings nonetheless; the saving grace for HON is its impressive margin expansion. Despite weak revenue, every segment in HON's portfolio posted significantly higher operating income due to very remarkable margin growth. Not only is HON improving its gross margins on its product sales through new product introductions and favorable mix, but it is improving its SG&A expenditures as it finds productivity gains elsewhere in the supply chain. In other words, HON's comprehensive focus on operating margins is paying off in a big way and we continued to see that in Q3. The margin story is the one I'm buying here because despite the weak revenue environment, HON was able to reiterate its EPS guidance for the year.I don't like HON's weak revenue anymore than the next guy but the fact is that productivity gains continue to outpace the weakness in revenue. I will say that the strong dollar environment is probably going to get worse before it gets better so I don't expect we'll see meaningful top line growth from HON for 2016 either. That all depends on the Fed and at this point, I don't even think the institution itself knows what it is going to do. Management, however, guided for continued margin expansion into 2016 so despite weak revenue, HON's profit growth trajectory looks to be intact.Looking at the chart, the picture has changed completely since July. Of course, we had the market wide meltdown in August, from which Honeywell was not spared. That took the stock well below its major moving averages and it has stayed there as each rally attempt has been met with selling. In addition the 50DMA is decidedly negative and has crossed under the 200DMA, indicating the uptrend may be over. Finally, the 200DMA is rolling over and if it moves to a negative slope, that will be very difficult for HON to overcome. All of these things mean that if HON were to rally, it will begin to run into lots of resistance levels overhead from here and that will make sustained rally attempts difficult to come by.But that does not mean all is lost. HON continues to post terrific margin growth and that will allow EPS to expand next year even if revenue is flat. The strong dollar is of great concern to me but HON's exposure is lower than many other multinationals. At just 14.8 times forward earnings, HON is not only a lot cheaper than it was back in July but it is cheaper against rival GE (NYSE:GE) as well, a stock that sports a 19 forward P/E. That is an enormous discrepancy for two businesses that have roughly the same EPS growth trajectory and I can't justify the difference. I think HON's margin expansion and its cheap valuation will see shares rise into 2016, so I'm sticking with my long call."
3583466,91945,2015-10-20T17:49:37-04:00,"Honeywell has seen new orders decline as the global economy and energy prices weakened.Management was able to increase margins by cutting costs, but there is little room left to improve.With the global economic picture looking dour in 2016, Honeywell could see its share price decline further.","Honeywell International (NYSE:HON) underperformed in its recent earnings release as the global economic environment continues to weigh on the industrial sector. Industrial companies are fending off adverse business conditions coming from various directions, making it difficult to stomach the current rollercoaster as a shareholder. Honeywell is a well-managed company, keeping margins elevated, but there is nothing one can do about global weakness in coming years.In its recent earnings results, Honeywell announced a decline in sales of 5% on the quarter, which was adjusted up to a 1% gain when taking into account foreign exchange effects. The industrial company has a lot of international exposure, which has been difficult in a time of U.S. dollar strength, a weak global economy, and lower energy prices.As the U.S. dollar strengthened, it lessened the amount of top line growth due to conversion losses. While the Federal Reserve has held off on raising rates in recent months, the U.S. economy is still better off than many others across the globe. For this reason, the dollar will likely remain strong, continuing to diminish Honeywell's top line growth,Additionally, the global economy, as well as global factory activity has weakened over the last year. Lower commodity prices have weighed on profits for emerging market economies. Moreover, China has seen its economy slow as demand for its products from ailing developed countries led to a cutback in production. This cutback in production also weighed on the price of energy and industrial metal commodities.China does not look to be reversing course anytime soon as it announced on Monday that it grew at a sub-7% annual growth, its first time below 7% since 2009. The chart below highlights China's growth trajectory. Since rebounding in 2010, growth has nearly halved. This has been both influenced by, as well as affected the global economy, and views of risk sentiment. With China unlikely reversing trend higher in the near future, global fixed investment should remain suppressed. This lack of investment weighs on new orders for Honeywell's goods, adversely affecting top line results.Additionally, lower energy prices have weighed on industrial production and investment in the U.S. Honeywell derived close to 11% from its sales from the energy industry. As the supply-glut of crude oil pushed prices lower, companies in the U.S. and Canada have cut capital spending. Sales in the Honeywell's materials and technologies business, which accounted for a quarter of the company's total sales, fell 13% in the third quarter due to declining orders from oil and gas customers.There looks to be little optimism regarding U.S. industrial production as well. Since the start of 2014, U.S. manufacturing declined from decade highs of 58, to 53 currently. Again, with oil and commodities unlikely to sustain a significant turnaround in coming months, Honeywell will likely continue to suffer from a weak operating environment, with slowing orders.While revenue has slowed for Honeywell, management's ability to cut costs and consolidate the business led to strong margin gains. The chart below highlights both revenue and operating margins for Honeywell. As was stated earlier, but pictured pictorially below, total sales began to rollover lower for Honeywell in 2014. In an effort to keep margins elevated, the company slashed jobs, and merged its businesses where revenue was falling, leading operating margins to rise to 18.3% from 16.2% a year earlier. Management, however, is pessimistic about future margin expansion as it feels it has tapped out cost cutting measures. This could lead to an acceleration lower of net income in 2016 if top line growth remains stagnant.The company trades at attractive multiples, with a forward price to earnings multiple of 15, and a price to earnings growth of 1.09. The problem, however, is that the macroeconomic factors are so unfavorable that 2016 could see large declines in the industrial sector. If global economic growth remains tepid, and commodity prices are suppressed, expect Honeywell to be sold off by investors down to 2014 levels in the mid-80s. I see little value in Honeywell at current levels, considering the outlook going forward, and lack of new business orders coming."
3668496,89576,2015-11-09T17:56:25-05:00,"Honeywell International is an established manufacturing company that operates in electronic, power systems, aerospace technology and chemical industry.In absolute terms, the stock looks overvalued. The company will have to increase its cash flow to justify its market value.Honeywell announced on Friday that it will raise its annual dividend by 15% to $2.38 per share, bringing its divided yield to 2.3%.","IntroductionHoneywell's (NYSE:HON) revenue declined in its aerospace business segment by 2% in Q3 in 2015 year over year (compared to Q3 2014). Its Automation and Control Solutions revenue declined by 3% and its Performance Materials and Technologies division's revenue declined by 13% in the same period. Meanwhile during this period, the stock rose 19.5% from $87 to $104 per share.As a reminder, Honeywell International operates through three business segments: Aerospace, Automation and Control Solutions, Performance Materials and Technologies. Honeywell announced in July 2015 that it was to acquire Elster, which manufactures water and gas meters and control devices, from Melrose Industries for $5.1 billion in cash to strengthen its automation and control solutions. Honeywell is focused on expanding its aerospace program and is set to buy Canadian satellite and space components maker COM DEV International (OTCPK:CDVIF) for $345 million to strengthen its position in the aerospace market.While global manufacturing remains weak and the management conversely continues to emphasize the available growth opportunities, it is important to look at valuations and see whether the recent stock appreciation is in line with the longer-term fundamentals. To understand Honeywell's prospects as a long-term investment, we take a step back and estimate the intrinsic value of the stock based on its ability to generate cash flows. To complement the analysis, we will also assess the relative richness/cheapness of Honeywell Intl.'s ordinary stock compared to its peers.ValuationOur valuation model for Honeywell International is based on the company's ability to generate cash. The key measure of cash flows that we use is free cash flow, which is the total cash inflow from operations minus the dividends and capital expenditure outlays. This is effectively the amount of ""excess"" cash that the company is making and, therefore, accruing to its lenders and shareholders.While we do look at historic cash flows, cash flows projections are of crucial importance because markets are forward looking. We start with the analyst consensus free cash flow projections. For our own projection, we assume that the analyst consensus is correct for the next 4 fiscal years. After that, we assume that the growth rate of cash flows falls back to its previous trend and remains on it for the next 6 years, after which it normalizes towards the sustainable rate of 3.89% per annum, based on the average real GDP growth over the last 15 years and the average inflation rate of 2%. The chart below shows the historic (blue line) and projected free cash flows (red line).To calculate the total value of the company, we discount the projected cash flows and the company's terminal value by its weighted average cost of capital (WACC). Our estimate of Honeywell International's cost of debt is 3.9%, based on its interest expense and amount of debt outstanding in the last fiscal year. The cost of equity is calculated using the 10-year treasury yield as the ""risk-free"" proxy plus the implied equity risk premium of 10.55% times the historic beta of 1.41 for the stock. Some of the other key metrics summarized below:After discounting the projected Free Cash Flows and the company's terminal value in 10 years' time, we subtract the current value of debt and arrive at the total equity value of 61,072,063, which equates to $79.24 per share. With today's share price at $104, re-pricing towards the estimated fair value would require a return of -23.8%. The green line in the below chart represents the estimated ""fair value"" per share, with the dashed lines showing the upper and lower bounds of the confidence interval based on stock's volatility.Relative ValuationHoneywell International, Danaher (NYSE:DHR), General Electric (NYSE:GE), 3M (NYSE:MMM), Eaton (NYSE:ETN) are Honeywell International's main S&P 500 competitors in the Diversified Industrials category. The table below can help us understand Honeywell Intl.'s valuation in relative terms.Table 1: Relative Valuation Table, Divers. Industrials in the S&P 500 indexThe price-to-earnings ratio for Honeywell is at a median level for the industry. While price to cash flow and price to book are higher than the median. The stock has a favorable growth in the past 5 years of 13.3% and a high ROE. The chart below shows the relation between P/B ratio vs. ROE within the industry, showing us that the company is not expensive relative to reported ROE.ConclusionTaking into consideration that Honeywell is a mature company in a stable sector, its long-term investment value will generally depend on its ability to continue to generate cash flows for investors. At this point in time, the discounted cash flow model indicates a certain degree of overvaluation based on consensus cash flow projections. Due to the global decline in economic growth and industrial production in 2015, with the trend unlikely to improve substantially in the near term, things might not be all well for Honeywell in 2016, but long-term investors will want to look beyond the near-term risks and focus on long-term opportunities. In addition to the opportunities in aerospace, another positive is the fact that China is developing its first passenger airplane, with major components being produced by Honeywell. That being said, our analysis shows that the stock is slightly overvalued and is not the best option for investors at this moment."
3579616,91235,2015-10-17T11:35:44-04:00,Honeywell experienced a fairly good Q3 - financials indicate the company is continuing to focus on margin expansion rather than top-line growth.Environmental issues have caused Honeywell stock to take a temporary hit.Investors should consider opening a position at a discount and keep an eye out for any further dips.,"This article serves as an update to a previous article I wrote about Honeywell.On the whole, Q3 was a fairly good quarter for Honeywell International (NYSE: HON). Q3 was essentially a checkpoint for Honeywell to meet its full-year guidance, and to this end, it was able to take another step forward to meet its full-year guidance. Top-line sales declined by 5%, but margins improved by about 200 basis points for both Honeywell's segment margin as well as its operating income margin. As a result, it was able to boost earnings per share from $1.47 to $1.90 quarter-on-quarter, about 9%, and if investors take into account the effect of Honeywell's 26.5% tax rate, the EPS growth is about 10%. Both cash flow from operations and free cash flow improved drastically by 35% and more than 40%, respectively.All in all, guidance was pretty much met. Investors didn't show much of a reaction, albeit some slight declines during the day of the release of earnings.Source: Stockcharts.comOn the surface, things may not look very interesting, but perhaps this quarter masks something else. If investors take a look at the above six-month stock chart, they'll notice that the stock has been trading sideways for quite some time now. Up until the big decline in August, the stock has been stuck between price barriers between around $107 and the low $100s. Then, suddenly in late August, the stock takes a huge nosedive down to $87. This was a result of Honeywell receiving a large penalty for environmental violations, which was the second time in two years. Although the environmental penalties are a setback, in the long-run, they really don't have much of an effect on the long-term thesis surrounding this investment, which is the fact that it remains a well-diversified bunker against market volatility. In fact, even after this steep decline, the stock has been trading generally between the low $90s and the low $100s, which represents an even more attractive valuation. The crossing of the 50-day moving average below the 200-day moving average may also signal further downside, so investors should be closely watching to buy into the stock at a discount.This quarter also continues to show that Honeywell isn't focusing as much on top-line revenue growth. Rather, the company is looking to boost bottom-line growth through margin improvement as well as targeted acquisitions that further boost the diversity of its product portfolio. What this does is highlight the fact that, as mentioned above, Honeywell can serve as a low-beta investment to shield against rising interest rates and other unfavorable market conditions in the near- to mid-term.So what should investors do right now? Honeywell stock has already taken a temporary hit from a relatively minor issue, and the stock is trading at a larger discount. Investors should consider buying into the stock unless they're waiting for an even bigger decline."
3579806,94046,2015-10-18T01:24:12-04:00,"Honeywell stock dropped 1.5% on Friday as the company reported a quarterly update that did not impress investors.The industrial group has become a much more profitable entity in recent years, and there's a lot to like in its capital allocation strategy, however.If management continues to deliver, Honeywell could reward long-term value hunters.","It's easy to forget that Honeywell (NYSE: HON) has become a much more profitable entity over the last five years, during which its shares have doubled in value from just over $47.You could also ignore the fact that investors may decide to shy away from risk into 2016, but then consider this: only a 20 basis points drop in its 2.1% forward yield will push up its stock price to $110, assuming constant dividends until the end of the year.That's a 13.4% pre-tax capital gain from $97, where the stock closed on Friday following the release of a quarterly trading update that did not impress investors.FridayThe industrial group is expected to record EPS of $6.1 this year, which implies a forward P/E multiple of 15.9 times.That valuation is broadly in line with that of the DJIA Index, but why has the stock of Honeywell outperformed the main index by only 0.3 percentage points in 2015?While all eyes were on its rival General Electric (NYSE: GE) on Friday, Honeywell issued a third-quarter trading update that showed falling revenues for all of its three core divisions.What You Are BuyingIf you are one of those who have sold Honeywell stock to buy GE shares -- very possibly, that is because you have paid attention to the wrong financial metrics of both companies. On top of that, Honeywell remains a much simpler company to value than GE.If you bet on Honeywell and its management team, you'll become the shareholder of a company that will likely have grown operating income margin and net income margin at compound annual growth rates of about 9% and 12%, respectively, between 2010 and 2017.That is a conservative estimate: there are no signs that Honeywell's profitability is about to plunge, and those growth rates imply a scenario according to which margins expansion will be up to 200bp lower than between 2010 and 2014.Yet there are signs that Honeywell could surprise on the upside.Growth""Honeywell delivered another strong quarter of earnings growth and exceptional margin expansion,"" its chairman and chief executive, Dave Cote, said on Friday.""In a slower growth environment, we generated earnings growth of 10% when normalized for tax, reaching the high end of our EPS guidance range,"" Mr Cote added.Honeywell's net debt position is negligible, while guidance for free cash flow (NYSE:FCF) implies a FCF yield of 5.7%. Currency swings pose a challenge, and you could point out that GE is on a roll and its forward yield is more enticing, while United Technologies (NYSE: UTX) might offer greater capital protection given its 2.7% forward yield. The problem is that the restructuring of the former will likely take time to yield dividends, and the capital structure of the latter is a bit stretched.UTX stock is down 19% in 2015, and most of that drop has come on the back of a profit warning in July and higher volatility in August.Up Or Down?True, Honeywell's revenue were down in aerospace (-2% in Q315 compared to Q314), automation and control systems (-3%) and performance materials and technologies (-13%) -- but revenue haven't grown much at all ever since January 2013, during which period the stock has risen 56% from $65. Remarkably, though, all the units have registered higher income (between +4% and +5%) and margins (between +130 and +330 basis points) in Q3 year on year.There is also a lot to like in its corporate strategy, too, which will likely help it protect its rising level of profitability if the business cycle turns south. Stock buybacks, meanwhile, have surged to $1.7bn from $689m in the nine months ended 30 September 2015, while dividends have grown 14.5% to almost $1.3bn over the period.Well, my view is that if management continues to deliver -- and even gets a little help from the business cycle -- a +50% performance could be on the cards by the end of 2017."

In doing so, I will be reviewing each stock based on the following characteristics:Since all investors are not the same, I believe that looking at companies through a range of lenses is useful in determining the worth of specific stocks. In my review, I will be comparing the two stocks on individual metrics, and then tallying the results of those values to determine a winning stock for each category.STABILITYThe purpose of this category is determine which stock has the best overall financial position, possessing a stable and consistent balance sheet and overall value.Return on AssetsIn terms of ROA, Honeywell International is the winner with a value of 9.64% compared to 6.85% for United Technologies. Looking at the chart below, you can see that Honeywell International has seen its ROA rise significantly over the past five years in a fairly steady manner, while United Technologies' ROA has been fairly flat with a slight overall decline.UTX Return on Assets ((((NYSE:TTM)))) data by YChartsReturn on Invested CapitalHoneywell International wins this metric as well with a value of 16.04% compared to 11.68% for United Technologies. The trend over the past five years has been similar as well, with Honeywell International improving its ROA by nearly 57% while United Technologies has seen its ROA drop by 11% during this time.Earnings YieldUnited Technologies does have the higher earnings yield with a value of 7.02% compared to 5.26% for Honeywell International. The earnings yield of both companies has went up and down over the past five years with United Technologies seeing an overall 11% increase in its yield and Honeywell International seeing a 5% overall decrease.Book ValueThe book value of both companies has followed a similar trend over the past five years; however, Honeywell International has seen the highest increase partly due to a recent decline in United Technologies' book value.UTX Book Value (Annual Per Share) data by YChartsOutstanding SharesHoneywell International has been able to keep its share count fairly steady over the past five years, while United Technologies has been able to reduce its share count by over 3% during the same stretch of time.UTX Shares Outstanding data by YChartsSummaryIn the stability section, I feel that Honeywell International is the fairly convincing winner with higher returns on assets, invested capital, and overall better book value per share growth.GROWTHThe purpose of this category is to determine which stock has seen the most growth over the past several years and which stock is likely to continue seeing the most growth in the future.Revenue GrowthBoth companies have seen very similar revenue growth over the past ten years with United Technologies having a slight advantage.UTX Revenue ((((TTM)))) data by YChartsEarnings GrowthIn terms of earnings growth, Honeywell International has seen nearly double the growth of United Technologies over the past ten years.UTX EPS Basic (((TTM))) data by YChartsProfit MarginHoneywell International has the higher profit margin based on trailing twelve months.

UTX has a trailing PE ratio of 14.24x compared to 19.00x for HON.PEG ratiosUTX is more attractively priced according to PEG ratios as well.UTX PEG Ratio ((TTM)) data by YChartsPrice to Book ValueUnited Technologies has a far more appealing price to book value compared to Honeywell International.UTX Price to Book Value data by YChartsPrice to Free Cash Flow ValueUnited Technologies wins this battle as well with a more appealing price to free cash flow value.UTX Price to Free Cash Flow (TTM) data by YChartsSummaryUnited Technologies is the clear winner of the value category with more attractive valuations in every metric.DEFENSEThe purpose of this category is to judge how well each stock will hold up during a recession. I will be looking at both dividend's and past performance to score this.Dividend HistoryBoth companies have steadily increased their dividends over the past five years, with Honeywell International seeing the largest growth.UTX Dividend data by YChartsPrice Returns During Prior RecessionsDuring the 2007-09 recession, both companies performed bad, with Honeywell International losing a large percentage of its value during this time period.UTX data by YChartsDuring the 2001 recession, both stocks once again performed poorly, and once again Honeywell International had a slightly worse loss.UTX data by YChartsDuring the 1990-91 recession, the same pattern emerged.UTX data by YChartsSummaryNeither of these stocks can be considered as defensive stocks as they both performed terribly during the past three U.S. recessions. United Technologies did hold up a bit better, but still greatly underperformed the market in general.ConclusionIn terms of stability and growth, I feel that Honeywell International is currently the most attractive stock for long term investors. But for investors looking for value, United Technologies might be the better option.Honeywell International has performed better over the past one-year, five-year, and ten-year periods; however, during recessions it has been United Technologies that has held up better.While I don't believe that either stock can be considered a defensive investment option, I do believe that United Technologies is the safer play, due to its current valuation and higher dividend yield. That being said, I feel that Honeywell International has the greater potential to deliver higher long term returns to long term investors.

I will explain.I also provide some basic analysis to determine a fair price Honeywell to see if it is appropriate for the GARP investor.","Recently, I wrote about an elderly man who I befriended when I once worked in the financial services. His name is Harry. His philosophy of finding large financially sound companies that pay increasing dividends over time allowed him to retire at the age of 47, and he lives the way he wants. He does not own a computer, does no stock screening, still reads actual financial newspapers, watches CNBC, and keeps all of his information on index cards. He is really quite amazing. While I was writing my first piece about him, I asked him what some of his favorite stocks were. Without hesitation, he included Honeywell International (NYSE: HON).What is Honeywell?According to Morningstar, ""Honeywell International Inc is a technology & manufacturing company, serving customers with aerospace products & services, control, sensing and security technologies for buildings, homes and industry, turbochargers, automotive products, chemicals."" The company is listed as a diversified industrials conglomerate. The company's website outlines products and services for home, aerospace and defense, security, buildings, scanning and mobile productivity, industrial process control, energy and utilities, automotive, oil and gas, healthcare, chemicals, manufacturing, and fire protection. I would venture to say that there are few of us that have not had a Honeywell thermostat in our homes at one time or another. They are an omnipresent company that has broad reach in multiple markets.What Is Honeywell Doing Now?Honeywell has been on a shopping spree of late. They recently acquired Datamax-O'Neil for $185 million, which allows Honeywell access to the scanning and mobility markets. Just this week, they agreed to buy Melrose Industries Elster unit for $5.1 billion. With the purchase of Elster, which manufactures gas, electric, and water meters, Honeywell hopes that it will provide a platform for future acquisitions. Given that the CEO, David Cote, announced that the company would spend $10 billion on an M&A strategy, it definitely appears that there is more to come. It is sitting on $7 billion in cash, so it is a strategy that will not require a lot of debt. Isn't that what large companies eventually do? Buy up smaller companies to facilitate growth? For Honeywell, that is a major part of their growth strategy.Why Does Harry Own Honeywell?Harry has three main criteria for owning stock in a company.Is Honeywell a large company? First, Honeywell is a very large company. As a member of the Fortune 100, it has a market cap over $80 billion. It currently ranks as 74th on the Fortune 500 list, and is a member of the S&P 500. For those who require the criterion, there are many analysts' reports that praise Honeywell's large moat. There is data to support that Honeywell is in this exclusive club, as it has consistently averaged over 12% for return on invested capital since 2006. It certainly passed Warren Buffett's criteria enough for him to take a 2% stake in 2001.Is Honeywell financially safe? Honeywell's Altman-Z score is 3.34. With a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.3, it has enough liquidity as indicated by its current ratio (1.5) and quick ratio (1.2). Additionally, one metric I was always look for is free cash flow. Honeywell generated $3.7 billion in free cash in the last 12 months. And don't forget that it is already sitting on a pile of cash.Does Honeywell consistently increase dividends over time? For Harry, this is the most important criteria for any company. Late last year, Honeywell increased their dividend by 15%, but that does not tell the full story. This is a company that has a history of increasing dividends, and for Harry, who bought it in 1975, it has provided a steady stream of rising income.Chart 1If one had bought Honeywell in January 1975 at $28 per share, they would have realized $27.50 per share in total dividend payouts. Pretty impressive. The chart does show, however, the main risk of dividend investing. Honeywell cut the dividend in 1991, but has consistently increased it since then. One should remember that a company can cut or eliminate a dividend at any time. Nevertheless, the dividend averaged an annual 4.9% increase for the last 40 years, and 9.2% since 1991. This is more than enough to keep up with inflation.Should One Buy Honeywell?I attempted to establish a fair target price for Honeywell, and came up with a few numbers. First, there is no ability to use the Discounted Dividend Model, because the required rate of return is 9.7%, and the company's anticipated growth rate is greater than that at 11.1%. From there, I had to focus on growth rates and multipliers to approximate a fair range for the target price. These are the data used:Depending on which direction one goes, the target price estimates range from $99.20 to $110.90. Since Honeywell is trading around $105, it appears to be fairly priced.So does one buy Honeywell? Well, it depends. For a growth investor who wants a reasonable margin of error, I would feel more comfortable recommending this stock if it were trading at $95 instead of $105. For the dividend investor who needs a minimum 2% yield, they should wait for it to fall to $100. If one currently owns Honeywell, I would recommend keeping it, and just ride the dividend wave. Officially, I would rate Honeywell as a HOLD.This is what others are saying about Honeywell:Happy Investing!"
3356835,23471,2015-07-24T20:00:55-04:00,"HON is suitable for the Enterprising Investor but not the more conservative Defensive Investor following the ModernGraham approach.According to the ModernGraham valuation model, the company is undervalued at the present time.The market is implying 5.91% annual earnings growth over the next 7-10 years, which is less than the rate the company has seen in recent years.","Honeywell International Inc. (NYSE:HON) has shown strong earnings growth over the last several years and pays a healthy dividend, factors that immediately attracts some investors. In addition, some analysts believe the company to be a good value based on qualitative factors. For example, Seeking Alpha contributor Josh Arnold wrote recently that the company's growth in margins are making up for lack of sales growth, a position similarly reported by Stephen Simpson. These qualitative issues are excellent to consider in the final stages of an investment decision, but first one must use quantitative metrics to determine the company's intrinsic value.Benjamin Graham, the father of value investing, taught that the most important aspect to consider is whether the company is trading at a discount relative to its intrinsic value. It is through a thorough fundamental analysis that the investor is able to make a determination about a potential investment's merits.The model is inspired by the teachings of Benjamin Graham and considers numerous metrics intended to help the investor reduce risk levels. The first part of the analysis is to determine whether the company is suitable for the very conservative Defensive Investor or the less conservative Enterprising Investor, who is willing to spend a greater amount of time conducting further research.In addition, Graham strongly suggested that investors avoid speculation in order to remove the subjective elements of emotion. This is best achieved by utilizing a systematic approach to analysis that will provide investors with a sense of how a specific company compares to another. By using the ModernGraham method, one can review a company's historical accomplishments and determine an intrinsic value that can be compared across industries.Defensive Investor - Must pass at least six of the following seven tests: Score = 4/7Enterprising Investor - Must pass at least four of the following five tests or be suitable for a Defensive Investor: Score = 4/5Valuation SummaryKey DataBalance Sheet - March 2015Earnings Per ShareEarnings Per Share - ModernGrahamDividend HistoryFree Cash Flow ConclusionHoneywell International is not suitable for Defensive Investors but it does pass the initial requirements of the Enterprising Investor. The Defensive Investor is concerned with the low current ratio and the high PEmg and PB ratios, while the Enterprising Investor's only concern is the low current ratio. As a result, all Enterprising Investors should feel very comfortable proceeding to the next part of the analysis, which is a determination of the company's intrinsic value.When it comes to that valuation, it is critical to consider the company's earnings history. In this case, it has grown its EPSmg (normalized earnings) from $2.68 in 2011 to an estimated $5.09 for 2015. This is a fairly strong level of demonstrated growth and outpaces the market's implied estimate for annual earnings growth of 5.91% over the next 7-10 years.In recent years, the company's actual growth in EPSmg has averaged nearly 18% annually, and while the ModernGraham valuation model reduces the actual growth to a more conservative figure when making an estimate, the model still returns an estimate of intrinsic value well above the current price, indicating that Honeywell International is significantly undervalued at the present time."
3365095,24361,2015-07-28T14:33:43-04:00,"Melrose wanted to sell and Honeywell was looking to buy; the two companies came together on a deal for the Elster metering and gas products business.Honeywell isn't getting Elster cheap (at more than 12x forward EBITDA), but the margins are attractive relative to Honeywell's base and there are synergy and growth possibilities.Elster should add at least $2 to Honeywell's value, while the sale puts more pressure on Melrose to identify its next buy-and-improve target.","A week ago, I wrote that Honeywell (NYSE:HON) had been quieter than most people expected with respect to M&A, and that automation/controls could be an area where the company would want to look. A week before that I had written that Melrose (OTC:MLSPF) (MRO.L) was likely looking to sell its Elster business (in whole or in pieces), return some cash to shareholders, and then move on to its next turnaround opportunity.In a peanut butter-meets-chocolate moment, the two companies got together and made both of those calls come true (more or less). Honeywell and Melrose announced Tuesday morning that the two companies had reached an agreement wherein Honeywell will acquire Melrose's Elster business in its entirety (and including pension obligations) for about $5.1 billion. This is a very good deal for Melrose and its shareholders, and management will likely move quickly to share the proceeds and identify the next target. For Honeywell, too, I believe this is a good deal and one that could open interesting doors down the road.The DealThese two companies announced Tuesday morning that Honeywell will acquire Elster from Melrose for $5.1 billion in cash (GBP 3.3 billion). A large portion of Honeywell's $6 billion cash balance has been stuck offshore and the company will be using this cash to fund the deal.Honeywell will be paying 12.6x times what it pegs as the consensus 2015 EBITDA estimate for Elster and more than 14x on a trailing basis (and more than three times trailing revenue). Melrose reported first-half earnings in conjunction with this announcement and reported that Elster's gas business grew at a 6% organic rate (revenue) for the first half, with 8% order growth, while the electricity business grew 18% and the water business declined 5%. All told, the business grew about 5% in the first half of the year.What Honeywell Is BuyingIn Elster, Honeywell is acquiring a company that is involved not only in smart metering, but also control products for the industrial and utility gas markets. Elster generates around 70% of its revenue from the gas market, where it sells a range of products including process-heating equipment, distribution and control products, and monitoring equipment. Some of the products sold include regulators and valves, flow computers, data loggers, and so on. Importantly, Elster touches the gas segment at all levels, from upstream (production/processing) to transmission/storage to end-users.Elster is also a major player in metering across gas, electricity and water. Elster is #1 in the gas space (30% share), with close to double the share of Itron (NASDAQ:ITRI) and well ahead of a handful of low-to-mid single-digit share rivals like General Electric's (NYSE:GE) Dresser and Toshiba's Landis+Gyr. Itron is a bigger player in metering overall than Elster (and Toshiba is likewise a much closer competitor), and although metering has been a very up-and-down market, there is still further penetration potential for smart meters.Elster wasn't a broken company when Melrose bought it, but Melrose has definitely made the company stronger in many respects. Melrose is rigorous when it comes to taking out costs and that has helped Elster's operating margin improve about one-third over the company's life of ownership (the acquisition of Elster was announced in mid-2012 and closed that year). I believe Melrose's rigorous attention to costs may make it more challenging for Honeywell to achieve its normal post-merger cost reductions, but management is nevertheless confident that it can obtain high single-digit cost synergies.A Good FitAlthough Elster is not what I had in mind for Honeywell to buy, it has a lot of the automation/control qualities that I thought Honeywell would be looking to acquire. Smart metering is not only an automation story (allowing utilities and users to monitor/control usage remotely), it is also a building control story and both fit comfortably into Honeywell's existing operating focus. I also believe that Elster's gas product business will fit in with its existing process automation operations in the oil/gas space. Integrating the Elster components into those existing operations could create some long-term synergy and cross-selling opportunities that may allow this acquisition to deliver more than the 4% or so long-term base case revenue growth I expect.For Melrose, What Comes Next?Unlike a serial acquirer like Danaher (NYSE:DHR) or GE (or, arguably, Honeywell), Melrose doesn't acquire to hold, but rather to fix and eventually sell. Management is paid in part on the value they create and it is corporate policy to share the proceeds with shareholders - to that end, Melrose will return about two-thirds of the proceeds of the Elster sale to shareholders.When I wrote on Melrose a little while ago, the central issue with valuation was figuring out where the company would go next. That's now an even more pressing concern as the remaining operations (the Brush turbogenerator business) is not doing exceptionally well and wouldn't appear to be a high-value sale opportunity today (it's likely worth more to Melrose to hold onto it a while longer and wait for the recovery in power gen to strengthen).Without repeating all of my prior article, there are a lot of places Melrose could look for its next fix-and-sell target. Andritz and Sulzer would make sense, as would Kennametal (NYSE:KMT), SPX (SPW), and Chart Industries (NASDAQ:GTLS) if the company were inclined to go with an American company. Whatever the case, it's most likely going to be an industrial company with a solid market presence in a durable market but where improved execution on costs could add meaningful value.The Bottom LineIf Honeywell can generate 3% to 5% long-term revenue growth from Elster and mid-single digit cost synergies (below management's target), I think this deal is worth an incremental $2 to $2.50 per share to Honeywell (shares are up $2.35 as of this writing). At a minimum, I find it hard to imagine that Honeywell is going to do worse than the alternative - letting the cash sit overseas and earn next-to-nothing or take a double-digit haircut from taxes upon repatriation. What's more, I do think there are synergy possibilities in the automation and building control businesses that could make the $2.50 estimate too conservative over the long term.In any case, this looks like a relatively uncommon M&A win-win - Melrose gets to liquidate Elster for cash at an attractive multiple, while Honeywell gets to acquire a relatively rare asset that matches well with the company's existing end-market and product foci.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

3391305,25120,2015-08-04T14:27:43-04:00,"Honeywell announces the sizable $5.1 billion purchase of Elster Division.
        The purchase makes sense as it improves the growth and margin profile of the business.
        While the deal is large in absolute terms it does not move the needle in a significant manner.
        This purchase does create another acquisition growth platform going forwards, as Honeywell has a solid track record in acquiring and integrating businesses.
        While I like Honeywell given its stability, I require a greater margin of safety before I buy the shares which trade near their all-time highs.","Honeywell (NYSE:HON) announced a sizable deal last week. For a considerable sum of $5.1 billion, Honeywell is acquiring the Elster Division from Melrose Industries.While the deal is large in absolute terms, the contribution to the overall Honeywell conglomerate is relatively modest. Honeywell has a great track record in integrating past acquisitions, a reason why investors like the deal which acts as a platform for future dealmaking.Elster's BusinessElster provides measurements and safety control systems for predominantly natural gas as well as water and electricity. This seems like a traditional and perhaps even boring segment, yet in reality it is now. Developments related to smart meters which can be combined with data analytics solutions are able to create a much more efficient and effective energy infrastructure.Honeywell is not able to buy Elster on the cheap. For $5.1 billion, the company acquires a business with $1.8 billion in sales at a valuation of 12.6 times EBITDA. In comparison, Melrose Industries bought Elster itself for $2.3 billion as recent as 2012.While these are no cheap multiples, Honeywell stresses the advantages of the deal. The company points towards the steep margins which exceed 20% as well as the good organic growth profile of the business. Honeywell is furthermore able to use non-US held cash to finance the deal, thereby avoiding steep repatriation tax charges.Elster operates in a stable industry which is seeing some interesting trends. While customers like Elster's products given their safety performance, accuracy as well as reliability, Elster has been working on some innovative solutions as well. Developments related to smart meters, which are coupled with data analytics, create a strong position in an industry which is impacted by the need to improve energy efficiency and reduce the environmental impact.Honeywell Has A Great Acquisition Track RecordDespite the fairly elevated valuation multiples, Honeywell is quite pleased with the deal as CEO Dave Cote points towards the strong organic growth profile of Elster as well as the opportunities for dealmaking in this area going forwards. Besides these opportunities, Honeywell can apply its own knowledge and capabilities in this area. Think for example about the smart thermostats of Honeywell as this technology can be used in Elster's products as well.Honeywell's acquisition driven growth strategy has been backed by a prominent investor. Nelson Peltz who often is very critical about conglomerates thinks that Mr. Cote is an excellent CEO and that he ¨deserves¨ to built or run a conglomerate, rather than to break it up in separate pieces.Honeywell anticipates that it can cut 8% of Elster's costs once it is fully integrated with its own business. The company failed to detail whether these anticipated cost savings applied to the operating cost base of the company or the entire cost base of Elster. In either case no major impact is seen to Honeywell's 2016s earnings. This results from the ¨full¨ valuation of the acquisition as well as the fact that Elster adds just 4-5% to Honeywell's total sales.Using The Strong Balance SheetHoneywell has a strong and liquid balance sheet which can easily support the acquisition. The company held nearly $6 billion in cash at the end of the second quarter while debt stood at $9.7 billion. This net debt load of $3.7 billion is equivalent to just 0.5 times the trailing EBITDA of $7.3 billion.Following the latest deal, the net debt load will increase to roughly $8.8 billion, as pro-forma EBITDA is seen at roughly $7.7 billion. This results in a 1.1 times leverage position after the deal has been closed, still leaving more financial room to make future deals.The 793 million shares outstanding in Honeywell trade at $105 per share, just shy of their all-time highs. This values equity at $83 billion, which in its turn values the business at roughly $92 billion after taking into account the net debt load.The pro-forma business now generates sales of $41-$42 billion and pro-forma EBITDA of $7.7 billion. Net earnings are seen around $4.5 billion. Based on these observations, the pro-forma business trades at 2.2 times sales and 12 times EBITDA. These multiples are quite similar to the multiples paid for Elster, as Honeywell's equity trades at 18-19 times earnings.Growth Driven By DealmakingDave Cote's statement, which said that the company made 80 acquisitions over the past decade which added $12 billion in sales, is quite informative. Honeywell posted sales of little over $27 billion in 2005 and this number has risen to $41-42 billion on a pro-forma basis.This means that sales have increased by roughly $15 billion over the past decade, as 80% of this sales growth has been the result of dealmaking. This pretty much implies that sales would have grown by just $3 billion if not for these deals. This very modest growth translates into organic growth of just around 1% per year over this time period.While the organic sales growth has not been great, the deals have allowed for large margin expansion. Honeywell has expanded operating margins from roughly 10% to current levels around 15%. The latest Elster deal will contribute to further margin expansion given that its operating margins come in around 20% of sales.While the $5.1 billion deal is the largest acquisition of Honeywell since its 1999 merger with AlliedSignal, leverage ratio's remain very manageable. If the company is willing to increase leverage to 2 times EBITDA, Honeywell has sufficient financial room to make another $7-8 billion worth of deals. This is consistent with Honeywell's ambitions to make at least $10 billion worth of deals through 2019.Dealmaking and organic growth results in a revenue target of $51 to $56 billion by 2018 according to Honeywell's 5 year plan. Segment margins are expected to improve by roughly 2.0% to 3.5% compared to 2014. In such a scenario, operating earnings might come in around $9 billion. Based on current effective tax rates, earnings might increase to $6.0-$6.5 billion in such a scenario.If one applies an 18 times earnings multiple to such an earnings base, Honeywell could be valued at $135 to $150 per share by 2018. If this scenario is realistic, investors could see potential returns of 9-12% per year in the coming three years.Final RemarksHoneywell is a steady operator. While organic growth is not spectacular, the company delivers on topline sales growth through savvy dealmaking. This topline sales growth is combined with high and stable margins, as the company continues to successfully unlock synergies from past deals.The growth from this dealmaking, expanding margins and steadily increasing valuation multiples have resulted in a boom in Honeywell's share price. Shares traded at a peak of $60 ahead of the 2009 crisis during which they have halved. Ever since, shares have risen steadily to levels above $100 per share driven by acquisitions, rising margins and increasing valuation multiples.While I like the stability, it does come at a price. At 18-19 times earnings, Honeywell supports a +5% earnings yield. Roughly 40% of these earnings are returned in the form of dividends while the remainder is used mainly for deals as CEO Dave Cote is not a big fan of dividends.The remarkable thing is that Honeywell trades just shy of the all-time highs, at a time when other industrial conglomerates have seen a pullback. 3M (NYSE:MMM) as well as United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) have seen a pullback in their share price amidst increased challenging conditions as well as dollar strength.This makes shares no obvious buy at current times at a market-equivalent multiple at which Honeywell currently trades. Honeywell could operational challenges too, prompting a potential correction in its shares, similar to what its competitors have seen.At $90 per share, the valuation multiple drops to 16 times earnings, a modest discount to the overall market. At these levels I am attracted to the shares given the solid earnings yield, earnings stability and relative contained leverage position."
3336035,54312,2015-07-19T01:57:19-04:00,"Honeywell announced strong second quarter results.Currency headwinds declined its sales growth.However, its strategy of investing only in high growth, high margin businesses increased its core sales and operating margins.It is a good stock to hold.","Honeywell International, Inc. (NYSE:HON) announced strong results for the second quarter of fiscal 2015. The company generated core sales growth of 3%, relative to the past year quarter. However, its reported sales declined 5% to $9.7B on strong currency headwinds and recent divestitures. It's all three segments generated positive sales growth in the second quarter of this year. Aerospace segment generated core sales growth of 3%, but dragged down by 5% on negative currency translations and Friction Materials divestiture. Honeywell's Automation and Control Solutions segment posted core sales growth of almost 4% on growth in demand for scanning & mobility, security, and fire safety products.On the negative side, the company's Performance Materials and Technologies segment generated negative core sales growth of 1% and reported sales declined 9% on currency headwinds and raw materials pricing in Resins & Chemicals. On a consolidated basis, its core sales growth of 3% looks impressive to me in a volatile business environment, when IMF has already lowered its outlook twice for this year.Source: earnings releaseOn earnings side, the company looks stronger with its strategy of investing in high growth, high margin businesses along working with working on cost cuttings. Its operating margin for aerospace businesses increased 140 bps, relative to the past year. In addition, in the second quarter, segment margin for its automation and control solutions segment and performance materials and technologies segment increased significantly by 120 bps and 330 bps, respectively. Overall, its segment margin increased 179 bps, relative to the past year quarter. Thus, on negative sales growth of 5%, the company generated 9% increase in earnings per share to $1.51 compared with $1.38 per share in the past year quarter.Source: earnings releaseOn cash side, its operating cash flow is expanding on growth in earnings. It generated operating cash flow of $1.4B, when capital requirements stood at only $243 million. Thus, the company is left with significant amount of free cash flows to make dividend payments of only $437 million along with working on buybacks and investing in growth opportunities.Honeywell's share price is on momentum over the past few years on its successful business strategies. Its stock gained almost 1.5% on earnings announcement and gained 7.45% over the past twelve months. In my recent articles, I consistently advised defensive investors to look at Honeywell international for safe dividend growth and steady price appreciation. Its healthy dividends, steady price appreciation and strong growth in earnings affirmed my opinion. Moving on, the company is likely to sustain its momentum in the coming days. On earnings announcement, the company also increased the low end of full-year earnings per share guidance range to $6.05-$6.15.In ConclusionI strongly believe that its balanced portfolio of short- and long-cycle businesses, disciplined capital allocation strategy in high growth, high margin businesses and penetration in end markets will enable it to keep its momentum. In addition, its dividends are not only safe, but the company has potential to make significant increase in dividends in the comings days. Its focus on buyback will also have a positive impact on its share price and dividends. Other than short term currency headwinds, I'm not seeing any risk which could hinder its future performance. Thus, I recommend investors to hold this stock for steady and safe gains."
3340855,24361,2015-07-21T04:00:40-04:00,"Honeywell delivered reasonably good organic revenue growth despite little pricing leverage, and the company's margin-improvement efforts are paying off.Aerospace and non-residential construction likely have more to give, while auto and oil/gas could be softer drivers in the coming quarters.On its own merits, I believe Honeywell can trade between $107 and $115 and that's before including the potentially outsized benefits of M&A.","There's an interesting dichotomy with a lot of industrial stocks these days - the stereotypically bullish sell-side is concerned that demand is going to start fading (and take margin leverage with it), while the valuations would seem to reflect more of a ""what, me worry?"" attitude on the part of owners.For its part, Honeywell (NYSE:HON) has continued to execute well and there is still a credible forward-looking story for margins and M&A. What's more, Honeywell has pretty attractive leverage to the more attractive industrial markets today and relatively low leverage to the less attractive sub-sectors. Valuation could be a little better, but that Honeywell might be cheap at all is somewhat surprising to me and there still may be some room left to run with this name (not to mention an attractive long-term angle for more patient investors).A Little Top-Line Acceleration And Some Margin Leverage As WellIt's been a lumpy reporting season so far, but then not that many major industrials have reported earnings. Atlas Copco (OTCPK:ATLKY) saw generally weak results, but better than expected, and General Electric (NYSE:GE) seemed to do fine for itself. Honeywell likewise reported what I think is a pretty solid set of numbers.Revenue declined 5% as reported, but rose 3% in organic terms. That marked a slight acceleration in growth rate on a sequential basis, but I would note that the lack of pricing power across the industrial space is true here as well, with all of the momentum on the volume side. That has me curious as to what 3M (NYSE:MMM) will report later this week...Honeywell's Aerospace business saw 3% organic growth, led by the Commercial OE business (up 6%) and the Transportation business (up 5%), with all of the units positive. Automation and Control was up 4% organically, with Energy, Safety, and Security up 5% and Building Solutions up 3%. Performance Materials was considerably more mixed, as the top-line number (down 1%) was dragged down by UOP (down 8%) and Process Solutions (down 4%), while Advanced Materials were up 6%. Given the underlying market conditions in process automation these days, I'd call down 4% a pretty solid result for that sub-segment.Margins were pretty good, even with Honeywell having laid out a relatively challenging hurdle. Gross margin improved 150bp, which seemed to be more or less in line with most analysts. Segment-level operating margin improved 170bp, though, and that was above the high end of Honeywell's guidance and most sell-side estimates. Reported operating income grew 5%, while segment profits rose 3%. Of particular note, aero is showing some benefits from an increased focus on margin improvement.In The Right Spots … For NowIt certainly cannot be hurting Honeywell to be leveraged to relatively stronger end markets today. Residential and non-residential building are both improving (even after a long wait and still not as much as the bulls hoped...), and these represent more than 20% of Honeywell's revenue exposure. Auto and aero are also doing pretty well, and those too are sizable markets for the company. The only really troubling exposure for Honeywell is in oil and gas, at around 15% of sales, but not all oil/gas market exposures are alike and Honeywell is relatively better-positioned than say Dover (NYSE:DOV) or GE.Obviously the attractive/unattractive market mix is a moving target. Auto and truck have been strong for a while and may be about to start decelerating. That would put about 10% of Honeywell's revenue potentially at risk (similar to Ingersoll-Rand (NYSE:IR), Eaton (NYSE:ETN), or 3M), but aero and defense seem to be improving and can offset that effect. Of course, Honeywell isn't the only play on stronger aero or non-resi, as GE and Parker Hannifin (NYSE:PH) offer some leverage to both, and Ingersoll-Rand is heavily leveraged to non-residential construction.Self-Improvement Still A Potential DriverI still believe that Honeywell can produce better results all on its own. The company's Honeywell Operating System Gold concept involves driving business growth at double the rate of the underlying market while achieving profitability levels 50% above peer averages. That's a pretty tough bar to achieve, but it could still lead to meaningful margin improvements. Management estimated at its Analyst Day earlier this year that about of 85% of its business (at the COGS level) were at Bronze or Silver levels and while Gold across the board may not be possible, it would appear that the most progress has been made in ACS and there's still more upside in the Aero segment.M&A could spike the punch bowl further in the company's favor. Management outlined some relatively bold capital deployment targets a year ago, but has since done relatively little. I would assume that high valuations have been the principal reason management has sat on its cash, and most of the bargains out there today have some definite end-market concerns attached to them.I've written recently about how both Emerson (NYSE:EMR) and Rockwell (NYSE:ROK) could find attractive targets in the automation space. The same is true for Honeywell, but this company has a lot of flexibility with where it could direct its attention. Automation (particularly in the controls and/or software spaces) could be a target, but then so could aerospace or specialty materials. I'd be surprised if Honeywell sought to acquire entirely new verticals, so areas like mining, power gen, and healthcare are probably not going to where management looks for deals.Value On TrackI've made relatively few changes to my models for Honeywell, and I'm still looking for revenue growth of 4% to be augmented by further improvements in margins and FCF efficiency sufficient to drive almost double that rate of FCF growth. Discounted back, that's worth more than $107/share today. I'd also note that my projections of the company's long-term ROE would support a fair value above $115 today. That suggests single-digit undervaluation for the shares, which may not sound great from an absolute sense, but is pretty compelling on a relative valuation basis.The Bottom LineUnless you think that non-residential construction (including building modernization/retrofitting) and aerospace are unlikely to grow from here, I think it's hard not to like Honeywell. If I had to put new money into industrials, I think this would be my first choice, or at least my first choice in the large/mega-cap space. Up almost 100% over the last three years, I can understand investors being concerned about buying it at peak levels, but I don't think Honeywell's primary markets are peaking yet and I think there's further room above Honeywell's current price."

        Investments in emerging markets as well as stable product markets give Honeywell a healthy mix of capital growth and stable income.
        Invest in Honeywell to weather the upcoming market storm and position oneself for long-term gains.","IntroductionEven though Honeywell International, Inc. (NYSE: HON) is among the companies in the group known as the Fortune 100, ranking in returns near household names like Johnson and Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) and 3M Co. (NYSE:MMM), I don't see it mentioned as often in the financial headlines. This is quite a shame, really, given the attractive fundamentals and strong leadership of the Company, which has positioned the Company for future growth in the long-term.Honeywell is an industrial conglomerate. Incorporated in 1985, it is a leading manufacturer of a wide variety of technology and industrial products. Its products span the industries of aerospace, security, environment, oil & gas, and many more. If you look at pretty much anything you have in your house, chances are it was created by something that was manufactured by Honeywell.For the past year or so, Honeywell's stock has seen a steady trend upward with a few bumps in the road. This bump was a result of some issues that occurred at one of Honeywell's Uranium Hexafluoride processing facilities; however, the decline in price was only temporary, and the stock quickly recovered to its previous price levels within several weeks. There was also a sharp dip in the fall of 2011, but even then, the decline was only temporary. Honeywell's fundamentals were not affected in both cases. As investors can see, this stock is quite elastic, making it a great position to ride the markets throughout the next several months.Source: Stockcharts.comGiven its sheer amount of diversification, both product-wise and geography-wise, as well as its solid dividend yield of 1.98%, Honeywell could make a great defensive addition to any portfolio for the turbulent markets ahead.FundamentalsIn terms of diversification, Honeywell is among the best. Not only does the Company sell to a wide variety of customers that span multiple industries, but it also engages in a healthy amount of international operations that yields a good combination of growth and stability. Across the three business segments that Honeywell divides its operations into, including Aerospace, Automation & Control Solutions, and Performance Materials & Technologies, US exports in these segments' international operations were 20%, 3%, and 21% of total sales, respectively. In terms of Non-US sales, excluding exports, international operations accounted for 32%, 67%, and 16% of total sales, respectively. Overall international sales were steady for the past years, with 41% of sales coming from international operations for 2014, 2013, and 2012.A closer examination of Honeywell's business segments paints an interesting picture. In terms of segment growth, Aerospace Sales lags behind Honeywell's other segments. Growth has stagnated for the past several years, with growth rates at -0.9% and 0.9% in fiscal years 2014 and 2013, respectively.Source: HON Company SEC FilingsHoneywell's other business segments bring better news. Automation & Control Solutions had 7.6% and 5.3% growth in fiscal years 2014 and 2013, respectively, and Performance Materials & Technology had 3.7% and 6.2% growth in fiscal years 2014 and 2013, respectively.Honeywell has always grown through a somewhat stable combination or inorganic and organic growth. While growth was bumpy in fiscal year 2009 due to the financial crisis, since then, growth in net sales has hovered around a respectable 6.2% for the past five years.Gross margin-wise, Honeywell has been stable, and the Company has been steadily improving it since fiscal year 2011 due to its implementation of HOS Gold, which is a business model Honeywell adopted to streamline and optimize its operations. The five-year average for Honeywell's gross margins is 25.2%.Source: HON Company SEC FilingsTaking a look at Honeywell's balance sheets, investors can see that Honeywell's cash position has increased in the past several years. Receivables and inventories have increased linearly as well, signaling steady growth. The Company's current ratio has jumped from 1.28 in fiscal year 2010 to 1.50 in fiscal year 2014, and retained earnings have grown healthily from $15,097M to $23,115M. Furthermore, the Company has taken on a good amount of leverage to bolster growth with a debt to equity ratio of 0.3, far less than the industry average of 1.0 (according to Morningstar.com).RisksSince Honeywell has such a significant amount of its operations overseas, it is subject to the political and economic instability that is inherent in international operations. Certain emerging markets, such as China and Brazil, have proved to be more unstable in the recent years, and growth has begun to slow. In particular, China's current stock market troubles have caused quite a ruckus, which may dash hopes of any near-term gains. When investing in Honeywell, investors should seek to open a position with a long-term growth strategy in mind. This is especially true for large diversified industrial companies whose growth is like a glacier: inevitable but at a slow rate.Furthermore, Honeywell obtains its sales from a number of turbulent sources. In its Aerospace segment, Honeywell derives a decent amount of its sales from the US government, which has steadily cut its military spending in recent years. In Honeywell's 2014 10-K, management states twice that its Defense and Space sales declined due to lower US government military spending.Although one of Honeywell's fastest growing segments is its UOP business within its Performance Materials & Technology segment, UOP sales are somewhat tied to oil & gas production due to the nature of the business. As investors know, the oil & gas industry has taken hits in the past several months, and continued slowdown of the industry may spell trouble for Honeywell.As the latter part of 2015 leads into early 2016, the worldwide markets are likely to become more and more turbulent. As growth is likely to slow down, investors should look for opportunities to open positions in solid, defensible investments such as Honeywell.ConclusionWith strong diversification in both stable and growth industries and geographies, Honeywell is poised to weather the upcoming storm in the latter end of 2015 to early 2016. A strong balance sheet, investments in emerging markets, and a dedication to streamlining operations all make Honeywell an attractive investment. While investors should lower any expectations for near-term gains, in the long-term, Honeywell may prove a reliable source of both stable income and capital growth."

Honeywell International, Inc. (NYSE:HON) also showed investors what it made of the second quarter and results were robust, despite currency headwinds: Second quarter revenues declined 5% to $9.8 billion from $10.3 billion in the year ago quarter, partly due to the influence of currency fluctuations, but they grew 3% on an organic basis, which is all that really matters. Analysts expected $9.9 billion in 2Q15 revenues.In terms of segment profits, Honeywell reported a 6% year-over-year increase to $1.8 billion. Just like General Electric, Honeywell also succeeded in expanding operating margins: In the second quarter of fiscal 2015, Honeywell said it had a segment profit margin of 18.4% compared against 16.7% in the year ago quarter. General Electric, on the other hand, grew its operating margin on the industrial side of its business from 15.5% last year to 16.2% in 2Q15.Honeywell had earnings per share of $1.51 in 2Q15, which were 9% higher than a year ago when the company reported earnings of $1.38 per share. The consensus earnings estimate was for $1.50 per share in second quarter earnings.Margin expansion the dominant theme in 2015When Honeywell released first quarter earnings in April, I contended that margin expansion is the real story for the company in 2015, while the endless discussion about currency fluctuations and their topline effects is only serving to distract investors from what's really going on.In the second quarter, Honeywell's segment margin stood at 18.4%, a respectable margin by any measure and a great improvement over 2Q14.Source: Honeywell Investor PresentationOptimistic guidanceHoneywell released an optimistic third quarter guidance as part of its second quarter earnings release.While Honeywell expects sales to consolidate 2-4% in the next quarter to a range of $9.7-$9.9 billion, core organic growth is forecast to be between 3-4%, and the margin theme is expected to remain intact: Honeywell guided for continued margin AND EPS growth for the next quarter.Source: Honeywell Investor PresentationFurther, Honeywell guided for full-year 2015 earnings per share of $6.05-$6.15.ValuationHoneywell has a forward P/E ratio of 15.8x, but the potential for margin and earnings growth makes this ratio defensible. General Electric, on the other hand, has a forward P/E ratio of 17.6x, while the company has not been quite as successful as Honeywell in terms of growing margins.Shooting for new 52-week highs?Honeywell International has returned 8.42% over the last year whereas General Electric's shares produced a price return of 4.85%.Honeywell's robust second quarter results and upbeat outlook could lend enough momentum to Honeywell in the weeks ahead to lift shares to new 52-week highs. The latest 52-week high was reached on May 18, 2015 at $107.10.Source: Yahoo FinanceYour TakeawayHoneywell did a great job in the second quarter. The strong U.S. dollar hurts international businesses, but currency fluctuations are merely a distracting sideshow. Honeywell's success in growing segment margins and earnings per share is the real story."
3349175,39011,2015-07-23T07:38:44-04:00,HON reported earnings last week and showed us that its margin growth story is still getting better.Sluggish sales are a concern but growth in margins are making up for it lack of sales growth.Raised guidance is always a positive and I think HON is still too cheap at 15.6 times forward earnings.,"Last time I wrote about industrial conglomerate Honeywell (NYSE:HON) back in May the stock was trading for $102 and I called it a terrific long term buy. The company's combination of steady, diversified earnings and its low valuation led me to believe HON was a great blue chip pick. If we move forward to today the stock is up marginally as it has bounced around a bit but the earnings report failed to produce new highs. In light of new information we've received and the stock's sideways action, I'll use this article to take a fresh look at HON to see if the long term bull thesis is still intact.To do this I'll use a DCF-type model you can read more about here. The model uses several inputs including earnings estimates, which I've borrowed from Yahoo!, dividends, which I've set to grow at 12% annually, and a discount rate, which I've set at the 5 year Treasury rate plus a risk premium of 7%.We can see the model is a bit indifferent as it computes the fair value of the stock right in line with where it trades as I write this. That would imply that HON is fully valued but let's take a look at the fundamentals to see what they can tell us.While Q2's revenue number was light in comparison to last year's Q2, margin growth helped HON produce significant profit growth. It also maintained its sales outlook but boosted its EPS guidance in a move I found a bit surprising considering the relatively weak outlook for sales. Nonetheless, the stock reacted favorably to the guidance raise and when a management team raises guidance, I take notice. The last thing a management team wants to do is raise guidance and then miss it so I have to think HON is quite confident heading into H2.I'm still bullish on HON despite the fact that Q2 saw all of its major segments post lower revenue than last year's Q2. The reason is because HON has become a great margin growth story that has allowed it to produce lots of FCF and earnings growth despite rather muted long term sales growth in the low single digits.I've charted below the spread between gross margins and SG&A for Honeywell for the past decade and the first half of this year as a way to examine operating margins. These two numbers contain the vast majority of the costs to run a business and give us a great read on how a company is doing with its operating margins.We can see that flat to declining margins gave way to rapidly improving margins beginning in 2011 as HON has kept a keen eye on costs while improving its gross margins. That expansion has allowed HON to grow profits at a rate well in excess of its revenue growth and that is the growth story here; you're not buying double digit revenue growth with HON, you're buying the margin growth story. Given that the first half of this year has been so strong with product margins once again taking off there is little reason to doubt management's bullish guidance.The other piece of this puzzle is that strong margins allow for equally strong FCF generation. That frees up HON to do lots of things that create value for shareholders like pay the dividend, buy back stock and buy its way to growth. The dividend takes up about 40% of FCF so that leaves lots of room for potential M&A targets HON could pay for organically. Analysts have their ideas of potential targets and while I won't speculate on that, HON has the ability to buy some revenue growth and as long as potential targets didn't disturb HON's margin profile, it would be welcome. The one thing HON needs help with is revenue growth so if it can buy it, all the better.HON isn't quite as cheap as it was last time I wrote about it since the stock has moved up a bit but given the guidance boost it is still in the same range. HON is trading for only 15.6 times forward earnings which is cheap by any measure but particularly in light of General Electric's (NYSE:GE) 17.5 forward multiple. I consider HON's growth story superior to GE's due to the latter's uncertainty surrounding its Capital exit and what that means for shareholders in addition to HON's excellent margin growth. I don't think HON will trade at 17.5 times forward earnings anytime soon but it deserves a higher multiple than it has. At any rate, even if I'm wrong and HON doesn't see some modest multiple expansion it certainly has less downside risk than GE with a markedly lower multiple and far less uncertainty surrounding its earnings trajectory. Thus, I'm still bullish on HON here based on its cheap valuation and margin growth."
3335295,50662,2015-07-18T18:19:52-04:00,"Honeywell's revenue decreased, but its operating expenses decreased even faster, leading to higher margins and a higher net profit.Changes in the company's working capital position are ""hiding"" an underlying adjusted free cash flow of almost $5B.At a free cash flow yield of 6.1%, Honeywell still isn't expensive, and this company definitely belongs in my conservative stock portfolio.","IntroductionI'm keeping an eye on several large-cap companies like Honeywell (NYSE:HON) to find useful additions for my more defensive stock portfolio. I do like Honeywell because it seems to continue to increase its dividend payments and as the company has just released its financial results for the second quarter of this year, I decided to dive in and crunch some numbers.The Q2 financial statementsEven though the company's sales number dropped by 5% to $9.8B, I'm generally quite optimistic about the company's future as after combing through the SEC filings, the margins seem to have expanded and the earnings per share increased as well. So don't let the negative headline surprise you as the underlying performance is much better.Source: SEC filingsYes, revenue decreased by 5%, but what's more important is the fact the company's total production and selling expenses decreased as well. By 7.1% to be exact. This means that even though the revenue decreased, the pre-tax income and the net income actually Increased, and the net income attributable to Honeywell increased by 8.6% to just short of $1.2B, resulting in an earnings per diluted share of $1.51 for the quarter and $2.91 for the first semester. This would mean Honeywell is relatively pricey at a P/E ratio of approximately 16, but wait, there's more than that.My readers already know I don't care about net profits and net income, as I strongly believe the free cash flow is what makes a company stand out from the crowd. So let's move over to those cash flow statements to check up on Honeywell's ability to generate free cash flow.Source: SEC FilingsThe company's operating cash flow was $1.408B, but I like to work with an ""adjusted"" operating cash flow, excluding changes in the working capital position as those changes aren't really sustainable. In Honeywell's case, the adjusted operating cash flow increases to $1.571B for the quarter. As Honeywell spent just $243M in capital expenditures, the adjusted free cash flow was $1.33B.Was this a lucky quarter? I don't think so. Let's pull the numbers for the first half of the year. The adjusted operating cash flow was $2.83B in H1 2015, and the capital expenditures were just $408M, resulting in a positive free cash flow of $2.42B, or almost $5B for the entire year. Given Honeywell's current market capitalization of $81B, this would result in an expected adjusted positive free cash flow yield of 6.1%, which is actually pretty good for a blue chip company.A balance sheet to drool overAs a final step in my decision-making process based on a company's fundamentals, I always check the balance sheet as well to make sure there are no hidden problems as in this era of cheap debt some companies are increasing the amount of debt on the balance sheet to make unthoughtful acquisitions, or even worse, to reward their shareholders.Source: SEC filingsI have to admit, Honeywell's balance sheet looks very robust. The company's working capital position is a very decent $7.6B, and the inventory level accounts for less than 20% of the current assets (I hate it when the majority of the current assets or even the working capital consists of ""inventory,"" as the ""real"" value of an inventory is uncertain).The total liabilities also are under control and the long-term debt position has been reduced from $6.05B to $5.56B, because some of the long-term debt now has to be paid within the year.Investment thesisSo, the balance sheet looks robust and Honeywell is on track to generate almost $5B in free cash flow this year. The main question is, what will the company spend it on, given the fact the balance sheet doesn't need to be repaired? $1.6B will go toward dividend payments, but that means there's an additional $3.4B available. I hope Honeywell will step up its share repurchase rate as it spent just $123M on share repurchases in Q2 and $486M in H1 2015, so I would hope the company increases its share repurchase program to $1.5-2B per year.The remaining $1-1.5B in free cash flow could then go toward either additional (smaller) acquisitions or to act as a buffer for the changes in the company's working capital.What can I say? I'm not surprised Honeywell increased the lower end of its EPS guidance from $6 to $6.05, and I'm charmed by the company's underlying operational results. I would be interested in writing a put option, and I'm focusing on a Put 90 expiring in January of next year. Depending on today's trading pattern in Honeywell, I'd hope to get an option premium of $1.5 for it. If I get the shares assigned, I will hold Honeywell at a forward free cash flow yield of 6.85%, and if Honeywell expires above $90/share in January, the option premium gives me an annualized return of 3.36%."
3331275,32001,2015-07-16T12:56:46-04:00,"GE's earnings estimates hammered on Finance sale, but stock higher YTD.HON is very well run, and probably fully valued.With GE Capital news, GE becomes a defensive stock yielding 3.5% currently with share repo's.","Both General Electric (NYSE:GE) and Honeywell (NYSE:HON) report before the opening bell on Friday, July 17th, 2015.Both stocks have outperformed the SP 500 YTD, although I'm more partial to GE at this point given that with the business model restructuring, and the sale of the Finance unit, Immelt and the GE Board can be more aggressive in restoring GE to its former glory days.GE / Honeywell return comparisonSource: ycharts.com as of 7/16/15General Electric:When GE reports Friday morning, July 17th, 2015, analyst consensus is currently looking for $0.28 in earnings per share (EPS) on $28.7 billion in revenue for expected y/y declines of 28% and 21% respectively.For the full-year 2015, analyst consensus is expecting a y/y decline in EPS of 22% on a 16% decline in revenue, all of this due to the sale of the sizable GE Capital unit.After the divestiture of GE Capital, the goal of GE will be derive 90% of its operating income from Industrial businesses, versus the roughly 65% contribution from GE Industrial today.With the sale of a big part of GE Capital, and the spinoff of Synchrony (NYSE:SYF), GE will return $90 billion of capital to shareholders, through share repurchases and dividends.GE is currently yielding 3.5% thus with the share repurchases that are planned, and the spinoff of additional units, I do think from a portfolio construction standpoint, GE becomes a defensive stock with more reward than risk in my opinion.From a valuation perspective, with high-single-digit organic growth expected with the Industrial unit, I think GE can trade into the low $30's. 2017's EPS estimate of $1.78 means GE could trade to $35 - $36 on a 20(x) multiple, but in order to do that, GE would need to start showing some growth out of the core Industrial businesses.Current consensus GE EPS estimates for 2016 and 2017 are looking for 22% and 15% growth respectively, on 4% and 1% revenue growth respectively.Just a small increase in organic revenue growth would help GE's p.e. ratio expand in my opinion.With the EU making noises about the Alstom (OTCPK:ALSMY) deal, and the fact it was an Energy business that GE jumped into just prior to the collapse of crude oil, Jeff Immelt's and the Board's job needs to be convince investors that they have their game on, and can restructure GE for faster growth.GE Industrial (per the 10-Q and financial disclosures) generates about half of total GE's cash-flow but about 65% - 70% of total GE's free-cash-flow. GE has been ramping GE Industrial capex the last few years, but GE Industrial's free-cash-flow alone as of 3/31/15 covered GE's dividend.GE's EPS, revenue growth and p.e metricsHoneywell:Honeywell consensus is expecting $1.49 on $9.74 billion on Friday morning, July 17th, for y/y growth of 8% on a decline of 5% in revenue.Like a number of Industrials, the strong dollar cost HON about $400 million in revenue in Q1 1'5 or about 4% of the $9.2 billion reported.The aerospace was a drag in Q1 '15 but improved sequentially as the first quarter progressed.One thing that caught my eye over the last few years is that HON's operating margin, now 18% has expanded from 12% - 15% several years ago.That being said, I think HON is overvalued here. While I wouldn't take a new position, if you own HON and have a nice gain on the stock, there is nothing in the numbers today that say ""sell"".HON's EPS, revenue growth and P.E metricsHere is a valuation table comparing some metrics between the 2 companies:Valuation comparison: GE vs. HoneywellSource: internal spreadsheetsConclusion / summary: The divestiture of GE Capital by GE means an enormous return of capital for the former Finance / Industrial giant, and the ability to reinvent the Industrial portfolio that would generate high single digit organic growth.In the meantime GE's 3.5% dividend yield, and the enormous share repurchase should portend more reward than risk, and for investors looking for safety and stability for the next 3 - 5 years, GE is a safe bet in my opinion.The real question is whether Jeff Immelt is the guy to carry them into the next phase of GE's portfolio transition. I still believe Jeff needs to get on his horse and be more aggressive with the Industrial portfolio, particularly with the capital generated from the Finance unit divestitures.Honeywell is a great operator, and yesterday at the Delivering Alpha conference, David Cote, the HON CEO received many kudos for his stewardship at HON.I just think HON is fully valued and would only be willing to buy it on a decent pullback into the $80 area."
3300055,70385,2015-07-02T12:59:04-04:00,"Honeywell International is a solid, well-performing company.Earnings growth has been good and margins have been improving thanks to the company innovating its operations.The company has a strong financial footing and a good track record of raising dividends regularly.","Honeywell International (NYSE:HON) recently set a new all-time of $107.10 in May, capping off a stable rise of 23% over the past two years. The business has been growing like clockwork in recent years as the general US economy is recovering. Industrials like Honeywell usually benefit in a rising cycle as individuals and companies have more money to spend and invest.The company, known for technology and developing equipment and machinery in industries as far ranging as aerospace and healthcare, is into its next 5-year plan to 2018 to streamline operations and expand business in high growth regions around the world.Not only does Honeywell make the equipment, the company aspires to be the ""Apple of the industrial sector"" through design studios that work on improving the experience of customers and technicians who use and maintain the equipment. Of the 22,000 or so engineers Honeywell employs, about half of them are working on software development. This is because the software systems that drive the machinery now have to be robust and comprehensive in use.FinancialsFor investors considering Honeywell now as a possible investment, you'll want to know about the company's operating performance, how well profitable it is and how it plans to grow in the future.Since 2011, earnings growth returned following the GFC, and over the past four years reported GAAP EPS has more than doubled, growing at an average annual 19.7%. The company's past long-term earnings track record has been for low double-digit growth. Revenues are steady and trending upward, but Honeywell's focus on improving its business has led to a rise in profit margins that are now at levels higher than they were before 2008.The net income margin in fiscal 2014 was 10.5%, up from 5.6% only three years earlier. Return on equity, the ratio that basically measures the profitability versus the assets used to make the earnings, is consistently high in the low to mid-20s.One way Honeywell maintains that high ROE is by controlling debt. The business itself generates enough cash flow that Honeywell doesn't have to resort to borrowing huge sums of money to pay for its growing business.To illustrate that, just look at $6 billion in long-term debt the company had in 2014. That year Honeywell's annual net income was $4.2 billion and the company had $6.9 billion in cash and equivalents. Without even touching its cash, theoretically the company could pay off its debt in full in less than a year and a half with just its earnings. My guide is to look for companies that have less than five times their net income in long-term debt. Honeywell passes that easily.For yield investors, Honeywell is attractive for is steady dividend growth. Over the past decade, dividends have risen a compound average 9.5% and in recent years that trend has increased to around 11% annually. At that rate, the current dividend would double in about six and a half years. The company projects that over the next several years dividends will grow faster than earnings because the company will be paying out a gradually higher percentage of earnings.Share price and valuationsAs much as I may think the company is attractive, I also have to consider if the current share price is reasonable. Presently, the stock is about 5% down from the earlier high, but it may be an average pullback move. Because the company has a great amount of overseas business, its revenues are being negatively affected by FX impacts from the strong dollar. This could be a short-term situation, but the company is on operating well and on target for its five-year plan, so the stock story is good.The stock is trading at 16 times forward earnings, yet the company is expected to grow earnings in the high single digits to low double digits over the next several years. That's a trade-off of price to growth that I'd be happy with. Add to that the 2.03% dividend yield, and the price looks reasonable for me.I'd say that Honeywell is that kind of steady earner that most portfolios should have to help keep future returns stable."

This is viewed as a positive for GE relative to Honeywell.Investor sentiment is higher for Honeywell than for GE, per Yahoo Finance. A shift in investor or analyst sentiment could benefit GE.Honeywell analyst opinion.GE analyst opinion, below.GE is reducing debt, which should free up cash flow by way of lower interest payments. Over the past 15-years long-term debt growth at GE has been less than that of Honeywell.GE's earnings yield has generally trended higher since 2000 while the stock price has fallen 48% compared to Honeywell's gain of over 200%.The large difference in stock performance suggests to me that GE offers a more attractive risk-reward trade than Honeywell. For that reason, a paired trade of long GE and short Honeywell is the idea for the article competition.GE offers a higher dividend yield than Honeywell, providing investors with a greater cash income and ability to reduce risk (build cash balance) without selling the stock.GE Dividend Yield (TTM) data by YChartsThe paired trade is more of a long-term or macro call, based upon the deleveraging at GE. Honeywell is a very good firm, however based upon relative valuation metrics discussed above GE appears to the be cheaper of the two issues.According to the Finra website GE debt is rated AA+ and Honeywell debt is rated A by S&P. Therefore GE should enjoy a lower cost of debt financing. Given the outlook for stable to higher interest rates GE may enjoy a cost of funding advantage. Should debt continue to decline at GE and increase at Honeywell then the funding advantage may be more pronounced in GE's favor.Bottom-line, the recent relative under performance of GE combined with its deleveraging and sour investor / analyst sentiment leads to the conclusion that GE appears well suited to catch the market by surprise. A minor shift in the price earnings ratio could provide for a nice paired trade return.GE PE Ratio (TTM) data by YChartsWhat do you think?"
3173996,39011,2015-05-13T10:28:56-04:00,"HON has done an amazing job of growing earnings and the stock price has followed.The company has a strong commitment to returning cash to shareholders as well.HON's forward PE of ~15 is far too low for its robust EPS growth, and I think the market has it wrong.","Industrial giant Honeywell (NYSE:HON) has certainly been a case study for how to grow a large business. In the space of five years, the stock is up roughly 250% as the dividend has soared to keep pace. Further, similar stocks like General Electric (NYSE:GE) have made lots of noise in the news but produced far less in shareholder returns over the past decade. Honeywell is a great example of staying the course to produce great results, but with the stock rolling off a bit from its highs of late, is the run over? In this article, I'll take a look at Honeywell to see if the rally may be coming to an end, or if there may be more gains afoot.To do this, I'll use a DCF-type model you can read more about here. The model uses several inputs, including earnings estimates, which I've borrowed from Yahoo!; dividends, which I've estimated to grow at 13% annually; and a discount rate, which I've set at the 10-year Treasury rate plus a risk premium of 6.5%.We can see the current fair value from the model is four cents from the current price of the stock. That would imply that Honeywell is perfectly valued right now from an earnings perspective, but let's take a look at the fundamentals to see if there is more to this story.Honeywell reported earnings a few weeks ago and it was met by investors with a resounding thud. The stock was hammered and traded down to $100 before perking back up in recent trading sessions. But the reaction from investors seems to have been warranted; HON missed its revenue forecast for the quarter and - worst of all - cut its revenue guidance for the year by $1.5 billion. That isn't pretty but let's see what the rest of the quarter looked like, and how it fits into the investment case for Honeywell.Honeywell cut its sales guidance for this year by a pretty significant amount, but it also posted some great numbers during the quarter. All three of the company's segments posted very strong profit growth at 6% (Performance), 7% (Aerospace) and 10% (Automation). This despite all three segments posting declines in revenue of 5%, 6% and 3%, respectively. Honeywell has done a masterful job of boosting margins year after year and that is how all three segments show substantial revenue declines but increases in profits. This bodes very well for Honeywell going forward because it is wringing every dollar of operating profit it can from its revenue base, even as the revenue base contracts.Honeywell's guidance for the rest of 2015 was organic revenue growth of 3% but a reported sales decline of 2% to 3% due to the effects of currency fluctuations. While this is painful, it is also temporary as currency swings almost always are. The bigger picture here - and the longer term picture - is that Honeywell's business is very strong and caught up in a transitory storm that will pass one day. When that happens, we'll see Honeywell's revenue grow nicely once more.Management is also looking for ~9% growth in free cash flow; of paramount importance considering Honeywell's commitment to return cash to shareholders in a big way. The dividend is keeping pace with the stock and has the current yield at about 2%; not great but not too shabby either considering HON is also an earnings growth story and not just a dividend stock like so many other mega caps.When you put all of this together, you get a pretty compelling investment picture. I know my model said Honeywell is fully valued right now and perhaps it is, but with the prospect of higher capital returns and strong earnings growth, HON's forward PE of only 15.4 makes it a relative steal in the large cap dividend space. Other large industrials are trading for higher valuations, and in most cases, lower earnings growth. Examples include GE at 17.3 times forward earnings, Deere & Co. (NYSE:DE) at 17.3 and Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) at 18.6 just to name three. All of these companies represent stocks that have less attractive earnings growth outlooks but much higher valuations, and I cannot justify that given HON's fundamentals. Its commitment to taking care of shareholders and what I think are transitory headwinds to earnings make HON a long-term buy in my view, even if it is fully valued at $102 right now."
3219366,24903,2015-05-29T14:46:03-04:00,"I was the only respondent to pick Honeywell as the ""one company to own"" in a recent survey.Here is the thought process of the selection.A bird's eye look at Honeywell and what makes it a versatile, attractive investment going forward.","I was recently asked by Mike Nadel to take part in a panel survey of 15 Seeking Alpha contributors. In it, we were asked the following question:Mike's goal was to have us determine the ""best"" company as an investment. He provided us with no specific guidelines or parameters as to what ""best"" necessarily represented or how we should go about providing a response. Thus, we were all on our own to define the project.The ""challenge"" elicited 9 responses from the panel, with three stocks Coke (NYSE:KO), Realty Income (NYSE:O), and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) each receiving three ""top stock"" responses from panelists. Six others picked 6 disparate equities.Though I currently own three of the other stocks mentioned by panelists [JNJ, Disney (NYSE:DIS), and Kinder Morgan (NYSE:KMI)], JNJ was the only one I seriously contemplated. After some measured thought, however, I passed on JNJ and a few others, and settled on Honeywell (NYSE:HON).Some of you have messaged me inquiring more about why I selected the company. So here's more detail about my decision.The Thought ProcessI took Mike's request as an ""all eggs in one basket"" challenge. In other words, if I were forced to sell all my publicly traded equities today and rotate them to just one stock, which would it be?In my response to Mike, I wrote that in being forced to own only one company, the prudent investor should be cautious and measured in their approach. I wrote:While I believe there is upside potential of some sort in all the stocks that I own - otherwise I wouldn't own them - finding something that seemed better insulated than others became mission #1 for me. I quickly eliminated energy companies, REITs, technology companies with a narrow focus, and financials from my consideration.As I scanned my portfolio, I had actually considered two retailers, Home Depot (NYSE:HD) and Ross Stores (NASDAQ:ROST), whose business models and execution have made them stalwarts for me. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) made the short list, since its revenue streams over the past many years have made it much less dependent on Windows. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was a thought, but I considered its revenue dependency on the ""i-duo"" (Pad and Phone) a negative. Johnson & Johnson's diversity within healthcare also made it an attractive option. Ultimately, I decided to pass on all of them.Attracting Flies With HoneyWhen I started to look at what Honeywell, a stock I've owned for several years now, brought to the table, I began to think I had found what I was looking for. The breadth of industries it is exposed to and the slew of both consumer and enterprise products the company provides are impressive.This diversity of revenue with a technological backdrop, in my opinion, provides both earnings and dividend growth upside and better-than-average downside protection.While Honeywell has not been the best performer in my portfolio during the time I've held it, I consider it an extraordinarily strong ballast, with a rather attractive forward risk/reward profile. For those reasons, I chose it as my ""one to own.""Though the company has been exposed to oil price declines and forex headwinds, which have caused it to cut near-term revenue predictions, Honeywell has been focused on efficiency. Margins have been expanding, which should still enable it to meet double-digit EPS growth projections for this year.David Cote has emerged as a highly regarded CEO, and has verbally expressed his commitment to become the ""Apple of the industrial sector."" For those of you with further interest in the company, I think listening to Cote discuss Honeywell's 5-year plan is time well spent.Honeywell Chairman and CEO David CoteDividend & ValuationHoneywell isn't generally high on a dividend investor's list to own, since its current yield is only about 2 percent. But for those of you with a long-term time horizon, consider the fact that HON will only pay out about 33% of this year's EPS. Cote has stated that he wants the dividend to grow faster than earnings going forward. There appears a long and sustainable runway for total return in the years ahead.I think your total return, and ultimately your dividend income, will be greater by investing in a company like Honeywell at current levels than in one of the storied consumer product franchises (PG, KO, MCD, etc.). While I certainly don't consider HON cheap here, at 17X earnings you are buying better growth, lower payout, and better management than you can find in many of your popular dividend names.ConclusionThough Honeywell doesn't get as much attention as some of its peers, it is a key industrial player and innovator. It has doubled its dividend over the last 8 years, and looks well positioned to do that again going forward. While the company isn't generally synonymous with any business in particular, one of its systems, devices, or doohickeys is probably installed somewhere in your home, your car, or in a plane you've recently flown on.Honeywell's diversity and omnipresence presents attractive upside potential for both total return and dividend growth investors alike."
3082306,53422,2015-04-20T11:16:17-04:00,"Honeywell is off to a good start in 2015.Honeywell beat on earnings, but missed on revenues.Currency headwinds and sales headwinds make for a challenging operating environment.Nonetheless, Honeywell has grown its segment margin by 220bps year-over-year and remains cautiously optimistic about 2015.Honeywell has outperformed General Electric.","After banks started off the earnings season with solid numbers, it is now the turn for industrial businesses and conglomerates to show investors how the first quarter of fiscal 2015 went for them. General Electric (NYSE:GE) did actually a good job in the first quarter, though its results were negatively impacted by the proposed sale of most of GE Capital's assets and related exit charges. Besides that, General Electric felt continued headwinds from lower oil prices in its Oil & Gas business and, obviously, from a stronger U.S. Dollar.Since Honeywell (NYSE:HON) operates essentially the same business as General Electric, its first quarter results were also affected by currency movements and sales headwinds.For the first quarter of 2015, Honeywell said it pulled in $9.21 billion in revenues, which compares against $9.68 billion in the first quarter of last year; that's a decrease of 5%, even though Honeywell was able to grow sales 2% organically. The consensus estimate was for revenues of $9.57 billion.On an earnings basis, Honeywell earned $1.12 billion, 10% more than in 1Q 2014 when the company raked in $1.02 billion. On a per-share basis, Honeywell reported earnings of $1.41 vs. $1.28 in the year ago quarter. Polled analysts expected earnings per share of $1.39.It's not all badHoneywell had a challenging quarter and one has to look no further than to the 5% year-over-year sales decrease to see that. But despite those revenue headwinds, Honeywell made progress on the margin front, which is clearly a positive development worthy of recognition at a time when most investors are fretting about currency rates.Year-over-year, Honeywell improved its segment margin by 220bps to 18.7% thanks to a sensible and balanced strategy of continuously improving productivity, controlling costs, forex hedging, and price management.Source: Honeywell Investor PresentationWhat about oil prices?Obviously, the direction of oil prices is important for companies like Honeywell. Like I said in many other articles about domestic upstream companies depending on shale oil and gas exploration, oil prices might remain depressed in the short-term, but the industry as a whole is already cutting back dramatically in investment spending. This 'under-spending' on resource development in response to lower oil prices actually supports long-term prices.Oil prices will likely remain weak in the first half of 2015, because rig counts are still falling fast. I do expect a slow price recovery until year end, though; $70+ per barrel could be possible. For the time being, lower oil prices translate into sales headwinds that are projected to persist in 2015.Source: Honeywell Investor PresentationOutlookHoneywell's outlook for 2015 can be described as 'cautiously optimistic'. Obviously, the company expects the operating environment to remain challenging since it projects a total 2-3% sales decline on a full-year basis. Nonetheless, Honeywell is optimistic that it can squeeze out 8-11% EPS growth in 2015. According to Honeywell's latest investor presentation, the company also expects margins to grow throughout 2015.Source: Honeywell Investor Presentation12-months share performanceHoneywell has handsomely outperformed General Electric over the last twelve months, which goes to show that investors are slightly more hopeful about Honeywell. General Electric has made leeway after the company announced it would sell GE Capital earlier this month, but Honeywell is still the winner in a direct performance comparison.Honeywell has gained 9% in value over the last twelve months. General Electric, on the other hand, has returned just about 2%.Source: Yahoo FinanceYour TakeawayFrankly, neither the dollar strength nor the oil weakness are reasons to reject an otherwise profitable company that managed to grow its segment margin in a difficult market. Currencies are always volatile and move based on changing interest rates and differentials, changes in economic growth, inflation expectations etc. Though currency movements now define Honeywell's and General Electric's first quarter results and 2015 sales outlook, currencies are unlikely to be a permanent drag on Honeywell's sales and earnings."
3079606,54312,2015-04-18T12:10:49-04:00,Honeywell announced first quarter results.Currency headwinds impacted its sales performance.The company lowered its sales guidance but raised its earrings outlook.Its stock tumbled on the earnings announcement which is providing an attractive buying opportunity.,"Honeywell International Inc (NYSE:HON) announced first quarter results for fiscal 2015. This year is turning out to be more interesting than any recent one as several things are happening in the economic environment. Commodity prices are falling to historic lows and international markets are experiencing a depressed business environment along with the devaluation of currencies. These negative trends are almost impacting each industry and their financial performance. Honeywell also remained a victim of currency headwinds along with depressed growth in international markets. Its sales declined compared to the past year quarter while earnings per share increased on margin expansion.The company posted sales growth of 1% on an organic basis, but dragged 6% on a reported basis due to a stronger dollar and recent divestiture of Friction Materials. Currency fluctuation declined its sales by four points and exchange headwinds could trouble sales by $1.7B this year. On the other hand, Honeywell's strategy of investing in high-growth, high-margin businesses is working. The company's segment margin expanded by 220 bps and operating margin stood at 17.6% relative to 14.2% in the last year quarter. Thus, on negative revenue growth of 5%, its earnings per share enlarged 10% to $1.41 per share vs. $1.28 a share in the past year quarter.Honeywell gained almost 12% in the past 12 months and gained 6% in the last three months. It is a very strong performance to me from any multinational company in a depressed international environment along with currency fluctuations. In my recent articles, I consistently advised defensive investors to look at Honeywell international for safe dividend growth and steady price appreciation. Its healthy dividends, steady price appreciation and strong growth in earnings affirmed my opinion.However, its stock lost 2.11% on the latest trading session on concerns related to sales growth. In addition, the company lowered its sales forecast for the full year to a range of $39B-$39.6B from $40.5B-$41.1B. It is only currency headwinds that are creating pressure on its sales as the company is likely to generate core organic growth of around 3% from all major segments. On the other end, Honeywell has raised its earnings outlook to a range of $6.00-$6.15 from earlier guidance of $5.95-$6.15. In this situation, I strongly believe that Honeywell's share price will offer buying opportunities for the long-term defensive investors on concerns related to sales growth. Its stock came under pressure after Q1 results and I believe that it could remain volatile over the following few weeks on these concerns.In ConclusionThe IMF has lowered its global economic outlook twice in the past six months to 3.5%, compared with an earlier forecast of 3.8% due to slow growth in emerging and European markets. This prediction is clearly reflecting in the first quarter results of multinational companies including Honeywell. However, due to new product introductions and strong penetration in international markets, Honeywell is partially offsetting these trends. In addition, the second half of this year is expected to remain stable as commodity prices are gearing up on increasing demand from Asian and American markets. Moreover, after the Fed's recent announcement of an expected increase in interest rates, we can expect stability in the second half of this year.Thus, I'm not seeing any major risk that can hinder its long-term performance. In addition, Honeywell's strategy of investing in high-growth businesses is driving double-digit growth in earnings even on negative revenue growth. I strongly recommend defensive investors buy this stock on dips for big profits."
3097166,23471,2015-04-23T17:09:17-04:00,"HON is suitable for Enterprising Investors, but not Defensive Investors following the ModernGraham approach.According to the ModernGraham valuation model, the company is undervalued at the present time.The market is implying 5.83% in annual earnings growth over the next 7-10 years, which is significantly less than the growth the company has seen in recent years.","Honeywell International (NYSE:HON) has shown very strong earnings growth over the last several years, which will immediately intrigue many investors. However, Benjamin Graham, the father of value investing, taught that investors must take emotion out of the equation, as the most important aspect to consider is whether the company is trading at a discount relative to its intrinsic value. It is through a thorough fundamental analysis that the investor is able to make a determination about a potential investment's merits. Here is a look at how the company fares in the ModernGraham valuation model.The model is inspired by the teachings of Benjamin Graham and considers numerous metrics intended to help the investor reduce risk levels. The first part of the analysis is to determine whether the company is suitable for the very conservative Defensive Investor or the less conservative Enterprising Investor, who is willing to spend a greater amount of time conducting further research.In addition, Graham strongly suggested that investors avoid speculation to remove the subjective elements of emotion. This is best achieved by utilizing a systematic approach to analysis that will provide investors with a sense of how a specific company compares to another. By using the ModernGraham method, one can review a company's historical accomplishments and determine an intrinsic value that can be compared across industries.Defensive Investor - Must pass at least 6 of the following 7 tests: Score = 4/7Enterprising Investor - Must pass at least 4 of the following 5 tests or be suitable for a Defensive Investor: Score = 4/5Valuation SummaryKey Data:Balance Sheet - December 2014Earnings Per ShareEarnings Per Share - ModernGrahamDividend HistoryConclusionHoneywell International Inc. performs well in the ModernGraham model and is suitable for Enterprising Investors. The Defensive Investor is concerned with the low current ratio and high PEmg and PB ratios, while the Enterprising Investor is only initially concerned by the low current ratio. As a result, Enterprising Investors should feel very comfortable proceeding to the next part of the analysis, which is a determination of the company's intrinsic value.When it comes to valuation, it is critical to consider the company's earnings history. In this case, the company has grown its EPSmg (normalized earnings) from $2.68 in 2011 to an estimated $5.07 for 2015. This is a strong level of demonstrated growth, which is well above the market's implied estimate of 4.53% annual earnings growth over the next 7-10 years. The ModernGraham valuation model reduces the historical growth to a more conservative figure, assuming that some slowdown will occur, but still estimates a growth figure much higher than the market's implied rate. Therefore, the model returns an estimate of intrinsic value well above the current price, indicating the company is significantly undervalued at the present time."

(NYSE:HON) operates under 3 main segments: Aerospace, Automation and Control Solutions (ACS), and Performance Materials and Technologies (NYSE:PMT).We have HON projected to beat revenue estimates by $112 million and EPS by $0.02. Though forex issues persist, we expect the hit from international operations to be offset by margin expansion efforts, favorable international market data, and the HOS Goldsystem.Euro to US Dollar Exchange Rate data by YChartsAs is evident, the euro has yet to recover in the Q2 period, thus we expect unfavorable conversion rates to hurt the top-line. However, we see favorable international market data to offset forex headwinds.^ADR data by YChartsThis bounce back in international market data is present in Q2, and we believe is representative of great things for Honeywell. From 2002 to 2014, international markets have experienced 3x growth compared to domestic sales, per a Honeywell IR deck.Margin expansion efforts have been aided by the HOS Gold program. This program incorporates all segments of HON's business and how management is planning to become more efficient in those segments. The system sets goals, provides road maps for future growth, and ensures all cylinders are firing.As you can see, HON's management is extremely thorough and forward-looking. We believe that strong initiatives such as HOS Gold will aid top and bottom-line growth in this quarter and those to come.Above is a brief overview of growth catalysts HON will have in each of its segments. Honeywell's CEO Dave Cote's 5 year plan positions HON to be an extremely attractive investment opportunity as time goes on. We believe that Mr. Cote will be influential in the growth HON will have in the coming years, and that the highly diversified and improving portfolio HON has will aid top and bottom-line growth.Above is HON's historical Q2 revenues, and, as is evident, there is a sharp decline for this year's Q2 due to FX headwinds. We projected revenues in the product sales segment to decrease by 4% YoY and the service sales segment to decrease by 3%. While these figures are out of line with regards to historical growth, they are representative of the sort of FX headwinds HON has seen this year.Management's guidance for Q2 earnings can be found above, but we believe HON will be on the high end of this with -3.8% YoY revenue growth due to favorable international market data and the HOS Gold system, coupled with more favorable FX headwinds than previously thought.All of these assumptions lead us to modeling HON to beat on both the top and bottom lines in Q2."

The firm is poised to capture incremental demand related to the burgeoning aerospace build cycle, and the company's turbo business may have the best growth potential of any of its segments. But while we like Honeywell's fundamentals very much, the most important dynamic for an investor is whether a company's shares are trading at a bargain. For example, every company has an intrinsic value per share on the basis of its future forecasts of free cash flow, and every company has a share price. Comparing a company's intrinsic value per share to its share price reveals whether a firm is undervalued or overvalued. Let's do this for Honeywell in this piece.Honeywell's Investment ConsiderationsInvestment Highlights• We spend a lot of time talking about the quality of businesses in our research. We compare the ability of a company to generate business returns with the cost of the capital that it takes to attain those returns. Our measure of Honeywell's business quality ranks among the best of the firms in our coverage universe. The firm has been generating economic value for shareholders with relatively stable operating results for the past few years, a combination we view very positively. Honeywell is one of the top companies from a fundamental standpoint.• For those that may not be familiar with Honeywell, the company is a conglomerate operating in the following areas: aerospace, automation and controls solutions, performance materials and technologies, and transportations systems. Its aerospace products are used on virtually every aircraft, while its building solutions are in over 150 million homes.• There are two very important dynamics when it comes to valuation: free cash flow and the net balance sheet. Honeywell has an excellent combination of strong free cash flow generation and low financial leverage. We expect the firm's free cash flow margin to average about 12% in coming years. Total debt-to-EBITDA was 1.3 last year, while debt-to-book capitalization stood at 33%.• Honeywell is targeting a long-term compound annual sales growth rate of roughly 4%-6%, and it expects segment margins to continue to expand. Though we expect continued margin improvement, our forecast for sales expansion is slightly lower than management's goals. This is okay -- it just means that if management delivers on its targets, there is upside to our fair value estimate.• Honeywell is looking for segment margins north of 20% for each of its four segments. This is a great level of profitability for an industrial company that is exposed to input cost fluctuations and pricing pressures across the supply chain. Transportation Systems (turbo) is poised to grow the fastest and experience the largest margin potential. We're monitoring this segment closely.• CEO Dave Cote is among the most talented executives, and his focus on value-creation is sound. We expect the management team to be cautious with any acquisition strategy, a topic that has been in the news as of late.Business QualityEconomic Profit AnalysisThis is the most important part of any stock research analysis: does a company generate a return with shareholders' capital that is greater than the cost of which it takes to attain such capital? Economic profit analysis is not stock market return analysis, but a measure of the return that a business generates on its actual business, as measured by return on invested capital. We view stocks as pieces of businesses.In our view, the best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital with its weighted average cost of capital. The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. Honeywell's 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 35.3%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 10.2%. We assign the firm a ValueCreation rating of EXCELLENT as a result.In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate.Cash Flow AnalysisWe like talking about cash flows. After all, cash flows are what the firm generates, not earnings per share, which is but an accounting measure. Firms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. Honeywell's free cash flow margin has averaged about 8.6% during the past 3 years. We think the firm's cash flow generation is STRONG as a result.The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. At Honeywell, cash flow from operations increased about 45% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures expanded about 24% over the same time period.Valuation AnalysisValuation is where the rubber hits the road.Investors can talk all day about how much they like this or like that about a company, but at the end of the day, the intelligent investor must translate those views into a future free cash flow stream that rolls up into a fair value estimate. Our discounted cash flow model indicates that Honeywell's shares are worth between $79-$119 each. Since all intrinsic value is based on future free cash flows and the future has yet to be written, a range of probable fair value outcomes makes the most sense in value estimation.Honeywell is currently trading in the middle of the fair value range. This means we think the company is fairly valued at present. We'd love to be able to scoop up shares closer to the low end of its fair value range. Remember, as investors, we're after bargains -- not paying fair value for something. We want to get a deal for those future free cash flows!Our enterprise free cash flow model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 4.4% during the next five years, a pace that is higher than the firm's 3-year historical compound annual growth rate of 3.3%. Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 17.8%, which is above Honeywell's trailing 3-year average. Beyond year 5, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 2.9% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For Honeywell, we use a 10.2% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows.Margin of Safety AnalysisOnce investors accept the view that paying anything greater than one can receive in future cash flows for an investment is unreasonable, the fundamental basis for cash flow analysis is then accepted. Once one accepts the view that the future is all that matters and it has yet to be written, one must then accept the view that value, by definition, should be presented as a cash-flow derived range of fair value outcomes. Common sense is so important in any analytical process.Our discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $99 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future was known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values.The ValueRisk rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock. In the graph above, we show this probable range of fair values for Honeywell. We think the firm is attractive below $79 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $119 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion.As an investor, it's helpful to think in this framework, a range of probable fair value outcomes. Any research that says that a firm is worth precisely this or precisely that is precisely wrong. The future cash flows are what determines intrinsic worth, and the future, by definition, has yet to be written. A range-of-outcomes approach is most valid in thinking about intrinsic worth.As for Honeywell, we like the company a lot. But it's trading at a fair price today, meaning there's not much of an abnormal return that can be generated from here on out. We think there will be a better time to consider Honeywell...for new money.Pro Forma Financial Statements)"
2859616,24361,2015-01-29T15:30:37-05:00,"Despite worries about forex and falling oil prices, Honeywell's management isn't backing away from its goal of mid-single digit core growth.Honeywell's Aerospace business can leverage growing commercial aviation builds, while a recovery in non-residential construction should boost ACS in the coming years.Honeywell looks only a little bit undervalued on the basis of better than 7% long-term FCF growth, but acquisitions could add worthwhile upside.","Having recently written that I'd be willing to sell 3M (NYSE:MMM) in the face of its take-no-prisoners valuation if I could find a good enough replacement idea, Honeywell (NYSE:HON) seemed like a logical place to look. I'm happy with what I found, as Honeywell offers broad multi-industry exposure but has built itself with a ""be the best or be gone"" mentality. Honeywell is also pursuing some fairly ambitious (but reasonable) margin and ROIC improvement targets that could have it near the top of the list of its peers in three to five years' time.Now for the catch - investors aren't exactly getting a fallen angel or hidden gem here. Honeywell's quality and self-improvement plans are not secrets and even with some concerns about the company's exposure to falling oil prices, the shares aren't dirt cheap. Management could add value by a faster/better margin acceleration and/or by leveraging the balance sheet and acquiring more businesses. I haven't decided if I'm going to swap 3M for Honeywell, but Honeywell isn't a bad stock to consider in the industrials/conglomerate space.A Good Enough End To 2014Honeywell's fourth quarter earnings weren't a blockbuster, but management gave ample opportunity and information to steer the sell-side towards the number and minimize the surprises. Guidance and management's tone on the call sounded pretty bullish, with Honeywell looking like it's in pretty decent company going into 2015.Revenue was down 1% as reported, but up 4% in organic terms with all of the growth provided by volume. ACS was the growth leader (up 6% organic) and the largest contributor to revenue, with Aerospace just behind and posting 4% organic growth. PMT reported 3% organic growth for the quarter.Gross margin was down 40bp on a GAAP reported basis, but up about 110bp on an adjusted basis. Likewise, adjusted operating income rose 7% while segment profits fell 2% and came in about 1% below Street expectations.All things considered, investors should be happy with this outcome. With many companies reporting serious pressure from currency headwinds and several large industrials (like Dover (NYSE:DOV) and Emerson (NYSE:EMR)) at some risk due to lower oil prices, Honeywell's guidance looked pretty strong on a relative basis. Non-resi construction and retrofit could offer some upside next year, as could the often overlooked chemicals/specialty materials businesses.Aero Seems Like A Good Place … For NowAerospace can be a brutally cyclical business, but everything I've seen and heard from companies like General Electric (NYSE:GE), United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) and the actual builders of airplanes (Boeing (NYSE:BA), et al) suggests that the next few years should be good ones.Honeywell saw good growth in its commercial original equipment business this quarter (up 7% org), with stronger BGA engine shipments to Bombardier (OTCQX:BDRBF) and Embraer (NYSE:ERJ) making a strong contribution. While Honeywell has less potential per-aircraft content than United Technologies and is more focused on regional and business jets relative to the wide-body exposure of GE and UTX, Honeywell's broad exposure to avionics, auxiliary power, environmental controls, and other components should give it plenty of upside in this cycle.I'd also note the long-term opportunity of the turbo business (up 4% org this quarter) which is also included in the Aerospace segment. I like the long-term outlook for this business (likewise for BorgWarner (NYSE:BWA)) given global trends in emissions and fuel economy standards.Often Overlooked, Specialty Materials Can Be SpecialHoneywell's specialty chemicals and materials business is often overshadowed by its aerospace, automation, and building controls businesses, but this is a strong business in its own right. Refining catalysts make up a sizable part of the business, but the company is also leveraged to natural gas in electricity generation, performance fibers, and specialty products for the electronics industry.I'm also curious to see what will become of the Solstice product. Coming out of the fluorine business, this platform includes refrigerants, blowing agents, and propellants that are supposed to be more environmentally friendly but do not compromise performance. Not surprisingly, they cost more than existing products.Lower Oil Prices - Good, Bad, Or Just Noisy?Investors have been worrying for a few months about the potential impact of lower oil prices on Honeywell, particularly with headline exposure of 10-15%. Management has gone to some length to explain that the company's upstream exposure is modest (largely in the UOP and Process Solutions businesses) and offset by larger exposure to midstream and downstream segments that could actually benefit from lower oil prices. Likewise, management has argued that lower oil prices will be beneficial for business like aerospace (better profitability for airlines supporting the OE/aftermarket businesses), turbo (lower gas prices leading to better new car demand), and emerging markets (less money spent on oil/refined products means more money for other Honeywell products).I'm not necessarily convinced that it will be as smooth and easy as all that sounds, but I think the point stands that Honeywell's risk from lower oil prices is manageable. At least on a relative basis, I'd be more concerned about the impact of extended low oil prices on Dover and Emerson than I would be on Honeywell.Growth With Margin LeverageFrom a macro perspective, I see Honeywell as a play on increasing urbanization, growing civil aviation demand/traffic, and an increasing focus on energy efficiency. Coupled with increased visibility on monetizing past R&D investments in the PMT business, I like Honeywell's chances to hit the intermediate-term goal of 4% to 6% organic revenue growth and I'm using a long-term revenue growth target of just over 4%.I also am bullish on management's targets for improved operating performance, including a target OPM of 18% to 20% in 2018 (versus reported OPM of 14% in 2013 and 11% in 2012). Improved firm-wide productivity will be the cornerstone of the margin improvements, but I'm also looking for increased operating leverage from growing Aerospace deliveries and a non-resi construction recovery, as well as mix shifts into higher-margin software products in businesses like Aerospace and ACS (process solutions and building automation). I also expect more FCF leverage as the company has largely built the platform/infrastructure it needs for its businesses (including emerging markets like China and India) and won't likely need to spend as much on capex.Last and not least, M&A remains an outlier to my model and a potential source of significant growth. Management has talked of spending as much as $10 billion over the next three or four years and Honeywell has done a good job in the past of integrating deals and generating worthwhile rates of return from them.The Bottom LineI'm looking for Honeywell to generate better than 7% long-term FCF growth, which supports a fair value of about $106 today. With M&A as an ""X factor"", I think investors can buy these shares today with the expectation of favorable risk-adjusted returns over the long-term. Honeywell is too big to become a quick multi-bagger, but investors looking for a good long-term asset could certainly do worse than owning Honeywell."

        The company is now trading at an attractive valuation relative to its peers.
        Honeywell's free cash flow position is impressive, and in this regard I see further upside for the company.","Honeywell International (NYSE:HON), along with United Technologies Corporation (NYSE:UTX), BorgWarner (NYSE:BWA), and Johnson Controls (NYSE:JCI) are major engineering component suppliers to a range of industries such as the automotive and aerospace sectors. In the case of Honeywell, the company is a conglomerate which provides high technology systems and engineering services to consumers, companies and governments across a consortium of technologies. In this article, I wish to argue that while Honeywell has ceased to generate alpha returns over the past four year period, the company has built up attractive financials in terms of free cash flow along with trading at a reasonable valuation that the company could well produce alpha returns in the future.To provide some context, I use the Capital Asset Pricing Model to compare the four companies outlined in terms of alpha performance for a period of little to no growth in the S&P 500 Index (19th September 2008 to 18th November 2011) and a period of high growth in the S&P 500 (21st November 2011 to 28th January 2015).19th September 2008 to 18th November 2011Source: Author's Calculations21st November 2011 to 28th January 2015Source: Author's CalculationsFrom the above, we can see that while Honeywell and BorgWarner generated alpha returns for the first period, all four companies generated negative alpha returns for the last four-year period. However, a financial ratio analysis shows that Honeywell has since become quite attractive on a cash flow and relative valuation basis, and in this regard I see HON as having the potential to outperform its peers in the near future.Sources: Yahoo Finance and YChartsIn terms of both core profit margin and operating profit margin, HON has been among the best performers based on 2013 annual results. Additionally, the company has the highest total cash per share figure of the four companies. In terms of valuation, the company looks quite attractive from this standpoint:- Along with BorgWarner and United Technologies Corporation, Honeywell is trading at a reasonable P/E ratio, with all three companies trading below the industrials sector P/E ratio of 21.7x and the S&P 500 ratio of 24x.Source: YCharts- Additionally, Honeywell is trading at the lowest price to free cash flow ratio of the four companies:Source: YCharts- Finally, we can see that Honeywell has produced among the highest free cash flow per share, while still having the highest total cash per share compared to the other three companies.Source: YChartsIn conclusion, despite the non-generation of alpha returns since 2011, Honeywell has become increasingly attractive from a cash flow and valuation standpoint, and in this regard the company may have significant upside from a financial standpoint."

(NYSE:HON) announced fourth-quarter 2014 net income of $956 million or $1.20 per share, compared with $947 million or $1.19 per share in the year-ago quarter. Revenues for the quarter decreased 1.0 percent from the year-ago quarter to $10.26 billion due to lower product and service sales. HON's aerospace division sales decreased 6 percent from the year-ago quarter to $3.84 billion, with profits decreasing 14.0 percent to $663 million.  The company's automation and control solutions division sales increased 3.0 percent from the year-ago quarter to $3.84 billion, with profits increasing 8.0 percent to $613 million.  The performance materials and technologies division sales were flat from the year-ago quarter at $2.57 billion, with profits increasing 6.0 percent to $425 million.  HON reaffirmed their full-year 2015 guidance with expected sales in the range of $40.5 to $41.1 billion and earning per share in the range of $5.95 to $6.15. The company did indicate, however, they expected a challenging macro environment while delivering strong earnings growth in 2015. The company intends to continue investing in new products and technologies, and increase their focus in high-growth markets. The company believes their balanced portfolio mix of short- and long-cycle businesses are well positioned to deliver higher organic sales and continued margin expansion. The company's shares surged 3 percent upward on the day of their earnings announcement.In our previous article, we indicated that HON's investments for the future include innovative new products and technologies, and expansion geographically, all of which will position the company's business portfolio for continued growth. We noted further that the company's balanced portfolio mix of short- and long-cycle businesses, improving end markets, new product introductions, penetration in high-growth regions, and productivity focus will all continue to drive the company's outperformance over the long term. We pointed out that the company saw higher organic growth, margin expansion, and double-digit earnings growth in 2015. We emphasized that growth in the company is seen being driven by: 1) solid commercial aerospace original equipment manufacturing, aftermarket, and international defense growth with an offset by weak U.S. defense sales; 2) improving residential markets and acquisition growth; 3) a strong project backlog and new product introductions; and 4) increased turbocharger penetration and rising auto sales. We emphasized further that operating margins in 2015 were seen rising from volume and productivity improvements in all of the company's divisions leading to cost savings in excess of price inflation. We stated the company's long-term strategy is to continue to expand operations in less costly areas of the world, while reducing costs in more costly countries by closing plants, consolidating facilities, and implementing efficient manufacturing.HON's building environmental and combustion controls, and its turbocharger products businesses should continue to benefit from a strong global trend toward energy efficiency. The company's aerospace division should also continue to benefit from rising global aircraft fleet sizes, demand for better fuel economy, and aftermarket demand. Specialty chemical volumes will also continue to benefit from improving global demand for petroleum products. Further, the company's cost control efforts will continue to benefit HON's profit growth. The company's is also likely to increase their dividend over the next several years in line with earnings per share growth. Risks to the company's performance include a further weakening of the global economy, operational difficulties, and less than expected restructuring benefits. HON has reinvigorated their revenue and profit growth in recent years, and has a strong balance sheet that helps it generate substantial free cash flow so that the company retains flexibility to use such cash flow for internal growth, acquisitions, and stock repurchases. We see HON's recent successful execution of their strategy continuing. The current price-to-earnings ratio for HON shares is about 19.05, and the shares yield 2.1 percent. HON's forward price-to-earnings ratio is about 16.35 based on 2015 earnings estimates of $6.11 and about 15.15 based on 2016 earnings estimates of $6.77. HON's average price-to-earnings ratio in the previous 10 years is 16.00. We believe that a potential investor in HON shares should wait for HON's share price to pull back modestly to a range of about $92.00 to $98.00 to establish a full position (A forward price-to-earnings ratio in the range of 15.0 to 16.0 based on 2015 earnings estimate)."
2846216,67805,2015-01-23T18:57:00-05:00,"Fourth quarter EPS (excluding pension adjustments) of $1.43 beat analyst estimates by $.01.The adjustments made in the adjusted EPS were incredibly reasonable. I'm less enthusiastic about adjustments to sales and segment margins.Aerospace profits were down 14%, but Automation and Control was up 8%. Performance Materials was also up 8%.I've been bullish on Honeywell since I first covered the company. My stance is reaffirmed as the company delivered solid performance across most areas.","Honeywell (NYSE:HON) reported a solid fourth quarter. On an adjusted basis, the fourth quarter EPS just barely beat analyst estimates. The GAAP statements are less appealing, but still tell the tale of a profitable company. Under GAAP, the EPS for the quarter was $1.20, up from $1.19 year over year. On an adjusted basis, EPS of $1.43 was up from $1.24 year over year. Frequently, I spot poor quality adjustments to EPS as companies attempt to add back real costs like stock-based compensation. In the case of Honeywell, the adjustments were simply adding back to the mark-to-market loss on its net pension position.On the other hand, revenues of $10.26 billion were down 1.3% year over year but beat analyst estimates by $50 million. In the case of Honeywell, that's a rounding error. Segment margins, a major factor for the company, were down .20% in the fourth quarter year over year. For the fiscal year, the segment margins were up by .30%. Management also provides values excluding the impact of OEM incentives used to move merchandise, but I'm disregarding those values because I believe GAAP does a solid job of recognizing the cost of the incentives. This article discusses non-GAAP metrics. Investors should be aware that non-GAAP metrics should not be used as a replacement for metrics computed in accordance with GAAP.The challenging area for the company in the fourth quarter was the Aerospace segment. This segment is one of the reasons I've been bullish on the company. In the quarter, revenues for Aerospace were down by 6% and the segment profit was down by 14% as the segment margin shrank from 18.9% to 17.3% year over year. If Honeywell can recover the sales to this division, it would give the company substantial room to grow. The Automation and Control Solutions segment sales up 3% and profits up 8%, with margins improving from 15.2% to 15.9%. The segment doing the best job of cutting its costs was the Performance Materials segment, where flat revenues still saw a 6% increase in profits as segment margins went from 15.6% to 16.5%.I consider the results fairly bullish as the company was able to grow margins despite seeing weaker sales on the segment with the best margins. Because the Aerospace margins are particularly susceptible to changes in revenues, I'm looking for the company to see continued margin improvement when the Aerospace segment gets back on track. In my original article, I noted that management's plans for the company were very bullish. During the earnings release, management reaffirmed guidance for 2015."
2853576,53422,2015-01-27T10:26:38-05:00,"Honeywell reported decent fourth quarter results, but they were affected by pension costs.Earnings and margin growth outlook for conglomerates remains bright as long as the economy grows above trend line.Honeywell has outperformed General Electric over the last five years, but has become expensive.I think General Electric offers investors comparatively better valuation growth prospects.","Honeywell International (NYSE:HON) reported fourth quarter earnings on Friday, which beat analyst expectations by a penny. Honeywell actually has been a good investment and delivered strong shareholder returns over the last five years, and I will readily admit that I got Honeywell wrong in the past. In fact, Honeywell has significantly outperformed General Electric (NYSE:GE) over multiple performance measurement periods, which is something I didn't expect at all (I am Long General Electric).Over the last five years, Honeywell has returned 165% to shareholders, whereas General Electric's 52% return over the same period looks rather meager.Source: Yahoo FinanceFourth quarter takeawayHoneywell's fourth quarter results were impacted by higher pension costs. Honeywell reported earnings per share of $1.20 in the most recent quarter, which compares against an EPS of $1.19 in the year-ago quarter. If results are adjusted for one-time effects, such as pension expenses, Honeywell's adjusted EPS rises $0.23 per share to $1.43. This adjusted EPS compares against $1.24 of adjusted earnings per share in the year-ago quarter, and against a consensus 4Q 2014 earnings estimate of $1.42 per share.Honeywell's net sales fell 1% year over year to $10.3 billion thanks to a softer performance in Honeywell's crucial Aerospace segment. Aerospace revenues declined 6% year over year to $3.8 billion and segment profits remained under pressure.Source: Honeywell Earnings Release PresentationIn fairness, Honeywell should not be judged merely on the results in one segment. Overall, results were good: Its adjusted operating income margin expanded 110bps to 14.5%, adjusted earnings per share grew 15%, and free cash increased 6%.What's way more important than actual results, though, is the earnings outlook that gives investors vital clues about whether Honeywell can grow into its already rich valuation.If you ask Honeywell's Chief Executive Officer Dave Cote, the growth outlook for industrial conglomerates is really good. Reason for this is the falling crude oil price, a theme that I also picked up in my recent evaluation of General Electric's fourth quarter results. Lower crude oil prices have the potential of providing huge tailwinds to consumer and business spending, which in turn should help Honeywell's and General Electric's earnings.Outlook and valuationHoneywell has guided for full-year 2015 revenues of $40.5-41.1 billion with adjusted earnings expected to come in somewhere between $5.95-6.15 per share, and free cash flows targeted to touch a midpoint of $4.25 billion. Should Honeywell hit the midpoint of earnings and free cash flow estimates in 2015, investors are looking at a forward P/E ratio of 17x and a P/FCF ratio of 19x, which is not exactly cheap.Source: Honeywell Fourth Quarter Earnings PresentationGeneral Electric, on the other hand, is valued at 14x forward earnings and 17.5x estimated 2015 FCF, and I don't think Honeywell will be able to consistently outperform General Electric by a wide margin in terms of earnings and margin growth.I have an optimistic earnings outlook for companies over the next few years and I expect good shareholder returns from equities. Honeywell and General Electric have the potential to surprise investors in terms of earnings growth in the near future. Since General Electric is much more attractively valued than Honeywell, I believe capital growth prospects favor an investment in General Electric over an investment in Honeywell. My investment thesis with respect to General Electric can be found here.Bottom LineHoneywell's results were solid, but not overly exciting. The outlook for Honeywell is pretty good, assuming that the economy grows above trend for the foreseeable future, but that's true for most companies right now. Since General Electric also presented good business results last week and could be more aggressive this year in the challenging Oil & Gas business, the company is an attractive alternative to Honeywell. Because General Electric has underperformed Honeywell in the past, I believe General Electric is the more promising bet on capital growth."

The company has multiple operating divisions that include aerospace that manufactures products for commercial and military aircraft. This division also provides global aircraft maintenance and produces space products and systems, including guidance and control systems and gyroscopes; the automation and control solutions division that manufactures environmental and combustion controls, sensing controls, security and life safety products and services, scanning and mobility products, process automation products and solutions, and building solutions and services; and 3) the performance materials and technology division that makes specialty chemicals and fibers. The company sells such industrial materials primarily to the petrochemical, food, pharmaceutical and electronic packaging industries; and the transportation systems division that makes turbochargers for gasoline and diesel engines. In late 2014, the company reduced the number of divisions it operates from four to three by combining two of the above divisions.Third quarter earningsIn the latest earnings report, HON reported earnings of $1.47 per share, a 19 percent increase from $1.24 per share the year-ago quarter. The company's revenues for the quarter increased 5.0 percent from the year-ago quarter to $10.08 billion. The company's performance-aerospace division sales were flat from the year-ago quarter at $3.89 billion due to the company's friction materials business divestiture, but profit for the division increased 8.0 percent from the year-ago quarter to $790 million. The company's automation and control solutions division sales increased 9.0 percent from the year-ago quarter to $3.67 billion, and profit for the division increased 11.0 percent to $583 million.  The company's performance materials and technologies division sales increased 7.0 percent to $2.54 billion, and profit increased 8.0 percent to $444 million.In December 2014, updated investors with respect to revenue and earnings guidance by stating that they expected 2015 to be another strong year for HON with growth in sales, margin, earnings per share, and free cash flow.

The company acknowledged that its investments for the future, including innovating new products and technologies and expanding geographically, all of which would position its business portfolio for continued growth. In addition, HON noted that its balanced portfolio mix of short- and long-cycle businesses, improving end markets, new product introductions, penetration in high-growth regions, and productivity focus would all continue to drive the company's outperformance over the long term. HON plans to show higher organic growth, margin expansion, and double-digit earnings growth in 2015.Our viewHON's building environmental and combustion controls, and its turbocharger products businesses should benefit from a strong global trend toward energy efficiency. The company's aerospace division should also benefit from rising global aircraft fleet sizes, demand for better fuel economy and aftermarket demand. Specialty chemical volumes will benefit from improving global demand for petroleum products. In addition, the company's cost control efforts will benefit HON's profit growth.

Honeywell generated sales of $40.3B and earnings per share came in at $5.56 per share for fiscal 2014. With the growth in earnings, its free cash flows increased by 6% to $1.3B compared to the last year of $1.2B.In my recent articles, I recommended investors to buy this stock at any attractive price for safe dividends and steady price appreciation. In addition, I predicted that the company was set to generate double-digit growth in earnings. Its recent results affirmed my prediction and the company's rosy outlook makes it a safe investment for defensive investors. With both short and long cycle business and continued investment on its products and technologies, the company has predicted to keep its momentum of double-digit growth in earnings in this year.Honeywell is a diversified industrial company, which serves customers with aerospace products & services, sensing, control and technologies for buildings, turbochargers, automotive products and chemicals. At present, industrial business are moving on momentum with the growth in the economic environment. In addition, the company's focus on improving end markets, new product introductions and penetration in high-growth regions will lead it to effectively accomplish its aim of generating double-digit growth in earnings.Its dividend growth is also sustainable with the growth in earnings and free cash flows. Recently, the company announced a 15% increase in its quarterly dividends and I am expecting similar increase in dividends by the end of this year. Strong financial performance and safe dividends will drive its share price performance in the coming days. Hence, I believe that Honeywell is a good stock to hold for defensive investors."

During the quarter, revenues from the sale of products decreased 1.4% to $8,185 million and revenues from the sale of services decreased 0.1% to $2,081 million, as revenues increased in two of its three major segments. Here's a breakdown of Honeywell's revenues and revenue growth by segment (in millions):Honeywell's operating income decreased 7.3% to $1,240 million in the fourth quarter and its operating margin took a slight hit, contracting 80 basis points to 12.1%; these weak results can be attributed to costs of services rendered and selling, general, and administrative expenses increasing 2.2% and 1.5%, respectively, all while the company's revenues declined. However, excluding pension related expenses, Honeywell's operating income increased 7.3% to $1,489 million and its operating margin showed strength, expanding 110 basis points to 14.5%.For the quarter, Honeywell generated $1,762 million in cash provided by operating activities and it invested just $414 million in capital expenditures, resulting in a bountiful $1,348 million of free cash flow. The company utilized its free cash, and the $6,428 million in cash and cash equivalents on its balance sheet to begin the quarter, to pay out approximately $409 million in dividends and repurchase approximately $235 million worth of its common stock. Honeywell ended the quarter with $6,959 million in cash and cash equivalents, so it is well positioned to accelerate repurchases and raise its dividend in fiscal 2015.Lastly, Honeywell provided its outlook on fiscal 2015, calling for the following performance compared to fiscal 2014:Should You Be A Buyer Of Honeywell Today?Honeywell is one of the world's largest companies and a crucial provider of products and services to numerous industries, and it just released solid fourth quarter results; the company reported a 15.3% increase in earnings per share and a 1.2% decrease in revenue, both of which came in better than analysts had expected, while generating $1.35 billion in free cash flow and returning $644 million to shareholders, and its stock has responded accordingly by rising over 1%.Even after the slight post-earnings pop in Honeywell's stock, I think it represents a great long-term investment opportunity, because it trades at positive forward valuations; here's a chart of the company's average earnings per share outlook on fiscal 2015 and analysts' earnings per share expectations for fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017, and its stock's price-to-earnings multiple based on these estimates:As the chart above shows, Honeywell's stock trades at less than 17 times fiscal 2015's, 2016's, and 2017's earnings per share estimates, all of which are very inexpensive compared to its five-year average price-to-earnings multiple of 19.0. Furthermore, Honeywell has shown a strong dedication to maximizing shareholder value, and this is supported by the fact that it has increased its dividend five times in the last four years, with the most recent increase coming on October 31, 2014, and by its consistent share repurchase activity. Following the recent increase, the company now pays an annual dividend of $2.07 per share, giving its stock a very healthy 2.05% yield at current levels and making it both a value and dividend play.With all of this information in mind, I think Honeywell represents a great long-term investment opportunity, so investors should consider initiating positions today, and adding to them on any weakness provided by the market in the weeks ahead."

Guidance was in-line, but CEO David Cote was upbeat and said this is not a bad sign. Cote said he foresaw the weakness in Europe and planned accordingly. Cote said the company is going to be affected by cheap oil, but this may be offset by its exposure to refined products. Cote said he is considering M&A, the company has done 80 acquisitions in the last decade and has a ""rigorous process"" for buying companies. Cote thinks the economy will be strong for some time since the real recovery hasn't happened yet.Are Things Really So Bad? PetSmart (NASDAQ:PETM), Riverbed (NASDAQ:RVBD), Cirrus Logic (NASDAQ:CRUS), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Bob Evans (NASDAQ:BOBE), Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), Whole Foods (WFM), Marriott (NASDAQ:MAR). Other stocks mentioned: Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), Zoetis (NYSE:ZTS)With the Dow falling 100 points, Cramer asked if things are really so bad? If things are so bad, why is PetSmart (PETM) being taken over on a premium and is one of the best deals of the year? The company had slowing same store sales and faced multiple downgrades. However, the company made a smart acquisition and caught a bid. Riverbed Technology (RVBD) is a ""down and out networker"" and is being taken private. The space is so crowded, but the buyers paid up for it. Cirrus Logic (CRUS) got an upgrade, and analysts talked about iPhone shortages, which is good for Apple (AAPL). Bob Evans (BOBE) soared on news that its CEO Steve Davis is departing, and the company might break up. Twitter (TWTR) has received some praise from analysts, even though the company has been challenged lately. Whole Foods (WFM) is likely to have an upside surprise despite competition. Marriott (MAR) also received an upgrade. Things are not as bad as the averages seem to be saying.Cramer took some calls:Alibaba (BABA) had too much hype going into Singles Day, and that was the peak. There is a Chinese slowdown as well. Alibaba is resting here.Zoetis (ZTS) was up on a spike because of Bill Ackman's taking a stake. That was a good time to take some profits.CEO Interview: Klaus Kleinfeld, Alcoa (NYSE:AA)Alcoa (AA) provides an accurate read on the global economy. Management has announced the acquisition of German-based Tital. The latter provides materials for lighter weight aluminum, has exposure to aerospace, and its products are proprietary. This is the second acquisition this year, but the company is also growing organically. Alcoa is closing non-productive plants. CEO Klaus Kleinfeld is dedicated to making Alcoa a low-cost producer of proprietary aluminum. 3D printing is creating value for the company in cutting down the time and cost of making prototypes.When Will the Oil Madness End? Stocks mentioned: Chesapeake (CHK), Apache (NASDAQ:APA)Cramer said it would make as much sense for the S&P 500 to go higher on cheap oil than lower, as it has been lately. Cheap oil is like a tax break and stimulus for the consumer. Most of the companies in the S&P 500 benefit from lower oil, even as oil producers will be hurt. The madness might end when stocks are so low that they aren't even impacted by oil. Then there may be a bottom.Cramer took some calls:Chesapeake Energy (CKE): Has too much debt not to be hurt.Apache (APA): ""Made some good moves that raised cash. It is not a buy yet.""CEO Interview: Burton Goldfield, TriNet (NYSE:TNET)TriNet (TNET) came public in late March and surged 19% the first day. The human resources outsourcing play has given a 37% gain since Cramer spoke with CEO Burton Goldfield in May. TriNet helps companies outsource human resources paperwork and helps clients save money on benefits packages. ""I am seeing more energy and vibrancy around small businesses than I have ever seen before."" Small business owners are motivated ""to get things done."" The hospitality industry is ""booming."" The company provides human resources services for 10,000 companies in the U.S. Around 50% of TriNet's business comes from referrals. As regulations get more complex, TriNet's services see greater demand.::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::Jim Cramer’s Action Alerts PLUS: Check out Cramer’s multi-million dollar charitable trust portfolio and uncover the stocks he thinks could be HUGE winners.

It is being speculated that the aircraft industry and ancillary equipment makers are set to explode this year, putting Honeywell International in a good position for growth.Earlier in 2014, Honeywell came up with a growth strategy plan of spending $10 billion on acquisitions in high growth areas over the next five years.Chief Executive Officer Dave Cote said of the strategy, ""Our expansion in key high-growth regions and ability to localize our capabilities is another great example of how we'll drive accelerated growth over the next five years.""In December, Honeywell maintained its forecast of $1.37 to $1.42 earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2014. On the other hand, the company decreased its revenue outlook for the quarter to between $10.1 billion to $10.2 billion, a drop from the prior outlook of $10.3 billion to $10.4 billion.On December 31st, Jefferies analyst Howard Rubel maintained a Buy rating on Honeywell and raised his price target from $105 to $115. He noted,In the past year, Rubel has successfully made 39 ratings out of 48 total, earning an 81% success rate recommending stocks and a +16.7% average return per recommendation.Honeywell was also rated on December 16th by William Blair analyst Nicholas Heymann, who reiterated a Market Perform rating and a $104 price target.

2758095,54312,2014-12-16T02:08:12-05:00,Honeywell announced earnings guidance.The company is on plan to achieve its strategic and financial goals.Honeywell continues to be a defensive investment.,"Honeywell International Inc. (NYSE:HON) has announced its earnings guidance for the final quarter and for the following year. The company is adhering to a business plan for generating double-digit growth in earnings. Based on the latest earnings guidance, Honeywell will continue to post double-digit growth in earnings. Although the company has forecasted lower sales for the final quarter, full-year earnings per share will be on target to achieve the earlier estimate of $5.50-$5.55. In addition, Honeywell is citing organic sales growth of 4%, EPS between $5.95-$6.15, and free cash flow of $4.2-$4.3B for the next year.At the end of first half of 2014, I recommended defensive investors to buy and hold this stock for safe returns. I had predicted that its business model, which includes a portfolio of short and long-cycle businesses, will allow it to sustain its profitability. In addition, its emphases on new product introductions, improving end markets, penetration in high-growth regions and productivity gains will lead it to successfully achieve its goal of generating double-digit growth in earnings. And, in the third quarter of this year, the company had practically showed that it is heading in the right direction by posting 5% growth in sales and around 19% growth in earnings per share.In addition, Honeywell has been continually making innovative launches over the years. Recently, it has announced the new Gulfstream 500- and 600-series planes as well as number of other innovative technologies, including bombardier business aircraft in 2015, synthetic vision, traffic and 3D airport maps, wireless connectivity and cockpit avionics. In addition, Honeywell's scanning and Mobility businesses also have momentum and the company is planning to deploy over 75,000 units of its next-generation mobile delivery device by the end of this year.Honeywell's latest earnings guidance affirmed my opinion. I still believe that Honeywell is a good stock for defensive investors. Its dividends are completely safe as the company is predicting to generate $4.3B in free cash flows, when dividend payments are expected to be at $1.5B for 2015. We can also expect considerable increase in its dividends in the coming days as free cash flows are offering a considerable room for the potential increase.Honeywell's share price surged significantly after it announced third-quarter results and reached the 52-week high of $100/share. However, concerns related to the slight drop in the fourth quarter sales slowed its momentum. I believe that the existing selloff will be very short-term and that it provides a buying opportunity as Honeywell is primed to achieve its earnings guidance."

The main components of guidance include:Chairman and CEO Dave Cote commented:In my previous article I had written that consensus EPS for 2015 was $6.10, which is within the current guidance range. HON's annual dividend was recently increased to $2.07, which based on 2015 guidance represents a payout ratio of 34% of net income and 38% of free cash flow. This reaffirms my thesis that dividend growth going forward will be driven to two key factors: EPS growth and a potential increase in the payout ratio.The payout ratio for 2015 looks very conservative, and EPS is growing an attractive 9%. On this basis, I am still maintaining my dividend target for 2018 of $2.89/share, an increase of 40% over the current (increased) dividend."

At the current payout ratio of 35%, the annual dividend in 2018 could be at least $2.89, which represents an increase of 40% from the new annual dividend of $2.07. The quote from Dave Cote above suggests the dividend could grow at an even faster rate than EPS, and hence I am even more bullish now on Honeywell's dividend thesis."

Honeywell was incorporated in Delaware in 1985.Source: JPMorgan Aviation Transportation and Industrials Conference PresentationValuation MetricsThe table below presents the valuation metrics of HON, the data were taken from Yahoo Finance and finviz.com.Honeywell's valuation metrics are pretty good; the enterprise value-to-revenue ratio is at 1.88 and the enterprise value-to-EBITDA ratio is low at 11.08. The average annual earnings growth estimates for the next five years is high at 10.30%, and the PEG ratio is at 1.70.Latest Quarter ResultsOn October 17, Honeywell reported its third-quarter 2014 financial results, which beat EPS expectations by $0.06 (4.26%), and beat Street's consensus on revenues.Source: Q3 2014 Honeywell Earnings Conference Call PresentationIn the report, Honeywell Chairman and CEO Dave Cote said:Dividend and Share RepurchaseOn October 31, Honeywell announced that its Board of Directors has approved a 15 percent increase in the company's regular annual cash dividend rate (from $1.80 to $2.07 per common share). The increased regular quarterly dividend will be effective starting with the fourth quarter dividend, which was declared on that day and is payable on December 10, 2014 to shareowners of record at the close of business on November 20, 2014.Honeywell has been paying uninterrupted dividends since 1970. The forward annual dividend yield is at 2.13% and the payout ratio only 33.3%. The annual rate of dividend growth over the past three years was high at 11.6%, over the past five years was at 8.8%, and over the past ten years was also high at 8.4%. I consider that besides dividend yield, the consistency and the rate of raising dividend payments are the most crucial factors for dividend-seeking investors, and HON's performance has been very good in this respect.HON Dividend data by YChartsSince the company generates lots of cash, and the payout ratio is low, there is a good chance that the company will continue to raise its dividend payment.The company did not repurchase shares in the third quarter. It has a $5 billion repurchase plan, authorized in December of 2013, though there is no specific schedule for repurchases.Competitors and Group ComparisonA comparison of key fundamental data between Honeywell and its main competitors is shown in the table below.Source: Yahoo Finance, finviz.comThere is not a big difference between HON's valuation metrics and those of its competitors.HON's Return on Capital parameters have been much better than its industry median, its sector median and the S&P 500 median, as shown in the table below.Source: Portfolio123RankingAccording to Portfolio123's ""All-Stars: Lynch"" ranking system, HON's stock is ranked fifth among all S&P 500 stocks yielding more than 2.0%; only QUALCOMM (NASDAQ:QCOM), Helmerich & Payne (NYSE:HP), Valero Energy (NYSE:VLO) and ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) are ranked higher, (see my articles about QCOM and VLO). The ranking system is based on investing principles of the well-known investor Peter Lynch.The ""All-Stars: Lynch"" ranking system is quite complex, and it is taking into account many factors like; trailing P/E, relative P/E, PEG ratio, institutional ownership, liabilities, sales growth and EPS growth, as shown in Portfolio123's chart below.Back-testing over fifteen years has proved that this ranking system is very useful. The reader can find the back-testing results of this ranking system in this article.Technical AnalysisThe charts below give some technical analysis information.Chart: finviz.comThe HON stock price is 2.30% above its 20-day simple moving average, 3.98% above its 50-day simple moving average and 4.40% above its 200-day simple moving average. That indicates a short-term and a mid-term uptrend.Chart: TradeStation Group, Inc.The weekly MACD histogram, a particularly valuable indicator by technicians, is at 0.19 and ascending, which is a bullish signal (a rising MACD histogram and crossing the zero line from below is considered an extremely bullish signal). The RSI oscillator is at 57.56 which does not indicate oversold or overbought conditions.Analyst OpinionAnalysts opinion is divided, but most analysts recommend the stock. Among the twenty-one analysts covering the stock, six rate it as a Strong Buy, eleven rate it as a Buy and four rate it as a Hold.TipRanks is a website that ranks experts (analysts and bloggers) according to their performance. According to TipRanks, among the analysts covering HON stock there are only three analysts who have the four or five star rating, all of them recommend the stock.Source: TipRanksIs HON's performance improving?In order to give an answer to this question, I compared HON's latest trailing 12 months' values of six relevant parameters to their previous trailing 12 months' values and to the five years' average values. The results are shown in the table below; the data were taken from Portfolio123.All trailing 12 month values of the Margins parameters and the Return on Capital parameters were above the previous 12 month values, and above the five years' average.In my opinion, these results demonstrate significant improvement in the profitability of the company.Major DevelopmentsIn its latest earnings release, the company raised the low-end of its 2014 proforma EPS outlook by $0.05 to $5.50-5.55 (up 11%-12%), which brings it to the high-end of the initial guidance it provided almost a year ago.CEO Dave Cote said:Looking ahead to 2015, we're once again planning for a slow growth macro environment, but expect to continue delivering strong earnings growth. We're confident that Honeywell will continue to outperform now and over the long-term driven by a relentless focus on new products and technologies, continued penetration of high-growth regions, and sustained implementation of our key process initiatives.Honeywell has shown significant earnings per share surprise in the last four quarters, as shown in the table below.Data: Yahoo Finance - Analyst EstimatesIn my opinion, the fact that the company has succeeded to beat analyst expectations quarter after quarter by a considerable margin, demonstrates the strength of its business. Hence, there is a good chance that Honeywell will continue to surprise by reporting better than estimate results also in the future.Going ForwardFor 2015, Honeywell sees modest sales but strong earnings growth. According to the company, commercial and industrial activities are improving, while residential activity is stable.Honeywell is on track to its ambitious 5-year targets, the company is targeting double-digit earnings growth, by continuing its 4-6% CAGR organic sales growth.Source: Goldman Sachs Industrials Conference PresentationIn my view, Honeywell will succeed in its plan to generate double-digit earnings growth over the next years. The company will continue to benefit from its diverse product lines and its strong presence in the commercial aerospace market. Its fast-growing Turbo motors segment also looks to benefit from increasing demand for fuel efficiency.The company continues to return value to its shareholder through dividend payments and stock buybacks, and it plans to use about half of cash from operations for dividends and to fund enough stock buybacks to keep shares outstanding flat. The other half of cash from operations will fund capital expenditures and acquisitions. In contrast to other diversified Industrial companies whose financial results have fallen victim to weakness in select international end-markets over the last year, Honeywell has succeeded to produce record operating margins and double-digit earnings growth amid difficult macroeconomic conditions.RiskAccording to Honeywell, the operating results of its segments are impacted by general global industry and economic conditions that can cause changes in spending and capital investment patterns, demand for its products and services and the level of its manufacturing and shipping costs. In addition, an increasing percentage of its sales and operations is in non-U.S. jurisdictions and is subject to the economic, political, regulatory and other risks of international operations.ConclusionHoneywell has good valuation metrics and strong earnings growth prospects. The company has shown considerable earnings per share surprise in the last four quarters, and it demonstrated significant improvement in its profitability. Honeywell has recorded very strong EPS growth, and it has strong earnings growth prospects. Furthermore, the company had put a target of strong organic revenue growth for the next five years. In my opinion, Honeywell will benefit from a strong global trend toward energy efficiency and from the increasing demand for better fuel economy. All these factors lead me to the conclusion that HON stock is a smart investment right now. Furthermore, the rich growing dividend represents a gratifying income."
2620315,70065,2014-10-30T17:17:19-04:00,Honeywell has increased dividends per share by 50% since 2010.The company has a very low payout ratio of 35% and plenty of room to increase it.Consensus EPS estimates for 2018 imply that HON could increase its dividend significantly by then.,"(Image Source)IntroductionHoneywell International (NYSE:HON) is a global diversified technology and manufacturing company that operates 4 main segments: (1) Aerospace (engines, power units, and engine controls), (2) Automation and Control Solutions (environmental and combustion controls, and sensing controls), (3) Performance Materials and Technologies (chemicals, hydrofluoric acid, and nuclear services) (4) Transportation Systems (charge-air systems and thermal systems for vehicles).In this article, I will analyze Honeywell's dividend for income-oriented investors who are looking for growth in dividends per share over the long run. HON has a strong track record of growing dividends, and the future looks even better. Honeywell has two key levers it can pull going forward: significant EPS growth and raising the payout ratio. I will examine two different scenarios that could result in approximately 60% to 100% increases in dividends per share by 2018.Historical PerformanceHoneywell's strong share price performance over the past 5 years has driven the dividend yield down to 1.9% from over 3% in 2010. Though down from the highs, HON's current dividend represents an attractive and stable income source while still providing significant opportunity for long-term growth through future increases.HON Dividend Yield (TTM) data by YChartsDividends per share have grown 50% since 2010 and stand at $0.45, currently up from $0.30 in 2010. This represents a CAGR of ~10%. While dividend growth on an absolute basis has been very strong, share price performance has been even stronger, and hence the yield has declined.HON Dividend Per Share (Quarterly) data by YChartsDespite significant dividend increases over the last 5 years, Honeywell's payout ratio has declined from about 58% in 2010 to about 34% currently. This is the result of EPS growth outpacing dividend increases. Based on consensus analyst estimates, the Street expects to see significant EPS growth over the next few years, with EPS reaching $8.25 by 2018.HON Payout Ratio (TTM) data by YChartsSo far we have examined the strength of Honeywell's dividend on a accounting basis (payout ratio is relative to EPS), but it is also prudent to examine it on a cash flow basis as well. Relative to free cash flow, we see a very similar story as with the EPS payout ratio. The annual dividend is currently $1.80/share, which equates to a payout ratio of 38% relative to free cash flow per share of $4.84.HON Free Cash Flow Per Share (TTM) data by YChartsDividend Growth Drivers Going ForwardDividend growth going forward will be driven to two key factors: EPS growth and a potential increase in the payout ratio. Consensus EPS estimates from Capital IQ are as follows:Based on these estimates we can run some scenarios about what the future dividend of Honeywell might be. At the current payout ratio of 35%, the annual dividend in 2018 could be $2.89, which represents an increase of 61% from the current annual dividend of $1.80.My upside scenario assumes that the payout ratio increases to 45%, in which case the dividend would be $3.71 and represent an increase of 106%. I believe the increased payout ratio assumption is justified by performing some peer analysis. Lockheed Marin (NYSE:LMT) has a payout ratio of 54%, 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) is 43%, and General Electric (NYSE:GE) is 64%. Taking an average of the peer group, we get a payout ratio of 49%, which would mean HON is still lower than average if it increases to 45%.HON Payout Ratio (TTM) data by YChartsAlternative Uses of CashIf Honeywell hits the consensus EPS targets laid out above and does not increase the dividend, the implied payout ratio in 2018 would be only 22%. If HON chooses not to increase the dividend, they will have significant cash flow available to buy back shares and/or make acquisitions. The current dividend costs HON about $1.4 billion annually. If the dividend is not increased, that leaves about $5 billion of retained earnings in 2018 to be used for other purposes (proxy for actual cash).The company recently authorized a plan that would allow it to buy back up to $3 billion of common stock. Based on its historical track record, however, the actual value is likely to be less. From Q4 2003 to present, HON has repurchased only $1.5 billion of shares cumulatively.Acquisitions are another likely alternative use of cash by management in the future. HON has historically financed acquisitions using all cash, but they have been relatively small deals. Of HON's last 6 acquisitions, all of them were under $1 billion, and two of them were small enough not to have a disclosed value. Barring a major change in acquisition strategy, this does not appear likely to be the use of all excess cash in the future.On balance, it appears that as EPS grows into 2018, the dividend payout ratio will at the very least remain flat. That still leaves room for share buybacks and acquisitions that would be in excess of historical averages. A flat payout ratio still implies a significant increase in dividends per share by 2018.ConclusionHoneywell has a very strong track record of growing dividends. Investors looking for dividend growth should consider adding shares of HON to their portfolio. HON is in the fortunate position to have two levers it can pull that could significantly increase dividends: growing EPS and plenty of room to raise the payout ratio. Consensus EPS estimates and even a flat payout ratio imply that the dividend could increase very significantly by 2018."

Revenue increased 4.8% to $10.11 billion, which exceeded estimates by $70 million. Earnings per share increased 18.5% to $1.47, which beat estimates by 4.3%. Operating cash flow increased 15% year-over-year, while free cash flow increased 12%. Honeywell saw strength in the U.S. in the residential and industrial markets.

The company recently unveiled the new Gulfstream 500 and 600 series planes. There are also numerous innovations such as: cockpit avionics, synthetic vision, wireless connectivity, traffic and 3D airport maps, and environmental controls. There is also a new Gulfstream flight deck called Symmetry, which is to be used for cockpit systems controls, communication, flight management, and for monitoring weather. These innovations will allow Honeywell to continue its growth going forward.The strong Q3 results reinforce my positive outlook on the company. I did predict in my last article that Honeywell would beat the market over the long term. The stock increased about 50% since the article was written, outperforming the market by a significant margin. The company is still undervalued with a forward PE of 14.7 as compared to the S&P 500's forward PE of 15.9. I think that the stock will continue to perform well going forward. However, the stock is more likely to match the performance of the market as its expected earnings growth is now more in line with the market's expected growth over the next few years."
2581915,67805,2014-10-22T03:36:38-04:00,"Honeywell slightly beat analyst estimates on both earnings and revenue.EPS, gross revenue, and segment margin forecasts are all raised very slightly.The improvements confirm my original expectations.I predicted improvements in gross margins, citing HON’s ability to efficiently run a conglomerate and the sale of Friction Materials.","Honeywell's (NYSE:HON) Q3 earnings release showed a beat on earnings of $.02 when reporting EPS of $1.43 normalized for a 26.5% tax rate. Diluted EPS with no normalization was $1.47. Revenues were also up to $10.11B which beat estimates by $70 million and is an increase of 4.8% year over year. While full year guidance was raised only very slightly, it represents the continued strength of Honeywell as they keep growing revenue despite a challenging macroeconomic environment. Management did caution that they expect the macroeconomic environment to continue into 2015.EPS was helped slightly by a decrease in the number of shares outstanding as the weighted average dropped from 797.1 to 795 (in millions) year over year. One of the more important strengths shown by HON this quarter was the growth in their segment margins. Segment margins increased to 17.4% from 16.7% year over year. I predicted growth in the segment margins when I wrote about the sale of Friction Materials.While Honeywell managed to beat earnings and raise guidance, the growth was not in the ideal sectors. Aerospace had flat sales, but it also had the highest segment margin at 20.3% and the largest growth in segment margin, a gain of 1.5%. While Aerospace was driving the margins, sales were driven by Automation and Control Solutions (up 9%) and Performance Materials and Technology (up 7%). Both segments improved margins slightly, from 20 to 40 basis points."
2573875,71135,2014-10-20T10:26:00-04:00,"Honeywell has delivered consistently strong financials quarter after quarter and year after year.There has been a build up of cash within the company, acting as a potential catalyst in the short term.The company would represent a long-term investment with great potential for significant total returns.","OverviewHoneywell (NYSE:HON) operates as a manufacturer of a wide variety of commercial and consumer products, and is a Fortune 500 company, ranking #78 in 2013. Despite the broad range of products manufacturer, Honeywell operates in four segments:Revenue for FY2013 can be found in the company's most recent 10-K. The breakdown is shown below.Source: Created by authorFrom 2011-2013, revenue for the Aerospace and Automation and Control Solutions segments have grown at a moderate pace in the low single digits, while Performance Materials has grown at a robust rate of over 9% annually. Transportation revenues have remained essentially flat.Quarterly Results ReviewHoneywell released its Q3 2014 results last Friday on October 17, and results were positive. An EPS of $1.47 handily beat estimates of $1.41, and revenues were above consensus as well at $10.1 bn compared to $10.0 bn. Revenue primarily benefited from strong organic growth from the Automation and Control Solutions and Performance Materials and Technologies segments at 9% and 7% growth from Q3 2013 respectively.Another major positive were company margins, as it posted an increase of 70 bps to 17.4% from Q3 2013 to 2014. It continues to post increased efficiencies, and has increased its EBITDA margins from ~10%-12% between 2009-2011 to ~17% in the LTM period.OutlookEarlier in the year, the company announced its 5 year plan detailing goals and milestones for the period of 2014-2018. With its recent quarter, it is clear that Honeywell is in a prime position to meet these milestones, as major targets were actually raised by management due to outperformance. Diversification is a major factor that shields the company from competitive pressures that may exist in a particular segment it operates within.Continued strong organic growth of its Automation and Control segment is promising, especially considering how it comprises over 40% of revenue. Rising margins is also indicative of future profitability, and the company expects future growth in this area as well. Furthermore, in the short term, the company seems to be well positioned with a backlog of $16.3 bn for 2014.Nevertheless, the one question that many investors and analysts have is in regards to the significant amount of cash that the company retains on its balance sheet. As at Q3 2014, the company has $6.4 bn of cash and $2.3 bn in short term investments. With a Net Debt / EBITDA ratio of under 0.1x, the company certainly has numerous options available.Although the company had announced a share repurchase program at FY2013 for up to $5 bn, there remains a high amount of flexibility. There has not been much guidance provided on this topic, but we believe that this could prove to be a significant catalyst for Honeywell going forward. It is possible for the company to re-lever up to undergo a capital-intensive project or acquisition, or undergo several acquisitions of a smaller scale, which it has prior experience with.ValuationAfter vastly outperforming the index from 2010-2013, Honeywell's performance YTD has not been strong, largely mirroring the S&P500.HON data by YChartsWe compare its valuation metrics (LTM and NTM EV / EBITDA and NTM P/E) to comparable companies (largely competitors). We note that Honeywell seems to be fairly valued via these comparables, but also that it is possible that it should be trading at a premium to its high growth potential (LTM revenue growth of 6% compared to -1% for its peers, and LTM EBITDA growth of 31% compared to 5% for its peers).Source: Created by authorFinal ViewsHoneywell is a company that is primed for future success and profitability as a leader in the wide variety of industries it operates within. We consider the prospects of Honeywell as a long-term investment positive, but would be less bullish on a short-term duration given its current valuation levels and market conditions."
2530025,56262,2014-09-30T03:15:54-04:00,"Honeywell hasn't performed brilliantly in 2014.
        The company's five-year plan looks solid and should reap benefits.
        Honeywell's diversified portfolio and shrewd initiatives should prove to be beneficial in the long-run.
        Honeywell is a buy at present valuation.","Industrial player Honeywell (NYSE:HON) has had a rocky ride this year, with the stock having gained just 2.5% so far. However, this flat performance looks like a buying opportunity as Honeywell is reporting consistent growth in its financials. Moreover, Honeywell operates in four segments, out of which three are doing well. Automation and control solutions, performance materials and technologies, and transportation systems are progressing well, while the company expects the weak aerospace segment to improve on the back of its technology and resources.A smart and sorted plan to propel growthHoneywell is working on smart business strategies to make efficient strategic decisions. Its much-discussed five year plan (2014-2018) looks very appealing and should help it grow impressively in the future. Speaking in detail, Honeywell's five-year plan focuses on the following points.1. A focus on high growth regions (HGR), which are expected to drive 50% of Honeywell's growth over the next five years.2. HOS Gold, the next step in the evolution of the Honeywell Operating System, to drive exceptional performance through continuous process improvements.3. The Honeywell User Experience (HUE), a competitive advantage focused on significantly improving the customer experience through solutions that are easier to use, more valuable and more efficient.4. An intensified focus on superb software development for more efficient and more robust technology.5. Effective cash deployment through investment in our businesses, dividend growth, and strategic M&A.The attractive five-year plan looks attainable considering the strong progress report of Honeywell. The company has been deploying rapid prototyping and other design principles, which will lead to faster cycle timing, thereby allowing it to achieve customer loyalty and support. The company is also planning to expand in China. On the back of such initiatives, it expects organic revenue growth from $7 billion-$12 billion to $46 billion-$51 billion by 2018.Impressive movesHoneywell has maintained a diversified portfolio, and updates it with changing market trends and demands. The company is also focused on the expansion of its product portfolio, as it has introduced the new Lyric Thermostat which will sync smartphones with devices using geofencing to turn it on and off depending on the user's demand. Users will be able to control and operate their thermostats remotely using their phones. This smart device will sense users' distance from their homes, like the time when the user is arriving home or leaving, and then set the temperature to save energy.Honeywell's aerospace business is also gaining momentum as the Embraer Legacy 500 is being put into service. The Legacy 500 is a result of the combined efforts of Embraer's vision and Honeywell's technologies. This jet provides high standard comfort and reliability with advanced cabin and propulsion technologies employed in designing.Honeywell provides the turbofan engines, auxiliary power unit (NYSE:APU), Ovation Select Cabin Management System, cabin pressure control system, and air conditioning system for Embraer's latest midsize jet. The reliable HTF7500E engines and new APU will provide a cutting-edge business travel experience. New levels of comfort and designs should attract customers and generate more revenue from Honeywell's aerospace and transportation segments.Honeywell is also planning to expand its business in India. S R Patil, minister for information technology, biotechnology and science & technology, Karnataka, revealed that Honeywell, which has a global presence in 70 countries, serving customers worldwide with diversified products and services, has a development center in Bangalore.Several of Honeywell's products are developed in Bangalore and services are offered from here. Therefore, the company has put forward an investment proposal before Karnataka's state high level committee to set up a new 5.4 acres campus in Bangalore. Honeywell has, till date, invested around Rs. 1,600 crore (or $265 million) in Bangalore, and now plans to invest another Rs. 1,400 crore (or $235 million) into this project. According to company officials, Honeywell has 21,000 engineers globally, out of which more than 5,000 are located in Bangalore.ConclusionThus, Honeywell is looking to invest aggressively in the business. As a result, its growth should pick up in the future. Moreover, the company's weaker aerospace segment is expected to gain steam going forward. Hence, it looks like a good idea to make use of Honeywell's flat performance this year by buying more shares as the stock looks set for better times ahead. Also, since the stock carries a dividend yield of 2%, investors have yet another reason to hold Honeywell in their portfolios."
2574615,25120,2014-10-20T08:52:04-04:00,"Honeywell posts strong third quarter results.Organic growth and margin expansion drive earnings growth again.Despite the solid business performance, appeal is limited at market-equivalent multiples currently.","Honeywell (NYSE:HON) posted solid results for the third quarter triggering some enthusiasm from investors who send shares of the industrial conglomerate some 4% higher on the back of the results.Given the modest growth, dividend yield and market-equivalent valuation, I fail to see the compelling upside at current levels, being only a buyer on significant pullbacks.Third Quarter HighlightsHoneywell posted third quarter sales of $10.11 billion, a 4.8% increase compared to the year before, as revenues came in above consensus estimates at $10.06 billion.Earnings attributable to shareholders rose by 17.9% to $1.17 billion. On a per share basis, earnings rose by a similar percentage to $1.47 per share, thereby beating consensus estimates by six cents.Solid QuarterCEO Dave Cote was pleased with the performance, citing the solid organic sales growth and double-digit earnings growth.In terms of the business units there has been some divergence between the three segments. Aerospace revenues of $3.89 billion were flat compared to last year as 3% organic growth has been offset by the impact of the Friction Materials divestiture. The company managed to expand margins by 150 basis points to 20.3% of sales thanks to operational excellence and the divestiture of Friction Materials.Automation and Control Solutions saw the revenues of the unit increase by nearly 9% to $3.67 billion, as organic sales growth of the unit came in at 4% being accompanied by the contribution from the acquisition of Intermec. Margins improved by 40 basis points to 15.9% of sales thanks to solid operational achievements as well.And finally, the performance materials and technologies unit reported 7% sales growth to $2.54 billion, thanks to gas processing growth. Margins were up a modest 20 basis points to 17.5% of sales on the back of improved volumes and excellence.Gross margins of the overall company came in at 29.5% of sales, a big 150 basis point improvement versus last year. These margins gains were partially made undone by selling, general and administrative expenses which rose by 50 basis points to 13.3% of sales.Net earnings were aided by these margin gains and sales growth on the back of a lower effective tax rate. The effective tax rate of 24.6% of earnings before taxes was down from the 27.4% as reported last year.Revised OutlookBased on the current performance, Honeywell is hiking the lower end of the full year sales guidance by a hundred million to $40.3-$40.4 billion.Operating margins are now seen at 15.6% of sales, coming in at the higher end of the previous guidance. Earnings per share for this year are now seen at $5.50 to $5.55 per share, which compared to the previous guidance calling for earnings of $5.45 to $5.55 per share.ValuationAt the end of the quarter, Honeywell held some $6.4 billion in cash, equivalents and short term investments. Total debt of $8.9 billion results in a net debt position of some $2.5 billion which is very much manageable but excludes asbestos related liabilities and post-retirement liabilities.With some 795 million shares outstanding, which currently trade around $90 per share, equity in the company is valued at $71-$72 billion. Based on the full year guidance, shares are valued at around 1.75 times anticipated annual sales and 16-17 times annual earnings.Modest Growth, But Great Margin ImprovementsOver the past decade, Honeywell has posted solid revenue growth, with sales increasing by a cumulative 60% from $25 billion in sales in 2004 to $40 billion by now. This annual growth of around 4-5% in terms of sales has been modest but has been accompanied by decent margin gains, fueling earnings growth.Earnings more than tripled over this time period as after-tax profit margins improved from about 5% of sales steadily to margins of 10% or actually a little more this year. Investors have furthermore benefited from share repurchases totaling 5-10% of the outstanding share base.The outstanding operating performance has been rewarded by investors as shares have gained significant ground over this past decade. Shares which traded around $60 ahead of the recession fell to lows of $25 amidst the crisis, only to steadily rise to highs of $98 earlier this year, with shares currently exchanging hands at around $90 per share.Final ThoughtsBack in September, Honeywell last presented itself at the Morgan Stanley Laguna Conference. In the presentation the company outlined its 2018 targets for sales of $46 to $51 billion, to be accompanied by improved segment margins to 18.5-20% of sales. Part of this growth should be driven by anticipated $10 billion in strategic deal making in the coming years, as 50% of the free cash flows are targeted to be returned to investors.This could result in earnings up to $6 billion some three or four years ahead in time, or close to $7.50 per share. While these targeted earnings are attractive, resulting in a 12 times earnings multiple, note that this target is still five years ahead in time.At the same time, the real compelling valuation is lacking in my eyes, with shares trading at market-equivalent multiples currently. This is as reported growth is not spectacular, neither is the 2.0% dividend yield.As such I like the company for the long run, but I am only a buyer on significant dips going forward, wishing to pick up shares in a $80-$85 targeted entry point, representing a 14-15 times earnings multiple based on this year's earnings."

(NYSE:HON) is an aerospace and industrial conglomerate. Growth in the company is seen being driven: 1) in the company's aerospace division by solid commercial aerospace original equipment manufacturer, aftermarket, and international defense growth with an offset by weak U.S. defense sales; 2) in the automation and control solutions division by improving residential markets and acquisition growth; 3) in the performance materials and technologies by a strong project backlog and new product introductions; and 4) in the transportation systems division by increased turbocharger penetration and rising auto sales. Operating margins in 2014 and 2015 are seen rising from volume and productivity improvements in all of the company's divisions leading to cost savings in excess of price inflation.HON manufactures and sells high-quality products, has a strong balance sheet, and generates substantial free cash flow that may be used for internal growth, acquisitions, and stock repurchases. In addition, the company is accomplishing their long-term strategy to expand operations in less costly areas of the world, while reducing costs in more costly countries by closing plants, consolidating facilities, and implementing efficient manufacturing. The company's shares currently yield about 2.00 percent and have a long history of yearly dividend increases. The company's shares are at or near 52-week highs so investors should put HON shares on their watch list to purchase the shares during an opportunistic overall market pullback.BackgroundHoneywell International Inc. is an aerospace and industrial conglomerate with about $39 billion in 2013 revenues. The company has the following four operating divisions: 1) the aerospace division (31 percent of 2013 revenues and 37 percent of operating profits) manufactures products for commercial and military aircraft. This division also provides global aircraft maintenance and produces space products and systems, including guidance and control systems and gyroscopes; 2) the automation and control solutions division (42 percent of 2013 revenues and 37 percent of operating profits) manufactures environmental and combustion controls, sensing controls, security and life safety products and services, scanning and mobility products, process automation products and solutions, and building solutions and services; and 3) the performance materials and technology division (17 percent of 2013 revenues and 19 percent of operating profits) makes specialty chemicals and fibers. The company sells such industrial materials primarily to the petrochemical, food, pharmaceutical and electronic packaging industries; and 4) the transportation systems division (10 percent of 2013 revenues and 7 percent of operating profits) makes turbochargers for gasoline and diesel engines.Second quarter earningsHON announced second quarter 2014 net income of $1.126 billion or $1.38 per share, compared with $1.022 billion or $1.28 per share from the year ago quarter. Earnings per share increased 7.8 percent from the year ago quarter. Revenues for the second quarter increased 5.8 percent to $10.253 billion. The company experienced strong sales growth across all of their divisions except aerospace. HON's short-cycle businesses, especially energy, safety and security, and turbo technologies, gained from improving end markets; while their long-cycle businesses saw a strong order backlog.Results by division were as follows: 1) the performance-aerospace division sales were flat from the year ago quarter at $2.991 billion. Profit for the division increased 1.5 percent from the year ago quarter to $592 million; 2)  the automation and control solutions division sales increased 10.3 percent from the year ago quarter to $3.607 billion. Profit for the division increased 14.1 percent to $533 million; 3)  the  transportation systems division saw a 7.6 percent increase in revenues to $1.019 billion. Profit for the division increased 32.5 percent from the year ago quarter to $167 million; 4)  the  performance materials and technologies division sales increased 6.3 percent to $2.636 billion. Profit for the division increased 8.4 percent to $475 million from the year ago quarter.  (Effective from third quarter 2014, HON will report their financial performance under three business divisions: aerospace, automation and control solutions, and performance materials and technologies.)HON lowered their sales guidance for 2014 from a range of $40.3 billion to $40.7 billion to $40.2 billion to $40.4 billion. The company, however, raised the lower end of its earnings per share guidance by $0.05, projecting earnings per share in the range of $5.45 to $5.55. The company remains positive on the macro environment and expects organic sales growth acceleration throughout the year. The company also intends to continue investing in new products and technologies, and increase their footprint in high-growth markets. Moreover, their restructuring and cost streamlining initiatives should translate into continued margin expansion in the second half of 2014. The CEO of HON characterized the company's progress during the second quarter as follows:CompetitionThe aerospace and defense industry provides defense, space, security, and information technology products. The aerospace industry is driven by the overall economic climate while the defense industry is driven by military budgets and the global political landscape. The profitability of individual companies depends on technical expertise and their ability to secure long-term contracts. The industry is cyclical and unpredictable due to uncertainty of the annual government budgeting process.Major cockpit controls competitors include Rockwell Collins (NYSE:COL) and France's Thales. Primary aircraft wheel and brake competitors include Goodrich (NYSE:GR), France's Messier-Bugatti and the U.K.'s Meggitt Plc. Major small jet engine competitors include the Pratt & Whitney division of United Technologies (NYSE:UTX), Williams International (privately held), and General Electric's (NYSE:GE) jet engine division. Primary competitors include the maintenance, repair and overhaul operations of several global airlines Goodrich, GE and Boeing (NYSE:BA). Primary security systems competitors include ADT (NYSE:ADT), UTX's fire and security division and Sweden-based Securitas AB. Johnson Controls (NYSE:JCI) and Borg Warner (NYSE:BWA) are also competitors for building solutions and services for homes, buildings and industrial facilities.Analysts' views and our viewsAnalysts see HON's building environmental and combustion controls and their turbocharger products businesses benefiting from a strong global trend toward energy efficiency. The company's aerospace division is seen as benefiting from rising global aircraft fleet sizes, demand for better fuel economy and aftermarket demand. Specialty chemical volumes are seen as benefiting from improving global demand for petroleum products. Analysts also positively view cost control efforts and believe that HON is hesitant to make any acquisitions greater than $1 billion. The company's dividend rate is expected to continue to rise over the next several years, in line with earnings per share growth. Risks to analysts' recommendations and target prices include a further weakening of the global economy, operational difficulties, and less than expected restructuring benefits. The substantial majority of analysts have a ""strong buy"" rating along with a few ""hold"" ratings and price targets ranging from $98 to $121 with an average price target of $107.We generally agree with analysts' conclusions regarding HON's shares. The company has reinvigorated their revenue and profit growth in recent years and has a strong balance sheet that helps them generate substantial free cash flow so that the company retains flexibility to use such cash flow for internal growth, acquisitions, and stock repurchases. The company also continues to execute their long-term strategy to expand operations in less costly areas of the world, while reducing costs in more costly countries by closing plants, consolidating facilities, and implementing efficient manufacturing. We see HON's recent successful execution of their strategy continuing. The current price to earnings ratio for HON shares is about 19.10 and the shares yield 2.0 percent. In addition, the company has a long history of raising their dividends in addition to the company's share buyback activity. HON's forward price to earnings ratio is about 17.00 based on their 2014 earnings estimates of $5.55 and 15.30 based on their 2015 earnings estimates of $6.17. We should note that HON's earnings estimates for 2015 have been raised slightly in recent months.HON's average price to earnings ratio in the previous 10 years is 16.00. With overall markets at or near record highs, however, an investor may want to wait for HON's share price to pull back modestly to a range of $91.00 to $94.00 to establish a full position (A forward price to earnings ratio in the range of 14.75 to 15.25 based on 2015 earnings estimate). Although an investor could wait for a pullback in the share price of HON, recent bullish options activity is signaling that an investor could comfortably establish a position in the company shares at the current price. Finally, HON's shares have seen extensive insider selling with one over $82,100 purchase in 2013 at about $82.10 a share."
2576105,25791,2014-10-20T16:13:32-04:00,,"Honeywell International Inc. (NYSE:HON) just reported its preliminary financial results based on which we provide a unique corporate earnings release based analysis of its performance. Our analysis focuses on the company's performance for the same quarterly period on a year-on-year basis (unless stated otherwise). HON-US is one of the first companies amongst its peer group to announce earnings for this period. Highlights:The table below shows the preliminary results and recent trends for key metrics such as revenues and net income (see complete table at the end of this report): Earnings Growth Analysis: The company's earnings growth has been influenced by the following factors: (1) Year-on-year improvements in gross margins from 31.66% to 31.73% and (2) better cost controls. As a result, operating margins (EBITDA margins) improved from 18.11% to 18.43% year-on-year. In addition, gross margins were 32.17% and EBITDA margins 18.80% in the immediate last quarter.Gross Margin Trend: Companies sometimes trade off for improvements in revenues and margins by extending friendlier terms to customers and vendors. One quick way to check against such activity is to compare the changes in gross margins with any changes in working capital. If the gross margins improved without a worsening of working capital, it is quite possible that the company's performance is a result of truly delivering in the marketplace and not simply a prop up using the balance sheet. The company's improvement in gross margins have come at the expense of a deterioration in working capital management, suggesting that the improvements in gross margins are likely trade-offs with the balance sheet and not strictly from operating decisions. Its working capital days have gone up to 74.45 from last year's levels of 42.48 days. Operating Cash Flow Growth Versus Earnings Growth: Companies often post earnings numbers that are influenced by non-cash activities. One way to gauge the quality of the declared earnings number is to judge the deviation in the growth in earnings from the growth in operating cash flows. In general, an earnings growth rate that is higher compared to the operating cash flow growth implies a higher proportion of non-operating and even one-time activities - such activities are typically not sustainable over long periods. HON-US's year-on-year change in Operating Cash Flow of 15.23% trailed its change in earnings suggesting some potential weakening of the balance sheet. Unusual Items: The company's earnings growth also has been influenced by the following factors: (1) Improvements in EBIT margins from 15.58% to 16.19% and (2) unusual items. The company's pretax margins are now 15.63% compared to 14.34% for the same period last year. EPS Growth Versus Earnings Growth: HON-US's year-on-year change in Earnings per Share (EPS) of 18.55% is better than its change in earnings of 17.88%.

Over the last 2 years, it has thoroughly outpaced General Electric (NYSE:GE) and United Technologies (NYSE:UTX), as well as the Dow Jones. As shown in the chart below, it wasn't one spike. The company has just been consistently outperforming.Following its strong first half of 2014, the company raised the low end of guidance by 5 cents, leading to a pro forma EPS guidance range of $5.45 to $5.55 for the fiscal year. Like other conglomerates, Honeywell has been spinning off segments that didn't make sense for it. Management points to the closing of the sale of ""Friction Materials"" as a driver for continued performance.Management has provided shareholders with the long-term targets for 2018. The targets look fairly aggressive, but Honeywell might be able to do it. Its success in its previous long-term goals helped its stock outperform the other conglomerates. Here are those targets:If you're new to reading about Honeywell, the company had four segments. They were: Aerospace, Automation and Control solutions, Performance Materials and Technologies, and Transportation Systems. The following chart should help display their relative value to the company.I use the past tense in referring to the four segment approach because Honeywell filed an 8-k in the third quarter to reflect a change in reporting. In the future, you'll see a segment called ""Transportation Systems and Aerospace"". This merging of segments was planned to follow the sale of Friction Materials. The second-quarter information under the new format, which should be used for comparisons moving forward, is presented below:For the combined segment of Transportation Systems and Aerospace, sales are expected to come in flat, possibly down by 2%. The potential decrease recognizes the loss of revenues from Friction Materials. When excluding Friction Materials from the values for 2013, sales should be up 2% to 3% for the segment, which includes 3 sub-segments: Commercial, Space and Defense, and Transportation Systems.Regarding the merging of the two segments, per the earnings call transcripts:Defense and Space has been a challenging area for Honeywell lately. Revenues were down 8% in the first quarter, but only 1% in the second quarter. Management is predicting the declines to be done, and has stated that they expect growth for the segment in the third quarter, as well as in the next fiscal year.Region salesHoneywell's geographic breakdown of sales is still centered on the United States. The typical breakdown for regional sales is:Cash DeploymentHoneywell has been following a simple plan for deciding what to do with cash. From 2010 through the projected end of 2014, the goal was, and still is, roughly a 50/50 split between returning to shareholders and investing in new growth. Counting the projected uses through the end of 2014, there should be $3.4 billion in share repurchases to compliment $6 billion in dividends. On the growth side, the totals are projected to be $4.5 billion into capital expenditures and $4 billion into Net M&A.TaxesHoneywell has been dealing with some minor difficulties in the effective tax rate. The effective tax rate of 26.1% in the second quarter reduced EPS by 6 cents relative to the second quarter of 2013. EPS of $1.38 per share, which beat the high end of management's guidance range by $.02, was an increase of 8% on a GAAP basis ($1.28 EPS for Q2 2013), or 12% normalized for taxes.Conflict between management statements and insider transactionsThe CFO, Tom Szlosek, closed his prepared remarks in the earnings call by saying:Those are fairly bullish statements. They are confident they will continue to outperform? As an analyst, I like the things they've done with the company, but I'm a little concerned that those statements were not representing an increase in exposure to the stock price. Since the earnings call, Insider Cow shows only sales by insiders, with total proceeds in excess of $9 million. Since Tom wasn't one of those sellers, I'll give him a pass on that. He may feel bullish, and I can understand the sentiment.ConclusionHoneywell has delivered great returns to shareholders for years. The vision is solid, and its targets are clearly articulated. I'm concerned that its targeted growth in segment margins may be beyond even its ability, but so far, there is no proof it can't hit it. By divesting the less appealing segments and refocusing the company, it is avoiding competing in areas in which it lacks a sustainable advantage. Its actions, in my opinion, read like a textbook on how to run a conglomerate. The trailing PE of 19.15 isn't too bad considering its combination of expected growth and dividend yield. I'm bullish on the stock. Even without the improvements to segment margin, the dividend yield and sales growth provide a reasonable level of protection against downside risk. The stock dipped in late July, but like most Honeywell dips, it was just another buying opportunity."

The growth in top line is driven by innovation and the company's proven abilities in research and development.HON's strong presence in the emerging markets is another critical top line growth driver. HON has been operating in the blooming markets of China and India since 1935. HON employs about 24,000 employees including scientists and engineers in China and India and owns and operates various state-of-the-art engineering and manufacturing facilities.

Looking at the most recent result of the second quarter of 2014, HON managed to grow its revenue by 6% compared to the figure reported in the same quarter last year.

HON is also confident regarding both its short and long-term revenue outlook.Exhibit 2 Source: Morningstar.comImproving Margins: A Very Well Run BusinessDespite being a huge enterprise that could lose efficiency owing to diseconomies of scale, HON has in fact improved its operational efficiency. In the figure above HON managed to increase both its gross and operating margins over the past ten years. It is fascinating to see the improvements in the company's margins since it is a daunting task to bring efficiency to such a huge enterprise. In 2004 the gross margin was 19.6% and improved considerably in ten years reaching 27.9% during 2013-14. The operating margins that stood at 6.6% in 2004 grew to 14.4% during 2013-14. The growing top line and expanding margins helped HON to produce healthy bottom line growth. Net income grew at a CAGR of 13.5% and EPS grew at a CAGR of 13% in ten years. The growth momentum continued in the recent quarter. In the second quarter of 2014 the company managed to grow its net income by 8% compared to the figure reported in the same quarter last year.It is encouraging to see that HON continued its segment margin expansion in recent financial results. During the second quarter of 2014, HON managed to expand its operating margin in all of its operating segments. As an innovator HON strives to improve the functionality of its products and it shows the same vigor when improving its operations. These qualities make HON a very good and stable long-term investment.Target Price Estimate Reveals UndervaluationThe consensus target price polled from 17 brokers shows an attractive upside. The mean target price is $107 which presents an upside of 12% at the current price of $95.51. The median target price is $105 which presents an upside potential of 10%. The most optimistic target price is $121 and if materialized it presents an upside of 27%. It's encouraging to see that even the most conservative analyst estimate has an upside of 3%. This analysis clearly shows that HON is under-appreciated by the market and this makes it a good investment opportunity.Source: Yahoo FinanceRelative ValuationIf we look at the price multiples to assess the relative price of HON compared to the industry, sector, and S&P 500 we don't get a clear answer. Honeywell's P/E ratio is 17.24 times which indicates that its stock price is undervalued compared to the industry but overvalued compared to the sector and S&P 500. The PEG ratio shows that HON is undervalued compared to the S&P 500 but overvalued compared to the industry and the sector. On a relative basis HON's stock is not a definite buy but the consensus target price that is used to calculate the intrinsic value of company shows that HON is an attractive investment at its current price level. Investors that intend to gain exposure in a diversified industrial company should consider investing in Honeywell.Source: Yahoo FinanceConclusionHoneywell has attractive upside at its current price level based on the target price analysis. Its consistent financial performance and expanding margins make it a stable long=term investment.

2430555,42201,2014-08-18T02:36:23-04:00,"Shares in Honeywell currently yield 1.91%, which is low compared to its largest competitor General Electric.However, the company has been growing revenues and margins, and expects double digit earnings growth in the next 5 years.The balance sheet looks great with close to 9% of the current market cap in cash and equivalents.","Shares in Honeywell International (NYSE:HON) are currently trading at $94.39, up 3.31% YTD. The stock has underperformed the S&P500, which is up 6.37% year to date, but it has done quite a bit better than General Electric (NYSE:GE), its largest competitor, which is down 7.67% since the beginning of this year.HON EPS Basic (NYSE:TTM) data by YChartsThe company recently increased its FY2014 EPS guidance from a range of $5.40 - $5.55 to $5.45 - $5.55. This would be an increase of 8.7% to 11.7% compared to last year's earnings per share of $4.97. As we can see from the graph above, Honeywell's dividend hasn't grown at quite the same pace as its earnings per share. This has allowed the company to maintain a very low payout ratio of only 35.1% over the past 4 quarters. For comparison, GE's payout ratio in the most recent 12 months stands at 64.1%. Honeywell currently has a dividend yield of 1.91%, which is well below its 5 year average of 2.4%. Looking at Honeywell's valuations we can see the company is trading at 18.6 times TTM earnings, which is exactly the same as its 5 year average p/e ratio. General Electric is slightly cheaper at a p/e ratio of 17.7.Over the past 12 months, Honeywell has spent $717 million in share repurchases, which is less than 1% of the current market cap of $73.77 billion.HON Revenue (TTM) data by YChartsHoneywell's earnings growth has been fueled by both growth in revenue and an increasing profit margin. In its 5 year plan, Honeywell states it plans to increase revenue to between $46 billion and $51 billion in fiscal year 2018. Combined with increasing margins, the company expects to see double digit earnings growth. This means the company should be more than able to continue its dividend increases. The 5 year dividend growth rate stands at 8.8%, and with double digit earnings growth expected, I would expect the dividend to continue growing at this pace or even higher.Honeywell's current price to sales ratio stands at 1.9, which is far above its 5 year average of 1.3. However, with profit margins growing, and expected to grow even further, I'm not surprised to see an expansion in the company's p/s multiple. Revenues simply become more valuable when the profit margin goes up.HON Current Ratio (Quarterly) data by YChartsNot paying too much to its shareholders has allowed the company to save a very decent amount of money. Cash and equivalents currently stand at $6.58 billion, which is 8.9% of the company's market cap. The current ratio stands at 1.57, while the quick ratio is 1.04, implying good short term financial health. The long term debt is only $6.84 billion, which I consider to be very sustainable for a company of this size.Conclusion:Honeywell has been growing its revenues at a decent pace, and expects to continue to do so. Combined with margin expansion, this should lead to earnings growth in the low double digits. For the next 5 years, average analyst EPS growth expectations for the company stand at 10.6%. The company has increased its dividend by an average of 8.8% over the past 5 years, and considering the great balance sheet health and already low payout ratio, I wouldn't be surprised to see the dividend growth rate go up. The current dividend yield of 1.91% isn't very impressive, but for investors looking for long term investment opportunities, such as myself, the growth in earnings and dividends makes this company a great buy.Disclaimer: I am not a registered investment advisor and do not provide specific investment advice.

With the healing of the global economy, the company started to post big profits year after year with its innovative products, technologies and services. Furthermore, its smart business strategies and efficient management is allowing it to turn single digit revenue growth into higher double digit growth in earnings. In the past three years, Honeywell has generated 24% growth in earnings on a 6% growth in revenues, which represents very efficient management and smart deployment of investments in higher margin areas. All this left the company in very strong financial condition. Its cash generating potential is also strong enough to support potential investments and dividends. The table below highlights Honeywell's eye-catching performance in the past three years.Investors are admiring Honeywell's business strategy, product innovations, and ability to convert sales into big profits. Its stock is consistently on surge over the last few years, with few shortfalls, presenting opportunities for interested investors. Honeywell is again offering an attractive opportunity for defensive investors to pick its stock on the market correction. I believe, and all indicators show, that Honeywell is going to make big profits in the coming days. At the moment, its valuations are moving in line with the industry average, but higher forward PE indicates that Honeywell has strong upside potential. Further, the outlook for the company's financial forecast is very attractive; which also signifies that Honeywell has better days ahead.Honeywell is a diversified manufacturing and technology leader offering aerospace products and services; control technologies for homes, buildings and industry; turbochargers; and performance materials. The company is operating in four business segments: Aerospace, Automation and Control Solutions, Performance Materials and Technologies, and Transportation systems. The company looks to amalgamate its Transportation and Aerospace segments in order to better take advantage of the technology and engineering similarities and the shared operating practices with two businesses. Honeywell's management is always seeking to maintain its portfolio, which continues to align with market demand.At the end of the recent quarter, all four of its segments had generated strong organic and inorganic growth except aerospace segments, which remain flat compared to the past year's quarter. On a consolidated basis, Honeywell has generated 6% growth in sales, including 3% organic growth and earnings per share increased by 8% on a reported basis. Further, the strong first half results allowed the company to increase its lower end guidance to $5.45 - $5.55, which represents a double digit growth compared to the past year's earnings per share of $4.92. Its short-cycle businesses are improving with the geographic expansion, innovation and robust demand in the end markets. While long-cycle businesses have been gathering massive backlogs on the back of improving economy.Source: Morningstar.comLooking at the cash side will reveal any risks associated with the company. It has been generating very strong cash flows over the years which are allowing it to make consistent increases in dividends. At the end of the recent quarter, Honeywell had generated $1.1B in free cash flows when its dividend payments are only standing at $373M. I am expecting hefty dividend increases from the company as its free cash flows are offering a huge opportunity for that. Further, the company's debt-to-equity ratio is well below the industry average and current and quick ratios are also showing that the company has hefty cash available to meet short-term liabilities. Being organized as a diversified industrial company most of its businesses are correlated with economic situation. At the moment, global economic situation is healing over the past two years and the environment is anticipated to improve further in the coming days based on International Monetary fund. Here, we can say that Honeywell will continue to grow with the healing of the economy and the company has very low risks in its way.In ConclusionThe company's five year plan looks attractive and achievable as it is in a strong situation with its diversified portfolio and innovative products and technologies. Additionally, the company has strong penetration in the market and its management is adjusting its portfolio according to the need and trends in the market. The company is well set to achieve double digit growth in earnings each year over the next five years and to double its free cash flows as they did in the past three years. Having such an attractive past performance and strong momentum in the present, I believe Honeywell is well set to generate big profits in the coming days. And I believe with the market correcting in price, Honeywell is offering an attractive entry point.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2363715,67815,2014-07-31T10:41:30-04:00,"GE has a lot of income potential and is highly profitable.However, sector peer Honeywell offers better growth prospects and higher levels of profitability.GE’s current valuation may be excessive versus Honeywell’s and its shares could fail to keep up with its rival.","In this article we're focusing on GE (NYSE:GE) and comparing it to Honeywell (NYSE:HON). Although GE is far bigger than Honeywell, with it having a market cap of $255 billion versus $73 billion for Honeywell, they share the same GICS sector of industrials and also sit in the same GICS sub industry of industrial conglomerates. Clearly, GE's operations are extremely diversified, ranging from airplane engines to finance products, so a perfect comparator is hard to find. However, we feel that for investors looking at how best to apportion their capital within the industrial conglomerate sub industry (and within the industry sector), a comparison between the two stocks could be useful. As ever, we welcome your suggestions on future articles and hope you enjoy the article!Strong ProfitabilityIn terms of profitability, we're impressed with GE. Although it's a huge, sprawling business it still is able to deliver reasonably strong profitability numbers, with return on equity being 11% last year and the company having an operating margin of 12%. This is impressive, since cost control can be tough to keep under wraps as a company expands, so we're pleased to see that GE is keeping a handle on its expenses column.However, GE's profitability is definitely second-best when being compared to that of Honeywell. For example, it has a return on equity of 25% and an operating margin of 14%. Impressive numbers, but what really stands out to us is Honeywell's ability to achieve these levels of profitability despite only running a relatively small amount of debt on its balance sheet. Indeed, its debt to equity ratio is just 48%, while GE's is 270%, which goes to show how successful Honeywell is at delivering a high return on equity.Income Potential?Clearly, when we're looking at so-called 'mega caps' such as these two companies, many investors are going to be concerned with yields. On this front, GE really delivers for its shareholders. For example, its forward dividend yield is 3.3% and we feel that there is scope for this to push northwards because the company has a dividend payout ratio of just 67%. For a company as mature as GE, we think this could be raised and that would mean a higher dividend for investors. Honeywell, meanwhile, also has significant scope to increase dividends, with its payout ratio standing at just 34%. Its yield at present, though, is some way behind that of GE at 1.9%, meaning the larger peer is likely to be more attractive to income seeking investors.Earnings GrowthWhere GE loses out to Honeywell, though, is in terms of earnings growth potential. Indeed, Honeywell is forecast to increase its bottom line by 11.2% next year, which is well ahead of the market and higher than GE, since it is expected to grow earnings by 9.6%. This is still an impressive number, although slightly behind Honeywell, especially when GE's sheer size and scale is taken into account.ValuationWhen looking at the two companies' valuations, we're mindful that a stock as large and as diversified as GE deserves a slight premium to its smaller peer. That's because it should deliver a more consistent growth profile going forward and is less susceptible to downturns in one or more industries, with it having exposure elsewhere to pick up the slack.However, we feel that the current valuations of the two companies indicate a mispricing. For example, GE's P/E (TTM) is 21, while Honeywell's is just 18.8. That means that GE trades at a premium of 11.7% to Honeywell based on this metric, while its PEG ratio of 2.14 is 32% higher than Honeywell's 1.62. In addition, an EV/EBITDA ratio of 22 versus just 11 for Honeywell appears to be too high in our view. As a result, we think that GE's shares could be overpriced relative to Honeywell's and, as such, it could underperform its sector peer going forward.ConclusionWe're impressed with GE's profitability, income potential and growth prospects. However, yield aside, Honeywell offers better growth and higher levels of profitability than its larger peer. Furthermore, the current valuations of the two stocks do not appear to take this into account, with GE trading at a substantial premium to Honeywell based on various valuation metrics. Therefore, we feel that GE could underperform Honeywell going forward, as investors react to what appears to be a mispricing in the market.Please follow Team Money Research for all of our latest updates on GE and many other stocks!Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

(NYSE:HON) is an equally diversified technology and manufacturing company among its four segments: namely; Aerospace, Automation and Control Solutions, Performance Materials and Technologies and Transportation Systems. The company has an active presence in the three main continents: US, Europe and Asia. Recently, the company has announced its second quarter earnings for the fiscal year 2014.Let's take a look at how the company has been performing and its future growth prospects.Recent Performance At A GlanceTop Line Growth DriversSource: International Monetary Fund 2014Despite a 4% growth in the Industrial Production, Honeywell was able to rake in revenues of $9.7 billion representing an increase of 6% compared to the corresponding quarter last year. This mid-digit growth was mainly contributed by its Automation and Control Solutions segment which had seen its quarterly sales rise by 10% on the back of positive acquisitions and growth in Environmental and Combustion Controls and Honeywell Scanning & Mobility. In the short run, the company has continued to gain from improving market conditions, product innovations and geographical expansion. Over the long haul, it has increased its backlog levels backed by positive macroeconomic trend and solid win rates.The company is also working on streamlining its business and becoming more centered on ""Great Positions in Good Industries"". Following the implementation of this strategy, it has decided to divest from businesses that do not match its long-term strategic plan. It plans to sell its Friction Materials business.The company will also combine its Transport Systems business with Aerospace during the third quarter of the current fiscal year in order to exploit the benefits of engineering and technology similarities and the shared business mechanisms of the two business divisions. As a result, the company will now be operating under three segments instead of four. This step is likely to bring in operational efficiencies in the future.Global GrowthHoneywell is looking forward to derive a CAGR of 3.5% for international defense budgets. International growth will also be achieved on the back of many large purchases of Trainers, Helo's, Fighters etc, demand from its aircraft customer MRO service providers and upgradations centering on safety and efficacy.Margin ExpansionThe company witnessed an improvement of 110 basis points in its operating income margin mainly due to the increased segment profit of every business segment, lower repositioning and other charges and higher pension income. Segment profit had shot up on the back of higher productivity and more volume sold along with additional investments made. Greater operational efficiency along with solid productivity results delivered by Turbo under the Transportation Systems segment contributed a major chunk of the margin expansion.Source: Jefferies Global Industrials Conference Presentation 2014The company expects to continue to achieve greater operational efficiency and combination benefits by merging Aerospace and Transportation Systems to form as one division. The amalgamation is anticipated to elevate the segment's 2014 margin to 19.5% from 18.2% in the prior year. The company also plans to bring fuel efficiency improvements in Helo Engines and ESPC's. Additionally, it aims to focus on maintaining advanced turbocharger technology via successful platform inaugurations.Final VerdictThe company has a promising future ahead as the world GDP and industrial production begin to pace up gradually. Also, the company is focusing on deriving cost savings by realigning its business and becoming more operationally efficient. The company's growth potential can also be checked by its capital appreciation potential. Based on the sector's P/E ""ttm"" of 25.62 and the consensus analyst estimate of EPS for the fiscal year 2014 of 5.54, the scrip's intrinsic value is estimated to be $141.93. The stock is currently trading in the market at a price of $94.20 which represents an upside potential of approximately 50%.Furthermore, the company is also paying a dividend yield of 1.89% while the average sector level is reported to be 1.62%."
2333795,54332,2014-07-23T12:15:00-04:00,The recent earnings are neither exciting nor discouraging.Expecting mid double digit growth is not a good idea at this point.Management’s high focus on excellence and five-year growth plan are great positives for long-term investment.,"Honeywell International Inc. (NYSE:HON) posted second quarter (ending June 30, 2014) earnings that were neither exciting nor discouraging to make an investment in the stock. Net sales improved by 6% in the second quarter of 2014, compared with same quarter previous year, which beat analyst estimates by $60 million. Honeywell reported EPS of $1.38 for the second quarter, which improved from $1.28 from the same quarter previous year, a growth of 8%. The company beat analyst estimates of EPS by $0.01.Honeywell operates its businesses in four segments, out of the four, Automation and Control systems reported greater growth in sales, up by 10% compared with same quarter previous year. Segment Profit wise Transportation systems posted 33% growth.From the valuation point of view, the stock is trading at higher valuation, 19.52 [ttm] times of earnings, 4.24 (mrq) times of book value, 1.92 times of sales; the company has long-term debt of $6,839 million. Considering the size of Honeywell, it is not possible to expect better results than it posted recently to justify the higher valuation or to give more room for growth in stock price. At the same time, I do not see any major downside to the stock in the near future as long as the global economy is expanding above 3% to 3.5% as the management mentioned in the recent earnings call. The global economy is expected to expand by 3.6% this year and 3.9% in 2015. In addition, it seems like there is no major threat to this growth expectation to cause any significant decline in the near future.While it is not possible to expect significant growth (like 25% - 50%) in the stock price in the one-year period because of the company's non-growth-stage nature. However, the stock has the potential to deliver slow and steady share price growth (in the range of 10% - 24.99% per year) in the next five years as the company executes its next five-year plan. Honeywell is aiming to take the total company sales to over $50 billion by 2018 that is approximately 25% growth from the full year 2014-guided sales range of $40.2 - $40.4 billion.The top management's priority is growth driven by excellence, which is the foundation for long lasting growth. In my view at the size Honeywell, many companies choose to focus on cost cuttings, acquisitions and introducing new product or service (also updating products and services) these are all normal actions of companies to grow. However, Honeywell also chooses to improve user experience at this stage, where the earnings growth is very slow. The company is going to introduce Honeywell User Experience (HUE), a new approach to the design and development of new products and services, the company has other process enablers. This kind of process will increase the brand value and customer loyalty, and the result will be much better sales.ConclusionKeeping in mind the valuation, slower growth and the management of Honeywell, whose priority is growth driven by excellence; I would invest in this company if my return expectations were low and if I am ready to stay invested for at least three years.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

It is a great stock for new investors because of its eye-catching 1.85 percent dividend yield. HON's current stock price of $97.34 is speculated to rise further so investors should use this article to determine why this stock is worth their attention.Five Year Target (2014-2018)The company held its annual investor conference to outline its new five-year targets (2014-2018) and discuss its continued outperformance and growth strategy. The company expects 2018's sales to increase organically by $7-$12 billion to $46-$51 billion and segment margins to increase 220-370 bps to 18.5-20.0%. The company also expects to deliver on its previous five-year targets by the end of this year. From an analytical point of view, I believe that company will be able to achieve its desired goals as management is planning to expand in Asia, specifically China.The company will also introduce the Honeywell User Experience (HUE), a new approach to the design and development of new products and services. HUE starts with the customer experience and deploys rapid prototyping and other design principles which enable faster cycle time and lead to increased customer value and loyalty.Over the next five years, Honeywell expects to continue to expand its margins, grow earnings at a double-digit pace, and nearly double its free cash flow. This will provide additional firepower to fund global growth opportunities and support strong shareholder returns. The company seeks to provide more than $10 billion for strategic acquisitions and expects to add approximately $5-$8 billion of sales over the next 5 years. The company aims to achieve total company sales of over $50 billion by 2018.FinancialsWith 795 million shares outstanding, the company's current annual EPS is $5.16. Analyzing the company's current EPS it is easy to understand that the company is generating healthy net income every year. Its existing P/E is 18.86 which makes the stock worthy of investment as this ratio is below the industry's ratio of 19.1. It is projected that the company's forward P/E will be 15.80; thus based on its current price, the expected EPS is $6.160. This discussion of EPS and P/E shows that company is moving towards growth-oriented results by fulfilling the short-term interests of investors.Moreover, the company is expected to continue considering investors' perspectives upfront. The company pays 32.5% of its net income as dividends. In 2013, $1.6800 was paid to investors as an annual dividend reflecting growth of 10% compared to last year. Projections based on the company's current scenario suggest that this year's annual growth in dividends will be more than 11.5%. The current dividend payout ratio and ROE of 25.04% provides 8.01% of sustainable growth to the overall organization. The following table shows the price multiple ratios in comparison with the industry.Source: CSI MarketValuationThe valuation of Honeywell's stock was done using the multiple-based valuation method using figures from finance Yahoo and CSI Market. Weights are given based on my opinion of each multiple's importance. The following table shows that the current market price of HON's stock is underpriced thus it invites investors to put this stock in their growth portfolios.Segmental AnalysisHoneywell has five business segments that generate a major portion of the company's overall revenue. The contributions of each segment are listed below.Source: CSI MarketThe table above shows that a majority of the company's revenue is generated from its Automation & Control Solutions segment. It is expected that this segment will generate 43% percent of total revenue. The performance of this segment in the last quarter (Q2-2014) was far below expectations but in my opinion the company is going to recover in the coming quarter and report outperforming results.ProjectionsThe next quarter will show 2% growth in revenue and 4.5% growth in sales. This increase in sales is in-line with the company's expectations. The company announced that its revenues would grow at a rate of 4-5% in the next 5 years. Dividend for the quarter is expected to be $0.50 because the company has a history of increasing its dividend every quarter.ConclusionFinally, I believe investors, who want a gradual increase in EPS, dividend and revenues, should consider buying this stock. The company is in a better position than its peers in the industry. HON's stock is underpriced which suggests that investors should reap the benefits of this market price. In my opinion, the company will be able to achieve the long-term goals of its five year plan. So, investors with long-term gain objectives will also benefit if they buy this stock now.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: The article has been written by a Gemstone Equity Research research analyst.

2326165,25120,2014-07-21T10:18:08-04:00,"Honeywell's shares hit fresh high in the wake of solid second quarter results.Multi-year plans, organic growth, margin expansion and valuation multiple increase all benefited shares in recent years.I wonder what could drive shares higher, not finding the current risk-reward too appealing given the cyclical nature of the business.","Investors in Honeywell (NYSE:HON) were pleased with the release of a solid set of second quarter results which pushed shares to fresh all-time highs.Shares have benefited from the economic recovery, margin expansion and general increase in stock valuations thanks to lower interest rates. All of this, combined with ambitious multi-year programs, leave me wondering what, if any, could be the next driver for shares to go higher going forwards.Second Quarter HighlightsHoneywell posted second quarter sales of $10.25 billion, up 6% compared to the year before. Sales came in ahead of consensus estimates at $10.19 billion.The company improved segment margins by another 60 basis points towards 16.7%, while reported earnings per share rose by 8% to $1.38 per share. Earnings beat consensus estimates by two pennies.The automation and control business posted the steepest sales growth, reporting a 10% increase in sales to $3.6 billion. Note that acquisitions were a big driver behind sales growth with organic growth coming in at 3%.Transportation sales rose by 8% to $1.0 billion, combined with strong margin expansion of 310 basis points. Organic growth in the segment totaled 4%.Sales at performance materials and technologies rose by 6% to $2.6 billion thanks to UOP catalyst and gas processing growth as well as increased sales of Fluorine products. Margins rose by another 30 basis points to a very impressive 18.0% of sales.Perhaps a bit disappointing was the flattish sales growth at the aerospace business with sales coming in at $3.0 billion. The very modest commercial growth was offset by a decline at the defense activities. Margins improved by another 30 basis points to 19.8% of sales.Updating On 2014 TargetsFor the current year, Honeywell has adjusted its full year targets. Sales are now seen at $40.2-$40.4 billion which would imply a 3-4% increase in annual sales. Previously, the company guided for sales of $40.3 to $40.7 billion.Despite the softer revenues, Honeywell sees segment earnings improving towards 16.8% to 17.0% of sales. Previously, the company guided for margins of 16.6% to 16.9% of sales.Earnings per share are now seen at $5.45 to $5.55 per share on a non-GAAP basis which means that the lower end of the range has been raised by five cents.Trading at $97 per share, equity in Honeywell is valued at $77 billion. This values the company's equity at 1.9 times anticipated sales and 17-18 times adjusted earnings. Despite having $6.6 billion in cash, Honeywell operates with a modest net debt position of $2.6 billion.2014-2018 PlanIn a youtube.com video, Honeywell released its new five year plan for the period 2014-2018.The company aims to post sales of $46-$51 billion by 2018 thanks to a 4-6% compounded annual increase in organic sales. This should be driven by relentless focus on innovation while the company also targets $10 billion in total merger & acquisition activity over this time period.Current segment earnings, targeted at 16.8-17.0% for this year, are set to improve towards 18.5-20.0%. At the midpoint of this range and given the anticipated sales growth, total earnings should grow at 40-45% on a cumulative basis. This translates into annual growth of about 10% for earnings, with anticipated share repurchases pushing growth potentially even higher.Based on the current valuation, Honeywell's 2018 targets values equity in the business at 1.6 times anticipated revenues and 13-14 times anticipated earnings. Note that this excludes the accretive potential from any share repurchases.Final TakeawayInvestors in Honeywell as well as other high-end industrial conglomerates have done well in recent years. Honeywell has posted solid organic growth, accompanied by bolt-on acquisitions and targeted margin expansion.Combined with greater shareholder payouts and valuation multiple expansion by the market in general, this has pushed up the share price. Shares fell from highs of $60 before the crisis to lows of $25-$30 by the end of 2008. One steady march higher has pushed shares to current highs of close to $100 per share.While I applaud all of management's intentions, I am wondering what could be the next driver behind a potential higher valuation. The company has benefited from sales growth, margin expansion and a general higher valuation of companies in the market. While continued improvements are anticipated in the new five year plan, shares are priced at rich valuation of 17-18 times adjusted earnings.While this is in line with the general market, don't forget that despite all the good intentions, Honeywell remains a cyclical play. I would urge investors to consider how much revenues dropped during the 2009 recession, and notice that only by 2012 revenues came back to the same levels as 2008.While management is making all the right moves, they simply cannot keep up with creating value amidst the strong multi-year momentum in the shares. I remain cautious and remain on the sidelines.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2268603,23945,2014-06-13T18:43:20-04:00,,"The age of the smart home has arrived. Though one of the biggest beneficiaries is a stodgy old tech name you’d probably never think of: Honeywell International (HON), the diversified manufacturer of everything from jet engines to refrigerator parts.Google (GOOG) made a big splash into the smart home market with its high-profile purchase of Nest, the maker of the Nest Learning Thermostat that actually observes your daily schedule and adjust the air conditioning accordingly. But Honeywell has been quietly carving out a large market share in the wifi-enabled smart thermostat market and, at this early stage, appears to be emerging as the early standard bearer.Summers are hot here in Dallas, so I thought I would join the ranks of those homeowners using smart thermostats to keep their electric bill tolerably low. Plus, I thought the idea of controlling my air conditioner from my phone to be irresistibly cool. But given that they start in the low $100s and can push $500, I decided to sweat it with my existing “dumb” thermostat, at least for now. Though Honeywell’s latest offering has given me reason to reconsider.Honeywell’s new Lyric thermostat takes Nest’s adaptability to a whole new level. By communicating with your smartphone, the Lyric detect when you are approaching your house and adjust the temperature accordingly. This geofence will have two settings: a 7-mile radius appropriate for those who live in the suburbs and a 500-foot radius for those that live in an urban setting.Honeywell is no Johnny-come-lately to the smart home market. My home’s security system, which is monitored by market leader ADT Corp (ADT), was manufactured by Honeywell. And Honeywell has a website dedicated to its home automation products that includes everything from programmed mini blinds to ceiling fans on a smartphone-controlled timer. Honeywell even produces smart locks that enable you to open your front door remotely from your phone or computer.And not to be relegated to the home, Honeywell announced earlier this quarter that it would be teaming up with AT&T (T) to muscle in on Gogo’s (GOGO) turf in provided fast in-flight wifi in airplanes.So, is Honeywell a buy?Yes, though not necessarily for the reasons you might think. Keep in mind that Honeywell’s smart-home products still contribute only a small amount to its top line. Its entire “automation and control solutions” unit, of which the smart-home products are a part, accounted for 42% of sales last quarter.I prefer to think of Honeywell as a reasonably-priced industrial stock with a nice embedded growth option in the form of its smart products. HON stock trades hands at 19 times trailing earnings and 15 times expected forward earnings. That’s in line with 22 and 15, respectively, at rival General Electric (GE). But aside from a brief spell in the early 2000s, Honeywell has consistently sported a higher return on equity.Honeywell also pays a modest but respectable dividend of 1.9%, and it has consistently raised its dividend since 2005. In fact, Honeywell has more than doubled its dividend over that period, and this from a cyclical industrial stock.Will you double your money in Honeywell over the next year? Probably not. But in an expensive market where value is getting harder and harder to find, I would expect HON to outpace the S&P 500 by a wide margin over the next several years.Disclaimer: This site is for informational purposes only and should not be considered specific investment advice or as a solicitation to buy or sell any securities.

2320525,20411,2014-07-17T13:28:55-04:00,Valuation matters and HON looks rich.It trades at almost 20 times earnings.But it is only growing at about 4%.,"Major growth concerns exist at Honeywell International Inc. (NYSE:HON). If the company manages to meet analysts' expectations it will be growing at a rate of 4% on a yearly basis. On a quarterly basis, the growth rate is much lower than that, but either way the stock trades at about 20 times earnings, making it rich not only when compared to the market but when compared to its overall growth rate as well.We evaluate earnings growth in two ways, using the same metric. For every quarter we calculate trailing 12 month EPS numbers so that seasonal anomalies are avoided. In our quarterly growth rate chart we compare that trailing 12 month data on a quarter by quarter basis to determine how earnings are growing every quarter. In our yearly growth rate chart we would take the trailing 12 month data from this quarter and compare it to the same quarter of the previous year to determine yearly growth for any well. By plotting this data over time we can see the changes in growth respectively.Our yearly growth rate chart shows us that after eye popping growth in 2011, Honeywell has been steadily growing slower every quarter. The company has been growing, earnings have not been contracting, but the growth rate is certainly is much slower than it was and if the company meets analyst expectations this time it will only be growing at 4%. That is only a concern if valuation matters.At 20 times earnings Honeywell is trading at five times its growth rate, and that makes it expensive. Investors in Honeywell should understand the valuation risk that exists.On a technical basis, Honeywell is very close to a level of longer-term resistance as we have defined that in our real time trading report for HON. The stock has not tested resistance officially, but it is within striking distance and by rule if the stock tests resistance and resistance remains intact we will expect a complete oscillation back down to longer term support again.In summary, although valuation risk exists our observations suggest that Honeywell could increase slightly before beginning a retracement, but unless earnings growth somehow accelerates the risks identified here will not go away.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: By Thomas H.

Portfolio123 has a powerful ranking system which allows the user to create complex formulas according to many different criteria. They also have highly useful several groups of pre-built ranking systems; I used one of them the ""All-Stars: O'Neil"" in this article. The ranking system is based on investing principles of the well-known investor William O'Neil.The ""All-Stars: O'Neil"" ranking system is quite complex, and it is taking into account many factors like EPS Growth, Sales Growth, Industry Growth, Market conditions and Margins, as shown in the Portfolio123's chart below.In order to find out how such a ranking formula would have performed during the last 15 years, I ran a back-test, which is available by the Portfolio123's screener. For the back-test, I took all the 7,014 stocks in Portfolio123's database.The back-test results are shown in the chart below. For the back-test, I divided the 7,014 companies into fifty groups according to their ranking. The chart clearly shows that the average annual return has a very significant positive correlation to the ""All-Stars: O'Neil"" rank. This brings me to the conclusion that the ranking system is useful.After running the ""All-Stars: O'Neil"" ranking system on the companies which are included in the S&P 500 index and pay a dividend with a higher than 1% yield, on March 18, I discovered the twenty best dividend stocks, which are shown in the table below. In this article, I describe the first stock of the list, Honeywell International Inc. (NYSE:HON).Source: Portfolio123Honeywell International Inc.The CompanyHoneywell International Inc. is a diversified technology and manufacturing company, serving customers worldwide with aerospace products and services, control, sensing and security technologies for buildings, homes and industry, turbochargers, automotive products, specialty chemicals, electronic and advanced materials, process technology for refining and petrochemicals, and energy efficient products and solutions for homes, business and transportation. Honeywell was incorporated in Delaware in 1985.Source: JPMorgan Aviation Transportation and Industrials Conference PresentationValuation MetricsThe table below presents the valuation metrics of HON, the data were taken from Yahoo Finance and finviz.com.Honeywell's valuation metrics are quite good; the enterprise value-to-revenue ratio is at 1.87 and the enterprise value-to-EBITDA ratio is quite low at 11.24. According to Yahoo Finance, HON's next financial year forward P/E is at 15.19, and the average annual earnings growth estimates for the next five years is quite high at 10.48%. These give a relatively low PEG ratio of 1.45.Latest Quarter ResultsOn January 24, Honeywell reported its fourth-quarter and full-year 2013 financial results, which beat EPS expectations by $0.03 (2.50%).Fourth-Quarter HighlightsIn the report, Honeywell Chairman and CEO Dave Cote said:Next Quarter ResultsHoneywell will report its first-quarter 2014 financial results on April 14. HON is expected to post a profit of $1.26 a share, a $0.05 rise from the company's actual earnings for the same quarter a year ago.DividendHoneywell has been paying uninterrupted dividends since 1970. The forward annual dividend yield is at 1.93% and the payout ratio only 34%. The annual rate of dividend growth over the past three years was quite high at 11.36%, over the past five years was at 8.77%, and over the past ten years was also high at 8.40%. I consider that besides dividend yield, the consistency and the rate of raising dividend payments are the most crucial factors for dividend-seeking investors, and HON's performance has been very good in this respect.HON's dividend is paid every quarter, as shown in the charts below.Competitors and Group ComparisonA comparison of key fundamental data between HON and its main competitors is shown in the table below.Source: Yahoo FinanceHON's valuation metrics are a bit worse than those of its main competitors. HON has a PEG ratio of 1.45 while BorgWarner (NYSE:BWA) and Johnson Controls (NYSE:JCI) have a lower PEG ratio of 1.10 and 0.93.HON's return on capital parameters have been much better than its industry median, its sector median and the S&P 500 median, as shown in the table below.Source: Portfolio123Technical AnalysisPersonally, I am using only fundamental analysis for my investment decisions. After many years of experience, and after having tried all kinds of decision making including technical analysis, I have reached the conclusion that relying on fundamental information is giving me the highest return. Nevertheless, some investors are successfully using technical analysis to find the proper moment to start an investment (I am not talking about traders; my analysis is only for investors). The charts below give some technical analysis information.Chart: finviz.comThe HON stock price is 0.54% below its 20-day simple moving average, 1.79% above its 50-day simple moving average and 9.65% above its 200-day simple moving average. That indicates a short-term downtrend, and a mid-term and a long-term uptrend.Chart: TradeStation Group, Inc.The weekly MACD histogram, a particularly valuable indicator by technicians, is negative at 0.11 and descending, which is a bearish signal (a rising MACD histogram and crossing the zero line from below is considered an extremely bullish signal). The RSI oscillator is at 61.02 which do not indicate oversold or overbought conditions.Analyst OpinionAnalyst opinion is divided, but most analysts recommend the stock. Among the twenty four analysts covering the stock, six rate it as a strong buy, eleven rate it as a buy and seven rate it as a hold.Christopher Glynn, an analyst at Oppenheimer (A four star rated analyst according to TipRanks) recommended the stock with a buy rating.DiscussionThe year of 2013 had been remarkably successful for Honeywell; it exited 2013 on a strong note with 5% organic growth in 4Q13. Productivity and a balanced portfolio offset the impact of a slow growth macro environment for the company. On March 05, an Analyst Day, Honeywell provided an update to its 5-year targets. HON had put a target of 4%-6% CAGR organic revenue growth until 2018, and 45-75 basis points per year segment margin growth. The company continues to return value to its shareholders through dividend payments and stock buybacks, and it plans to use about half of cash from operations for dividends and to fund enough stock buybacks to keep shares outstanding flat. The other half of cash from operations will fund capital expenditures and acquisitions. In contrast to other diversified Industrial companies whose financial results have fallen victim to weakness in select international end-markets over the last year, Honeywell has succeeded to produce record operating margins and double-digit earnings growth amid difficult macroeconomic conditions.RiskAccording to Honeywell, the operating results of its segments are impacted by general global industry and economic conditions that can cause changes in spending and capital investment patterns, demand for its products and services and the level of its manufacturing and shipping costs. In addition, an increasing percentage of its sales and operations is in non-U.S. jurisdictions and is subject to the economic, political, regulatory and other risks of international operations.ConclusionHoneywell has recorded very strong EPS growth, and it has strong earnings growth prospects. Furthermore, the company had put a target of strong organic revenue growth for the next five years. In my opinion, Honeywell will benefit from a strong global trend toward energy efficiency and from the increasing demand for better fuel economy. All these factors lead me to the conclusion that HON stock is a smart investment right now. Furthermore, the rich growing dividend represents a gratifying income.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2254633,54532,2014-06-05T11:25:20-04:00,"Despite a tough economic climate worldwide, Honeywell generated more than 200% shareholder return since 2009 on the back of consistent improvement in its top and bottom lines.Honeywell’s EPS grew by 11% YoY in 2013 and the company expects the EPS to grow again by more than 10% in 2014.Honeywell’s continued focus on refining its manufacturing processes is paying off, as the company is on a constant journey of improving the margins of its segments.","Honeywell International Inc. (NYSE:HON) is a manufacturing and technology company that produces a variety of commercial and consumer products, engineering services, and aerospace systems. The company has weathered the hostile macroeconomic climate since 2008, and has been reporting impressive top and bottom line results in the last five years. Honeywell announced its Q1 FY 2014 results on April 17th, 2014, beating the estimates, and the company also unveiled its five-year plan in March 2014.Past Five Years: Robust Growth Even in a Challenging Macroeconomic EnvironmentHoneywell operates in a host of industries that are impacted by various macroeconomic factors. As the recession loomed in 2008, the stock's price plummeted from more than $60 to less than $30. However, the company has done well to recover from the setback and since then Honeywell has been a story of impressive growth despite depressed global demand.Source: Google FinanceHoneywell's share produced 219% total return to shareholders since 2009 which is 1.7 times the S&P 500 index return for the same period. The company was able to increase sales by 30% over the past five years while segment margins increased 300 basis points.Source: Honeywell's 2013 Annual ReportWhat to Expect in 2014Honeywell cheered up its shareholders when it beat analysts' estimates of its Q1 FY 2014 results. The company recorded an EPS of $1.28 while the expected range was $1.24 to $1.27. On a tax-adjusted basis, EPS was up 10% YoY while sales increased by 4% compared to Q1 FY 2014.

Reuters estimates that for FY 2014 the EPS will stand at $5.54 reflecting a YoY EPS rise of 11.5%.A segment-wise breakdown of expected sales and margins improvement in FY 2014 is presented below.Growth Momentum to Continue in the Next Five YearsHoneywell revealed its five-year targets on March 5th, 2014, as it successfully concluded its previous five-year period which was announced in March 2009. The plan aims to increase sales to over $50 billion by 2018, up from $39.1 billion in 2013. Segment margins are expected to rise to 18.5%-20% from 16.3% during the same period and the company is aiming for double-digit EPS growth each year. The company has around $6.7 billion cash in hand and generated a free cash flow of $3.8 billion in 2013. Honeywell promises to double free cash flow in the next five years and to invest $10 billion to make high-return acquisitions that will boost revenues by $5 to $8 billion.An Ideal Candidate for Long Term InvestmentAs far as fundamentals go, Honeywell is brilliant. The company is rich in cash, low on debt levels, generates extraordinary cash flows, and its past and present performance favors its future outlook. The company expects double-digit EPS growth in the next five years and seems well on track to achieving that. The stock also offers a dividend yield of around 2%. Presently, Honeywell is trading at a P/E of 18.1x compared to the industry average of 21.1x. The forward P/E for the share is less than 15x.ConclusionHoneywell deserves investors' attention as it has many features of a quality investment. The revenue streams are well-diversified; the company has shown it can endure rough phases of the economic cycles; dividends and EPS have been consistently on the rise; and the company has just laid out a great road map for the next five years.

2192633,24491,2014-05-06T02:39:48-04:00,"We think Honeywell is fundamentally well-positioned.Boeing has significant flexibility to fill delivery slots in the years ahead, and the aerospace giant's nice position will have spillover benefits to suppliers, including Honeywell.Though we like Honeywell, we prefer ideas in the Best Ideas portfolio and Dividend Growth portfolio.","Honeywell (NYSE:HON) is one of our favorite industrial conglomerates on a fundamental level. Its aerospace products are used on virtually every aircraft, while its building solutions are in over 150 million homes. The company's prospects for turbo in its Transportation Systems division are also very attractive. Let's evaluate the firm through the DCF and apply the Valuentum process to shares in this article.But first, a little background to help with the understanding of some of the terminology in this piece. At our boutique research firm, we think a comprehensive analysis of a firm's discounted cash flow valuation, relative valuation versus industry peers, as well as an assessment of technical and momentum indicators is the best way to identify the most attractive stocks at the best time to buy. We think stocks that are cheap (undervalued) and just starting to go up (momentum) are some of the best ones to evaluate for addition to the portfolios. These stocks have both strong valuation and pricing support. This process culminates in what we call our Valuentum Buying Index, which ranks stocks on a scale from 1 to 10, with 10 being the best.Most stocks that are cheap and just starting to go up are also adored by value, growth, GARP, and momentum investors, all the same and across the board. Though we are purely fundamentally-based investors, we find that the stocks we like (underpriced stocks with strong momentum) are the ones that are soon to be liked by a large variety of money managers. We think this characteristic is partly responsible for the outperformance of our ideas -- as they are soon to experience heavy buying interest. Regardless of a money manager's focus, the Valuentum process covers the bases.We liken stock selection to a modern-day beauty contest. In order to pick the winner of a beauty contest, one must know the preferences of the judges of a beauty contest. The contestant that is liked by the most judges will win, and in a similar respect, the stock that is liked by the most money managers will win. We may have our own views on which companies we like or which contestant we like, but it doesn't matter much if the money managers or judges disagree. That's why we focus on the DCF -- that's why we focus on relative value -- and that's why we use technical and momentum indicators. We think a comprehensive and systematic analysis applied across a coverage universe is the key to outperformance. We are tuned into what drives stocks higher and lower. Some investors know no other way to invest than the Valuentum process. They call this way of thinking common sense.Honeywell's Investment ConsiderationsInvestment HighlightsBusiness QualityWhy We Like Honeywell's Aerospace ExposureIn the world of investing, the strength of the industry in which a firm operates is sometimes as important as the company itself. A strong industry backdrop offers the potential for fundamental upside as the industry revenue pie grows. Said differently, it is much easier for a firm to do well in an expanding industry, where both the industry's revenue pie is growing and market share opportunities are available, than it is for a firm to do well in a shrinking industry, where it may have to battle entrenched competitors in a pricing death match to gain share. Though commercial aerospace will always be cyclical (as it relates to order trends) and pricing competitiveness will always be present, the massive backlogs of unfulfilled orders (already booked) at the airframe makers is simply remarkable - with the better part of a decades' worth of orders already in hand.Boeing (NYSE:BA) showcased its enviable revenue visibility when it posted strong first-quarter results. The company ended the quarter with a total backlog of $440 billion, nearly five times the high end of its revenue guidance range for 2014 ($90.5 million). This measure is roughly flat from the end of 2013, up from $390 billion in 2012, and $355 billion in 2011 (shown in image below). Compared to revenue of just a few years ago, the current level of backlog is nearly 8 times 2011 revenue, for example - a staggering multiple given that 2011 can likely be considered mid-cycle performance, despite Boeing almost being over its head developing and producing the 787 Dreamliner at the time.Image Source: BoeingDuring the first quarter, the firm booked 235 net commercial airplane orders, and its commercial backlog swelled to over 5,100 planes valued at $374 billion. The value of the commercial backlog is more than 6 times the expected top-line results of its Commercial Airplanes segment in 2014, and the tally of unit orders is roughly 7 times expected deliveries for this year. Boeing has significant flexibility to fill delivery slots in the years ahead, and the aerospace giant's nice position will have spillover benefits to suppliers, including Honeywell.Economic Profit AnalysisThe best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital with its weighted average cost of capital. The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. Honeywell's 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 31.9%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 10.1%. As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT. In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate.Cash Flow AnalysisFirms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. Honeywell's free cash flow margin has averaged about 6.9% during the past 3 years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generation is relatively STRONG. The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. For more information on the differences between these two measures, please visit our website at Valuentum.com. At Honeywell, cash flow from operations increased about 66% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures expanded about 19% over the same time period.Valuation AnalysisOur discounted cash flow model indicates that Honeywell's shares are worth between $71-$107 each. Shares of Honeywell are trading just north of $90 each at this time, which is slightly above the midpoint of the fair value range. The margin of safety around our fair value estimate is driven by the firm's LOW ValueRisk™ rating, which is derived from the historical volatility of key valuation drivers. If Honeywell were trading below the low end of the fair value range on improving technical/momentum indicators, we'd grow very interested in shares. They'd also register a very high Valuentum Buying Index rating under those conditions.The estimated fair value of $89 per share, the mid-point of the fair value range, represents a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 18.1 times last year's earnings and an implied EV/EBITDA multiple of about 11.3 times last year's EBITDA. Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 4.6% during the next five years, a pace that is lower than the firm's 3-year historical compound annual growth rate of 5.4%. Still, we think a 4.6% annual growth rate estimate in the top line during the next five years is a rather reasonable assumption for Honeywell (it's also within management's forecasted range of 4%-6%).Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 16.6%, which is above Honeywell's trailing 3-year average. We're expecting nice operating leverage as the industrial conglomerate benefits from aerospace industry tailwinds and margin expansion in its Transportation Systems division. This should drive strong earnings expansion.Beyond year 5, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 2.7% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. We tie Honeywell's long-term growth rate to expectations of the pace of global GDP, which we view as a reasonable assumption for the global conglomerate. For Honeywell, we use a 10.1% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows.We understand the critical importance of assessing firms on a relative value basis, versus both their industry and peers. Many institutional money managers -- those that drive stock prices -- pay attention to a company's price-to-earnings ratio and price-earnings-to-growth ratio in making buy/sell decisions. With this in mind, we have included a forward-looking relative value assessment in our process to further augment our rigorous discounted cash flow process. If a company is undervalued on both a price-to-earnings ratio and a price-earnings-to-growth ratio versus industry peers, we would consider the firm to be attractive from a relative value standpoint. For relative valuation purposes, we compare Honeywell to peers 3M (NYSE:MMM), Danaher (NYSE:DHR), Tyco Inc (TYC), and United Tech (NYSE:UTX).Margin of Safety AnalysisOur discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $89 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future was known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values. Our ValueRisk™ rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock. In the graph below, we show this probable range of fair values for Honeywell. We think the firm is attractive below $71 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $107 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion.Future Path of Fair ValueWe estimate Honeywell's fair value at this point in time to be about $89 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart below compares the firm's current share price with the path of Honeywell's expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate. The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year 3 represents our best estimate of the value of the firm's shares three years hence. This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the firm's future cash flow potential change. The expected fair value of $115 per share in Year 3 represents our existing fair value per share of $89 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.Pro Forma Financial StatementsIn the spirit of transparency, we show how the performance of the Valuentum Buying Index has stacked up per underlying score as it relates to firms in the Best Ideas portfolio.

The business of these companies is dependent on the economic environment as was witnessed during the Great Depression. Diversified industrial companies were among multiple industries affected by the economic downturn then and recently. The entire industry lost its value and generated a negative return of 44% in 2008. Nevertheless, these companies took the downturn as an opportunity to restructure their business by focusing on their core products. As a result, they are now making acquisitions and dispositions, working on cost-cutting and producing innovative products.Over the past two and a half years, since the global economy started showing signs of recovery, these companies have had strong momentum and have been generating massive profits. These companies have strong business models and global exposure, which allow them to achieve strong top- and bottom-line growth. In this article, I pick one of the best companies, Honeywell International Inc (HON), to see where it stands in these circumstances. I will look at its business strategy, future prospects and financial situation to gauge either it is a perfect stock for defensive investors with low risk and high rewards.How Honeywell is a Safe Investment?Source: Morningstar.comHoneywell has been generating strong growth over the past three years as demonstrated in the above table. Its continued investment in growth opportunities, global expansion and ability to introduce new innovative products led it to generate excellent results. Honeywell is a technology and manufacturing company. It operates in four business segments including Aerospace, Automation and Control Solutions, Performance Materials and Technologies and transportation systems. All four business segments are generating strong growth for the company.In 2013, its aerospace segment has generated flat growth, but margin expansion was stronger. The Automation and Control Solutions segment has produced 4% growth and 9% growth in segment profit. The Performance Materials and Technologies segment has generated 9% growth, and Transportation segment has provided the company with 5% growth in sales. On a consolidated basis, its revenue growth was at 4%. However, with solid margin expansion, it has posted 33% growth in earnings per share.Looking forward, the company is looking to produce mid single digit growth in revenues and double digit growth in earnings. On top, recently, Honeywell announced its five-year goals. Every year until 2018, Honeywell is expecting to generate double digit growth in earnings. Further, it is looking to double its cash flows as well. To do this, it is expecting to invest more than $10 billion on strategic acquisitions that will add nearly $5 to $10 billion in revenues. Further, it will continue to invest to produce innovative products and will continue to generate strong growth with its recent additions to product portfolio.The maturity of its key process enablers - Velocity Product Development (VPD), the Honeywell Operating System (HOS), Functional Transformation (FT) and at the moment the Honeywell User Experience (HUE) all providing revenue and margin growth well into the future. The company products like Honeywell's Wi-Fi Smart Thermostat with voice control and cloud-based voice control solutions are generating solid organic growth for the company. Further, it has been experiencing strong acceleration in the commercial aftermarket ESS, Turbo and Advanced Materials. All this suggests a modest improvement in end market conditions. At the end of last year, its ASS solutions order backlog was at double digits and defense backlog was up around 20%.Ability to Sustain ReturnsHoneywell has been returning significant cash to investors over the years in the form of dividends, buybacks and price appreciation. The below chart demonstrates this trend.HON data by YChartsWith a smart investment strategy and solid financial performance, Honeywell has been able to enhance investor confidence over the years. The company's stock price surged nearly 191%, and dividend growth is at 45%. I believe the company has more promising days to come in the next five years as it is looking to generate double digit growth in earnings each year.Over the past three years, it has increased quarterly dividends by 45%. Recently, it increased the quarterly dividend to $0.45/share which takes it annual dividend to $1.80. Its strong cash generating potential allowed it to make massive increases in dividends. Its free cash flows are twice than its dividend payments. In 2013, it has generated around $3.3 billion in free cash flows and only paid $1.3 billion in dividends. This big gap offers a lot of room for future increases. Further, the company is continuously working on a buyback program which is further enhancing its dividend and share price. Its payout ratio based on income of only 33% is not only manageable but also offers potential for more increases in the coming days.Going forward, as the company is looking to generate double digit growth in earnings and nearly doubling its cash flows, I expect dividends to double in the coming five years. With all these positives, I expect the share price to keep up its upward trend. Its continued buyback program will also enhance both share price and dividends.In conclusionHoneywell's strong product portfolio and solid footprints in global markets will keep allowing it to entice investors. The company's continued investment in growth opportunities including strategic acquisitions will lead it to produce double digit growth. Its dividends are completely safe, and the company has full potential to double them in the coming five years. I believe trading at 18 times to earnings, Honeywell is still a good pick for defensive investors, and it is set to generate big profits for investors in the coming days.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1992991,56962,2014-02-04T15:45:14-05:00,,"Honeywell International Inc. (NYSE:HON) has been the focus of many recent analyst reports. The company deals in a variety of industrial products and solutions ranging from the aerospace and automotive industries to technologies related to building and construction all over the world.The company recently reported its Q4 fiscal year 2013 results so I will have a brief look at these figures in this article. I will also discuss the company's full fiscal 2013 results compared to the previous year but my article will focus more upon the company's future outlook. In order to determine whether or not this company is a profitable opportunity for investors I will consider the on-going and recent favorable activities initiated by the company as well as future growth from the industry.To begin, I will first analyze the company's segments that contribute to its revenue growth along with an overview of the company's revenue performance.Q4 and Fiscal 2013 Top Line Overview and Growth DriversThe company has disclosed a turnover of $10.39 billion for Q4 fiscal year 2013. This figure reflects an increase of 8.4% from 4Q2012's figure. The company's Q4 fiscal year 2013 revenue has also beaten the consensus estimate of $10.19 billion. In order to further analyze revenue I will conduct a segmental analysis to determine the major revenue generating segments of the company. Source: HON 10K Report and PresentationFrom the table above it is evident that automation and control solutions generate around 42% of the total revenue earned by the company from 2010-2012. This is followed by the aerospace segment that has been recording a decline in revenue contribution and growth as it generated 30.7% of company's total revenue in 2013 compared to 33% in 2010. The company's performance materials and technologies segment recorded the highest revenue growth of 9.4% in 2013. The transportation segment contributed the least to the company's aggregated revenue but recorded a 5.4% growth in its revenue for the current year. I will now determine the future outlook of these segments. Through this, we will be able to determine whether or not these segments will continue to generate revenues in the future.Future Outlook of Revenue DriversAerospace Segment's Growth Derived from Overall Recovery in the IndustryThis segment of the company deals with products related to air transport, aviation, defense and space. According to Deloitte, Global Aerospace and the Defense Industry is expected to record a revenue growth of 5% in 2014. This will mainly be led by double-digit growth in the commercial aerospace industry as the defense sector is expected to record a decline.Source: DeloitteBy 2023, a significant rise of 25% in commercial aircraft annual production levels is being anticipated and the growth trend has been portrayed in the graph above. As far as the defense sector is concerned an increase in defense spending in the Middle East, China, Japan, South Korea and Brazil will offset a bit of the decline in global defense spending due to military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The commercial segment was previously hurt by the global economic slowdown but as the world has started recovering from the slump the segment will receive a boost. This can be seen in the company's current backlog and orders.Automation and Control Solutions' Growth Derived from Overall Recovery in IndustryThis segment offers energy, safety and security solutions for homes, buildings as well as industrial plants. The rise in construction activities and growth in buildings will derive growth for the automation and control solutions segment of the company so I will turn my focus upon the outlook of the global building and construction industry.Government spending, economic and population growth and urbanization will be the drivers for the upcoming growth of this industry. Due to growth in these sectors, the global construction market is forecasted to reach a worth of $15 trillion by 2025. China, India and the US will contribute 60% to this overall global growth.Performance Materials and Technologies' Growth Derived from Innovation as per Market TrendThis segment provides advanced materials in the form of chemicals and technologies to various industries. The recently formed partnership will benefit the company in boosting the sales derived from this segment.Partnership to Cater to Emerging Demand For New Refrigerant with Lower Global Warming PotentialThe company recently became a partner of the Japanese manufacturer Asahi Glass Company Ltd to manufacture more environmentally-friendly automobile refrigerant. This type of technology has been witnessing increased demand due to environmental and global warming concerns all around the world. The new technology that the company will be supplying is the HFO-1234yf model that has a 99.9% lower global-warming potential in contrast to the technology presently in use. The production of new refrigerant is expected to begin mid-2015. Environmental laws will also oblige consumers to install this technology such as the EU MAC Directive that aims to lessen greenhouse gas emissions of air-conditioning systems in passenger cars and light commercial vehicles. Auto manufacturers in the U.S. are also embracing HFO-1234yf to conform to Corporate Average Fuel Economy (NYSEARCA:CAFE) and vehicle greenhouse gas standards. The objective of these initiatives is to improve the average fuel economy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with cars and light trucks. So, Honeywell along with its suppliers will invest $300 million to enhance capacity for the technology's production.Around half a million cars on the road now-a-days safely use HFO-1234yf and up until 2014 the number of vehicles is anticipated to pass 2 million. As a result of the company taking the initiative to work with changing consumer preference this segment is likely to improve in the future.Transportation Systems' Growth Derived From Rising Demand for TurbochargersThis segment deals in turbochargers, thermal systems and other friction materials used in vehicles. When installed in engines turbochargers boost a vehicle's efficiency and create an enhanced power output. This addresses the rising consumer concerns for fuel economy as well as controlling CO2 emissions. The market volume of turbochargers is predicted to be 39.45 million units by 2017 mainly led by demand growth from Europe. Honeywell is regarded as a key player in this industry and will continue to grow.Bottom Line to Perform Even BetterThe preceding information dealt with the growth prospects of the company's top line. Now, I will briefly discuss the company's bottom line performance.The company's growth in this quarter's net income will amaze you because it recorded an increase of 13% in contrast to the previous fiscal year's Q4. This resulted in EPS $0.03 ahead of Wall Street's estimate of $1.21 for the quarter. Margins improved due to the fine-tuning of internal operations.Source: Company PresentationsFrom the table above, you can observe a positive change in the basis points of the segments' margins year-over-year with the exception of the transportation systems segment in 2012. This has allowed the company to attain an attractive EPS growth. Overall, the company had a very prosperous fiscal year 2013. Revenues increased by 4% in fiscal year 2013 compared to the previous year while EPS reached $4.97 reflecting an increase of 11% compared to fiscal year 2012 and also ahead of the $4.95 EPS expectations made by analysts. Looking ahead, the company has not exhausted its opportunities to gain more margins. The company has initiatives to reduce its costs and plans to switch to smaller and more efficient facilities in terms of energy utilization as well as other operational matters.Targets Ahead and ConclusionHoneywell outdid the industry during the dark days of the economic downturn so it is justifiable to keep an optimistic view regarding the company's upcoming performance and position. The company plans to grow its EPS by 8-12% on the back of the 3-4% sales growth in fiscal year 2014. Argus has recently set a price target of $99-101 for Honeywell's stock regarding it as a buy. Analysts at Langenberg & Company also changed their ranking of Honeywell's stock from hold to buy increasing their price target for the stock from $90 to $100. Zacks has a price target of $94 for the company's stock. The stock is currently trading around $89.74 so there is still a chance to make capital gains from buying the stock.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: The article has been written by a Blackstone Equity Research research analyst.

1980941,24491,2014-01-30T12:22:26-05:00,,"There has been a lot of controversy over what may happen to Honeywell's (NYSE:HON) distributable cash flow -- whether share buybacks or dividends will become more important in the years and decades ahead (these are two of the ways a company can return cash to shareholders). Management was intent on bolstering its buyback program (see here), but should dividend growth investors now be worried? Let's dive in.But first, a little background on dividend growth investing. History has revealed that the best-performing stocks during the previous decades have been those that shelled out ever-increasing cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. Unfortunately for the individual investor, most dividend analysis that we've seen out there is backward-looking - meaning it rests on what the company has done in the past: how long it has raised its dividend, etc.Although analyzing historical trends is important, we also think assessing what may happen in the future is even more important. That is why we created a forward-looking assessment of dividend safety through our innovative, predictive dividend-cut indicator, the Valuentum Dividend Cushion™. We use our future forecasts for free cash flow and expected dividends and consider the company's net cash position to make sure that each company is able to pay out such dividend obligations to you -- long into the future. In this article, let's evaluate the dividend growth prospects of Honeywell.Image Source: ValuentumFirst of all, Honeywell's dividend yield is solid, offering a 2% annual payout at recent price levels - we prefer yields above 3% and don't include firms with yields below 2% in our dividend portfolio. But for a company as solid as Honeywell, we're keeping a close eye on the firm. And here's why.For starters, we think the safety of Honeywell's dividend is GOOD. We measure the safety of the dividend in a unique but very straightforward fashion. As many know, earnings can fluctuate in any given year, so using the payout ratio in any given year has some limitations. Plus, companies can often encounter unforeseen charges, which makes earnings an even less-than-predictable measure of the safety of the dividend in any given year. We know that companies won't cut the dividend just because earnings have declined or they had a restructuring charge that put them in the red for the quarter (year). As such, we think that assessing the cash flows of a business allows us to determine whether it has the capacity to continue paying these cash outlays well into the future.That has led us to develop the forward-looking Valuentum Dividend Cushion™. The measure is a ratio that sums the existing cash a company has on hand plus its expected future free cash flows over the next five years and divides that sum by future expected dividends over the same time period. Basically, if the score is above 1, the company has the capacity to pay out its expected future dividends. As income investors, however, we'd like to see a score much larger than 1 for a couple reasons: 1) the higher the ratio, the more ""cushion"" the company has against unexpected earnings shortfalls, and 2) the higher the ratio, the greater capacity a dividend-payer has in boosting the dividend in the future. For Honeywell, this score is 2.6, offering both a nice ""cushion"" and revealing excess capacity for future dividend growth (above and beyond our existing dividend growth projections--please view bottom right table in the image above). The beauty of the Dividend Cushion is that it can be compared apples-to-apples across companies. For example, Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) scores a 1.5 on this measure. We often use the dividend cushion as a key decision component in choosing companies for addition to the portfolio of our Dividend Growth Newsletter.Now on to the potential growth of Honeywell's dividend. As we mentioned above, we think the larger the ""cushion"" the larger capacity it has to raise the dividend. However, such dividend growth analysis is not complete until after considering management's willingness to increase the dividend. As such, we evaluate the company's historical dividend track record. If there have been no dividend cuts in 10 years, the company has a nice growth rate, and a nice dividend cushion, its future potential dividend growth would be EXCELLENT, which is the case for Honeywell.However, we don't just stop there -- we make it easy for the individual investor to view the health of a dividend with a simple view of a matrix. Also in the image above, one can see that Honeywell has a very solid dividend--the cross section of its GOOD safety and EXCELLENT future potential growth scores. And because capital preservation is always an important consideration (and prudent necessity for investors), we assess the risk associated with the potential for capital loss (offering dividend growth investors a robust and straightforward picture). In Honeywell's case, we think the shares are fairly valued, so the risk of capital loss is MEDIUM. If we thought Honeywell was undervalued, we'd consider the risk to be LOW.All things considered, we like the potential growth and safety of Honeywell's dividend. The only issue we see right now is that its yield is a bit low to get us excited. We'd wait for a dividend increase or a pullback in the shares to consider it a nice income play. We don't think Honeywell's management will sacrifice dividend growth for its ambitious share buyback program. Free cash flow is quite robust.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1970011,42201,2014-01-27T11:41:11-05:00,,"On January 24th Honeywell (NYSE:HON) released its 4th quarter and full-year results for 2013. Revenues are up by 4% compared to FY2012, at $39.055 billion. Earnings per share were up by an amazing 11%, reaching $4.97. The company aims to increase its EPS by another 8%-12% in fiscal year 2014. Does this mean Honeywell is a good stock to own at the current price of $88.47? This is the question I will be trying to answer in this article.After a rise of just over 30% in the last 12 months, Honeywell is now trading just below its 52-week high of $91.56. This means the company is now valued at 17.8 times 2013's earnings per share. Analysts expect Honeywell EPS to reach $5.54 in the current fiscal year, which gives us a forward p/e ratio of only 16.0. As we can see in the graph below, Honeywell has traded at much higher multiples in recent years. Its 10-year average p/e ratio stands at 18.7 despite the massive drop in 2008 and 2009. If analyst expectations for 2014's EPS are correct, the stock would have to grow by 17.1% to $103.60 to reach its 10-year average p/e ratio.Honeywell's revenues in 2013 were only 6.8% higher than in 2008. However, net income has gone from $2.79 billion in 2008 to $3.96 billion in 2013, an increase of 41.9%. Honeywell has managed to increase its profit margins to over 10%, as can be seen in the graph below.Honeywell pays a dividend of $0.45 per share each quarter, giving it an annual dividend yield of 2.03%. This is not a very high yield compared to its competitors. General Electric (NYSE:GE) for example has a current yield of 3.53%, while 3M (NYSE:MMM) yields 2.63%. However, current yield is not the only thing that's important to dividend investors. Honeywell's payout ratio for 2013 was only 34.1%. This means there is plenty more room to grow. Furthermore, Honeywell's dividend is protected by a rock solid balance sheet with $6.422 billion in cash. This means Honeywell has $8.18 per share in cash. At the current rate of $0.45 per quarter, Honeywell has enough cash to pay four and a half years worth of dividends. With current assets of $21.16 billion and current liabilities of $14.21 billion, the company has a very healthy current ratio of 1.49. Long term debt stands at $6.801 billion, a number I consider to be quite sustainable.Conclusion:Honeywell's high expected growth for fiscal year 2014 has lowered its forward p/e ratio to only 16.0. This means Honeywell is now a lot cheaper than in recent years. Honeywell has managed to increase its margins at a very impressive rate, which has led to EPS going up dramatically. Honeywell's dividend yield is quite low compared to its peers, but a low payout ratio and large pile of cash mean the company has plenty of room for dividend raises. I wouldn't be surprised to see Honeywell's dividend get raised to $0.50 near the end of 2014.Disclaimer: I am not a registered investment advisor and do not provide specific investment advice.

1964401,23625,2014-01-23T18:37:27-05:00,,"Honeywell International (NYSE:HON) is set to report FQ4 2013 earnings before the market opens on Friday, January 24. Honeywell is an over 100 year old American multinational company that invents and manufactures different technologies in consumer products, engineering services and aerospace systems. To the average person however, they are perhaps most well known for their home thermostats. Here's how the buy-side expects Honeywell to report Friday.The information below is derived from data submitted to the Estimize.com platform by a set of Buy Side and Independent analyst contributors.(Click Here to see All Estimates for Honeywell)The current Wall Street consensus expectation is for Honeywell to report $1.22 EPS and $10.199B revenue while the current Estimize.com consensus from 10 Buy Side and Independent contributing analysts is $1.23 EPS and $10.171B revenue. This quarter the buy-side as represented by the Estimize.com community is expecting Honeywell to beat the Wall Street consensus on both profit, but come up short on revenue.The magnitude of the difference between the Wall Street and Estimize consensus numbers often identifies opportunities to take advantage of expectations that may not have been priced into the market. In this case we are seeing a smaller differential between the two groups' forecasts.Through the past two years Honeywell has established a great track record of beating the Wall Street consensus on profit. Over the past eight quarters Honeywell has beaten the Street's forecast every time.On the revenue side Honeywell has been a lot less predictable, and the analysts on Estimize.com seem to have noticed. Throughout the past two years Honeywell has missed the Wall Street consensus on revenue five out of eight times.Over the previous six quarters the Estimize.com consensus has been more accurate than Wall Street in predicting HON's EPS and revenue four and three times, respectively. By tapping into a wider range of contributors including hedge-fund analysts, asset managers, independent research shops, students and non professional investors Estimize has created a data set that is up to 69.5% more accurate than Wall Street, but more importantly it does a better job of representing the market's actual expectations. It has been confirmed by an independent academic study from Rice University that stock prices tend to react with a more strongly associated degree to the expectation benchmark from Estimize than from the Wall Street consensus. The distribution of estimates published by analysts on Estimize range from $1.22 to $1.25 EPS and $10.040B to $10.239B in revenues. This quarter we're seeing a large distribution of estimates compared to previous quarters.The size of the distribution of estimates relative to previous quarters often signals whether or not the market is confident that it has priced in the expected earnings already. A larger distribution of estimates signaling the potential for greater volatility post earnings, or smaller vice versa.This quarter the Wall Street profit consensus has edged higher from $1.21 to $1.22 EPS while the revenue forecast has fallen from $10.214B to $10.199B. Meanwhile the Estimize EPS consensus has returned to its starting point of $1.23 and the Estimize revenue consensus has recently fallen from a high of $10.191B to $10.171B. Timeliness is correlated with accuracy, and a decrease in the community consensus going into the report is often a bearish indicator. The analyst with the highest estimate confidence rating this quarter is danvk who projects $1.25 EPS and $10.049B in revenue. In the Winter 2014 season, danvk is currently ranked as the second best analyst and is ranked 49th overall among over 3,500 contributing analysts. Estimate confidence ratings are calculated through algorithms developed by deep quantitative research which looks at correlations between analyst track records and tendencies as they relate to future accuracy. danvk agrees with the Estimize community that Honeywell will beat the Street on profit and miss on revenue, but danvk projects that consensus out to a much higher magnitude.Disclosure: None."
1975451,25120,2014-01-29T05:31:44-05:00,,"Investors in Honeywell (NYSE:HON) are slightly disappointed with a soft outlook for the current first quarter. While Honeywell moves along nicely on its margin expansion trajectory, the current valuation has increased significantly on historical standards. At this point in the cycle, despite the solid strategy, I remain cautious and stay on the sidelines.Solid End To 2013Honeywell reported fourth quarter revenues of $10.39 billion, up 8.4% on the year before, and ahead of consensus estimates at $10.2 billion.The company reported fourth quarter earnings of $964 million, up significantly from the $255 million reported last year. Diluted earnings per share came in at $1.19 per share. Adjusted earnings of $1.24 per share came in ahead of consensus estimates at $1.21 per share.The results marked the end of 2013 a very successful year for Honeywell in which revenues rose to $39.06 billion while earnings advanced to $3.96 billion.Accelerating growthReported revenue growth of 8.4% in the final quarter was solid, driven by 5% organic growth. Fourth quarter growth easily surpassed the annual growth rates of 3.7%.Despite the strong growth in revenues, absolute cost of goods sold actually fell slightly, being a huge boost to margins and earnings.The aerospace business reported third quarter revenues of $3.10 billion, up 3% on the year before after reporting flat growth for the year. Commercial growth and excellence boosted segment margins by 60 basis points to 20.5% of sales.The automation and control business reported solid 10% revenue growth for the final quarter, to $4.58 billion. Acquisitions and innovations drove results even as margins fell by 20 basis points to 15.3% due to dilutive acquisitions.Performance materials and technologies segment's sales growth accelerated to 12% in the final quarter, driven by the Thomas Russell acquisition and solid organic growth. Strong sales leverage and productivity resulted in 210 basis points expansion to 15.7% of sales.Transportation was the best performing business, reporting 16% revenue growth as margins rose by 250 basis points to 13.6%. New launches and an uptick in Chinese vehicle demand drove results.Outlook For 2014For the current year, Honeywell sees revenues of $40.3 to $40.7 billion, up 3-4% compared to 2013. Segment margins are expected to improve by 30 to 60 basis points to 16.6-16.9%.Operating margins are expected to show greater improvements, increasing 100 to 130 basis points to 15.2-15.5%. This should result in earnings per share of $5.35-$5.55 per share, up 8 to 12% compared to 2013.While Honeywell is guiding for solid full year growth, the guidance for the first quarter is a bit soft. Revenues are seen between $9.6 and $9.8 billion, below consensus estimates at $9.87 billion. Excluding the impact of sales and acquisitions, organic revenue growth will slow down to 2-4%, down from a 5% reported in the fourth quarter. The company remains confident that the growth picture remains intact.Efficiency Is Driving Earnings And ReturnsOver the past year, net earnings of Honeywell expanded to 10% after tax. Revenues rose by 20% over the past three years while earnings doubled and Honeywell has been able to continuously find efficiency gains. Further improvements are seen in the coming year.These achievements have driven returns for investors as shares have risen from lows of just $25 in 2009 to current highs approaching $90. Increased dividends to $0.45 per quarter, provides investors with a 2.0% dividend yield in the meantime. While Honeywell has complemented this with accretive acquisitions, Honeywell still has a solid balance sheet. The firm holds $6.4 billion in cash and liquidity, operating with a modest net debt position of just $0.5 billion.What's Left For Shareholders?After the strong run-up in recent years as part of its five-year plan, Honeywell is now a $70 billion industrial conglomerate. After shares saw 30% returns over the past year, which are in line with the wider market, they trade at 17-18 times earnings.As such shares have been driven on the back of relatively modest sales growth, aggressive margin expansion and valuation multiple expansion, which is driven by lower interest rates. As margin expansion possibilities going forward might be exhausted at some point in time, and rates could increase, the risk-reward ratio is not too compelling for shareholders at this point. How much could lower rates and multiple expansion really drive shares forward at this point?Key points to look forward to remain margins, especially after 2014 as Honeywell remains vulnerable, just like the rest of the market, to tapering by the Federal Reserve.Therefore, I can only conclude that shares are ""fairly"" valued, yet I don't see reasons for excessive optimism or pessimism at current levels. I remain on the sidelines.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

In order to reduce aircraft fuel consumption on the ground, aircraft manufacturing companies are incorporating a green taxiing system in their aircraft.This will help the airliners reduce fuel consumption on the ground, which is around 6% of the total fuel consumption.Honeywell (NYSE:HON), in partnership with Safran (OTCPK:SAFRF), is working on developing the Electric Green Taxiing System, or EGTS, a hybrid TaxiBot. This system will use the aircraft's Auxiliary Power Unit, or APU, to power electric motors, which are attached to the main landing gear wheels. This architecture is designed to allow pilots to keep full control of the aircraft's speed and direction during taxi operations.Electric Green Taxiing SystemThis system will save taxiing time, reduce aircraft fuel consumption, and reduce taxiing-related emissions by 4% per trip for single-aisle aircraft by eliminating the use of engines during taxiing. In order to develop more fuel-efficient aircraft and boost their order book, aircraft manufacturing companies are focusing on incorporating EGTS in their aircraft. It is expected that airline operators could save around $200,000 annually on each aircraft with EGTS. Further, it will also reduce total flight time and ease airport traffic.Honeywell and Safran are expected to compete with the TaxiBot manufacturing company, Lufthansa (OTCQX:DLAKF), which will offer its taxiing services to airline operators in 2014. TaxiBots are used to tow the plane and are controlled by the pilot in the cockpit. It is expected that with the use of this TaxiBot, airliners will able to reduce taxiing-related time and fuel consumption. The TaxiBot cost around $1 million for the narrow body version aircraft and double for a larger TaxiBot model, which is capable of towing jumbo jets. By incorporating TaxiBot in the Airbus super-jumbo jet A380, which required taxiing time of around 10 minutes, airliners are able to cut the taxi-related fuel consumption by 95%, or a net savings of 130 gallons of jet fuel, costing nearly $400 per departure.Further, a Boeing (NYSE:BA) 747 requires taxiing time of 17 minutes and consumes 330 gallons of jet fuel. However, with the use of TaxiBot, the same process requires only 8 gallons of fuel and emits less carbon dioxide. In smaller aircrafts, like the Boeing single-aisle aircraft-737, the TaxiBot could save around 35 gallons, or $100, for taxiing it to the end of the runway. It is estimated that this will help airliners significantly reduce taxiing-related fuel consumption.Deal for EGTS with AirbusIn December, the aircraft manufacturing division of European Aeronautic Defence & Space (OTCPK:EADSY), Airbus, signed a MoU, with both Honeywell and Safran to develop an EGTS for its A320 family aircraft. The Airbus A320 is the most Eco-efficient single-aisle aircraft, and with this electric taxiing, Airbus is looking to enhance the A320's fuel-efficiencies and capabilities. This will in turn allow airliners to push their aircraft away from the gate as well as taxi in and out to runways using the electric motors attached in their wheels, without igniting the main engines.Airbus has a strong backlog of around 4,229 aircraft of the A320 family as of November 30, 2013, for which Honeywell is developing the EGTS. I expect Airbus, by incorporating this system in all of its A-320 family aircraft, will meet airliners' demands for more fuel-efficient aircraft, which will generate a significant growth opportunity. The rise in the order book for the A320 family aircraft will enhance the orders for additional EGTS, providing opportunities for both Honeywell and Safran to strengthen their financial position.Divestiture of non-core businessIn order to strengthen its earning capabilities, Honeywell is also undergoing operational restructuring, divesting its non-core business. This will allow the company to focus on its long-term goal in its core technological business and will enable it to improve its overall financial position.Honeywell recently signed a deal with Federal-Mogul (NASDAQ:FDML) to sell its friction material business unit for around $155 million. The transaction is expected to be completed by the second half of this year. This unit manufactures disc pads and braking system components for original equipment manufacturing companies. Honeywell underwent substantial restructuring in the past two years to improve the margins of this unit and achieved its target. However, the company doesn't consider this unit in-line with its core-differentiated technologies or its long-term growth plans, so it planned for the unit's divestiture.This divestiture will allow Honeywell to realign its portfolio, concentrate on its core business, and reduce the risks related to its non-integration. It is estimated that this transaction will incur a loss of nearly $0.04 per share for the last quarter of 2013. However, the company's past decisions have strengthened its presence among peer companies, which helped Honeywell to strengthen its earning capabilities and improve its financial position. Concentrating on its core business will allow Honeywell to generate significant value for its stakeholders.On the other hand, by acquiring Honeywell's friction material business segment, Federal-Mogul is expected to strengthen its business operations. This will enable Federal-Mogul to integrate its global friction business, which will provide better braking technology to customers. It is expected that this transaction will strengthen the manufacturing and engineering segment of Federal-Mogul's brake platform and enhance its competitive manufacturing capacities and capabilities. This will allow the company to serve global customers, both original equipment manufacturing and the aftermarket, covering passenger car, light truck, commercial vehicle, railway and other industrial applications with cost-leadership and innovative solutions.ConclusionBy signing the strategic alliance with Airbus for its EGTS, Honeywell is expected to build strong financial positions. I expect, if the company is able to receive orders from other aircraft manufacturers, this will enhance its earning capabilities further. Additionally, divesting its friction material business unit will enable Honeywell to concentrate on its core business, which will help the company outshine its competitors.Despite the EPS loss from this divestiture, the company expects its 2014 EPS to be in the range of $5.35 to $5.55 compared to the 2013 EPS guidance of $4.90 to $4.95. I believe the company will able to achieve its 2014 EPS guidance comfortably by signing more agreements with the aircraft manufactures. Further, trailing at a PE of 22.09 with a forward PE of 16.14 depicts the company's high growth potential, and the company's higher EPS guidance for 2014 is expected to maintain investors' interest in the stock. Investors can add Honeywell stock to their portfolio with the long-term prospective for higher capital gains.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1907431,25120,2013-12-19T11:10:15-05:00,,"Investors in Honeywell (NYSE:HON) are not pleased with the ""conservative"" outlook for 2014, with both revenues and earnings falling short of consensus estimates. As shares have risen more than a third this year, the stock price has vastly outperformed the operational improvements, resulting in increased valuation multiples.This, combined with slow growth and a more than fair valuation, leaves me standing on the sidelines.2014 GuidanceOn Tuesday, Honeywell released its 2014 outlook, seeing revenues between $40.3 and $40.7 billion, up 4 to 5% compared to 2013. Sales growth is driven by expected organic growth of 3 to 4%. Analysts were looking for 2014 revenues of $41.1 billion, as Honeywell's CFO calls global GDP growth not as robust as the company would like to see. This is important, as the company derives more than half of its total revenues from abroad.On top of that, operating margins are seen up by 50 to 80 basis points compared to 2013, implying operating margins of 15.3 to 15.6%. This margin expansion is driven by an expected $125 million in saving as part of a long term restructuring program.All of this will result in expected earnings per share growth of 8 to 12%, with earnings seen anywhere between $5.35 and $5.55 per share. Analysts were looking for 2014 earnings of $5.55 per share. CEO and Chairman Dave Cote commented on the outlook:ValuationBack in October, Honeywell reported its third quarter earnings. The company ended the quarter with $5.50 billion in cash and equivalents. Total debt stands at $8.61 billion, for a net debt position of $3.1 billion.Revenues for the first nine months of the year came in at $28.7 billion, up 2.1% on the year before. Net earnings rose by 12.0% to $3.00 billion. Full year revenues are seen around $39 billion, with earnings around $4.90 per share, implying annual earnings of $3.8 billion.Trading around $87 per share, the market values Honeywell at $68 billion. This values equity in the business at 1.7 times annual revenues and 17-18 times annual earnings.Honeywell recently hiked its quarterly dividend to $0.45 per share, for an annual dividend yield of 2.1%.Some Historical PerspectiveLong-term investors in Honeywell have seen excellent returns driven by the very impressive run up in the shares post the financial crisis. From a peak around $60 in 2007, shares more than halved to lows of $25 during the crisis. Ever since, shares have seen a steady but impressive recovery to current all-time highs in the mid to high eighties.Underlying these returns is Honeywell's five year plan. Between 2009 and 2013, Honeywell is expected to grow its annual revenues by a cumulative 30% to $39 billion. Earnings rose sharply from $1.5 billion to $3.8 billion in the meantime following impressive margin expansion.Investment ThesisHoneywell has great business diversification, and these diverse businesses within its portfolio moderate both the cyclical upswings as well as downturns. Under its long term plan, Honeywell has boosted margins in every major business unit this year, and is expected to do so again in 2014.On top of that, every business unit is expected to display topline growth in 2014. While aerospace revenues are seen between flat and plus 2%, growth in the transportation, automation and control, and performance materials business is seen anywhere between 3 and 7%. Merger and acquisition activity, a solid backlog and further momentum in the recovery cycle, are the drivers behind this growth.All of this could lead up to $4 billion in free cash flows next year, allowing Honeywell to boost its capital expenditures budget by 30% to $1.2 billion to boost organic growth rates. Cash is further intended for merger and acquisition opportunities and dividends.Back in April, when Honeywell acquired RAE Systems in a $340 million deal, I last took a look at the company's prospects. Shares traded around $75 per share at the time of writing, as I concluded to remain on the sidelines, citing modest revenue growth despite margin expansion opportunities.Shares have continued to increase, notably on the back of these savings and the general strong market performance ever since, as I see no reason to change my opinion.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1955241,24491,2014-01-20T11:53:01-05:00,,"In December, Honeywell (NYSE:HON) approved an authorization to repurchase up to $5 billion of its common stock, now that the firm's previous $3 billion share repurchase program approved in 2011 is substantially complete. We encourage Honeywell management to be a bit cautious buying back shares at current levels on the basis of our estimate of the firm's intrinsic value and the undeniable cyclicality of its operations. We'd prefer management hang on to cash and buy shares back aggressively during the next economic downturn, which will inevitably come. As part of our process, we perform a rigorous discounted cash-flow methodology that dives into the true intrinsic worth of companies. In Honeywell's case, we think the firm is fairly valued at $77.We think a comprehensive analysis of a firm's discounted cash-flow valuation and relative valuation versus industry peers is the best way to identify the most attractive stocks at the best time to buy. This process culminates in what we call our Valuentum Buying Index, which ranks stocks on a scale from 1 to 10, with 10 being the best. Essentially, we're looking for firms that overlap investment methodologies, thereby revealing the greatest interest by investors (we like firms that fall in the center of the diagram below):Honeywell posts a VBI score of 7 on our scale, reflecting our 'fairly valued' DCF assessment of the firm, its attractive relative valuation versus peers, and bullish technicals. We compare Honeywell to peers 3M (NYSE:MMM), Danaher (NYSE:DHR), and Tyco Intl (TYC).Investment ConsiderationsInvestment HighlightsBusiness QualityEconomic Profit AnalysisThe best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital - ROIC - with its weighted average cost of capital - WACC. The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. Honeywell's 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 29.1%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 10.2%. As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT. In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate.Cash Flow AnalysisFirms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. Honeywell's free cash flow margin has averaged about 7.6% during the past 3 years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generation is relatively STRONG. The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. For more information on the differences between these two measures, please visit our website at Valuentum.com. At Honeywell, cash flow from operations decreased about 16% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures expanded about 36% over the same time period.Valuation AnalysisThe estimated fair value of $77 per share represents a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 20.8 times last year's earnings and an implied EV/EBITDA multiple of about 12.5 times last year's EBITDA. Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 4.4% during the next five years, a pace that is lower than the firm's 3-year historical compound annual growth rate of 6.8%. Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 15%, which is above Honeywell's trailing 3-year average. Beyond year 5, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 1.7% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For Honeywell, we use a 10.2% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows.Margin of Safety AnalysisOur discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $77 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future was known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values. Our ValueRisk™ rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock. In the graph below, we show this probable range of fair values for Honeywell. We think the firm is attractive below $58 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $96 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion.Future Path of Fair ValueWe estimate Honeywell's fair value at this point in time to be about $77 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart below compares the firm's current share price with the path of Honeywell's expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate. The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year 3 represents our best estimate of the value of the firm's shares three years hence. This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the firm's future cash flow potential change. The expected fair value of $99 per share in Year 3 represents our existing fair value per share of $77 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.Pro Forma Financial StatementsDisclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1893121,27361,2013-12-11T16:49:58-05:00,,"For investors looking for a large-cap company with a history of dividend increases coupled with long-term growth potential, Honeywell International (NYSE:HON) is a company worth further investigationHoneywell International, Inc. is a technology & manufacturing company, which serves customers with aerospace products & services, control, sensing and security technologies for buildings, homes and industry, turbochargers, automotive products, chemicals.In the section below, I will analyze aspects of Honeywell's past performance. From this evaluation, we will be able to see how Honeywell has fared over the past four years regarding their profitability, debt and capital, and operating efficiency. Based on this information, we will look for strengths and weaknesses in the company's fundamentals. This should give us an understanding of how the company has fared over the past few years and will give us an idea of what to expect in the future.ProfitabilityProfitability is a class of financial metrics used to assess a business's ability to generate earnings compared with expenses and other relevant costs incurred during a specific period of time. In this section, we will look at four tests of profitability. They are: net income, operating cash flow, return on assets and quality of earnings. From these four metrics, we will establish if the company is making money and gauge the quality of the reported profits.Over the past four years, Honeywell's net profits have increased from $2.022 billion in 2010, to $3.228 billion in 2013 TTM, which represents a 59.64% increase.Operating income is the cash generated from the operations of a company, generally defined as revenue less all operating expenses, but calculated through a series of adjustments to net income.Over the past three years, Honeywell's operating income has increased from $3.134 billion to $4.611 billion in 2013 TTM. This represents an increase of 47.13%.ROE - Return on EquityAs shareholders' equity is measured as a firm's total assets minus its total liabilities, ROE reveals the amount of net income returned as a percentage of shareholders' equity. The return on equity measures a company's profitability by revealing how much profit it generates with the amount shareholders have invested.Net Income / Shareholders' EquityOver the past three and a half years the ROE is showing improvement. Since 2010 the ROE has increased from 18.96% to 21.58%. As the ROE has increased over the past four years, this reveals that there has been an increase in how much profit has been generated compared to the amount that shareholders have invested, thus indicating an increase in shareholder value.Debt And CapitalThe Debt and Capital section establishes if the company is sinking into debt or digging its way out. It will also determine if the company is growing organically or raising cash by selling off stock.Total Liabilities To Total Assets, Or TL/A ratioTL/A ratio is a metric used to measure a company's financial risk by determining how much of the company's assets have been financed by debt.Over the past three and a half years, Honeywell's total assets have increased by $6.572 billion, while the total liabilities have increased by $2.279 billion. This indicates that the company's assets have increased more than the liabilities thus adding shareholder value.Working CapitalWorking Capital is a general and quick measure of liquidity of a firm. It represents the margin of safety or cushion available to the creditors. It is an index of the firm's financial stability. It is also an index of technical solvency and an index of the strength of working capital.Current Ratio = Current assets / Current liabilitiesOver the past three and a half years, Honeywell's current ratio has remained relatively even. As the current ratio is currently above 1, this indicates that Honeywell International would be able to pay off its obligations if they came due at this point.Common Shares OutstandingHON Shares Outstanding data by YChartsOver the past three and a half years, the number of company shares has increased. The company shares have increased from 774 million to 784.67 million.Operating EfficiencyOperating Efficiency is a market condition that exists when participants can execute transactions and receive services at a price that equates fairly to the actual costs required to provide them. An operationally efficient market allows investors to make transactions that move the market further toward the overall goal of prudent capital allocation without being chiseled down by excessive frictional costs, which would reduce the risk/reward profile of the transaction.Gross Margin: Gross Income/SalesThe Gross Profit Margin is a measurement of a company's manufacturing and distribution efficiency during the production process. The gross profit tells an investor the percentage of revenue/sales left after subtracting the cost of goods sold. A company that boasts a higher gross profit margin than its competitors and industry is more efficient. Investors tend to pay more for businesses that have higher efficiency ratings than their competitors, as these businesses should be able to make a decent profit as long as overhead costs are controlled (overhead refers to rent, utilities, etc.).Over the past four years, Honeywell's gross margin has increased. The ratio has increased from 23.53% in 2010 to 25.66% in 2013 TTM.Asset TurnoverThe formula for the asset turnover ratio evaluates how well a company is utilizing its assets to produce revenue. The numerator of the asset turnover ratio formula shows revenue found on a company's income statement and the denominator shows total assets, which are found on a company's balance sheet. Total assets should be averaged over the period of time that is being evaluated.Over the past three and a half years the revenue growth has increased by 14.62% while the assets have increased by 17.37%. This is an indication that the company from a percentage point of view has been slightly less efficient at generating revenue with its assets.Based on the information above we can see that Honeywell International has had a very strong 4 years. The net income over the past three and a half to four years, have increased by 59.64%, the ROE has increased from 18.96% to 21.58% in the same time period. The company's assets have increased by 6.572 billion while the liabilities have increased by $2.279 billion. All these metrics indicate that Honeywell is gaining strength.Moving Forward - China A Key Driver for GrowthWith the global middle class population expected to increase from the current amount of 1.8 billion to almost 5 billion by 2030, Honeywell is well situated to capitalize on the needs of this growing trend. As more people drive cars, travel by air, own homes and establish new communities, they will need products that aid them in living this lifestyle.As the middle class population is expected to increase significantly in China over the next 15 years this presents exceptional opportunities for Honeywell International. Because Chinese companies have been increasingly aligning with U.S. multi-national corporations this opens up the door for growth in this emerging market. Honeywell expects the majority of its Chinese growth to come from tier 2, 3 and 4 cities (Cities with 1 million people or more).In Support of the Chinese growth, Honeywell announced they will establish a new manufacturing campus in Zhangjiagang, China. This manufacturing campus will be designed to support growing demand in Asia for energy technology and advanced materials.In the short-term Honeywell's management doesn't expect extensive growth in China as CFO Dave Anderson stated: It wouldn't be surprising to us if China didn't break 7% GDP growth in 2013, Our expectation is that there's going to be relatively muted growth overall"".Having stated that long-term fundamentals support steady growth in China over the next few years, with Citigroup (NYSE:C) stating: ""After last year's slowdown, we continue to expect China's economic growth to level off at 7-8% this year (2013) and 7-7 1⁄2% per year in 2014- 2017, reflected in ongoing rapid productivity gains.""Analysts' EstimatesAnalysts at the Nasdaq are estimating an EPS for FY 2013 at $4.95 while the EPS is expected to increase in FY 2014 to $5.56.Bloomberg Businessweek supports this idea, as it expects the company's revenues to be around $38.9 billion for FY 2013 and increase to $41.1 billion for FY 2014.DividendAs Honeywell is committed to paying a sustainable and steadily increasing cash dividend over time, the chart below indicates the company is doing as it states.HON Dividend data by YChartsCurrently, with a dividend ratio of 41.08%. As the company's prospects look positive moving into 2014 the results should yield an EPS that is expected to be $5.56. The future for the dividend growth looks to be strong and the company should be able to increase the dividend faster than inflation or the 10-year bond which is currently 2.84%.HON Payout Ratio ((NYSE:TTM)) data by YChartsPrice TargetsThe above analysis reveals that Honeywell International has had a very successful four years. This success looks to continue as growth in emerging markets such as China look to be a catalyst for the company. Because of global market demand revenues projections are estimated around $38.9 billion for FY 2013 and increase to $41.1 billion for FY 2014. As this is the case, analysts are estimating that Honeywell's EPS for FY 2013 will be $4.95 while the EPS are expected to improve to $5.56 in FY 2014. Based on this information, Honeywell should be able to maintain its history of dividend increases. Over the long-term as middle class populations increase especially within the emerging markets and the demand for this lifestyle also increases, Honeywell is in a great position to capitalize on this growing trend.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

The company does not have a strong enough current ratio, and is trading at too high of PEmg and PB ratios for the Defensive Investor. For the Enterprising Investor, the company holds too much debt relative to its current assets. From a valuation side of things, the company has exhibited some growth in EPSmg (normalized earnings), going from $2.95 in 2008 to an estimated $3.63 for 2013. However, the market is currently implying a growth estimate of 8.14%, which is higher than has been seen historically. As a result, Honeywell would appear to be overvalued at the current time.Disclaimer: The author did not hold a position in Honeywell International Inc.

1877121,56822,2013-12-04T11:58:18-05:00,,"Honeywell (NYSE:HON) is a Fortune 100 diversified technology and manufacturing leader serving customers worldwide with aerospace products and services, control technologies for buildings and homes along with performance materials. In its latest quarterly earnings release the company promised good prospects as margins in mostly all the departments were positive.Besides slow growth of sales in the defense and space business, Honeywell was experienced better performance than its peers. Not only this, Honeywell's strong performance over the last two years was driven by growth in almost all of its segments and has beaten analysts' EPS consensus for four straight quarters in a row!Source: MorningstarThe modest but steady economic growth has caused the company's stock price to jump by more than 60% in the last two years to $88 in November. It has even managed to double the Dow's return over this time frame while competitors such as General Electric (NYSE:GE) and United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) have just been able to outperform the index.Expansion in ChinaHoneywell plans to expand its operations within China owing to growing demand in Asia for its energy technology and the advanced materials made by its PMT segment. The company recently announced that it would build its first manufacturing facility in China.The initial phase of the expansion will include building a production facility for advanced catalysts for Honeywell's Oleflex technology that is used to produce propylene, a plastics building block. By licensing Oleflex technology to 19 Chinese producers over the past three years during a period of tightening propylene supplies has allowed Honeywell to benefit from strong demand for propylene and isobutylene. Compared with alternative technologies offered by its peers, Oleflex technology offers higher yields, lower production costs and higher investment returns which have made Honeywell's product a good penetration and profit seeker for the company in the region.The expansion also supports Honeywell's growing PMT segment as seen in the latest earnings release. Of its four business segments, which include aerospace, automation and control solutions, PMT and transportation, PMT saw the largest year-over-year sales growth. Though much of the 10% growth in the quarter compared to Q3 of 2012 was due to Honeywell's acquisition of Thomas Russell, in the future these offered licenses are likely to increase contribution to profits.Completion of Telemec Acquisition to Bring $800 Million in SalesAlso, this quarter, Honeywell completed its acquisition of Telemac which provided products such as mobile computing, voice-enabled workflow, data-collection and printing solutions. The acquisition has added new products and solutions to Honeywell's database. Plus, the added engineering expertise along with the global sales channel previously held by Telemec will now add $800 million annually to Honeywell's sales beginning next year.Honeywell's Performance This QuarterHoneywell reported strong performance this quarter due to management's focus on boosting profit margins across the business. Revenue grew by 3.3% compared to last year but operating profits grew by 9.5%! This was been the result of greater productivity and a favorable product mix. Similarly, EPS grew by 10% after normalizing it for tax to $1.24 in the last quarter.The favorable mix further added to Honeywell's order book. Last month, Honeywell received a 5 year $500 million contract to sell spare parts to support various weapon systems including aircraft, engines and helicopters to the US government. This was seen as a ray of hope when budget cuts are harming all the players in the defense industry.SegmentsThe aerospace segment's margins improved by 110 basis points to 20.2% despite a 3% fall in revenue this quarter year on year. The improvement came from higher sales of large commercial jets and healthy demand for mid to large business aircraft. Commercial aftermarket sales were up 5% in the quarter driven by improving flight hour trends, repairs, upgrades and modification revenue. However, the Defense & Space segment's sales were down 11% due to the budget cuts of the US government and political closures.Taking that into account, the future prospects of this segment depends primarily on the commercial jet business. Even though the business is improving due to greater orders with airlines such as Boeing, the surplus inventory market of spare parts and products presently offered by Honeywell does not allow the company to benefit from this improvement. However, the future of this department will further improve once held inventory clears out and new orders begin pouring in.The PMT segment has a promising future as Honeywell's expansion into China will directly benefit the segment. Sales improved by 10% this quarter; however, inflation and investments in China led to margins improving by a mere10 basis points. It is expected that margins will increase as investments begin reaping returns.ACS Segment FinanicalsSource: ACS Revenue and Margin, PresentationThe ACS segment's high residential end market demand and expansion in China will also continue to boost profits for this segment as total sales increased by 4%. Organic sales contributed 3%and margins jumped by 90 basis points to 15% due to growth investments. Orders backlog also increased by 7% and will be fulfilled in the future. The ACS segment has seen increasing sales in the past along with higher margins and strong backlog. Despite slowing US orders, investments and increasing global demand will benefit ACS in the future.The transportation segment has also improved due to strong gas demand globally as sales went up 5% organically in the quarter driven by new launches and higher US& China turbo gas penetration. The transportation segment's margins were up by almost 200 basis points to 14%last quarter. Slightly better sales performance in the future could add to profitability as auto production increases and turbo unit shipments rise.ConclusionHoneywell is operating at strong margins within most of its segments. Current expansion, increasing backlogs and gas revolution is providing support for growth. In 2014, management expects to remove another $125 million in costs. Even though some may argue that Honeywell is trading at a higher price than its competitors, considering the future potential and further increase in stock price anticipated, I recommend investors to consider buying this stock.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1801302,24491,2013-11-04T07:52:19-05:00,,"What is stock analysis? Well, there are some that think it has everything to do with the dividend. There are others that only look at charts. There are others that think analyst estimate misses (notice how this is equivalent to companies' earnings beats) are a way to gauge the trajectory of a stock. And yet there are other groups that are lost in medieval times. We as investors need to move beyond these individual frameworks and start taking a holistic view. Let's take a look at what we mean as it relates to our analysis with Honeywell (NYSE:HON).At Valuentum, we think a comprehensive analysis of a firm's discounted cash-flow valuation, relative valuation versus industry peers, as well as an assessment of technical and momentum indicators is the best way to identify the most attractive stocks at the best time to buy. This process culminates in what we call our Valuentum Buying Index (click here for an in-depth presentation about our methodology), which ranks stocks on a scale from 1 to 10, with 10 being the best. Essentially, we're looking for firms that overlap investment methodologies, thereby revealing the greatest interest by investors. More interest = more buying = higher stock price.If a company is undervalued both on a DCF and on a relative valuation basis and is showing improvement in technical and momentum indicators, it scores high on our scale. Honeywell posts a VBI score of 7 on our scale, reflecting our 'fairly valued' DCF assessment of the firm, its attractive relative valuation versus peers, and bullish technicals. We compare Honeywell to peers 3M (NYSE:MMM), Danaher (NYSE:DHR), and Tyco International (TYC). In the spirit of transparency, we show how the performance of our VBI has stacked up per underlying score:Investment ConsiderationsInvestment Highlights• Honeywell earns a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT, the highest possible mark on our scale. The firm has been generating economic value for shareholders for the past few years, a track record we view very positively. We expect the firm's return on invested capital (excluding goodwill) to expand to 46.4% from 36% during the next two years.• Honeywell is a conglomerate operating in the following areas: aerospace, automation and controls solutions, performance materials and technologies, and transportations systems. Its aerospace products are used on virtually every aircraft, while its building solutions are in over 150 million homes.• Honeywell has a good combination of strong free cash flow generation and manageable financial leverage. We expect the firm's free cash flow margin to average about 11.2% in coming years. Total debt-to-EBITDA was 1.5 last year, while debt-to-book capitalization stood at 36.6%.• Honeywell is targeting a long-term compound annual sales growth rate of roughly 6-8%, and it expects segment margins to continue to expand. Though we expect continued margin improvement, our forecast for sales expansion is slightly lower than management's goals. This implies upside to our fair value estimate.Business QualityEconomic Profit AnalysisThe best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital (ROIC) with its weighted average cost of capital (WACC). The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. Honeywell's 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 29.1%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 10.2%. As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT. In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate.Cash Flow AnalysisFirms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. Honeywell's free cash flow margin has averaged about 7.6% during the past 3 years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generation is relatively STRONG. The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. For more information on the differences between these two measures, please visit our website at Valuentum.com. At Honeywell, cash flow from operations decreased about 16% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures expanded about 36% over the same time period.Valuation AnalysisOur discounted cash flow model indicates that Honeywell's shares are worth between $58.00 - $96.00 each. Why such a large margin? Click here. The margin of safety around our fair value estimate is driven by the firm's MEDIUM ValueRisk™ rating, which is derived from the historical volatility of key valuation drivers. The estimated fair value of $77 per share represents a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 20.8 times last year's earnings and an implied EV/EBITDA multiple of about 12.5 times last year's EBITDA. Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 4.4% during the next five years, a pace that is lower than the firm's 3-year historical compound annual growth rate of 6.8%. Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 15%, which is above Honeywell's trailing 3-year average. Beyond year 5, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 1.7% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For Honeywell, we use a 10.2% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows.Margin of Safety AnalysisOur discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $77 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future was known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values. Our ValueRisk™ rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock. In the graph below, we show this probable range of fair values for Honeywell. We think the firm is attractive below $58 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $96 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion.Future Path of Fair ValueWe estimate Honeywell's fair value at this point in time to be about $77 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart below compares the firm's current share price with the path of Honeywell's expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate. The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year 3 represents our best estimate of the value of the firm's shares three years hence. This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the firm's future cash flow potential change. The expected fair value of $99 per share in Year 3 represents our existing fair value per share of $77 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.Pro Forma Financial StatementsDisclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1718492,38201,2013-09-28T03:37:57-04:00,,"Honeywell (HON) provides mobile computing and scanning facilities under its business segment ""Automation and Control Systems"". In a bid to enhance its portfolio in this segment, the company completed the acquisition of Intermec on Sept. 17, 2013 for around $600 million. Honeywell announced its intent to acquire Intermec last year, and the company received shareholder approval in March 2013.Intermec produces radio frequency identification device, or RFID, barcode printers and scanners. RFID is a chip used to identify electromagnetic tags attached with objects. With this deal, we expect the company will be able to grow in the RFID market since it's relatively new to this market. Honeywell launched its first ever RFID enabled device last year, whereas Intermec is a stronger player in global RFID market. We feel Honeywell is well positioned to gain in the robust RFID market, which is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 18% to $19.3 billion over the period of 2011-2014 due to technological advancements in RFID devices.With this acquisition, Honeywell will not only benefit from Intermec's RFID, but it will open other new horizons for Honeywell as well. This is substantiated by Roger Fradin, head of Honeywell's Automation and Control solutions business, who stated, ""While Intermec strengthens our core scanning and mobile computing business, it opens up entirely new opportunities in voice solutions, barcode, and receipt printing segments that we currently don't serve.""Honeywell's Automation and Control Systems segment is the highest revenue generating segment of Honeywell, accounting for 42.16% of Honeywell's total revenue in fiscal year 2012. However, this segment grew only 2% year over year in fiscal year 2012. Although this segment registered low growth in the last fiscal year, we feel Intermec's acquisition will aid the company to ramp up this low growth in revenue going forward. We expect that the company will benefit most from the growing RFID market, which is growing at a rapid pace of 18%.Outperforming peersHoneywell clearly outperforms its peers based on its year over year sales growth, operating margin, and earnings per share, or EPS. The first chart below compares Honeywell's year over year sales to its peers' average in the last two years. The operating margin is the amount left with a company after paying off its variable cost like wages and raw material. Consequently, an increasing operating margin is considered better. Additionally, in the last two years, Honeywell's EPS outperformed peers' average. All these factors are clearly depicted in the chart below and favor the growth potential of Honeywell.Source: Company's reportValuation:Honeywell's major rivals are Danaher (DHR) and 3M Company (MMM). How is Honeywell performing compared to its major rivals?A stock with a lower forward PE ratio compared to its trailing PE ratio is undervalued. Honeywell's forward price to earnings, or PE, ratio is 15.20, significantly lower than its trailing twelve months PE of 21.01. As compared to its peers, Honeywell's stock is undervalued, as are all its competitors. Each has a forward PE slightly lower than their respective twelve months trailing PE ratio.Source: Finviz.comHoneywell's ROE is better than Danaher and the industry, though a little lower than that of 3M Company. We have also analyzed Honeywell based on price to book value, or P/B ratio. A low P/B ratio is considered better. Although Honeywell's P/B ratio is higher than its peers' P/B ratio, it isn't significantly higher than 3M Company's P/B.These valuation parameters suggest that Honeywell's stock is currently undervalued and is expected to grow in the future.Upside in dividendBy examining a company's earnings growth rate, we can analyze its dividend growth rate. For obtaining dividend growth on this basis, our calculation is based on ROE and earnings retained by Honeywell.In this case, we are considering the ROE and dividend payout ratio to be constant for the next twelve months. Dividend payout ratio is the portion of earnings that a company pays in the form of dividend to the investors, and (1- dividend payout ratio) signifies the earnings retained by the company after paying out the dividend. Return on equity is a measure of company's profitability, which we discussed above. The product represents growth in dividend of the company.Since the trailing twelve months' dividend payout ratio and trailing twelve months' return on equity are considered constant for next twelve months, we estimate the dividend to grow by 14.4% for Honeywell for the next twelve months, as shown in the above table. The dividend goes in line with the above discussed acquisition. Since we expect the acquisition to boost the company's highest revenue generating segment, it will grow Honeywell's earnings. This in turn is expected to hike the company's dividend.ConclusionWe expect that Honeywell will boost its automation and control solution segment with its acquisition of Intermec, as this acquisition will strengthen Honeywell's current facilities of this segment. This acquisition will also allow Honeywell to gain in markets like RFID, which is relatively new for the company. Honeywell's stock is also attractive compared to its peers based on its valuation. Considering the growth aspects and attractive valuation of Honeywell, we expect upside potential in its stock, which hints at a 'buy'.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1581902,24491,2013-07-29T18:44:20-04:00,,"Industrial conglomerates General Electric (NYSE:GE) and Honeywell (NYSE:HON) reported strong respective second-quarter results (GE's press release; Honeywell's press release). Though we liked that Honeywell raised the low end of its 2013 earnings per share guidance range, the most important takeaway from their respective second-quarter performances, in our view, was the significant growth in GE's backlog of equipment and services, which advanced to $223 billion at the end of the quarter. We think such expansion bodes well for many firms across the industrial/energy space, from oil/gas to commercial aviation.Image Source: GEGE's second-quarter revenue missed consensus expectations, but the firm's bottom line came in slightly better than what the Street had been expecting. Still, second-quarter operating earnings of $3.7 billion, or $0.36 per share, fell 8% and 5%, respectively, from the same period a year ago. However, profit advanced in six of the firm's seven industrial segments ('Power & Water' was weak during the period, though this was a result of timing), while second-quarter orders increased 4% (+20% in the US). GE's backlog of equipment and services at the end of the period hit $223 billion, the highest ever. 'Oil & Gas' and 'Energy Management' saw equipment orders increase 42% and 23%, respectively, during the period, while overall pricing on new orders was strongest in 'Aviation' (up 2.5%). The firm's margin performance was encouraging, as GE drove industrial segment margins 50 basis points higher from the same period a year ago (the firm remains on track for its planned 70 basis-point margin increase in 2013). GE continues to reduce GE Capital's portfolio and, by extension, the conglomerate's risk profile, while total cash from operating activities came in at a solid $5.1 billion (excluding NBCU deal-related taxes) during the period.Honeywell's second-quarter revenue was in-line with expectations, while its bottom-line performance beat the consensus forecast. Sales growth of 3% leveraged into a 12% jump in earnings per share, a 29% increase in cash flow from operations, and a 10% jump in free cash flow, the latter accounting for 11% of revenue. The firm's 'Automation and Control Solutions' (ACS) and 'Transportation' segments led the profit charge, with both segments' earnings expanding 11%. 'Aerospace' segment profit jumped 4%, while 'Performance Materials and Technologies' was the laggard, experiencing a segment profit decline of 9% in the quarter (as a result of lower licensing sales at UOP). Commercial aerospace original equipment demand continues to be robust (sales advanced 8% in the quarter), while improved housing conditions helped the firm's ACS unit. Higher turbo gas penetration and productivity initiatives helped bolster the firm's 'Transportation' segment. The strong performance in the period was enough for management to raise the low end of its sales, segment margin, and earnings-per share forecasts for 2013.Image Source: HoneywellValuentum's TakeThe industrial complex certainly looks healthy on the basis of General Electric's and Honeywell's second-quarter performance (and their respective outlooks for the remainder of 2013). Specifically, their results reinforce ongoing strength in energy equipment and commercial aerospace, the latter we seek to capitalize on via the aerospace supply chain in our position in Precision Castparts (NYSE:PCP). We're warming up to General Electric's dividend growth profile as it continues to reduce its dependence on GE Capital, though the shares look fairly valued at the time of this writing. Honeywell's dividend growth potential is equally attractive, though its yield isn't as juicy. We also think shares of Honeywell are fairly valued at the time of this writing.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1369931,24063,2013-04-25T07:18:00-04:00,,"By Matt DoironHoneywell (NYSE:HON) rose on April 19th after reporting decent results for the first quarter of 2013. According to the company's 10-Q, net sales were flat versus a year earlier though higher gross margins helped earnings rise by 17%. The manufacturer of industrial technology products, instruments, and materials generated about $340 million in cash flow from operations during the quarter, most of which went to investing activities.While the increase in net income is certainly a positive sign, however, the lack of change on the top line suggests that Honeywell cannot count on similar growth rates going forward (unless revenue starts to increase as well). The company is buying back some shares, but the effect on EPS is not particularly strong: cash used on repurchases is less than that used on dividends, and the yield is not very high at 2.2%. With Honeywell trading at 19 times trailing earnings, the valuation is therefore calling for earnings per share to continue to increase- likely at double-digit rates- for the next few years. That is what Wall Street analysts are expecting in fact, and as a result the forward P/E is 14. Even if Honeywell does hit that target the company would need to continue to do well to justify the current valuation, so we are at least somewhat skeptical that it is a buy at these prices.We track quarterly 13F filings from hedge funds and other notable investors as part of our work developing investment strategies (we have found, for example, that the most popular small cap stocks among hedge funds earn an average excess return of 18 percentage points per year) and can use this database to find individual funds with positions in Honeywell as of the end of December. Adage Capital Management, managed by Phil Gross and Robert Atchinson, increased their stake during the fourth quarter to a total of 6.7 million shares (see Adage's stock picks). Billionaire Mario Gabelli's GAMCO Investors reported owning 2.7 million shares of Honeywell in its 13F (find Gabelli's favorite stocks).BorgWarner (NYSE:BWA) and Johnson Controls (NYSE:JCI) are two of Honeywell's peers. These stocks trade at about the same levels as Honeywell in terms of trailing earnings, with P/E multiples in the 18-20 range. The sell-side is also expecting slightly higher growth rates, with the result being that each company is priced at a small discount to that company in terms of projected earnings for the forward fiscal year. BorgWarner reported small declines in both revenue and earnings in its last quarterly report compared to the fourth quarter of 2011, though, so given where it is currently trading we would avoid the stock unless financials improve. At Johnson Controls, net income fell 17% over the same period; similarly, we just don't think it is a good idea to buy a struggling business with a trailing earnings multiple of about 20.We can also compare Honeywell to United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) and to General Electric (NYSE:GE). These larger companies are each valued at 16 times their trailing earnings, representing a narrow discount to the other three peers we've reviewed. GE's Q1 actually looked a lot like Honeywell's: revenue was roughly unchanged, but earnings grew at a decent rate. While of course we'd have a similar concern here as we did at Honeywell- we can't expect GE to sustain earnings growth entirely through wider net margins- the few points' worth of a discount (or the 3.5% yield, for income investors) might make it worth watching. United Technologies recently reported a rise in revenue for its most recent quarter compared to the same period in the previous year, but this was entirely due to an acquisition. As a result the stock actually fell on the news despite a small earnings beat.Honeywell and its peers are not looking too attractive at this time- although GE might get close to value territory if its earnings continue to improve, and there is a fairly high dividend yield there. Honeywell itself has been experiencing growth in net income, but without corresponding rises in revenue we are skeptical that this will continue to the degree which it needs to in order to make Honeywell a good value.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: This article is written by Insider Monkey's writer, Matt Doiron, and edited by Meena Krishnamsetty.

1800702,53422,2013-11-04T00:53:42-05:00,,"Honeywell (NYSE:HON) is a conglomerate producing everything from fine chemicals to brake pads and security alarm systems. With its broad industrial footprint Honeywell is a bet on broad-based economic growth and its global operations add another layer of diversification to the business. Conglomerates like Honeywell have had a decent run over the last two years and stock prices are now relatively high compared to underlying profitability. Honeywell is not trading cheaply anymore and investors might want to look elsewhere to get bargain priced conglomerate exposure.Share performanceHoneywell gained 61% over the last two years while General Electric (NYSE:GE) gained 62%, United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) 38% and Cummins (NYSE:CMI) 25%. Honeywell is one of the best performing conglomerates over the last one and two years. YTD it leads the peer group with a gain of 34%.Free cash flow valuationHoneywell presents solid operating cash flow growth over the last three years which I extrapolate into 2014. Investing cash outflows include property plant and equipment expenses, net investments and acquisition expenses. Honeywell's historical cash flows as well as my estimates of 2014 cash flows are depicted in the table below. I estimate that Honeywell will achieve a free cash flow to equity of $3.6 billion which equates to a FCFE of $4.58 per share. Honeywell currently trades at nearly 19 times my 2014 FCFE estimate which is a very rich multiple and makes it unlikely that investors find a decent-prized bargain in Honeywell.If net borrowings in 2014 were set to zero, the resulting forward P/FCFE ratio would stand at nearly 23x making Honeywell even more expensive.Applying a discounted cash flow model with a long-term growth rate of 4% and equity cost of capital of 10% yields an intrinsic value of $76.72. Honeywell presently trades at $86.91 and has nearly 12% downside potential correspondingly.Market valuationHoneywell is everything but cheap on an earnings basis as well. It trades at 15.67x forward earnings which is above the peer group average of 14.77. Cummins is the cheapest stock in the sector with a P/E of 13.11. United Technologies trades at 15.56x forward earnings and based on free cash flow profitability isn't a BUY either.General Electric is the best dividend play in the conglomerate sector with a yield of 2.86%. Honeywell, United Technologies and Cummins are all producing yields just under the peer group average dividend yield of 2.27%.A summary of the most relevant valuation metrics is provided below. Honeywell trades at a slight premium (6.09%) to the peer group average P/E of 14.77. I find Honeywell's dividend yield not compelling considering the premium price investors are currently asked to put up.ConclusionHoneywell is operating a variety of segments that compete with other conglomerate structures in aerospace, defense, construction, energy, materials, automotive, transportation and others. All segments produce vital inputs for the manufacturing base and are likely to do well when the economy expands. However, investors already pay a premium price based on free cash flow and earnings. Investors now pay an estimated 19x forward free cash flow to equity and an earnings multiple approaching 16. Its dividend yield stands at just above 2% and isn't really enticing either. General Electric, on the other hand, may be a much better cyclical bet on an increase in economic momentum in the coming years.Disclosure: I am long GE.

1363581,25120,2013-04-23T16:56:59-04:00,,"Shares of Honeywell (NYSE:HON) are trading roughly unchanged in Tuesday's trading session. The diversified technological and manufacturing company announced the acquisition of RAE Systems, a manufacturer of a range of gas and radiation detection systems.The DealHoneywell announed that it has agreed to acquire privately held RAE Systems for $340 million. RAE offers personal, hand-held, transportable and fixed gas and radiations sensing and detection devices for the oil & gas as well as industrial markets. RAE's products are sold in over 120 countries to leading multinationals and governments.RAE's Systems 750 employees will become part of Honeywell Analytics, which in its turn is part of Honeywell's Automation and Control Solutions division.RAE generated full-year revenue of $107 million for 2012. As such the price tag values the company at 3.1 times annual revenues. Honeywell furthermore released that the deal values the company at 13 times estimated EBITDA for 2013. Honeywell stresses that the EBITDA multiple is only 6 times, adjusting for expected synergies, implying that the company expects to achieve annual synergies of $30 million.The deal is subject to ordinary closing conditions including regulatory review. The deal is expected to close in the second quarter of 2013.ValuationHoneywell ended its first quarter of 2013 with $5.13 billion in cash, equivalents and short-term investments, giving the company sufficient liquidity to finance the deal. The company operates with $7.70 billion in short- and long-term debt, for a modest net-debt position of $2.6 billion.Honeywell generated first-quarter revenues of $9.33 billion, up 0.2% on the year before. Net income rose more than 17% to $969 million as the company successfully managed to boost productivity across the board.Last week,the company slightly revised its full-year revenue target downwards to $38.8-$39.3 billion. As a result of the increased productivity, Honeywell now expects to earn between $4.80 and $4.95 per share, implying that full-year earnings are expected to come in around $3.8 billion.Trading around $75 per share, the market values Honeywell around $59 billion. This values shares of the company at around 1.5 times annual revenues and 15-16 times annual earnings.At the moment, Honeywell pays a quarterly dividend of $0.41 per share, for an annual dividend yield of 2.2%.Some Historical PerspectiveLong-term holders of Honeywell have seen decent returns. Over the past decade alone shares have more than tripled, this even excludes dividend income. Shares peaked around $60 in 2008 to fall to lows of $25 a year later during the recession. Shares steadily recovered and are currently exchanging hands at all-time highs of $75 per share.Between 2009 and 2012, Honeywell increased its annual revenues by roughly a quarter, up from $30.0 billion in 2009 to $37.7 billion over the past year. Net income almost doubled to $2.9 billion in the meantime.Investment ThesisDespite the very modest revenue growth, investors are still enthusiastic about the prospects for Honeywell with shares trading around all-time highs.Investors are applauding the cost savings measures, which the company outlined, in an attempt to cut operating costs by $150 million in 2013. Results are already visible in the first quarter of 2013 as earnings rose sharply on stable revenues.Shares could further get a boost as a result of recent acquisitions. Last year, Honeywell acquired a 70% stake in Thomas Russell and it acquired Intermec (NYSE:IN).Honeywell is trading at premium levels despite weak revenue growth, which gets a modest boost from accretive acquisitions including that one of RAE Systems, Intermec and Thomas Russell. Yet earnings could get a boost giving that gross margins rose by 100 basis points to 16.2% in the first quarter. The company has targeted margin expansion to 18% in 2014.Trading around all-time highs I remain on the sidelines despite the targeted margin expansion. Valued around 15-16 times annual earnings there is little upside given the modest revenue growth. The 2.2% dividend yield is fair as well.I remain on the sidelines.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Below I have provided an update of the quarter as well as an overview of earnings expectations.Profile and EstimatesHoneywell has a market cap of $57.26 billion and currently trades for $71.95 per share. Shares are up 15.97% YTD and trade 40.48% above their 52 week low of $51.21. Analysts have a mean target price of $78.57 and a median price target of $79.00 on the shares. Twenty three analysts have an average first quarter earnings per share estimate of $1.14 on estimated revenues of $9.44 billion. Honeywell has beat earnings estimates in all of the last four quarters.Fundamentals and HighlightsPositivesNegativesTake AwayHoneywell's revenue is highly dependent on the economy and this quarters earnings will shed light on how fast the economy is healing as well as where Honeywell is targeting future growth. I think the UOP acquisition is a step in the right direction and will provide more consistent returns.

1304271,46691,2013-03-27T13:00:09-04:00,,"If a product costs thirty times as much as the benefit it brings, and in addition, is capable of releasing a highly toxic chemical, one would not expect that product to be successful. If use of that product is mandated by government regulation, it might succeed in the marketplace despite its shortcomings. The product in question is the refrigerant R1234yf, made by a joint venture of DuPont (NYSE:DD) and Honeywell (NYSE:HON), and the prospective customers are auto makers selling in Europe, including Volkswagen (OTCPK:VLKAF), PSA Peugeot (OTCPK:PEUGF), Ford (NYSE:F), General Motors (NYSE:GM), Renault (OTC:RNSDF), Fiat (FIADF.PK), Toyota (NYSE:TM), Daimler (OTCPK:DDAIF), and BMW (OTCPK:BAMXF). Will we see a transfer of wealth amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars from these car makers and European car buyers to DD and HON or will the latter two companies have to reduce their earnings expectations?The root of the problem is the well-intentioned European Union directive 2006/40/EC, which provides that cars to be sold in the European Union, in order to obtain the necessary type approval, must not use fluorinated refrigerants with a global warming potential larger than 150. Global warming potential (GWP) is a figure expressing a substance's power as an atmospheric greenhouse gas compared to carbon dioxide-for example, a substance with a GWP of 10 would be ten times as a powerful a greenhouse gas as carbon dioxide. The refrigerant currently in use, R134a, has a GWP of 1,430. America does not have the European mandate, but there are credits against a car maker's fleet emissions available for the use of refrigerants with lower GWP. Among the alphabet soup of possible refrigerants, the leading candidate until last year was R1234yf, which is reasonably close in properties to R134a, but has a GWP of only 4. Alternative technologies such as using carbon dioxide, known as R744 in that context, are feasible, but not ready for market introduction and would likely lead to both higher cost and higher fuel consumption; the latter characteristic causes an obvious tension with the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.The use of R1234yf, anticipated as it was until the end of last year, would be a substantial cash cow for DD and HON. While the old R134a is a commodity going for under $10/lb., HON holds substantial intellectual property rights in R1234yf that despite some patent trouble will likely keep competitors out of the marketplace for the time being and allow HON and DD to charge a monopoly premium that increases the price about tenfold vs. R134a. Marginal manufacturing costs are anybody's guess; the process of making R1234yf is substantially more complicated than for R134a, but it appears reasonable to assume that a large chunk of that price will have to go to fixed cost for the HON/DD joint venture's new plant in China and economic rents for the two companies.This positive story for DD and HON became doubtful last year, just as the new manufacturing plant went online, as Daimler recalled its new 2013 SL in order to replace the expensive new refrigerant with the tried and true R134a and announced that it would not use R1234yf in any new cars. The reason for this move was that in Daimler's testing R1234yf proved inflammable under the conditions found in engine compartments; this is a particular problem because one of R1234yf's combustion products is the highly toxic and caustic gas hydrofluoric acid, which is aggressive enough to destroy even glass and can easily penetrate skin. The media reaction labeling R1234yf the ""killer refrigerant"" following this might have been exaggerated-igniting the new refrigerant is possible, but difficult-but even if the danger turned out to be not that great, the public relations damage is done. European buyers might be rather hesitant to purchase a car equipped with R1234yf for the foreseeable time, and DuPont's attempt to present the refrigerant as safe seems unlikely to regain the public's trust.The question now is whether political pressure will still force car makers to use the unloved, expensive, and possibly dangerous refrigerant. They certainly would do so if that was the only way to get new car models approved for sale in the European Union, but are likely to resist rather fiercely. Green politics is powerful in Europe: Daimler's very own home state of Baden-Württemberg has a prime minister from the Green party, and the prohibition against most light bulbs in the EU is in force despite its unpopularity. Does that mean that green will be more important that safe?A possible answer to that question lies in the following chart showing the price history of greenhouse gas emissions certificates in the European emissions allowance trading scheme:In short, the price for greenhouse gas emissions has fallen off a cliff, reflecting, depending on one's point of view, either that emissions reductions in Europe are ahead of schedule or that European politicians aren't actually serious about reducing greenhouse gas emissions very much. Either one should bode well for car makers and badly for DD and HON.Automotive refrigerants are not actually part of the EU emissions trading scheme, but to see how the political process might play out, let's pretend that they were. The climate does not care from what source greenhouse gases are emitted-they unfold their activities over the course of decades or centuries after being mixed with the atmosphere. For the sensible goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, it is immaterial from which source we reduce them. That is the entire point of a cap and trade system. Now if automotive refrigerants were included in this emissions trading scheme and if we assume full release of the refrigerant into the atmosphere with no recycling (even though recycling actually does take place and is mandated) it would take an allowance for 700 kg of carbon dioxide emissions to offset the global warming potential of a one-pound charge of refrigerant in a smaller auto air conditioning system. This would currently cost all of €3! If one takes the emissions trading system seriously at all, for €3 one could have the same reduction in greenhouse gas emissions that can be obtained by spending more than €100 to redesign, build, and charge an air conditioning system for R1234yf. Conversely, for the same price spent on converting the air conditioning system, one could have thirty times the reduction in greenhouse gases, and all without using a combustible refrigerant that releases poison gas when burned. That's all there is to say about the merits of the EU regulation and of DD's and HON's product.But how will this play out in practice? Car makers seem to be in a good position to renegotiate the EU directive. They can demonstrate the directive's absurdity, and they can offer a greater greenhouse gas reduction to politicians by offering to purchase emissions allowances offsetting a larger amount of greenhouse gases than actually corresponds to the refrigerant charges in their air conditioning systems, which would also contribute to the goal of supporting the price of emissions certificates. They also have the benefit of being local and being able to enlist the support of unions whereas DD and HON are American companies and their production plant is in China. And they have the most powerful argument of all on their side: ""Save the children (from hydrofluoric acid)!""If these thoughts hold true, DD and HON might well be forced to reduce their expectations for the money to be made from R1234yf. By how much? As a back-of-the-envelope calculation, let's take 10 million new cars per year equipped with a metric pound of refrigerant each, giving a volume of 5,000 tons of refrigerant. If we assume a profit impact of $30 per kilogram R1234yf sold, we would have a loss of $150MM per year. This would correspond to a reduction in earnings of 2-3% for both HON and DD for years to come. About the only way for R1234yf to become a useful product would be a rise in the price of European carbon allowances to at least €80, which is very unlikely, plus clarity about the safety issues.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: Promanthan LLC provides consulting services with respect to offsetting automotive refrigerant emissions with emissions certificates.

1209561,24491,2013-02-21T02:07:01-05:00,,"As part of our process, we perform a rigorous discounted cash-flow methodology that dives into the true intrinsic worth of companies. In Honeywell's (NYSE:HON) case, we think the firm is fairly valued at $64, about in line to where it is currently trading.At Valuentum, we think a comprehensive analysis of a firm's discounted cash-flow valuation, relative valuation versus industry peers, as well as an assessment of technical and momentum indicators is the best way to identify the most attractive stocks at the best time to buy. This process culminates in what we call our Valuentum Buying Index, which ranks stocks on a scale from 1 to 10, with 10 being the best. Essentially, we're looking for firms that overlap investment methodologies, thereby revealing the greatest interest by investors (we like firms that fall in the center of the diagram below).If a company is undervalued both on a DCF and on a relative valuation basis, it scores high on our scale. Honeywell posts a VBI score of 7 on our scale, reflecting our 'fairly valued' DCF assessment of the firm and its attractive relative valuation versus peers. We compare Honeywell to peers 3M (NYSE:MMM), Danaher (NYSE:DHR), and Tyco Intl (TYC). In the spirit of transparency, we show how the strategy has performed recently:Our Report on HoneywellInvestment ConsiderationsInvestment Highlights• Honeywell earns a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT, the highest possible mark on our scale. The firm has been generating economic value for shareholders for the past few years, a track record we view very positively. Return on invested capital (excluding goodwill) has averaged 25.8% during the past three years.• Honeywell is a conglomerate operating in the following areas: aerospace, automation and controls solutions, performance materials and technologies, and transportations systems. Its aerospace products are used on virtually every aircraft, while its building solutions are in over 150 million homes.• Honeywell has a good combination of strong free cash flow generation and manageable financial leverage. We expect the firm's free cash flow margin to average about 10.1% in coming years. Total debt-to- EBITDA was 2.1 last year, while debt-to-book capitalization stood at 41.1%.• Honeywell is targeting a long-term compound annual sales growth rate of roughly 6-8%, and it expects segment margins to continue to expand. Though we expect continued margin improvement, our forecast for sales expansion is slightly lower than management's goals. This implies upside to our fair value estimate.• The firm sports a very nice dividend yield of 2.5%. We expect the firm to pay out about 36% of next year's earnings to shareholders as dividends.Business QualityEconomic Profit AnalysisThe best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital (NASDAQ:ROIC) with its weighted average cost of capital (OTC:WACC). The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. Honeywell's 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 25.8%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 10.3%. As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT. In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate.Cash Flow AnalysisFirms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. Honeywell's free cash flow margin has averaged about 8.9% during the past 3 years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generation is relatively STRONG. The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. For more information on the differences between these two measures, please visit our website at Valuentum.com. At Honeywell, cash flow from operations decreased about 34% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures expanded about 31% over the same time period.Valuation AnalysisOur discounted cash flow model indicates that Honeywell's shares are worth between $48.00 - $80.00 each. The margin of safety around our fair value estimate is driven by the firm's MEDIUM ValueRisk™ rating, which is derived from the historical volatility of key valuation drivers. The estimated fair value of $64 per share represents a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 27.3 times last year's earnings and an implied EV/EBITDA multiple of about 15.3 times last year's EBITDA. Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 3.9% during the next five years, a pace that is higher than the firm's 3-year historical compound annual growth rate roughly flat. Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 12.8%, which is above Honeywell's trailing 3-year average. Beyond year 5, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 2.3% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For Honeywell, we use a 10.3% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows.Margin of Safety AnalysisOur discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $64 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future was known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values. Our ValueRisk™ rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock. In the graph below, we show this probable range of fair values for Honeywell. We think the firm is attractive below $48 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $80 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion.Future Path of Fair ValueWe estimate Honeywell's fair value at this point in time to be about $64 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart below compares the firm's current share price with the path of Honeywell's expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate. The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year 3 represents our best estimate of the value of the firm's shares three years hence. This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the firm's future cash flow potential change. The expected fair value of $81 per share in Year 3 represents our existing fair value per share of $64 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.Pro Forma Financial StatementsDisclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1056921,37061,2012-12-11T09:30:48-05:00,,"The market knows that Honeywell's (NYSE:HON) management started talking much more optimistically about the company's M&A prospects in September. Over the past few years, HON has demonstrated an ability to bolster its performance through acquisitions. Therefore, it was not a complete surprise for investors when the company announced its deal to buy Intermec (NYSE:IN) for $10/share (roughly $600 million). Intermec is an automatic identification and data capture vendor. The transaction will make IN a part of HON's automation and control solutions business. The fact that IN got scooped up was not a surprise to the market, as IN announced on Nov. 1 that it had hired Bank of America Merrill Lynch to help it in exploring strategic alternatives.HON has already spent $1.1 billion on acquisitions in the fourth quarter. However, given the bullish words from the company's CEO in September, it seems as if many acquisitions are still to come for this manufacturer of flight controls and thermostats.This deal is expected to temper the next year's profit. The transaction is expected to trim HON's consensus profit by 3-4 cents a share to an EPS of $4.75-$4.95 in 2013. The deal will have a dilutive impact on HON's income in the next year because IN is currently generating an operating loss. IN disclosed this fact in its Q3 earnings release this year. However, management believes that the deal is expected to pay off for investors in 2014. This will be possible due to certain factors:The following chart (taken from HON's investors' presentation) shows IN's targeted regions and products:Click to enlarge images.(ACS = automation and control solutions)Through synergies and diversification, the deal will also help the company to achieve its 2014 targets:Source: Investors' presentation.HON's stock is currently trading at a forward multiple of 12 times. Currently, the biggest drag on the company's profitability is its European operations. It is facing a recession in Europe. The company's CEO claimed in the Q3 earnings release that the company is also facing a lower demand for the short-cycle products in China.Valuations and ConclusionHON is a diversified industrial company with four business units: aerospace; automation and control solutions; performance materials and technologies; and transportation systems. This acquisition will help the company to boost the performance of its automation and control solutions segment.The company expects the sales to grow by 5% to $39.5 billion in the next year. It is also expecting a 50-80 bps boost to the operating margins in 2013. While the FCF is expected to be flat at $3.7 billion, no pension contribution is expected for 2013 (vs. $1 billion in 2012), which will increase the company's flexibility for M&A and repurchases.The company's long-cycle businesses (35% of sales) are expected to see a growth of +3%-4% in 2013. The short-cycle businesses are expected to grow by 1%-3% in 2013 (this segment generates almost 40% of sales). Following table shows the company's expectations regarding different segments:The emerging region sales are expected to grow by 7%-9%. However, the sales in the developed regions are expected to grow by only 0%-2%.Stifel Nicolaus has set a target price of $72 for this stock, which means an upside of 16%. Currently, the main hindrance in the execution of the deal seems to be the ongoing inquiry by Levi & Korsinsky LLP. Levi & Korsinsky is investigating into a possible breach of fiduciary duty by IN. IN's stock is up by 40% in the last seven months. The company also announced both a $17.7 million improvement in the adjusted operating profit and an increase of $21 million in revenues. Levi & Korsinsky believes that the transaction fails to take into account IN's growth potential and stock evaluation.It is important to note that HON's stock price dipped after the announcement for acquisition as the company announced that the deal will dilute the company's profits for 2013. However, this means that the expected growth after acquiring IN has not been priced into HON shares. The dip has provided the investors an ideal entry point in the stock. I recommend the stock as a buy.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1108431,39301,2013-01-12T13:09:36-05:00,,"IntroductionHoneywell (NYSE:HON) is a diversified scientific/technology company, and is likely to grow earnings going forward. I anticipate Honeywell to break out of its multi-year resistance level in 2013, and trend higher for the next 5-years.Qualitative AnalysisSource: Information pertaining to Honeywell came from the shareholder annual report and shareholder outlook reportHoneywell remains optimistic on its future performance and anticipates a compounded rate of growth in its revenue by 6-8%. The company plans to improve its profit margins by .25-.28% per annual year. The company is meeting its own expectations.The company plans on $41-45 billion in sales along with 16-18% net profit margins for 2014.The Aerospace division is involved with the production and development of auxiliary power units, propulsion engines, electric power systems, engine controls, repair services, among many other services/products related to aerospace and defense. Automation and control solutions division is involved with the production and development of automated energy, safety, and security devices for buildings (along with many other products/services). Performance materials and technologies division is involved with the production and development of advanced materials (resins, advanced fibers, electronic materials, and etcetera). The company's transportation systems division is involved with the development and production of turbochargers, thermal systems, brake hard parts, and other friction materials.The fastest growing divisions are the performance materials (20% revenue growth) and transportation systems (20.8% revenue growth). The capital expenditures for the transportation systems have gone up the most over the other divisions (cap-ex increased by 49.4%). Honeywell is investing its capital into its fastest growing divisions, implying that the company is flexible and adept at managing its earnings.So as long as Honeywell continues to: invest its capital intelligently, realizes revenue growth, and makes improvements in profit margins, the company will grow earnings. Improving economic conditions, plus share-buybacks further supports the optimism I have for the stock going forward.Honeywell competes with Danaher (NYSE:DHR), Emerson Electric (NYSE:EMR), Ametek (NYSE:AME), Waters (NYSE:WAT), Illumina (NASDAQ:ILMN), among many others.Technical AnalysisHoneywell is in a long-term up-trend, and is trading near its multi-year resistance level of $68 per share. The resistance level goes as far back as 1999. I think the stock will break above this resistance level based on technical and fundamental analysis.Source: Chart from freestockcharts.comThe stock is trading above the 20-, 50-, 200-Day Moving Averages. The stock recently broke above the upper tend-line of the symmetrical triangle formation, the 20-Day Moving Average crossed above the 50-Day Moving Average, implying further upside in the stock. The technical analysis supports the buy-thesis in the stock.Notable support is $52.80, $58.80, and $62.40 per share. Notable resistance is $68.00, $75.00, and $84.00 per share.Street AssessmentAnalysts on a consensus basis have reasonable expectations for the company going forward.Source: Table and data from Yahoo FinanceThe company shows reasonable growth as analysts on a consensus basis have a 5-year average growth rate forecast of 10.52% (based on the above table).Source: Table and data from Yahoo FinanceThe average surprise percentage is 3.3% above analyst forecast earnings over the past four quarters (based on the above table).Forecast and HistorySource: Table created by Alex Cho, data from shareholder annual report, and price history is from Yahoo Finance.(Note: the EPS figures presented are from the GAAP audited income statement and is different from the headline/pro-forma EPS numbers)The EPS figure shows that earnings grew throughout 2003-2007. Whereas the 2007-2009 period earnings/revenues dropped as the company was adversely affected by the great recession. Once the United States economy exited the recession in 2010-2011 the company earnings have improved.Source: Chart created by Alex Cho, data from shareholder annual reportBy observing the chart we can conclude that the business is cyclical and is affected by macroeconomics. Therefore the largest risk factor to Honeywell is the slowing of international gross domestic product growth. So as long as the world economy continues to grow, the company will generate outstanding returns over a 5-year time span based on the forecast below.Source: Forecast and table by Alex ChoBy 2018 I anticipate the company to generate $5.33 in earnings per share. This is because of earnings/revenue growth, product expansion, improving global outlook, and cost management.The forecast is proprietary, and below is a non-linear chart indicating the price of the stock over the next 5-years.Source: Forecast and chart by Alex ChoBelow is a price chart incorporating the past 10 years and the next 6 years. Detailing 16 years in pricing based on my forecast and price history on December 31st of each year.Source: Forecast and chart created by Alex Cho, data from shareholder annual report, and price history is from Yahoo Finance.Investment StrategyHON currently trades at $66.31. I have a price forecast of $68.31 for December 31st 2013. The stock is at fair value, and will trend higher by 2014.Short TermOver the next twenty-four months, the stock is likely to appreciate from $66.31 to $75.73 per share. This implies 14.2% upside from current levels. The technical analysis indicates the stock is in a long-term up-trend further backing the buy-thesis on the stock.Investors should buy HON at $68.31 and sell at $75.73 to pocket short-term gains of 14.2% in 2013-2014.Long TermThe company is a good investment for the long-term. I anticipate HON to deliver upon the price and earnings forecast despite the risk factors (competition, economic conditions, and commodity prices). Honeywell's primary upside catalyst is international expansion, cost management, product expansion, and share buy-backs. I anticipate the company to deliver upon my forecasted price target of $114.43 by 2018. This implies a return of 72.5% by 2018. When factoring back in the dividends (based on the table below) the company will generate a combined return of 90.9%. This rate of return is reasonable considering the moderate-level of risk (5-year beta of 1.4).Source: Forecast and table by Alex Cho, dividend data from shareholder annual reportHON has a market capitalization of $51.9 billion; the added liquidity makes this an investment opportunity appropriate for larger institutions that require added liquidity.ConclusionHoneywell is a good investment opportunity, the stock will trade at higher valuations over time.The conclusion remains simple: buy Honeywell.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1126701,25210,2013-01-23T05:58:37-05:00,,"In this article, we'll examine Honeywell International Inc. (NYSE:HON). We'll take a look at the risk-return profile. Also, we'll discuss the financial performance of the firm, and we'll take a look at Honeywell from the perspective of a technical analyst. Further, we'll conduct a relative valuation of the Company.That said, Honeywell is a market leader during this intermediate-term advance, and investors should consider accumulating shares of Honeywell.First, we'll use descriptive statistics by taking a sample of the population of nominal monthly returns of the Company. At this point, we won't make any statistical inferences. Some of the sample statistics will include the arithmetic time-series mean, and the time-series median. Also, we'll take a look at a histogram of nominal monthly returns. We'll also discuss the absolute frequencies, relative frequencies and cumulative relative frequencies of the return profile. Further, we'll determine the geometric mean return and the modal interval. The sample will consist of monthly returns between January 2000 and January 2013.Readers should note that the selected sample contains two bull markets and two bear markets. Further, the sample contains both high interest rate and low interest rate environments.The time-series nominal arithmetic mean monthly return was 0.9 percent. The time-series median monthly nominal return was 1.5 percent.One of the nominal monthly returns was between -40 percent and -30 percent. Four of the nominal monthly returns were between -30 percent and -20 percent. Fifty of the nominal monthly returns were between -10 percent and 0 percent. Seventy-seven of the nominal monthly returns were between 0 percent and 10 percent. Seventeen of the nominal monthly returns were between 10 percent and 20 percent. One of the nominal monthly returns was between 50 percent and 60 percent.The return of -38 percent occurred during June of 2000, during the bursting of the dot-com bubble. The return of 51 percent occurred during October of 2000.About 32 percent of the nominal monthly returns were between -10 percent and 0 percent. Further, 49.4 percent of the nominal monthly returns were between 0 percent and 10 percent. About 6.4 percent of the nominal monthly returns were between -40 percent and -10 percent. Finally, 10.9 percent of the nominal monthly returns were between 10 percent and 20 percent.That said, 38.5 percent of the nominal monthly returns were between -40 percent and 0 percent. That means the other 61.5 percent of the nominal monthly returns were 0 percent or higher. The modal interval was 0 percent to 10 percent.The time-series geometric mean nominal monthly return or time-series nominal monthly compound growth rate was 0.4 percent. The nominal geometric mean monthly return on a bond equivalent basis was 4.8 percent. The nominal geometric mean monthly return on an effective annual yield basis was 4.9 percent.We'll make a statistical inference about the population geometric mean nominal monthly return. The population geometric mean nominal monthly return at 95 percent confidence, assuming a standard normal distribution, was between 1.9 percent and -1.1 percent.Honeywell's nominal monthly return distribution was negatively skewed and leptokuric.Next, we'll compare some of those sample statistics with the sample statistics of the S&P 500 between 2000 and 2012.The arithmetic time-series mean monthly nominal return on the S&P 500 was 0.1 percent. The time-series median monthly nominal return on the S&P 500 was 1 percent.The geometric time-series mean nominal monthly return or time-series nominal monthly compound growth rate on the S&P 500 was 0 percent. I'm sure you can calculate the nominal bond equivalent yield and nominal effective annual yield on the S&P 500: It was 0 percent.The lack of nominal compound growth is because of the secular bear market that the S&P 500 entered in 2000.Thus, Honeywell outperformed the S&P 500 between 2000 and 2012.The sample standard deviation of nominal monthly returns on Honeywell was 9.8 percent. The sample standard deviation of monthly returns on the S&P 500 was 5 percent.Next, we'll compare Honeywell to some of its competitors in the diversified machinery industry.Honeywell's revenue and net income increased at a nominal compound growth rate of 6 percent between 2003 and 2011. The dividend increased at a 7.8 percent pace.Honeywell's revenue and income are increasing faster than the share price: the firm is getting cheaper.Between 2003 and 2011, General Electric's (NYSE:GE) revenue grew at a nominal compound growth rate of 4.4 percent. Net income declined at a nominal compound rate of 1.1 percent. The dividend declined at a nominal compound rate of 2.9 percent.Siemens' (NYSE:SI) revenue increased at a nominal compound growth rate of 3 percent between 2003 and 2011. Net income increased at a 7 percent pace and the dividend increased at a 12 percent pace.Overall, Honeywell performed the best financially of the three diversified machinery firms. A large portion of Honeywell's revenue growth came from the automation and control solutions operating segment.General Electric was valued at 15.78 times trailing earnings and 1.53 times trailing sales.Siemens was valued at 14.56 times trailing earnings and 0.94 times trailing sales.Honeywell was valued at 22.59 times trailing earnings and 1.40 times trailing sales.The market is paying a premium for Honeywell's earnings, but on a price-sales basis the firm isn't too expensive. That said, the forward PE ratio is 13.90: that implies almost a 40 percent upside over the next 12 months if Honeywell continues to trade at about 22.5 times trailing earnings.We'll take a look at a few of the financial ratios using cross-sectional analysis. The current ratio was 1.40 and the quick ratio was 1.06. Debt to equity was 0.61. Also, the dividend yield was 2.42 percent.Technical AnalysisShares of Honeywell are trading above the rising 50-day simple moving average. The market for shares of the firm is in an intermediate-term up-trend. Also, Honeywell is a market leader. Further, shares are trading above the rising 200-day simple moving average: the primary trend is towards higher prices.The market for shares of Honeywell is in trending mode as the 14-day slow stochastic indicator is in the overbought zone.Disclaimer: This article is not meant to establish or continue an investment advisory relationship.

953341,30811,2012-10-26T00:08:46-04:00,,"Shares of Honeywell International, Inc. (NYSE:HON) have returned 18.66% over the past 12 months. At $61.43 per share, the stock is trading just slightly off from its 52-week high of $63.48 achieved recently. Given its current attractive valuations, solid dividend yield, and robust growth potential, Honeywell International is one of my favorite dividend investments. In this article, I will elaborate the analysis that supports my bullish view for this quality stock.Valuation AnalysisHoneywell's valuations are cheap relative to the company's financial performance (see table below). Comparing to a peer group consisting of HON's comparable companies such as United Technologies (NYSE:UTX), Emerson Electric (NYSE:EMR), and Johnson Controls (NYSE:JCI), HON's strong growth and profitability prospects appear to be  its primary strength. Analysts on average predict HON's revenue, EBITDA, and EPS to rise by 2-year CAGRs of 4.0%, 42.0%, and 37.8% over the current and next fiscal years. The EBITDA and EPS estimates are significantly higher than the peer averages of 8.1% and 6.0%, respectively. In addition, HON's EBITDA margin is forecasted to expand substantially by 8.3% over the same period, compared to the average decline of 0.1% for the comparable companies. On the profit side, although all of HON's trailing profitability margin and capital return measures are below the par, it should be noted that the expected EBITDA margin expansion of 8.3% should help boost most of the metrics down the road. In terms of leverage and liquidity, HON assumes an in-line level of debt as reflected by the company's higher debt to capitalization ratio, but lower debt to EBITDA rate. Honeywell's trailing free cash flow margin is on par. However, the company's interest coverage ratio is currently below the peer average. But again, with the company's expected profitability improvement, that ratio should also see an increase in the near term. Both HON's current and quick ratios are above the peer averages, reflecting a healthy corporate balance sheet.Click to enlargeTo summarize the financial comparisons, HON's superior growth potential and profitability prospects should warrant at least a small premium stock valuation relative the peer average. Nevertheless, the current stock valuations at 7.1x forward EV/EBITDA and 13.0x forward P/E actually represent an average valuation discount of 7.3% to the peer-average trading multiples (see table above), suggesting that the stock is likely undervalued.Moreover, HON's forward P/E multiple has been underperforming the valuation of the S&P 500 index since July 2011 (see chart below). The value discount provides further support to my view that the stock is undervalued, as HON's long-term estimated earnings growth of 10.7% is largely higher than the average estimate of 7.9% for the S&P 500 companies (according to Capital IQ data).Dividend AnalysisHoneywell currently offers a 2.4% dividend yield, which is safely backed by the company's solid stream of free cash flow and commitment to continuously raise dividends. In the past decade, the annual dividend payment in general represented only a small portion of the annual free cash (see chart below), implying that there remains ample room for further dividend growth. Additionally, dividend per share has been raised from $0.91 in FY2006 to $1.37 in FY2011. Despite no growth in FY2010, the growth rate in the subsequent year resumed to be above the 10% level due to the recovery of the free cash flow (see chart below), reflecting a sound dividend policy.From a dividend perspective, HON is downside protected by the expected dividend growth. According to the 5-year dividend yield chart shown below, HON's yield has been hovering around 2.5% most of the time since 2010, and as long as the yield rose to higher levels, strong demand from income investors drove it down subsequently. Owing to the current low-interest market environment, I believe this pattern may persist for a while. As such, assuming a target dividend yield at 2.5%, and supposing that the current annualized dividend per share of $1.49 would be raised by only 10% to $1.64 in 2013, that conservative scenario would imply a stock value of $66, suggesting limited downside risk.Taking the peer-average forward P/E multiple of 13.6x, which is consistent with the current P/E multiple of the S&P 500 index, and assuming the company's EPS could rise to the analysts' average FY2013 estimate of $4.97, the 1-year target price can then be calculated to be $68, representing 10% upside. It should be noted that the calculation here is relatively conservative, given that HON should deserve a higher P/E multiple for its superior growth forecasts.In conclusion, in the light of the cheap valuations and the solid dividend growth prospects, HON should warrant your buy decision.Comparable analysis table is created by author, all other charts are sourced from Capital IQ, and all financial data is sourced from Morningstar and Capital IQ.Disclosure: I am long HON.

946821,24491,2012-10-24T15:27:41-04:00,,"Last Friday, Honeywell (NYSE:HON) reported mixed third-quarter results that showed weakness in Europe (as expected) but strength in commercial aerospace, infrastructure spending, and oil and gas investments. Though revenue was roughly flat from the same period a year ago, organic sales edged up 2% and earnings per share from continuing operations jumped nearly 40%, though the firm benefited from a more-favorable tax rate in the most recently reported quarter. The company lowered its 2012 revenue guidance modestly, but it only narrowed the range of its 2012 proforma earnings per share outlook to $4.45-$4.50 per share (was $4.40-$4.55 per share), still representing a double-digit increase from last year. Free cash flow for the year is expected to come in slightly better than previous expectations, reaching $3.55 billion at the midpoint of the provided range, about 9.4% of sales. Our fair value estimate of the industrial conglomerate remains relatively unchanged.Aerospace sales continue to perform well, with sales up 4% thanks to a 9% increase in its commercial end market. Commercial original equipment sales advanced 14% driven by higher aircraft production rates. We continue to believe that the tremendous and multi-year backlogs at Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Airbus (OTCPK:EADSY) will provide support for Honeywell's aerospace business for many years to come. And while we don't hold Honeywell in our Best Ideas portfolio (click here for our academic white paper), we do hold a number of aerospace suppliers. Aerospace segment profit advanced 9% thanks to segment margin expansion of 90 basis points, to 19.1%.Honeywell's Automation/Controls Solutions (ACS) and Performance Materials/Technologies (PMT) segments showed roughly flat growth. However, segment profit in each segment advanced at a mid- to high-single-digit pace during the quarter as a result of margin expansion. Impressively, segment margins in its PMT business jumped 130 basis points from the same period a year ago, to 18.6%, a very nice showing. Strong performance at UOP and solid execution on productivity initiatives were the primary drivers for the profit expansion in its PMT segment.The company's Transportation Systems (TS) segment, on the other hand, was incredibly weak. Sales dropped 10%, while segment profit fell 14% as margins shrank 50 basis points from the same period a year ago. On an organic basis, performance didn't look quite as poor, but organic revenue still fell 2% as new platform launches and higher turbo gas penetration in the US failed to offset lower European light vehicle production volume and unfavorable foreign exchange fluctuations.Looking ahead to 2013, Honeywell will face an uncertain macroeconomic backdrop, but we continue to see strong growth in aerospace and UOP as key performance drivers. The company has solid exposure on Boeing's Dreamliner (787) as well as the jumbo 747-8. Management also spoke positively about the record backlog at UOP and the addition of Thomas Russell, a leader in technology and equipment for natural gas processing and treating. Furthermore, solid execution, productivity initiatives and tailwinds from recent restructuring efforts should help drive consolidated margin expansion for the year. We like Honeywell and its dividend (click here for our dividend analysis), but its shares are fairly valued.Image Source: Honeywell 3Q Slide Presentation (page 12)Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1056281,25120,2012-12-11T00:21:31-05:00,,"Shares of Honeywell (HON) ended Monday's trading session roughly unchanged. The diversified industrial technology and manufacturing company issued its full year 2013 forecast and announced the acquisition of Intermec.2013 OutlookHoneywell today announced its full year 2013 outlook. For its fiscal 2013, the company guides for full year revenues of $39-$39.5 billion, up 4 to 5% from the full year 2012 guidance of $37.5 billion. This includes the effects of acquisitions, including the deal with Intermec as announced on Monday. The revenue guidance comes in line with analysts forecasts of $39.4 billion.Segment margins are expected to increase between 20 and 50 basis points to 15.8%-16.1%. Operating margins are expected to increase between 50 and 80 basis points to 14.2%-14.5%.Earnings per share are expected to increase between 6 and 11% to $4.75-$4.95 per share. Analysts expected that Honeywell could earn $4.95 in 2013.The Deal With IntermecHoneywell announced that it will acquire Intermec (IN) for a total consideration of roughly $600 million. Honeywell will pay $10 per share for the provider of mobile computing, radio frequency identification solutions, bar codes and labels. The offer, represents a 25.3% premium compared to Friday's closing price.The deal with enhance Honeywell's scale on mobile computing. Combined, Honeywell and Intermec boost the existing scanning & mobility franchise and increase the automation offerings. Upon completion, Intermec will become part of Honeywell's Automation and Control Solutions business. Intermec's 2,200 employees operate in over 65 offices across the globe.For the first nine months of 2012, Intermec generated revenues of $573.5 million. The company lost $272.4 million after paying $212.2 million in income taxes and a $41.3 million goodwill charge. Based on a simple extrapolation, Intermec could generate annual revenues of roughly $750 million, valuing the firm at 0.8 times annual revenues.The purchase price values Intermec at roughly 10 times trailing annual EBITDA, excluding certain one-time costs. Based on expected synergies, the deal values Intermec at 5 times EBITDA, which implies that annual synergies could total $60 million per annum. The deal will dilute 2013s earnings per share by three to four cents per share. The deal is expected to be accretive to earnings per share in 2014.The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2013. The deal is subject to shareholder approval of Intermec's shareholders and regulatory review.ValuationHoneywell ended its third quarter with $5.5 billion in cash and equivalents and short term investments. The company operates with roughly $8.0 billion in short and long term debt, for a net debt position of roughly $2.5 billion. As such, Honeywell has plenty of liquidity to finance the deal.For the first nine months of the year, Honeywell generated revenues of $28.1 billion. The company net earned $2.7 billion for the period, or $3.43 per diluted share. The company is on track to generate annual revenues of $37.5 billion, on which the company could earn $4.47 per share.The market currently values Honeywell at $48.5 billion. This values the firm at 1.3 times annual revenues and roughly 14 times annual earnings. Honeywell currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.41 per share, for an annual dividend yield of 2.6%.Some Historical PerspectiveYear to date, shares of Honeywell have risen some 14%. Shares started the year around $54 per share and rose to $62 during spring before falling back in the summer. Shares recovered to highs of $64 in recent weeks, currently exchanging hands at $62 per share.After trading as low as $25 in 2009, shares are trading near all time highs of $68 set in 1999. Honeywell is on track to report annual revenues of $37.5 billion. Net income rose over the past years on track to earn $3.5 billion this year.Investment ThesisHoneywell's deal with Intermec is a small addition to the firm. The deal will add roughly 2% in annual revenues, thereby providing a strong base under the 2013 revenue forecast.The deal values Intermec at 10 times annual EBITDA and roughly 0.8 times annual revenues. The valuation seems fairly cheap, compared to Honeywell's own valuation multiples of 1.3 times annual revenues and 8.5 times annual EBITDA. Factoring in synergies, Honeywell values Intermec at just 5 times EBITDA.Investors seem pleased with the deal of Intermec, which seems very attractive and gives Honeywell ownership to well-known products including First Alert, the home security system. In October of this year, Honeywell bought a 70% stake in Thomas Russell & Co for $525 million.Shares are trading unchanged as investors are not impressed with the full year outlook for 2013. Revenues and earnings came in at the low end of the guided range, however this includes the accretive impact of the acquisition of Intermec. Excluding the impact of the deal, the guidance fell short of expectations with existing operations expected to report merely 1 to 3% increase in revenues.Shares are fairly valued at these levels, being a perfect addition to any long term investment portfolio. Valued at 1.3 times annual revenues and 14 times annual earnings, shares are fairly valued paying a fair dividend yield of 2.4% in the meantime.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

939831,25791,2012-10-22T17:51:28-04:00,,"Honeywell International Inc. (NYSE:HON) recently reported its preliminary financial results based on which CapitalCube provides a unique peer-based analysis of the company. Our analysis is based on the company's performance over the last 12 months (unless stated otherwise).Honeywell International Inc.'s analysis versus peers uses the following peer-set: United Technologies Corp. (NYSE:UTX), Boeing Co. (NYSE:BA), Emerson Electric Co. (NYSE:EMR), Lockheed Martin Corp. (NYSE:LMT), Rolls-Royce Holdings PLC ADS (OTCPK:RYCEY), BAE Systems PLC (OTCPK:BAESF), Raytheon Co. (RTN), SAFRAN S.A. (NYSE:SAF) and Rockwell Collins Inc. (NYSE:COL). The table below shows the preliminary results along with the recent trend for revenues, net income and returns. CapitalCube reported extensively on Boeing Co. (BA) last month.Valuation DriversHoneywell International Inc.'s current Price/Book of 3.7 is about median in its peer group. The market expects more growth from Honeywell International, Inc. than the median of its chosen peers (PE of 21.2 compared to peer median of 13.1) and to improve its current ROE of 18.8% which is around peer median.The company's asset efficiency (asset turns of 0.9x) and net profit margins of 6.2% are both median for its peer group. Honeywell International, Inc.'s net margin has increased 1.1 percentage points from last year's low and is now close to its five-year average net margin.Economic MoatThe company has achieved better revenues growth than its chosen peers (year-on-year change in revenues of 9.4%) but its earnings growth performance has been below the median (change in annual reported earnings of -8.1% compared to the peer median of 17.5%). This suggests that, compared to its peers, the company is focused more on top-line revenues. Honeywell International, Inc. is currently converting every 1% of change in revenue into -0.9% change in annual reported earnings.Honeywell International, Inc.'s return on assets currently is around peer median (5.8% vs. peer median 6.7%) -- similar to its returns over the past five years (6.4% vs. peer median 6.9%). This performance suggests that the company has no specific competitive advantages relative to its peers.The company's gross margin of 30.9% is around peer median suggesting that Honeywell International, Inc.'s operations do not benefit from any differentiating pricing advantage. In addition, Honeywell International, Inc.'s pre-tax margin of 7.7% is also around the peer median suggesting no operating cost advantage relative to peers.Growth and Investment StrategyWhile Honeywell International, Inc.'s revenues have increased more slowly than the peer median (-0.1% vs. 1.3% respectively for the past three years), the market currently gives the company a higher than peer median PE ratio of 21.2. The stock price may be factoring in some sort of a strategic play.Honeywell International, Inc.'s annualized rate of change in capital of 5.7% over the past three years is around its peer median of 5.0%. This median investment has likewise generated a peer median return on capital of 11.9% averaged over the same three years. This median return on investment implies that company is investing appropriately.Earnings QualityHoneywell International, Inc.'s net income margin for the last twelve months is around the peer median (6.2% vs. peer median of 7.4%). This average margin and relatively conservative accrual policy (3.5% vs. peer median of 1.4%) suggests possible understatement of its reported net income.Honeywell International, Inc.'s accruals over the last twelve months are positive suggesting a buildup of reserves. In addition, the level of accrual is greater than the peer median -- which suggests a relatively strong buildup in reserves compared to its peers.Trend ChartsCompany ProfileHoneywell International, Inc. is a diversified technology and manufacturing company.

936801,25120,2012-10-20T10:45:05-04:00,,"Shares of Honeywell International, Inc. (HON) were one of the few gainers in Friday's trading session. The diversified technology and manufacturing company announced its third quarter results before the open. Shares of Honeywell rose 1.7% on the day to $62.49.Third Quarter ResultsHoneywell reported third quarter revenues of $9.34 billion, up 0.5% on the year. On average, analysts expected Honeywell to report revenues of $9.50 billion.The company delivered on strong margin improvements. Segment margins rose by 110 basis points to 15.8%, while operating income margins rose 360 basis points to 13.9%.Earnings per share from continuing operations rose 38% to $1.20 per diluted share. Earnings beat analysts consensus of $1.14 per share.CEO and Chairman Dave Cote commented on the results:Segmental UpdateAerospaceRevenues for the aerospace division rose 4% to $3.04 billion. A 9% growth in Commercial end markets, was partially offset by a 1% decline in Defense and Space. Profits for the segment rose 9% to $582 million, as margins improved by 90 basis points to 19.1%, as result of increased productivity.Automation and Control SystemsRevenues for the automation division were roughly unchanged at $3.96 billion. Volume growth and the favorable impact of acquisitions was offset by unfavorable exchange rates. Segment profits rose 5% to $571 million as productivity increased. This boosted segment margins by 60 basis points to 14.4%.Performance Materials and TechnologiesRevenues for the performance materials and technologies division were up 1% on the year to $1.47 billion. Sales were driven by the Specialty Products and Electronics Materials, offset by challenging conditions for Fluorine Products and Resins and Chemicals. Operating margins were up 130 basis points to 18.6%, resulting in a 8% increase in segment profits to $275 million.Transportation SystemsTransportation revenues fell 10% on the year to $863 million on the back of unfavorable exchange rate movements, and a weak European light vehicle production volume. Margins compressed by 50 basis points to 12.1%, resulting in a 14% drop in segment profits to $104 million.OutlookFor the full year of 2012, Honeywell lowered its full year revenue outlook from $37.8-$38.4 billion to $37.5-$37.7 billion. The mid-point for operating margins was raised by 10 basis points to 13.4-13.6%. Honeywell narrowed its full year earnings per share guidance to $4.45-$4.50 per share.Dave Cote commented on the future prospects, saying:ValuationHoneywell ended its third quarter with $5.5 billion in cash, equivalents and short-term investments. The company operates with $8.0 billion in short- and long-term debt, for a modest net debt position of $2.5 billion.For the first nine months of 2012, Honeywell generated revenues of $28.0 billion. The company net earned $2.7 billion, or $3.38 per diluted share.The market values Honeywell at $49.0 billion. Based on the company's full year outlook, this values the firm at 1.3 times annual revenues, and 14 times annual earnings.Currently, Honeywell pays a quarterly dividend of $0.3725, for an annual dividend 2.4% per year.Investment ThesisYear to date, shares of Honeywell have risen some 15%. Shares rose from $55 in January to highs of $63 in March. From that point in time, shares corrected back to the mid-$50s during the summer months on fears of an economic slowdown. Shares have since recovered and are currently exchanging hands around $62.50.Over the past five years, shares have been trading largely unchanged. Shares fell from $60 in 2008 to lows of $25 by the end of that year, and gradually recovered to $60 at the moment. Between 2008 and 2012, Honeywell consolidated its annual revenues from $36.6 billion to an expected $37.6 billion this year. Net income rose from $806 million in 2008, to an expected $3.5 billion in 2012.Honeywell is not overly optimistic for 2013, but certainly works with realistic assumptions. The company warns that China might report the slowest growth rate since 1990, breaking through the 7% growth barrier next year.Honeywell will cut operating costs by $150 million in 2013 and will introduce new products to keep earnings at its current level. Revenues and earnings might rise slowly if currencies remain stable next year. The strong dollar cost the firm $700 million in annual revenues for 2012. Growth would also be driven by small acquisitions like the $525 million deal with Thomas Russell, announced a few weeks ago.I think Honeywell trades at a fair valuation, with shares near all-time highs. There are few short-term triggers for the shares, as the company has given but little inspiring update for 2013. Long-term investors with diversified investments could pick up some shares in this industrial conglomerate. Honeywell trades at 14 times earnings and offers a 2.4% yield in the meantime. Don't expect large stock price appreciations in the short to medium term.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Revenues missed the Zacks Consensus  Estimate of $9.5 billion.The company reported revenue growth in three of its four segments. Income from continuing operations was $1.2 billion in the quarter vs.  $1.1 million in the second quarter of 2011, due to lower SG&A and  declines in interest and financial charges.Outlook RaisedManagement raised its earnings guidance for 2012, and now expects  earnings per share from continuing operations between $4.40 and $4.55,  compared with its previous guidance range of $4.35 to $4.55.

919341,25871,2012-10-11T15:46:36-04:00,,"This article is going to examine Honeywell International Inc (NYSE:HON) through the lens of FAST Graphs - fundamentals analyzer software tool. What we see is a picture of a company that is currently in-value. With a 2.5% dividend yield, the prudent dividend growth investor might want to take a closer look at this fine company and do their own due diligence to see if Honeywell warrants addition to their portfolio. Based in Morris Township, NJ, Honeywell is a Fortune 100 diversified technology and manufacturing leader.Earnings Determine Market Price: The following earnings and price correlated FAST Graphs™ clearly illustrates the importance of earnings. The Earnings Growth Rate Line or True Worth™ Line (orange line with white triangles) is correlated with the historical stock price line. On graph after graph the lines will move in tandem. If the stock price strays away from the earnings line (over or under), inevitably it will come back to earnings.Earnings & Price Correlated Fundamentals-at-a-GlanceA quick glance at the historical earnings and price correlated FAST Graphs™ on Honeywell International Inc shows a picture of a company that's currently in-value based upon the historical earnings growth rate of 12.1% and a current PE of 14.6. Analysts are forecasting the earnings growth to continue at about 10.7%, and when you look at the forecasting graph below, the stock appears in-value, (it's inside of the value corridor of the five orange lines - based on future growth).Honeywell International Inc: Historical Earnings, Price, Dividends and Normal PE Since 2004Performance Table Honeywell International IncThe associated performance results with the earnings and price correlated graph, validates the principles regarding the two components of total return; capital appreciation and dividend income. Dividends are included in the total return calculation and are assumed paid, but not reinvested.When presented separately like this, the additional rate of return a dividend paying stock produces for shareholders becomes undeniably evident. In addition to the 7% capital appreciation (green circle), long-term shareholders of Honeywell International Inc , assuming an initial investment of $1,000, would have received an additional $283.84 in dividends (blue highlighting) that increased their total return from 7% to 8.8% per annum versus 3.2% (red circle) in the S&P 500.The following graph plots the historical PE ratio (the dark blue line) in conjunction with 10-year Treasury note interest. Notice that the current price earnings ratio on this quality company is as normal as it has been since 2004.A further indication of valuation can be seen by examining a company's current price to sales ratio relative to its historical price to sales ratio. The current price to sales ratio for Honeywell International Inc is 1.26 which is historically normal.Looking to the FutureExtensive research has provided a preponderance of conclusive evidence that future long-term returns are a function of two critical determinants:1. The rate of change (growth rate) of the company's earnings2. The price or valuation you pay to buy those earningsForecasting future earnings growth, bought at sound valuations, is the key to safe, sound, and profitable performance.The Estimated Earnings and Return Calculator Tool is a simple yet powerful resource that empowers the user to calculate and run various investing scenarios that generate precise rate of return potentialities. Thinking the investment through to its logical conclusion is an important component towards making sound and prudent commonsense investing decisions.The consensus of 19 leading analysts reporting to Capital IQ forecast Honeywell International Inc's long-term earnings growth at 10.7% (orange circle). Honeywell International Inc has medium long-term debt at 39% of capital (red circle). Honeywell International Inc is currently trading at a P/E of 14.6, which is inside the value corridor (defined by the five orange lines) of a maximum P/E of 18. If the earnings materialize as fore cast, Honeywell International Inc 's True Worth™ valuation would be $112.63 at the end of 2018 (brown circle on EYE Chart), which would be a 14.7% annual rate of return from the current price (yellow highlighting).Earnings Yield EstimatesDiscounted Future Cash Flows: All companies derive their value from the future cash flows (earnings) they are capable of generating for their stakeholders over time. Therefore, because Earnings Determine Market Price in the long run, we expect the future earnings of a company to justify the price we pay.Since all investments potentially compete with all other investments, it is useful to compare investing in any prospective company to that of a comparable investment in low risk Treasury bonds. Comparing an investment in Honeywell International Inc to an equal investment in 10 year Treasury bonds, illustrates that Honeywell International Inc's expected earnings would be 7.2 (purple circle) times that of the 10 year T-Bond Interest. (See EYE chart below). This is the essence of the importance of proper valuation as a critical investing component.Summary & ConclusionsThis report presented essential ""fundamentals at a glance"" illustrating the past and present valuation based on earnings achievements as reported. Future forecasts for earnings growth are based on the consensus of leading analysts.

915631,24491,2012-10-10T09:34:11-04:00,,"Dividend growth investing is lots of fun, especially if you have a systematic methodology to determining which companies' dividends are safe and which ones' aren't. That is why we created a forward-looking assessment of dividend safety in our innovative, predictive dividend-cut indicator, the Valuentum Dividend Cushion™. In this article, let's evaluate the investment merits of Honeywell (NYSE:HON), as well as its dividend under this unique but yet very straightforward framework.Investment ConsiderationsReturn on Invested CapitalHoneywell's DividendHoneywell's dividend yield is above average, offering just below a 2.5% annual payout at recent price levels. We prefer yields above 3% and don't include firms with yields below 2% in our dividend growth portfolio.We think the safety of Honeywell's dividend is good (please see our definitions at the bottom of this article). We measure the safety of the dividend in a unique but very straightforward fashion. As many know, earnings can fluctuate in any given year, so using the payout ratio in any given year has some limitations. Plus, companies can often encounter unforeseen charges (read hiccups in operations), which makes earnings an even less-than-predictable measure of the safety of the dividend in any given year. We know that companies won't cut the dividend just because earnings have declined or they had a restructuring charge that put them in the red for the quarter (year). As such, we think that assessing the cash flows of a business allows us to determine whether it has the capacity to continue paying these cash outlays well into the future.That has led us to develop the forward-looking Valuentum Dividend Cushion™. The measure is a ratio that sums the existing cash a company has on hand plus its expected future free cash flows over the next five years and divides that sum by future expected dividends over the same time period. Basically, if the score is above 1, the company has the capacity to pay out its expected future dividends. As income investors, however, we'd like to see a score much larger than 1 for a couple reasons: 1) the higher the ratio, the more ""cushion"" the company has against unexpected earnings shortfalls, and 2) the higher the ratio, the greater capacity a dividend-payer has in boosting the dividend in the future.For Honeywell, this score is an impressive 2.6, revealing that on its current path the firm may can cover its future dividends with net cash on hand and future free cash flow. The beauty of the Dividend Cushion is that it can be compared apples-to-apples across companies. Also, for firms that have a score below 1 or that have a negative score, the risk of a dividend cut in the future is certainly elevated. In fact, the Valuentum Dividend Cushion caught all dividend cuts in our non-financial coverage universe, except for one, which subsequently raised its dividend above pre-cut levels (meaning it shouldn't have cut it in the first place). We use our dividend cushion as a key decision component in choosing companies for addition to the portfolio of our Dividend Growth Newsletter (please see our links on the left sidebar for more information).Now on to the potential growth of Honeywell's dividend. As we mentioned above, we think the larger the ""cushion"" the larger capacity it has to raise the dividend. However, such dividend growth analysis is not complete until after considering management's willingness to increase the dividend. As such, we evaluate the company's historical dividend track record. If there have been no dividend cuts in 10 years, the company has a nice growth rate, and a nice dividend cushion, its future potential dividend growth would be excellent, which is the case for Honeywell's. The company is simply a cash cow.And because capital preservation is also an important consideration, we assess the risk associated with the potential for capital loss (offering investors a complete picture). In Honeywell's case, we think the shares are fairly valued, so the risk of capital loss medium. For a read on how we calculate the intrinsic value of Honeywell within our extensive discounted cash-flow framework, please click here. If we thought the shares were undervalued, the risk of capital loss would be low.All in all, we'd wait for a dividend increase or a pullback in Honeywell's shares. However, there's no denying its dividend growth is sweet.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

845681,27361,2012-09-04T16:07:00-04:00,,"A company's debt, liabilities and risk are very important factors in understanding the company. Having an understanding of a company's debt and liabilities is a key component in understanding the risk of a company, thus aiding in the decision to invest, not to invest, or to stay invested in a company. There are many metrics involved in understanding the debt of a company, but for this article, I will look at Honeywell International's (NYSE:HON) total debt, total liabilities, debt ratios and WACC.Through the above-mentioned four main metrics, we will understand more about the company's debt, liabilities and risk. If this summary is compared with other companies in the same sector, you will be able see which has the most debt and the most risk.All material is sourced from Google Finance, Morningstar and Company webpage.1. Total Debt = Long-Term Debt + Short-Term DebtA debt is an amount of money borrowed by one party from another, and must be paid back. Total debt is the sum of long-term debt, which is debt that is due in one year or more, and short-term debt, which is any debt that is due within one year.Honeywell International's total debt has decreased over the past five years. The company reported a five-year low of $6.654 billion in 2010, and a five-year high in 2008 at $8.375 billion. In 2011, the company reported a total debt of $7.555 billion, which was an decrease of 1.35% over 2007.2. Total LiabilitiesLiabilities are a company's legal debts or obligations that arise during the course of business operations, so debts are one type of liability, but not all liabilities. Total liabilities is the combination of long-term liabilities, which are the liabilities that are due in one year or more, and short-term or current liabilities, which are any liabilities due within one year.Honeywell's liabilities have increased from $24.583 billion in 2007, to $29.002 billion in 2011, an increase of 17.98%.In analyzing the company's total debt and liabilities, we can see that the company currently has a moderate amount of debt at $7.555 billion and a large amount of liabilities at $29.002 billion for the size of the company. Over the past five years, the total debt has decreased by 1.35%, while total liabilities have increased by 17.98%. As the company's still has a moderate amount of debt and the liabilities have increased over the past five years, the next step will reveal if the company has the ability to pay for their debt and liabilities.Debt Ratios3. Total Debt to Total Assets Ratio = Total Debt / Total AssetsThis is a metric used to measure a company's financial risk by determining how much of the company's assets have been financed by debt. It is calculated by adding short-term and long-term debt and then dividing by the company's total assets.A debt ratio of greater than 1 indicates that a company has more total debt than assets; meanwhile, a debt ratio of less than 1 indicates that a company has more assets than total debt. Used along with other measures of financial health, the total- debt-to-total-assets ratio can help investors determine a company's level of risk.As Honeywell International's total-debt-to-total-assets ratio is well below 1 and dropping, this indicates that Honeywell has many more assets than total debt, ensuring that the company is currently in good financial condition.4. Debt ratio = Total Liabilities / Total AssetsTotal liabilities divided by total assets. The debt ratio shows the proportion of a company's assets that are financed through debt. If the ratio is less than 0.5, most of the company's assets are financed through equity. If the ratio is greater than 0.5, most of the company's assets are financed through debt. Companies with high debt/asset ratios are said to be ""highly leveraged."" A company with a high debt ratio or that is ""highly leveraged"" could be in danger if creditors start to demand repayment of debt.In looking at Honeywell's total liabilities to total assets ratio, we can see that the ratio has remained almost the same over the past 3 years. As these numbers are around 0.75 mark, this indicates that Honeywell has financed most of the company's assets through debt. As Honeywell's debt ratio is below 1 this implies that the company is not in danger of becoming insolvent and/or going bankrupt.5. Debt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Shareholders' EquityThe debt-to-equity ratio is another leverage ratio that compares a company's total liabilities with its total shareholders' equity. This is a measurement of how much suppliers, lenders, creditors and obligators have committed to the company versus what the shareholders have committed.A high debt-to-equity ratio generally means that a company has been aggressive in financing its growth with debt. This can result in the company reporting volatile earnings. In general, a high debt-to-equity ratio indicates that a company may not be able to generate enough cash to satisfy its debt obligations, and therefore is considered a riskier investment.Over the past three years, Honeywell International's debt-to-equity ratio has been moderately high. In 2011, the ratio was calculated at 2.68, as the ratio is well above 1 this indicates that suppliers, lenders, creditors and obligators have more equity invested than shareholders; 2.68 indicates a moderately high amount of risk for the company. As the ratio is well above 1 and considered moderately high, so is the risk for the company.6. Capitalization Ratio = LT Debt / LT Debt + Shareholders' Equity(LT Debt = Long-Term Debt)The capitalization ratio tells the investors about the extent to which the company is using its equity to support its operations and growth. This ratio helps in the assessment of risk. Companies with a high capitalization ratio are considered to be risky because they are at a risk of insolvency if they fail to repay their debt on time. Companies with a high capitalization ratio may also find it difficult to get more loans in the future.Over the past three years, Honeywell's capitalization ratio has been between .41 to .35. This implies that the company has had relatively the same amount of equity compared with its long-term debt. As this is the case, the company has had around the same amount of equity to support its operations and add growth through its equity. As the ratio has been relatively the same so has the company's risk.7. Interest Coverage Ratio = EBIT (Earnings before interest and taxes) / Interest ExpensesThe interest coverage ratio is used to determine how easily a company can pay interest expenses on outstanding debt. The ratio is calculated by dividing a company's earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) by the company's interest expenses for the same period. The lower the ratio, the more the company is burdened by debt expense; the higher the ratio the better. When a company's interest coverage ratio is 1.5 or lower, its ability to meet interest expenses may be questionable.Honeywell's interest coverage ratio has ranged between 7.07 and 8.36 over the past 3 years. As the interest ratio has been well over 1.5, this implies that the company is not burdened by debt expenses.8. Cash Flow to Total Debt Ratio = Operating Cash Flow / Total DebtThis coverage ratio compares a company's operating cash flow with its total debt. This ratio provides an indication of a company's ability to cover total debt with its yearly cash flow from operations. The higher the percentage ratio, the better the company's ability to carry its total debt. The larger the ratio, the better a company can weather rough economic conditions.Over the past 3 years the cash flow to total debt ranged between .63 to .37. As the ratio is well below 1 this implies that the company did not have the ability to cover its total debt with its yearly cash flow from operations.Based on the above six debt ratios, we can see that Honeywell International has very stable results in regards to its debt ratios. As the ratios results are very stable, this indicates that Honeywell has the ability to pay for its debt, is not burdened by tax expenses, and is not on the verge of bankruptcy. The next step will reveal how much the company will pay for the debt incurred.Cost of DebtThe cost of debt is the effective rate that a company pays on its total debt.As a company acquires debt through various bonds, loans and other forms of debt, the cost of debt metric is useful, because it gives an idea as to the overall rate being paid by the company to use debt financing.This measure is also useful because it gives investors an idea as to the riskiness of the company compared with others. The higher the cost of debt the higher the risk.9. Cost of debt (before tax) = Corporate Bond rate of company's bond rating.According to the S&P rating guide, the ""A"" rating is - ""Strong capacity to meet financial commitments, but somewhat susceptible to adverse economic conditions and changes in circumstances."" Honeywell Company has a rating that meets this description.10. Current tax rate ( Income Tax total / Income before Tax)5-year average = 25.22%Over the past five years, Honeywell International has averaged a tax rate of 25.22%.11. Cost of Debt (After Tax) = (Cost of debt before tax) (1 - tax rate)The effective rate that a company pays on its current debt after tax.The cost of debt after tax for Honeywell International is 2.86%Cost of equity or R equity = Risk free rate + Beta equity (Average market return - Risk free rate)The cost of equity is the return a firm theoretically pays to its equity investors, for example, shareholders, to compensate for the risk they undertake by investing in their company.Risk free rate + Beta equity (Average market return - Risk free rate)Honeywell International has a cost of equity or R Equity of 8.90%. So investors should expect to get a return of 8.90% over the long term on their investment to compensate for the risk they undertake by investing in this company.(Please note that this is the CAPM approach to finding the cost of equity. Inherently, there are some flaws with this approach and that the numbers are very ""general."" This approach is based off of the S&P average return from 1950 - 2011 at 7%, the U.S. 10-year bond for the risk free rate which is susceptible to daily change and Google finance beta.)Weighted Average Cost of Capital or WACCThe WACC calculation is a calculation of a company's cost of capital in which each category of capital is equally weighted. All capital sources such as common stock, preferred stock, bonds and all other long-term debt are included in this calculation.As the WACC of a firm increases, and the beta and rate of return on equity increases, this states a decrease in valuation and a higher risk.By taking the weighted average, we can see how much interest the company has to pay for every dollar it finances.For this calculation, you will need to know the following listed below:Tax Rate = 25.22% (Honeywell's five-year average Tax Rate)Cost of Debt (before tax) or R debt = 3.83%Cost of Equity or R equity = 8.90%Debt (Total Liabilities) for 2011 or D = $29.002 billionStock Price = $58.45 (September 3rd, 2012)Outstanding Shares = 780.57 MillionEquity = Stock price x Outstanding Shares or E = $45.624 billionDebt + Equity or D+E = $74.626 billionWACC = R = (1 - Tax Rate) x R debt (D/D+E) + R equity (E/D+E)(1 - Tax Rate) x R debt (D/D+E) + R equity (E/D+E)(1 - .2522) x .0383 x ($29.002/$74.626) + .0890 ($45.624/$74.626).7478 x .0383 x .3886 + .0890 x .6113.0111 + .0544= 6.55%Based on the calculations above, we can arrive that Honeywell International pays 6.55% on every dollar that it finances or .0655 on every dollar. From this calculation, we understand that on every dollar the company spends on an investment, the company must make $.0655, plus the cost of the investment for the investment to be feasible for the company.SummaryIn analyzing the company's total debt and liabilities, we can see that the company currently has a moderate amount of debt at $7.555 billion and a large amount of liabilities at $29.002 billion for the size of the company. Over the past five years, the total debt has decreased by 1.35%, while total liabilities have increased by 17.98%.Based on the above six debt ratios, we can see that Honeywell International has very stable results in regards to its debt ratios. Based on the good results from the ratios above, this indicates that Honeywell has the ability to pay for its debt and is not on the verge of bankruptcy.As Honeywell's bond rating currently stands at ""A"" this indicates that the company has a ""Strong capacity to meet financial commitments, but somewhat susceptible to adverse economic conditions and changes in circumstances.""The CAPM approach for cost of equity states that shareholders need 8.90% over a long period of time on their equity to make it worthwhile to invest in the company. This calculation is so based on the average market return between 1950 and 2011 at 7%.The WACC calculation reveals that the company pays 6.55% on every dollar that it finances. As the current WACC of Honeywell International is currently 6.55% and the beta is above average at 1.35, it implies that the company needs 6.55% on future investments and will have above average volatility moving forward.Based on the calculations above, the company has a moderate amount of debt and a large amount of liabilities in comparison to the size of the company but currently has the capacity to make its debts payments, meet its tax obligations and is not in danger of bankruptcy.The analysis of Honeywell International's debt and liabilities indicates a strong company with a manageable amount of debt and liabilities. The analysis also reveals the company is strong and stable in regards to the debt ratios. The WACC reveals that Honeywell also and has the ability to add future investments and assets at reasonably low rates. Currently, Honeywell International has the ability to pay for its debts, meet its tax obligations, is not in danger of bankruptcy, and has the opportunity to capitalize on future investments with relatively low risk.For another article on Honeywell International please read:Honeywell: Inside The NumbersDisclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

910351,25120,2012-10-08T10:29:10-04:00,,"Honeywell (HON) announced last week on Monday that it will acquire a 70% stake in Thomas Russell Co. for $525 million in cash. Shares of Honeywell rose 1.8% in Monday's trading session.The DealHoneywell announced that its UOP business will acquire a 70% stake in Thomas Russell, the privately-held provider of technology and equipment for natural gas processing and treating.Honeywell will pay $525 million for a 70% stake in the company, valuing the entire company at $750 million. Honeywell has the right to acquire the remaining 30% stake in the near future.With the acquisition of Thomas Russell, UOP will offer a range of technologies and products. This allows shale and conventional natural gas producers to remove contaminants from natural gas and recover high-value natural gas liquids used for petrochemicals and fuel.Thomas Russell expects to generate annual revenues of $425 million in 2012. Further financial details were not released. The deal values Thomas Russell at 1.8 times 2012s annual revenues.Honeywell estimates that the acquisition is accretive to 2013's earnings. The deal is subject to customary regulatory approvals and is expected to close in the fourth quarter.ValuationHoneywell ended its second quarter of 2012 with $4.8 billion in cash, equivalents and short term investments. The company operates with $8.0 billion in short and long term debt, for a modest net debt position of $3.2 billion. Given the size of Honeywell and its financial strength, the acquisition can easily be financed.For the first six months of 2012, Honeywell generated revenues of $18.7 billion. The company net earned $1.7 billion, or $2.21 per diluted share. For the full year of 2012, Honeywell guides for annual revenues of $37.8-$38.4 billion. Earnings per share are expected to come in between $4.40-$4.55.The market values Honeywell at $48 billion. This values the firm at 1.3 times annual revenues and 14 times 2012s expected annual earnings.Currently, Honeywell pays a quarterly dividend of $0.37 per share, for an annual dividend yield of 2.4%.Investment ThesisYear to date, shares of Honeywell have risen some 13%. Shares have traded the entire year between $53-$63 per share, now exchanging hands at the upper end of the range at $61.Over the past five years, shares are trading largely unchanged. Shares fell to lows of $25 in the beginning of 2009 but have recovered to $60 at the moment, around its all time highs. Between 2008 and 2012, the company only modestly increased its annual revenues from $36.6 billion in 2008 to an expected $38.1 billion this year. Net income rose from $806 million to an expected $3.5 billion.Honeywell's deal with Thomas Russell is rather modest, given the size of the industrial conglomerate. The entire deal will add little over 1% in total revenues. It is a useful addition to its UOP Gas Processing and Hydrogen business.Furthermore the deal seems fair on a revenue multiple and increases Honeywell's exposure to the growing natural gas industry. The deal values Thomas Russell at a revenue multiple of 1.8, versus a valuation of 1.3 times for Honeywell itself. Honeywell's UOP business has already increased its offerings in natural gas by acquiring the gas membranes line from W.R. Grace in 2009.Shares of Honeywell trade at a fair valuation, despite the fact that shares are trading near all time highs. While I see few short-term triggers for shares, the stock is a perfect addition to any-long term portfolio. Investors should expect moderate capital gains in future years as the company has decent operations in a range of industries. The company trades at 14 times annual earnings, and continues to pay a reasonable dividend yield of 2.4%.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

726471,21445,2012-07-17T12:48:44-04:00,,"Honeywell International (NYSE:HON) is expected to report Q2 earnings before the market open on Wednesday, July 18 with a conference call scheduled for 9:00 am ET.Analysts are looking for EPS of $1.12 on revenue of $9.56B. The consensus range is $1.09-$1.14 for EPS, and $9.4B-$9.69B for revenue, according to First Call. The company reported positive results in Q1, beating both EPS and revenue estimates. On its Q1 earnings report, the company raised FY12 adjusted EPS guidance to $4.35-$4.55 from $4.25-$4.50, consensus $4.44. However, it narrowed its FY12 revenue view to $38B-$38.6B from prior $37.8B-$38.9B, consensus $38.53B. Management noted that Q1 performance benefited from higher than expected organic sales, but Europe still remained soft. It expected the Aerospace commercial aftermarket to moderate in 2H12, with Defense and Space down 6%-8%. CEO David Cote further revised FY12 revenue guidance on May 31, saying he expected ""revenue of about $38B,"" consensus $38.58B. He also noted that the appetite for acquisitions remained ""very, very high."" Shares of Honeywell have traded modestly lower since Q1 results were released, moving from around $60 to a recent $54.00. Concerns about the situation in Europe have likely dampened any gains."
733251,24361,2012-07-19T14:03:36-04:00,,"Industrial companies and stocks are clearly out of favor right now, and that's not an entirely unreasonable position - Europe continues to struggle, China and Brazil look weaker, and even the robust U.S. industrial rebound seems to be tiring. All of that bad news seem to largely be in these stocks, though, and that could make it a good time to consider shopping for diversified names like Honeywell (HON).Growth Is Soft, But Execution Looks Very GoodOn balance, Honeywell seems to be doing pretty well in the face of tougher, lower-growth conditions across many of its markets. With solid management execution showing through in the margins, I can understand why investors would look to this as a worthwhile name to hold in anticipation of a rebound.Sales were up about 4% this quarter, with volume up 4% and price more or less flat across the board. Aerospace grew well, with revenue climbing 8%. Automation and Control saw a 2% revenue gain, while Performance Materials rose 10%. Transport, with its sizable exposure to Europe, was the only declining business (down 9%).As mentioned, margins were solid. Gross margins were basically flat with the year-ago (and up sequentially about half a point), while corporate-level operating income rose 10%. Segment operating income climbed 14%, with only the transport business showing a year-on-year decline in operating margin.Aerospace Likely To Glide Down A BitHoneywell saw quite strong original equipment orders in its commercial aerospace business, as well as strong aftermarket orders. All of this helped offset expected weaker defense sales, but sustainability could be an issue. While wide-body production rates at Boeing (BA) are going to keep General Electric (GE) and United Technologies (UTX) plenty busy, I would expect the aftermarket business to slow more to a level in line with actual flight hours (low single-digit growth recently).ACS A ""When, Not If"" BusinessI would suspect that business for the ACS business is not going to get substantially better this year. Other automation companies like ABB (ABB), Emerson (EMR), and Siemens (SI) have been sounding increasingly nervous about this market, particularly with the slowdowns in Europe, China, and Brazil. Likewise, there's no real momentum in residential or commercial construction or renovation to fuel expectations of a big improvement in building control.All of that said, these are attractive markets for the long-term. Emerging market customers are keenly interested in reducing their power needs, and that is an area where Honeywell is quite good. What's more, with China apparently looking to stimulate the economy by funding more large-scale projects like refineries and regional airports, that does fit with some Honeywell's stronger capabilities in ACS.The Bottom LineAs industrial conglomerates go, I rather like Honeywell. I wish the returns on capital were higher, and I wish the company's free cash flow conversion rates were stronger, but there's no perfect industrial stock. Relative to the likes of Emerson, Siemens, and maybe even my much-favored ABB, Honeywell looks like a quality name to own.Valuation is just not quite there for me yet, though. Even if Honeywell can grow free cash flow at a low-teens rate for the next decade (based on abnormally low 2011; more like mid-single-digit growth on an adjusted basis), fair value tops out at around $70. That's not bad at all, but the appreciation potential is below my hurdle rate for new investments and I am more inclined towards names like GE and ABB among conglomerates or Cummins (CMI) and BorgWarner (BWA) in less-diversified industrials.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
687851,24491,2012-06-27T13:35:06-04:00,,"History has revealed that the best-performing stocks during the previous decades have been those that shelled out ever-increasing cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. Unfortunately for the individual investor and time-strapped financial advisor, most dividend analysis that we've seen out there is backward-looking - meaning it rests on what the company has done in the past: how long it has raised its dividend, etc. We're looking to change that view.Although analyzing historical trends is important, we think assessing what may happen in the future is even more important. That is why we created a forward-looking assessment of dividend safety through our innovative, predictive dividend-cut indicator, the Valuentum Dividend Cushion™. We use our future forecasts for free cash flow and expected dividends and consider the company's net cash position to make sure that each company is able to pay out such dividend obligations to you -- long into the future. In this article, let's evaluate the investment merits of Honeywell (NYSE:HON), as well as its dividend.Investment ConsiderationsReturn on Invested CapitalHoneywell's DividendHoneywell's dividend yield is above average, offering just above a 2.6% annual payout at recent price levels - we prefer yields above 3%, and don't include firms with yields below 2% in our dividend portfolio.We think the safety of Honeywell's dividend is GOOD (please see our definitions at the bottom of this article). We measure the safety of the dividend in a unique but very straightforward fashion. As many know, earnings can fluctuate in any given year, so using the payout ratio in any given year has some limitations. Plus, companies can often encounter unforeseen charges (read hiccups in operations), which makes earnings an even less-than-predictable measure of the safety of the dividend in any given year. We know that companies won't cut the dividend just because earnings have declined or they had a restructuring charge that put them in the red for the quarter (year). As such, we think that assessing the cash flows of a business allows us to determine whether it has the capacity to continue paying these cash outlays well into the future.That has led us to develop the forward-looking Valuentum Dividend Cushion™. The measure is a ratio that sums the existing cash a company has on hand plus its expected future free cash flows over the next five years and divides that sum by future expected dividends over the same time period. Basically, if the score is above 1, the company has the capacity to pay out its expected future dividends. As income investors, however, we'd like to see a score much larger than 1 for a couple reasons: 1) the higher the ratio, the more ""cushion"" the company has against unexpected earnings shortfalls, and 2) the higher the ratio, the greater capacity a dividend-payer has in boosting the dividend in the future.For Honeywell, this score is 2.8, revealing the firm has a nice ""cushion"" and the capacity to pay out its expected future dividends. The beauty of the Dividend Cushion is that it can be compared apples-to-apples across companies. For example, Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) scores a 1.4 on this measure. Also, for firms that have a score below 1 or that have a negative score, the risk of a dividend cut in the future is certainly elevated. In fact, the Valuentum Dividend Cushion caught all dividend cuts in our non-financial coverage universe, except for one, which subsequently raised its dividend above pre-cut levels (meaning it shouldn't have cut it in the first place). View our backtesting work here. We use our dividend cushion as a key decision component in choosing companies for addition to the portfolio of our Dividend Growth Newsletter (please see our links on the left sidebar for more information).Now on to the potential growth of Honeywell's dividend. As we mentioned above, we think the larger the ""cushion"" the larger capacity it has to raise the dividend. However, such dividend growth analysis is not complete until after considering management's willingness to increase the dividend. As such, we evaluate the company's historical dividend track record. If there have been no dividend cuts in 10 years, the company has a nice growth rate, and a nice dividend cushion, its future potential dividend growth would be EXCELLENT, which is the case for Honeywell. And because capital preservation is also an important consideration, we assess the risk associated with the potential for capital loss (offering investors a complete picture). In Honeywell's case, we think the shares are fairly valued, so the risk of capital loss is MEDIUM. If we thought shares of the firm were undervalued, the risk of capital loss would be LOW.All things considered, the growth potential and safety of Honeywell's dividend are attractive, and the size of its yield makes the firm worth considering as a potential income play. However, we'd be really excited if its shares were undervalued, too. In the spirit of transparency, our full report on Honeywell and hundreds of other companies can be found here.The glossary below shows how we rate a company's dividend in each key area:Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

633541,27361,2012-06-03T09:53:26-04:00,,"Determining a company's financial health is a very important step in making a decision on whether to invest or to stay invested. There are many different ways to compute a company's financial health. In this test, I will be taking into consideration Honeywell International Incorporated's (NYSE:HON) profitability, debt and capital and operating efficiency. Based on this criteria, we get to see sales, returns, margins, liabilities, assets, returns and turnovers.ProfitabilityProfitability is a class of financial metrics that are used to assess a business' ability to generate earnings as compared with expenses and other relevant costs incurred during a specific period of time.In this section, we will look at four tests of profitability. They are: Net Income, Operating Cash Flow, Return on Assets and Quality of Earnings. From these four metrics, we will establish if the company is making money and gauge the quality of the reported profits.To pass, the company needs to have a positive net income. Honeywell International passes.Operating Cash Flow is the cash generated from the operations of a company, generally defined as revenue less all operating expenses, but calculated through a series of adjustments to net income.To pass, the company needs to have a positive operating cash flow. Honeywell International passes.ROA is an indicator of how profitable a company is relative to its total assets. ROA gives an idea as to how efficient management is at using its assets to generate earnings. Calculated by dividing a company's net income by its total assets, ROA is displayed as a percentage. Sometimes this is referred to as ""return on investment"".In 2010 to 2011, the company's ROA decreased. Honeywell does not pass.4. Quality of EarningsQuality of Earnings is the amount of earnings attributable to higher sales or lower costs rather than artificial profits created by accounting anomalies such as inflation of inventory.To pass, the operating cash flow must exceed the net income. Honeywell International passes, Operating Cash Flow exceeds net income.Debt and CapitalThe Debt and Capital section establishes if the company is sinking into debt or digging its way out. It will also determine if the company is growing organically or raising cash by selling off stock.TL/A ratio is a metric used to measure a company's financial risk by determining how much of the company's assets have been financed by debt.Honeywell Internationals increase in Total Assets did not exceed the percentage of Total Liabilities. Total Assets increased by 2.22%, while the total liabilities increased by 6.75%. The Total Assets did not exceed the Total liabilities. Honeywell International does not pass.Working Capital is a general and quick measure of liquidity of a firm. It represents the margin of safety or cushion available to creditors. It is an index of the firm's financial stability. It is also an index of technical solvency and an index of the strength of working capital.Boeing Company's current ratio went from 1.32 in 2010 to 1.31 in 2011. As the current ratio decreased, Honeywell International does not pass.To pass, the company's shares must increase less than by 2%. Honeywell internationals shares decreased by 8.4 million or 1.07%. Honeywell passes.Operating EfficiencyOperating Efficiency is a market condition that exists when participants can execute transactions and receive services at a price that equates fairly to the actual costs required to provide them. An operationally-efficient market allows investors to make transactions that move the market further toward the overall goal of prudent capital allocation without being chiseled down by excessive frictional costs, which would reduce the risk/reward profile of the transaction.The gross profit margin is a measurement of a company's manufacturing and distribution efficiency during the production process. The gross profit tells an investor the percentage of revenue / sales left after subtracting the cost of goods sold. A company that boasts a higher gross profit margin than its competitors and industry is more efficient. Investors tend to pay more for businesses that have higher efficiency ratings than their competitors, as these businesses should be able to make a decent profit as long as overhead costs are controlled (overhead refers to rent, utilities, etc.)The gross profit margins decreased slightly in 2011 from 2010. The gross margin went from 23.58% to 21.82%. Honeywell International does not pass.The formula for the asset turnover ratio evaluates how well a company is utilizing its assets to produce revenue.The numerator of the asset turnover ratio formula shows revenues found on a company's income statement and the denominator shows total assets that is found on a company's balance sheet. Total assets should be averaged over the period of time that is being evaluated.As the Sales growth is exceeding the Asset growth, this implies that the company is making money on its assets. Honeywell International passes.Based on the nine tests that Honeywell International received on profitability, debt and capital, and operating efficiency, Boeing received five passes out of nine - this is a passing grade for financial health. Honeywell did not pass the ROA metric, Debt and Capital, Working Capital and Gross Margin segments of the assessment.As the company did not pass the ROA metric, it implies that Honeywell was not as efficient in using its assets to generate earnings as the year previous. As the company did not pass the debt and capital metric this implies that the company used debt to finance some of their purchases. Honeywell's decline in working capital was very slight, only .5% of a percentage point so this is something to keep an eye on but does not raise any concerns. As the company slipped in the gross margin metric, it implies Honeywell was not as efficient in its manufacturing and distribution during the production process. Even though the overall company financial health is good, these are some aspect of the company to keep an eye on in future reports. Overall, based on the nine tests, the company is showing passing results with five passes out of nine.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

With the recent market tumult and the likelihood of continued volatility in the macro environment over the rest of 2012, investors should have a buy list ready for future dips, pullbacks and corrections. Honeywell deserves to be on that buy list. Here's why:PerformanceOne of the most important values in life, business and the market is the value of integrity (OK, maybe just in life). If a person or a company says s/he/it is going to do something, that something better get done. Once or twice, one can afford to miss a target without totally damaging one's credibility, but if it keeps happening, that person/company can't be trusted.That last scenario? Honeywell's performance has been the flip side of that: The company has delivered on its targets and its promises and then some.Companies get measured on their long-term execution as well as the quarterly checkups. Honeywell's health has been sound during its checkups, with earnings beats in eight of the last nine quarters against analysts' estimates and/or its own guidance. Honeywell has started off 2012 on a positive note as well, with a triple threat of earnings beat/revenues beat/guidance raise in the first quarter. This constant upwards pressure on estimates and earnings speaks to Honeywell's execution.That execution fits into the achievement of the company's longer-term goals. Honeywell's goal is to hit $41-45B in sales by 2014, an annual growth rate of 6-8%. Hardly an eye-popping number, but considering the ongoing challenges from Europe, the slow recovery in the U.S., and even the bumps in the high-growth markets of China, India and other developing markets, this sort of conservative, consistent achievement would be laudable. Similarly, the company is more than halfway along a five-year plan to improve segment margins for its various businesses, and should achieve its long-term goal of 16-18% by 2014 comfortably, leading to faster earnings growth than the revenue number above.Honeywell's business spans across four segments: Automations and Control Solutions, Aerospace and Defense, Performance Materials and Technologies, and Transportation Systems. The company produces thermostats that help improve energy efficiency in the house, turbo systems that increase performance at no cost to efficiency for vehicles, and a variety of efficient and greener fuels and chemicals for industrial markets, among many other things. Within its diversified business, the company has managed to refocus itself over the past 10 years through key acquisitions and divestitures, as well as an overall tightening of operations, to achieve consistency in its results.A good example of this is Honeywell's most recent noteworthy contract win. Honeywell is teaming with Inmarsat (OTCPK:IMASF) to provide broadband internet equipment on airlines. Honeywell estimates $2.8B in revenue over the span of the 20-year contract. The revenue is nice, but not earth-shattering for a company that raked in $36.5B last year in sales. But that this contract win came directly out of the company's acquisition of EMS Technologies last summer speaks to wise acquiring, good integrating and an overall job well done to date. Or as CEO Dave Cote put it on this year's Q1 call:This sort of foresight, execution, and track record makes Honeywell a steady company, which should translate into steady growth for the stock over the coming years.ValuationHoneywell is not cheap when compared to its peers:(Sources: TDAmeritrade, WSJ)As the chart shows, the P/E ratios are roughly in line with peers (with Eaton as the cheapest of the bunch), and the P/FCF ratio and PEG ratios for Honeywell are on the high end of the group. Honeywell's yield also ranks on the low end of this group.That said, two points to be made before the investor rushes off and buys stock in Eaton (not that buying Eaton would be a bad thing, what with its recent acquisition Cooper Industries, but that's for another article). First, Honeywell is not overvalued at these levels. 14x past year's earnings is an appropriate multiple, and maybe even a low one. Second, and more importantly, Honeywell's earnings performance in terms of hitting or beating estimates and guidance has been better than rivals. The performance merits a higher multiple than peers.Solid Financials, DividendHoneywell's debt position is solid. The current ratio is 1.31, the quick ratio is .97, and the cash ratio is .34: that last isn't spectacular, but the others should allay any doubts about Honeywell's financial viability. The total debt to equity ratio is .7, another manageable figure. This comes after the recent EMS acquisition.The company also generates positive free cash flow after dividends, and has raised its dividend seven times in the past eight years. Considering the earnings growth and the company's goal of 100% free cash flow conversion, a dividend hike by fourth quarter of 2012 seems like a decent bet.LeadershipBehind the strong performance and growth of the company has been consistent, quality leadership. Cote has been CEO of the company since February 2002, guiding the company through a major turn around and revitalization. Dave Anderson has been CFO since June 2003. This consistency at the top has helped pace Honeywell along its successful trajectory. While one can find criticism on Cote for his approach toward unions, in the past months the most significant negative news about the CEO had to do with his position on JPMorgan's (NYSE:JPM) risk-policy committee (and the unmonitored, risky beached whale $2B trading loss) and his criticism of business policies in India. Neither poses any headwind for Honeywell's continued success.The Other Shoe - CaveatsWhich isn't to say the stock doesn't face headwinds. Most significant are the aforementioned macro concerns: any Seeking Alpha reader is aware of the tumultuous period Europe will continue to endure over the coming months and possibly years. While Honeywell has had strong success in the U.S. and non-European international markets, that success rests on an uneasy macro foundation. Considering the company is a cyclical play, any significant downturn poses a great risk.It should also be mentioned that the stock has not outperformed the S&P 500 (NYSEARCA:SPY) over the past year. Honeywell is down about 4% (1.5% if you add dividends back in), while the index is flat. That said, over three, five, and 10-year time frames, the stock has comfortably outperformed the index as a whole.(Source: TDAmeritrade; Honeywell's share price is represented by the green line, the index by the black line, the other lines are Honeywell's 9, 27, and 200-day Moving Averages.)The Time to BuyHoneywell's stock, like the market as a whole, slogged through May. Since getting as high as 61.45 at the end of April in the wake of the positive Q1 earnings, Honeywell's share price has dropped as much as 10.5%, before recovering to its current 57.2 price (as of Tuesday, May 29th's close). Applying its past year multiple on earnings of 14x to 2013 forward earnings, I get a 12-month target price of 70.42, a 23% return before factoring in dividends.The stock's 200-day moving average hovers just above 54. The stock price hasn't seen that level since before Christmas. As we enter what could be another volatile summer, however, 54-55 looms as a good place to enter a long position in the stock or lower cost basis on an existing position, depending on one's status (I'm looking to do the latter around 54, for example).Honeywell has a compelling, consistent growth story, quality management, good positioning, a nice dividend and reasonable valuation. The stock is a quality one to own. If you are looking for a long-term cyclical play with dividends and growth prospects, you would do well to add Honeywell to your buy list, and from there to your portfolio.Disclosure: I am long HON."

Analysts are looking for EPS of 99c on revenue of $9.16B. The consensus range is 94c-$1.03 for EPS, and $9.01B-$9.3B for revenue, according to First Call. The company reported mixed results in Q4, beating EPS but narrowly missing revenue estimates. On its Q4 earnings report, the company issued Q1 EPS guidance of 93c-98c and revenue of $9B-$9.2B. It also reaffirmed FY12 EPS $4.25-$4.50 and revenue $37.8B-$39.9B, consensus is $4.44/$38.62B. Management noted that its FY12 estimates were towards the ""high side"" of guidance, and the company was continuing to plan for U.S. defense budgetary pressures. The company forecast a slow growth economic environment in 2012. Shares of Honeywell have traded in a narrow range since Q4 results were released, and are approximately four points off their 52-week high of $62.27 made last year."
395681,24491,2012-02-27T16:50:52-05:00,,"As part of our process, we perform a rigorous discounted cash-flow methodology that dives into the true intrinsic worth of companies. In Honeywell's (NYSE:HON) case, we think the firm is fairly valued at $62 per share, near where it is currently trading.For some background, we think a comprehensive analysis of a firm's discounted cash-flow valuation, relative valuation versus industry peers, as well as an assessment of technical and momentum indicators is the best way to identify the most attractive stocks at the best time to buy. This process culminates in what we call our Valuentum Buying Index.If a company is undervalued both on a DCF and on a relative valuation basis and is showing improvement in technical and momentum indicators, it scores high on our scale. Honeywell posts a VBI score of 7 on our scale, reflecting our 'fairly valued' DCF assessment, the firm's attractive relative valuation versus peers, and its bullish techinicals. Honeywell along with United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) post the highest VBI among peers Danaher (NYSE:DHR), Tyco Intl (TYC), and 3M (MMM).Our Report on Honeywell imagesInvestment ConsiderationsInvestment HighlightsHoneywell earns a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT, the highest possible mark on our scale. The firm has been generating economic value for shareholders for the past few years, a track record weview very positively. Return on invested capital (excluding goodwill) has averaged 25.8% during the past three years.The firm is trading at attractive valuation multiples relative to peers, but our DCF process indicates a less compelling opportunity. We'd wait for a clearer signal on valuation before jumping into the firm's shares.Honeywell has a good combination of strong free cash flow generation and manageable financial leverage. We expect the firm's free cash flow margin to average about 9.1% in coming years. Total debt-to-EBITDA was 2.1 last year, while debt-to-book capitalization stood at 40.9%.Although we think there may be a better time to dabble in the firm's shares based on our DCF process, the firm's stock has outperformed the market benchmark during the past quarter, indicating increased investor interest in the company.The firm sports a very nice dividend yield of 2.5%. We expect the firm to pay out about 33% of next year's earnings to shareholders as dividends. We have Honeywell on the watch list contained within our Dividend Growth Newsletter.Economic Profit AnalysisThe best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital (ROIC) with its weighted average cost of capital (WACC). The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. Honeywell 's 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 25.8%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 10.3%. As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT. In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate.Cash Flow AnalysisFirms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. Honeywell 's free cash flow margin has averaged about 8.9% during the past 3 years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generation is relatively STRONG. The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. For more information on the differences between these two measures, please visit our website at Valuentum.com. At Honeywell, cash flow from operations decreased about 34% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures expanded about 31% over the same time period.Valuation AnalysisOur discounted cash flow model indicates that Honeywell 's shares are worth between $47 and $78 each. The margin of safety around our fair value estimate is driven by the firm's MEDIUM ValueRisk™ rating, which is derived from the historical volatility of key valuation drivers. The estimated fair value of $62 per share represents a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 26.4 times last year's earnings and an implied EV/EBITDA multiple of about 14.9 times last year's EBITDA. Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 5.2% during the next five years, a pace that is higher than the firm's 3-year historical compound annual growth rate of 0%. Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 12.2%, which is above Honeywell 's trailing 3-year average. Beyond year 5, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 2.1% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For Honeywell , we use a 10.3% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows.Margin of Safety AnalysisOur discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $62 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future was known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values. Our ValueRisk™ rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock. In the graph below, we show this probable range of fair values for Honeywell. We think the firm is attractive below $47 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $78 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion.Future Path of Fair ValueWe estimate Honeywell 's fair value at this point in time to be about $62 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart below compares the firm's current share price with the path of Honeywell 's expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate. The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year 3 represents our best estimate of the value of the firm's shares three years hence. This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the firm's future cash flow potential change. The expected fair value of $79 per share in Year 3 represents our existing fair value per share of $62 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.Pro Forma Financial StatementsDisclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
542751,20725,2012-04-30T12:37:55-04:00,,"Honeywell (NYSE:HON) is in an enviable position with products and services ranging from aerospace and defense to healthcare and medical to safety and security. It is diverse and has its foot print in a number of areas with annual revenue approaching $40 billion. Its recent earnings report on April 20 was a typically solid performance as it beat EPS estimates by 5 cents with revenue growing 7% y/y. HON was also able to raise its FY12 EPS guidance. There were a number of factors behind the positive results. The Chairman and CEO, David Cote, said that ""we've seen good momentum in the U.S. and our key high growth regions, which is more than offsetting softness in Europe impacting our short-cycle businesses. Our long-cycle businesses, namely commercial aerospace and UOP, had particularly strong growth, overdriving expectations in the quarter. ..""Despite the positive results and raised guidance, HON is trading at about where it should be as all of the valuation metrics suggest that the stock is fairly valued or a bit overvalued. Below is an in depth look at the valuation metrics and stock chart.Valuation: Honeywell's trailing 5 year valuation metrics suggest that the stock is overvalued as all of the metrics are above their respective 5 year averages. Honeywell's current P/B ratio is 4.1 and it has averaged 3.8 over the past 5 years with a high of 5.6 and low of 2.7. Honeywell's current P/S ratio is 1.3 and it has averaged 1.1 over the past 5 years with a high of 1.4 and low of 0.6. Honeywell's current P/E ratio is 21.9 and it has averaged 20.1 over the past 5 years with a high of 36.2 and low of 11.3.Price Target: The consensus price target for the analysts who follow Honeywell is $68. That is upside of 12% from today's stock price of $60.57 and suggests that the stock is fairly valued at these levels. This also suggests that the stock has limited upside and should be avoided at its current stock price.Forward Valuation: Honeywell is currently trading at about $61 a share with analysts expecting EPS of $5.03 next year, an earnings increase of 12% y/y, for a forward P/E ratio of 12. Taking a look at the company's publicly traded comparisons will give us a better idea of the stock's relative valuation. General Electric (NYSE:GE) is currently trading at about $20 a share with analysts expecting EPS of $1.76 next year, an earnings increase of 14% y/y, for a forward P/E ratio of 11.1. Textron (NYSE:TXT) is currently trading at about $27 a share with analysts expecting EPS of $2.31 next year, an earnings increase of 18% y/y, for a forward P/E ratio of 11.6. United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) is currently trading at about $82 a share with analysts expecting EPS of $6.73 next year, an earnings increase of 22% y/y, for a forward P/E ratio of 12.1. The mean forward P/E of Honeywell's competitors is 11.6 which suggests that Honeywell is fairly valued relative to its publicly traded competitors.Earnings Estimates: Honeywell has beat EPS estimates every time in the past 4 quarters. The company's EPS figures have come in between 1 cents and 10 cents from consensus estimates or about 1% to 10% from analyst estimates. The company has reported earnings that have differed from analyst estimates by a small margin which suggests that the stock should experience limited upside from earnings surprises.Price Action: Honeywell is down 0.4% over the past year, underperforming the S&P 500, which is up 5.3%. Looking at the technicals, the stock is currently above its 50 day moving average, which sits at $59.63 and above its 200 day moving average, which sits at $53.20.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

The company has operations in the following segments: Aerospace, Automation & Control Solutions, Performance Materials, and Transportation Systems. Many of us have Honeywell thermostats in our homes. Some of its other products include: aircraft engines & systems, airport logistics, environmental & combustion controls, resins & chemicals, brakes for cars & commercial vehicles, and more.It looks fairly valued with a trailing PE ratio of 23.09, a forward PE ratio of 12.15, and a PEG of 0.97. The stock is currently trading at 4.36 times book value per share. If the price to book ratio was under 3, I would consider the stock undervalued. The company grew approximately in line with its earnings for the past five years reinforcing this fair valuation.Honeywell pays a respectable dividend of 2.4%. Although it does raise the dividend over time, the payout does sometimes remain stagnant for a few years before a new increase is implemented. The company does offer a DRIP (dividend reinvestment plan) for investor's convenience.Honeywell has operating cash flow of $2.83 billion and free cash flow of $2.87 billion. Only $1.2 billion of the free cash flow is used to pay dividends, while the other $1.67 billion is used to grow the business. Total cash stands at $4.11 billion and total debt is $7.56 billion. The company has 1.31 times more current assets than current liabilities.The earnings outlook is bright for Honeywell. It has two upward earnings revisions for 2013. Honeywell is expected to grow earnings annually at 14.17% for the next five years. This should allow the current stock price of $60 to grow to around $116 in five years. Since the company pays a dividend of 2.4%, investors should expect to earn a total annual yield of 16.57% over the next five years. Or, to put it another way, the initial investment should approximately double in five years.Emerging regions comprise 20% of Honeywell's total sales. The company is seeing large increases in Turbo, Commercial Aerospace, UOP (Honeywell's refining and petrochemicals company), and Process and Building solutions, with an increase in sales of 20% in the fourth quarter for China, India, and the Middle East.The Aerospace segment was another highlight in Q4 for Honeywell. Aerospace profit increased 40% in Q4 due to strong commercial aftermarket volume. Sales for the Performance Materials & Technologies segment (PMT) increased 24%. Advanced Materials sales increased 18%. Transportation Systems sales increased 10%, driven by sales of turbochargers. ACS (Automation and Controls) increased 4%, where the company saw solid global growth.Honeywell is expecting total sales for 2012 to fall in the range of 4% to 7%. It is projecting segment margins to grow 15% to 15.3% for the year. EPS is expected to be in the range of $4.25 to $4.50 which should reflect a 5% - 11% increase over 2011. These projections already account for a downturn in Europe for the first half of the year.The company expects better results for 2013 and beyond. It is expected to grow earnings at 11.9% for 2013. Earnings growth will continue to march higher in 2014 and beyond. This growth will be driven by strength in: commercial aerospace, process solutions, and its UOP business.Overall, Honeywell looks like a solid, diverse, dividend paying investment that will beat the market over the next five years.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Additional disclosure: Although I don't own Honeywell individually, I may have a position as part of a larger fund within my retirement plan."
384021,24866,2012-02-22T14:58:56-05:00,,"Honeywell (NYSE:HON) and United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) have been on a roll, yielding solid double-digit returns for the year to date. Both companies have impressive fundamentals and have taken appropriate measures to address inevitable defense cuts. Based on my review of their strengths an DCF model, I find safe 20% upside for both companies.From a multiples perspective, United Technologies is the cheaper of the two. It trades at a respective 15.3x and 12.4x past and forward earnings with a dividend yield of 2.3%. Honeywell, on the other hand, trades at a respective 25.7x and 12.1x past and forward earnings with a dividend yield of 2.5%. According to T1 Banker, United Technologies is also preferred at a ""strong buy"" versus just a ""buy"" for its competitor.At the fourth quarter earnings call, Honeywell's management noted an excellent close to the year:Fourth quarter results were terrific with the top-line up 4.8% y-o-y, driven by a 20% y-o-y rise in commercial aerospace. Even defense declines - the source of apprehension for investors - were swallowable. Operating margins of 14.9% grew 70 bps y-o-y and emerging markets now make up about one-fifth of business. Management is further well position the company to benefit from strong secular trends in energy efficiency as it invests in environmental controls and improves scale.Consensus estimates for Honeywell's EPS forecast that it will grow by 9.9% to $4.45 in 2012 and then by 11.7% and 12.5% in the following two years. Assuming a multiple of 15x and a conservative 2013 EPS of $4.93, the rough intrinsic value of the stock is $73.95, implies 23.5%.United Technologies similarly has safe upside, if not safer upside given that is 28.6% less volatile. The one area of uncertainty concerns financing the $16.4B Goodrich (NYSE:GR) takeover. It has been speculated that the company will sell off non-core assets to limit the impact of issuing $4B worth of equity. At the end of the day, however, Goodrich is a perfect acquisition since it dramatically improves both scale and pricing power. And on the organic side, management is making solid investments in aircraft engines to sustain momentum for Pratt and Whitney. As the company is the sole engine producer of joint striker F-35, it is relatively less vulnerable to defense cuts.Consensus estimates for United Technologies' EPS forecast that it will grow by 1.8% to $5.59 in 2012 and then by 20.8% and 14.8% in the following two years. Assuming a multiple of 15x and a conservative 2013 EPS of $6.66, the rough intrinsic value fo the stock is $99.90, implying 19% upside.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Additional disclosure: The distributor of this research report is not a licensed investment adviser or broker dealer.

Product sales generate about 80% of the revenue and services generate the remaining 20%. The trailing twelve month EPS is $3.49, this is more than double versus the EPS realized in 2003 ($1.54).Business operations are managed through four businesses that are reported as operating segments:Graph 1 gives an overview of the revenue percentage per business segment based on the latest quarterly SEC filing: Honeywell’s balance sheet looks good. The company has $3.88 billion in cash and $11.8 billion in stockholder equity, versus $8.2 billion in debt. Goodwill is around 25% of total assets. Average free cash flow over the last 3 years is approximately $3 billion. This is more than sufficient to support the $0.33 per share in quarterly dividend and the recent authorized repurchase of up to a total of $3 billion of Honeywell common stock. Financially, the company is in good shape.There are a few risky areas investors should keep an eye on. The aerospace, transportation and specialty material divisions are short-cycle businesses, sensitive to economic cycles. Raw material inflation due to rising commodity costs, like benzene cost, can have a big impact on earnings of segments like specialty materials.Additionally, sales to the U.S government amounted to $4.3 Billion last year (around 12% of revenue). The focus on government deficit reduction through budget cuts can put pressure on this part of the revenue.In the last 5 years Honeywell has consistently achieved gross margins above 20%, EBIT margins above 8% and a Return on equity above 20% (Graph 2). Good results in an era of uncertain economic times and rising commodity costs.5-Year Gross Margin, EBIT Margin and ROE Trend Honeywell is currently trading around $49, in between the 52-week low of $41 and high of $62. Current dividend yield is 3%. Using the discounted cash flow method, taking an EBIT percentage or 10%, tax percentage of 24%, discount rate of 10%, 10 year growth rate of 5% and a terminal growth rate of 0% gives an intrinsic value of $54 a share. I prefer to have at least 30% discount to intrinsic value when buying a stock. A price around $37 makes an attractive entry point to build a position.

Since then, Emerson has fallen by 8.2% and been outperformed by Honeywell by 1,740 basis points.

It trades at a respective 16x and 13.2x past and forward earnings while Honeywell trades at a respective 25.5x and 11.9x past and forward earnings. In addition, Honeywell's current PE multiple is 136% its historical 5-year average while Emerson is roughly in-line. But even after factoring in substantial multiples contraction, we still find that Honeywell will outperform.At the first quarter earnings call, Emerson's CEO, David Farr, noted an optimistic outlook despite recent disappointment:Orders in December decelerated from those in November, but management nevertheless reiterated sales growth of as high as 7% for 2012. Much of the poor results in December were expected due to the Thailand flooding impact and visibly poor business trends. ROIC is estimates to expand by around 480 bps to 27.2% in 2014 as net cash quickly convert into a net cash position. Going forward, network power and climate technologies, however, are fundamentally weak and will offset gains in tools and process.Consensus estimates for Emerson's EPS forecast that it will grow by 8% to $3.50 in 2012 and then by 13.4% and 11.3% in the following two years. Modeling a CAGR of 10.9% for EPS over the next three years and then discounting backward by a WACC of 9% yields a fair value figure of $56.26, implying 7.8% upside.Honeywell, on the other hand, had stellar performance in its most recent quarter. EPS came above the high-end of guidance as sales grew 7% organically off of greater exposure to emerging markets. Margins expanded by 90 bps to 15.1% while an impressive $1.4B worth of free cash flow was generated. Margins, ROIC, and net cash flow are all anticipated to grow as productivity gains continue to drive value creation.Consensus estimates for Honeywell's EPS forecast that it will grow by 9.9% to $4.45 in 2012 and then by 11.7% and 12.5% in the following two years. Assuming a multiple of 15x and a conservative 2013 EPS of $4.91, the rough intrinsic value of the stock is $73.65, implying 24.1% upside. This multiple, however, is well below the 5-year historical average and thus provides a safe estimate.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
314664,24242,2011-12-19T06:53:26-05:00,,"Honeywell International (NYSE:HON) is the world leader in avionics systems for commercial aircraft. In addition, Honeywell makes small engines for regional and business jets as well as for military vehicles. Investors may be more familiar with Honeywell products that involve heating, cooling, ventilation, home comfort, and security. Below is a breakdown of Honeywell's revenue percentages by segment.Honeywell's defense business has spooked investors, but the commercial aircraft market has been turning around. Increasing flight hours will continue to be a key driver for Honeywell's earnings. Honeywell has a long-term growth plan, and has set revenue and earnings expectations through 2014. The company aims to achieve a long-term revenue CAGR of 6% - 8%. Honeywell has stated that it is on target to meet the long-term objectives it has set out to achieve.Source: 2012 Outlook Announcement Presentation 12-15-11  Investors should take notice of Honeywell's long-term perspective. It isn't often that a company has the confidence to publish such goals, especially in this economic environment. Certainly there are risks to the projections, such as a deeper or more protracted recession in Europe, but the company feels that it can manage through the tough macro environment. I encourage readers to take a look at Honeywell's investor presentations, particularly the 2012 Outlook Announcement Presentation, for details on Honeywell's long-term growth plans.Currently shares of Honeywell trade around the mid-point of their 52 week range. Shares do trade at a premium relative to other companies in the defense sector. The premium doesn't seem absurd given that Honeywell has several other segments, including a large commercial avionics business, that drive revenue. The stock currently trades at about 15 times earnings and 12 times forward earnings. Honeywell has a price-to-earnings growth (PEG) ratio of 0.85. Honeywell has grown earnings at an annualized rate of 7% over the last five years.The stock currently yields 2.8%. Honeywell returns about 34% of cash to shareholders through its dividend. As revenue and cash flow increase over the coming years, so too should the dividend. Honeywell has increased its dividend at an annualized rate of 8% over the last five years.Click to enlargeSterne, Agee & Leach upgraded shares of Honeywell on November 28th, citing in part the recovering commercial aircraft segment and Honeywell's long-term growth plan. Sterne, Agee & Leach expect that Honeywell can earn $6.30 per share in 2014. At 11 times 2014 earnings, they give Honeywell a price target of $69.00. An earnings multiple of 11 would be less than where Honeywell is currently trading, so there may be much more upside potential for the stock by that time.Honeywell is a solid company with a long-term plan. It is refreshing to see management with such a long-term perspective. The stock is fairly priced right now, but investors may want to consider buying on dips. In order to get a 3% dividend yield, investors would want the stock to trade down to about $50.00. It isn't a stretch to think the stock could trade at that level given the current market volatility. Shares of Honeywell would be very attractive at a 3% or higher dividend yield. Patient investors may see Honeywell shares take flight well before the company achieves its long-term targets.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in HON over the next 72 hours."

In Honeywell's (NYSE:HON) case, we think it is worth more than $60 per share, representing meaningful upside from today's levels. Our full reports on Honeywell and hundreds of other companies are available on our website.We think a comprehensive analysis of a company's discounted cash-flow valuation, relative valuation versus industry peers, as well as an assessment of technical and momentum indicators is the best way to identify the most attractive stocks at the best time to buy. This process culminates in what we call our Valuentum Buying Index, which ranks stocks on a scale from 1 to 10, with 10 being the best. If a company is undervalued both on a DCF and on a relative valuation basis and is showing improvement in technical and momentum indicators, it scores high on our scale. We think our methodology and broad coverage universe is largely responsible for the meaningful outperformance of the portfolio in our Best Ideas Newsletter. In Honeywell's case, the company scores a 7 on our scale. Very few register this high on our scale, and such a score for Honeywell's reflects its undervaluation on a relative-value basis, as well as its very bullish technicals.Our Report on Honeywell(Click to enlarge)Investment Considerations (Click to enlarge)Investment Highlights  Honeywell earns a ValueCreation rating of EXCELLENT, the highest possible mark on our scale. The firm has been generating economic value for shareholders for the past few years, a track record we view very positively. We expect the firm's return on invested capital (excluding goodwill) to expand to 39.5% from 24.1% during the next two years.Honeywell has a good combination of strong free cash flow generation and manageable financial leverage. We expect the firm's free cash flow margin to average about 9% in coming years. Total debt-to-EBITDA was 1.6 last year, while debt-to-book capitalization stood at 38.4%.Although we think there may be a better time to dabble in the firm's shares based on our DCF process, the firm's stock has outperformed the market benchmark during the past quarter, indicating increased investor interest in the company.The firm sports a very nice dividend yield of 2.7%. We expect the firm to pay out about 35% of next year's earnings to shareholders as dividends.(Click to enlarge) Economic Profit AnalysisThe best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital (ROIC) with its weighted average cost of capital (OTC:WACC). The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. Honeywell 's 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 24.1%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 9.9%. As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreation rating of EXCELLENT. In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate.(Click to enlarge) (Click to enlarge)Cash Flow Analysis  (Click to enlarge)Firms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. Honeywell 's free cash flow margin has averaged about 9.8% during the past 3 years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generation is relatively STRONG. The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. For more information on the differences between these two measures, please visit our website at Valuentum.com. At Honeywell , cash flow from operations increased about 11% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures fell about 26% over the same time period.Recent Quarterly ResultsHoneywell reported fantastic third-quarter results that showed strong organic revenue growth and impressive margin improvement. We liked the firm’s performance and outlook, and we are maintaining our $61 fair value estimate.The conglomerate’s revenue advanced 14%, with 8% coming organically – a level matching General Electric’s (NYSE:GE) organic expansion during its quarter. Honeywell’s third-quarter performance was driven particularly by aerospace, an industry which we continue to overweight in our best ideas portfolio. We firmly believe the build rates by Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Airbus (OTCPK:EADSY) will accelerate in coming years thanks to the jet makers’ massive backlogs and material narrowbody rate increases. Honeywell, as well as a number of other component suppliers, are well-positioned to capitalize on this strength. Honeywell’s Automation and Controls Solutions segment also put up a solid quarter, with organic revenue advancing 4%--trumping concerns regarding the segment raised by Ingersoll Rand’s (NYSE:IR) negative earnings pre-announcement a few weeks ago. Revenue in the firm’s Transportations Systems segment jumped 22% thanks to higher global vehicle and passenger turbo vehicle volumes, while Specialty Materials also saw sales expansion of 25% thanks to strength at UOP, an organization specializing in process technology for oil refining and other energy-related systems.Honeywell’s third-quarter earnings-per-share growth was nothing short of stellar, up 45% from the same period a year ago. Segment profit in its aerospace segment jumped 16%, as segment margins advanced 120 basis points. At Automation and Controls Solutions, segment profit increased 15%, as segment margins nudged 20 basis points higher. Segment profit at Transportation Systems and Specialty Materials were particularly impressive, increasing over 30% at both, with segment margins expanding nearly 100 basis points in the quarter for each. The firm did an excellent job converting earnings to free cash flow as well, pulling in nearly $900 million during the period.Honeywell also provided a rosy outlook, despite cautioning that there are some concerns about slowing growth. CEO Dave Cote, on the firm's third-quarter conference call:Honeywell expects positive organic growth through the remainder of 2011 and for 2012 (and earnings growth 2 to 3 times that of top-line expansion). As for full-year 2011 guidance, the firm expects revenue to hit $36.7 billion at the high end of the range and pro-forma earnings per share to reach $4.05 (up from $4), representing about 35% growth on the bottom line. Free cash flow guidance for the year was also robust, at $3.5 billion.Valuation Analysis  Our discounted cash flow model indicates that Honeywell 's shares are worth between $46 and $76 each. The margin of safety around our fair value estimate is driven by the firm's MEDIUM ValueRisk rating, which is derived from the historical volatilityof key valuation drivers. The estimated fair value of $61 per share represents a price-toearnings (P/E) ratio of about 23.3 times last year's earnings and an implied EV/EBITDA multiple of about 12.2 times last year's EBITDA. Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 5.7% during the next five years, a pace that is higher than the firm's 3-year historical compound annual growth rate of -1.2%. Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 13%, which is above Honeywell 's trailing 3-year average. Beyond year 5, our valuation model assumes free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 2.2% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For Honeywell , our model uses a 9.9% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows.(Click to enlarge)(Click to enlarge)(Click to enlarge)Margin of Safety Analysis  Our discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $61 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future was known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values. Our ValueRisk rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock. In the graph below, we show this probable range of fair values for Honeywell . We think the firm is attractive below $46 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $76 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion.(Click to enlarge)(Click to enlarge) Future Path of Fair ValueWe estimate Honeywell 's fair value at this point in time to be about $61 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart below compares the firm's current share price with the path of Honeywell 's expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate. The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year 3 represents our best estimate of the value of the firm's shares three years hence. This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the firm's future cash flow potential change. The expected fair value of $78 per share in Year 3 represents our existing fair value per share of $61 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.

295313,24710,2011-09-22T11:49:46-04:00,,"Honeywell (NYSE:HON), a Fortune 100 company, is the world's largest manufacturer of aviation electronics, climate control equipment, and small jet engines. The company employs 122,000 people throughout the world. Honeywell has four business units. Its aerospace products can be found on ""virtually every commercial and business aircraft operating today."" The company's Aerospace segment serves both commercial clients and the military and supplies planes with everything from cockpit controls to wheels and brakes. Honeywell's Automation and Controls segment makes sensors, scanners, environmental controls and security products that ""are at work in 120 million homes, 10 million buildings, 5,000 industrial facilities, and hundreds of public and private utilities worldwide."" The Transportation Systems segment makes a wide variety of products including brake pads, antifreeze, spark plugs, turbochargers, and car wax (popular brands include Prestone, Fram, and Autolite). Lastly, the Specialty Materials segment makes chemicals and fibers that are used in a variety of ways across a variety of industries.Recently, the company decided to sell-off its car-care products business for around $950 million pending approval  -- a move S&P says will allow the company to ""focus on higher-margin businesses"".At a recent price of $44.87 (just $3.25 above its 52-week low), Honeywell trades for just 10 times analysts' consensus estimate of $4.44 per share in 2012. United Technologies Corp., a competitor, trades for 12.2 times its estimated 2012 EPS. Two insiders purchased stock in the company last month on the 5th and on the 26th -- the latter transaction was for around $230,000 dollars worth of shares. Sixty-three percent of analysts who cover the company rate it a buy/hold or better. The stock yields around 2.84% -- slightly more than United Technologies.Going forward, the company's results should benefit from an increase in global air traffic and the necessity of replacing aging fleets. S&P has a 12-month target price of $70 on the shares citing ""the company's prospects for strong earnings growth."" Any slowdown in spending in the U.S. likely won't have too much of a deleterious effect on Honeywell's earnings given that more than half the company's sales come from outside the country. Additionally, 87% of sales come from customers other than the U.S. government so a decrease in government spending shouldn't impact the company too badly either. It is also worth mentioning that in a note to investors dated September 13, Jim Cramer opined that although Honeywell is one of a handful of large industrials with 25% or so exposure to Europe, the stock is ""pretty whipped, certainly enough to factor in a big decline in earnings per share because of Europe."" Honeywell is a world-class company that will bring in roughly $37 billion in revenues this year. With the stock trading in the low 40's now seems like an opportune time to start averaging in and building a position.

292120,24491,2011-09-07T10:43:19-04:00,,"We've been eyeing Honeywell (NYSE:HON) ever since it reported second-quarter results a number of weeks ago. The firm has hit our trigger buy price in the low-to-mid $40s per share range, and we're anticipating upside to $60 per share by early 2012. We have included a link to our 16-page equity research report on Honeywell here and have pasted a snapshot of the first page of the report below.(Click to enlarge) Source: Valuentum Securities, Inc.In Honeywell's second quarter, the firm’s top-line expanded 15% (7% organic growth), while earnings per share jumped over 40% from the same quarter a year ago thanks to a 70 basis-point expansion of segment margins to 14.3%. The key driver fueling the growth was solid performance in the firm’s aerospace commercial aftermarket (up 21% in the period) reflecting strong spare sales and higher aircraft utilization rates. Total aerospace sales advanced 6% from the same period a year ago, while segment profit only advanced 2% thanks to margin pressure in the division (excluding the impact of certain payments, however, margins would have been up 110 basis points in the segment). Management expects its commercial aerospace segment to continue to be strong, and we agree. Build rates at Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Airbus (EADSY.PY) are expected to advance considerably thanks to rate increases across their narrow body platforms and initial deliveries of new builds (787 Dreamliner). We expect Honeywell's aerospace segment to capture a nice portion of this strength going forward.The top line for its ACS segment increased 20% from last year’s quarter, thanks primarily to acquisitions and the ongoing general industrial recovery (organic growth in the segment was 6%). Management indicated the strong performance for this segment was driven by an uptick in retrofit activity thanks to new product introductions and energy efficiency initiatives across its customer base. Segment profit for its ACS division increased 24%, as segment margins increased 40 basis points due to higher throughput. Looking ahead, the firm indicated that building solutions will see some acceleration in the back half of the year, as it converts some of its large wins in 2010 (currently in backlog) into revenue. However, our enthusiasm for this division is somewhat tempered by the current domestic economic malaise, specifically softness in the commercial construction end markets.Its Transportation Systems segment had a particularly strong showing. Sales in this segment jumped 26% compared with the second quarter of 2010, while segment profit surged 45% thanks to margin expansion of over 150 basis points in the division. Management suggested that turbocharger unit sales were up in the “high-teens” during the quarter, and we think the strong pace will ensue in coming periods, as Honeywell continues to achieve a relatively high win rate on new gas and new turbo-diesel programs globally. However, the firm did mention that the rate of growth will moderate a bit as production schedules and diesel penetration rates level off, particularly in the current third quarter.The firm’s Specialty Materials segment increased 12% from the same period a year ago, and segment profit increased 31% thanks to material margin expansion of 200 basis points. Management indicated that it continues to see a recovery in global refining and continued strength in its petrochemical end markets. Further it suggested that UOP’s book-to-bill remains over one, with growth expected to accelerate in the second-half of the year. However, the firm cautioned that its current strong margins in this segment may face some headwinds due to commodity-inflation factors. We'll be watching profitability in this segment closely in coming periods.Honeywell bumped up its full-year revenue guidance to the range of $36.1-$36.7 billion (up $100 million from its previous range) and its 2011 earnings-per-share estimate to the range of $3.85-$4.00 per share from $3.80-$3.95 per share previously. Management expects organic revenue growth to be slightly lower in the second half than in the first (5%-8% versus 9%), but we view this more as conservatism than any tragic shift in Honeywell's top-line potential. In fact, we think strong growth at UOP and aerospace will likely enable it to beat its organic top-line forecasts for the year, though key risks regarding the global economy and weakness in the euro remain. As for earnings, Honeywell warned that margins may face some pressure in the back half due to the dilutive impact of acquisitions and some pressure in Specialty Materials. However, we would not be surprised to see another beat-and-raise performance in its third quarter.The company also reiterated its 2011 free cash flow guidance of $3.5-$3.7 billion, excluding contributions to its pension plan. We expect net income conversion to free cash flow to continue to be strong, as it was during its most recently reported second quarter. In terms of cash use, the firm continues to plow funds into its pension plan (now 90% funded) and buy back shares. Though we find Honeywell's management to be shareholder-friendly, we'd prefer the firm look more opportunistically to buy back shares at lower levels than today's. In all, we're bullish on Honeywell's outlook, and we'd be looking to add it to our Best Ideas portfolio in coming weeks.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

Honeywell had outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate over the  trailing four quarters with an average positive surprise of 77.03%.Second Quarter HighlightsHoneywell International Inc. reported second-quarter 2011 earnings per  share from continuing operations of $1.00, above the Zacks Consensus  Estimate of 98 cents and prior-year earnings of 71 cents.Total revenue was $9.1 billion, below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  $9.2 billion for the quarter and above $7.9 billion in the prior-year  quarter. Revenue excludes $234 million from its discontinued Consumer  Products Group (NYSE:CPG) operations in 2011 and $235 million in 2010.  Organically, total revenue was up 8% year over year, driven by growth of  new products, emerging-region growth and strong end-markets. Honeywell  witnesses continued momentum across its portfolio.Agreement of Estimate Revisions   In the last 30 days, out of the analysts providing estimates for the  stock, two decreased their estimates for the third quarter and for 2011  while three decreased their estimate for 2012. One analyst has increased  its estimate for 2012.For the third quarter, none of the analysts changed their estimate in  the last 7 days while one decreased for 2011 and one has increased for  2012.Magnitude of Estimate Revisions   In last 30 days, the earnings estimate for 2011 increased from $3.95 to  $3.97 and for 2012 decreased from $4.44 to $4.39. The estimate for the  third quarter increased from 98 cents to 99 cents per share in the last  30 days.In the last 7 days, the earnings estimate for 2011 declined from $3.98  to $3.97 and for 2012 was unchanged. The estimate for the first quarter  has been stable at 99 cents per share in the last 7 days.Our Take   Honeywell’s short-cycle businesses as well as its commercial aerospace  spares and residential and commercial retrofit businesses are performing  impressively well and are expected to support the company's future  growth outlook. In second-quarter 2011, aerospace's commercial  aftermarket continued to see a robust recovery, with spares up 30-plus  percent and R&O significantly outpacing flight hours. Longer-cycle  businesses including Process Solutions and UOP also witnessed  double-digit growth in the quarter.Improving end markets, growth from new products, high-growth regions  and good return from acquisitions are facilitating Honeywell to deliver  solid performance. However, material price inflation negatively affects  segments operating profit and is a matter of concern. High R&D cost  together with the BGA OE payments declined Aerospace profit in the  second quarter. Major competitors of Honeywell are BorgWarner Inc. (NYSE:BWA), United Technologies Corp. (NYSE:UTX) and Johnson Controls Inc. (NYSE:JCI).Overall, we believe Honeywell is all set to deliver good financial  results in the third quarter of 2011. We currently maintain our Neutral  recommendation on the stock, with a Zacks #3 Rank (Hold recommendation)  over the next one to three months."

For 2011, the firm, based on information released yesterday, expects to accrue a $200MM expense on its P&L, despite an actual cash contribution into its pension plans of $1 billion. Its shift to mark-to-market helps during periods of rising asset values.Obviously, this will pump up earnings despite its obvious negative impact on free cash flows, with Honeywell needing to borrow when all aspects of the business are considered. Honeywell is a strong credit with low cost of capital and open access to the commercial paper markets. images Source: Honeywell, ‘Investor Update – Pension’, November 16, 2010During the period 2005-2008, Honeywell contributed, on average, $269MM into its pension and retirement plans, far short of what was really needed; thus, starting in 2009, the company began to make contributions in excess of $1 billion, which will continue through at least next year. If interest rates remain low or market values decline, Honeywell’s ultimate obligation will be much larger than currently recognized. If interest rates rise, Honeywell will most likely further match its liabilities or completely close out it plans with annuities.Taking advantage of accounting rules, $2 billion is now in a funding “corridor” from which, if a shortfall to Honeywell’s actuarial assumptions occur, will not need to be reflected in earnings as reported to shareholders, but in a section of the balance sheet, titled “Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income.” As CT Capital’s invested approach focuses on cash flows, the reality is, shortfalls will eventually need to be made up.Other firms, because of their higher cost of capital, will not be as lucky as Honeywell, and CT Capital currently penalize such firms for their real cash flows, adjusted for the actual contributions that need to be made.Related articles:Disclosure: No positions"

Sub-metering  essentially allows landlords to put tenants onto individual electrical  meters and thereby encourage conservation. It is often cited as one of  the more effective techniques for getting companies and individuals in  shared buildings to think about power. (It came up during a panel  discussion yesterday, in fact.)E-Mon, an appellation that sounds like someone trying out a fake  Jamaican accent, is no startup. It was founded in 1981 and works with  1,500 distributors. Along with meters, the company develops software and  management tools.Back in May, Honeywell  bought Akuacom,  which provides demand response services to independent service  providers and building owners. Honeywell and Johnson Controls (NYSE:JCI) are the  dominant names in building  management. Chances are you're in a building  right now controlled by  their systems. With its two grid companies,  Honeywell can, ideally, begin to better connect its traditional products  and services to demand response services, grid management programs,  etc. In other words, the bridge between the grid and what goes on inside  your office is being solidified.The deal also marks another step along the way in one of the big trends of 2009 and 2010: the rise of the green giants.  Conglomerates have money, sales contacts, and worldwide heft. Smaller  companies often have good technology. Acquisitions bring out the best in  both. General Electric (NYSE:GE) last year bought Naverus, a software developer  that can curb airline fuel consumption. Since then, GE has landed deals to get the software deployed in U.S. and Europe. Expect to hear a lot from Honeywell over the next few years. (We picked them as one of our Top Ten Green Giants  recently.) The company works extensively on a variety of industrial and   power projects. It is also minting executives. Jack Bolick, the CEO of   Adura, came out of Honeywell. So did Robert Gillette, the CEO of First Solar. These guys have packed speed dials.Disclosure: No positions"
225916,24018,2010-09-19T08:08:13-04:00,,"Historically, as the economy emerges slowly from recession, the industrials will have their day in the sun. Honeywell International (NYSE:HON) may be a good play in the sector. The company is a diversified, international technology and manufacturing conglomerate. HON has businesses spanning several industries including aerospace, automation / control solutions, specialty materials and transportation systems.  Honeywell has their business spread out over early and late cycle industries. Indeed, during their second quarter earnings conference call, management noted that transportation systems / turbochargers, resins and chemical products were up very strongly. Aerospace, automation and control products / solutions are seeing green shoots of a growth recovery.  While HON is an American company headquartered in New Jersey, it generates about nearly half of its revenue overseas. They are experiencing solid growth in emerging markets, particularly in Asia.  The stock price has bounced around a bit over the past year, but has beaten the S&P500 handily over the prior one year, six month and three month periods.  I offer some fundamental analysis and conclusions for your consideration:The long-term Debt to Equity ratio of 83 percent is a bit high. However, Return on Equity and Return on Assets of 24 and 6 percent, respectively, is comparable to industry. The Debt to Capital ratio of 43 percent is likewise well in line with industry peers.   The current ratio is 1.3. That's good for an industrial company. I like to see between 1.2 and 1.5. Long term debt has remained about flat for the past three years. Management is handling debt fine. Honeywell holds nearly five dollars per share in cash. Very good.HON increased revenues each year between 2005 and 2008. In 2009, they took a hit, like just about everyone else in the business. 2010 is the low-ebb EPS year. Nonetheless, over the past four quarters, revenues have increased on a sequential basis. The five-year revenue growth rate has been a postive four percent. This is excellent given the depth and severity of the recession.  Gross margins are 29 percent. This is well in-line compared with the industry.  Earnings tell a similarly good story. The five-year EPS growth rate has been 14 percent. Remember, we are still early into the industrial sector pickup as a function of the business cycle. That bodes well for the future. Honeywell management presents an optimistic (yet realistic) picture going forward. Based upon management guidance, I envision 2010 earnings of $2.45. Next year the consensus earnings are forecast at $3.04. I concur. Under the premise that weaker than expected U. S. growth may cut into the figure, I believe it will be offset by higher than projected international growth. Key fact: HON management has not had a quarterly earnings ""miss"" in several years. They stay on the mark.What attracts me to this stock is the cash flow. Free Cash Flow (operating cash minus capex) has been $3.00 a share over the first six months of this year. That eclipses HON's project net income for the entire year. Their dividend is tops in the industry and has been increased by 10 percent a year for the past five years. The yield is now 2.75 percent, pushing the ten-year T-note yield. The 2010 dividend will be about $1.21 a share. No problem covering it. Fat city.  Let's perform a quick sector check. Honeywell and its industry (aerospace and defense) have lagged the S&P500 over the past year. However, the industry has overtaken the S&P500 over the past three months. This makes sense as HON's early-cycle businesses have picked up steam. In addition, HON share price is ahead of its industry peers over the recent three-month and six-month periods. This may be partially attributed to Honeywell's industrial conglomerate status. It's not a pure aerospace and defense play. It's really a diversified industrial conglomerate. Looking good.  Lastly, HON bought out Sperian Corporation earlier this year. It's an excellent acquisition. Sperian will complement Honeywell's PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) business, offers additional exposure to emerging markets, and should be accretive to 2011 earnings.   What's the downside?  Perhaps timing. The stock trades at $43.82 as of my writing this article. This is about 16 times TTM earnings. The five year average PE is 16. Reviewing historical PEs, I believe that we could see the PE expand to no higher than 19X this year; that would peg the top price at $47 a share. In 2011, the multiple could shrink a little as the cyclical business pick up (counter-intuitive, but factual when evaluating a cyclical player like Honeywell). Using a conservative PE of 17.5, I put a twelve-month $54 target on the stock. Given the right circumstances, say a ten percent earnings beat and / or a little higher multiple, Honeywell could fetch $58.  Not bad, a 22 percent uplift from here into 2011 plus a healthy dividend. Looking at the downside risk, I don't see the multiple getting crushed lower than 13X earnings. There's no precedent for that over the past ten years sans the Great Recession crash. I don't believe we are heading for another stock market crash. I see a solid 2011 forecast of three bucks per share.  There's also an issue of inadequate pension funding. The Company is working on this. They are buying HON stock to help fund some of the overseas pension liability and have made changes to future benefits for newer employees to stem the tide. They are taking their medicine now. Once the dust settles, Honeywell will be in a better position that some others, who are dodging bullets.   Bottom line:  If one could pick up more HON at $40 or less, I'd say is was a steal and jump on it. If you like the one or two year prospects, I'd pick at it anywhere near $42 a share. It's a solid portfolio entry that will benefit from the global recovery, grow cyclical earnings for at least another few years, and spin off a good dividend to boot. I'd expect the dividend to continue to increase given the bountiful cash flows. The management has demonstrated itself as sound and reliable.  Honeywell International has a good balance sheet, industry businesses that are awaiting their turn in the global business cycle, proven long-term earnings growth, and lots of cash.   Some of the upside has been baked in, but there's still enough room to run.    Disclosure: Author is long HON"

These would be in two areas: 1) reality based interpretation of pension obligations and 2) a history of questionable share repurchases. What I see is a company with a number of fine if cyclical businesses, but a management approach to the two concerns mentioned that is questionable with the wisdom of hindsight.In the process of a portfolio review, I checked Morningstar's analysis, which included some concerns on pension obligations, and decided to go over the situation on my own. This article presents the results.Overview- from the 10-K:Pensions – Pension accounting is dependent on two key assumptions – the rate of return on pension assets, and the discount rate applied to future liabilities. The rate of return assumption will vary based on whether investments are tilted toward equities or bonds. Finally, annual gains or losses on pension liabilities do not go directly to P&L: They are averaged out over time by means of the Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) item in the Shareholder's Equity section of the balance sheet. Here are snips of the relevant information from the most recent 10-K:Honeywell's approach is aggressive: satisfactory resolution of their pension liabilities requires a continued resurgence of equity markets. Note that the (29%) loss for 2008 is not compensated by the 20% gain for 2009. The gyrations of these values are not reflected in GAAP EPS, and the shareholder is not really getting the smooth ride the earnings portray. 60 to 70% of pension assets are invested in equities.Valuation – Regular readers know I use a P/5 year average EPS method of valuation in situations where it is feasible, adjusting for share counts if the entity involved has a history of buybacks. Noting that my five year history of profits does not include the pension obligation increases that have been parked in AOCI(NYSE:L), I intend to bring them in. Here is the math:Leaving pensions out of the computation, the shares would be worth $59 by this method. My impression is that the pension obligation will develop favorably this year and I would feather the approximate $42 value upward somewhat on that basis.Buybacks – there is considerable debate as to the extent to which buybacks create or destroy shareholder value. It is best to look at them over a significant period of time, comparing the prices paid to market values and also to an objective standard of value. Then the cash deployed for this purpose should be compared to other potential uses, including the reduction of outstanding debt.Honeywell includes treasury shares (buybacks) at cost on the balance sheet: totaling 9.0 billion for 193.4 million shares, or 46.50 per share, as of Y/E 2009. This does not compare favorably to today's price or the valuation previously developed that considers the effect of accumulated pension obligations on earnings.Long term debt checks in at $6.2 billion, somewhat less than the total expended on buybacks. The picture is not pretty: Management has deployed cash that could have reduced long term debt in order to buy shares at prices in excess of a prudent valuation. There is a linkage between buybacks and pension, in that the company contributes its own shares to the pension plan from time to time.Honeywell did not repurchase any of its common stock during 2009 and does not anticipate that it will do so during 2010.Strategy – I have been playing this situation with a combination of diagonal and vertical call spreads, with the upper (short) legs at 44 and 45 in June. The exit price looks about right and there is no reason to chase the stock higher.Investment Implications - Investors who are long the shares may want to review the pension information and form their own conclusions. Those who do not share management's view that 9% returns are possible going forward will adjust accordingly.In spite of being an Industrial, Honeywell is leveraged to the equity markets, in much the same way as variable annuity providers such as Metropolitan (NYSE:MET) and Prudential (NYSE:HIG), both of which are doing well as confidence is being restored. After all, a pension is an annuity, and Honeywell's obligations are funded by equity investments, just like Met or Pru's.Implied volatility is low at 21.3%. The dividend is 1.21, yielding 2.69% at last week's closing price. Short interest is trivial at .89%. Beta at 1.3 suggests the stock will move in the same direction but more rapidly than the market as a whole. HON is an excellent fair weather stock but is unlikely to stand up well to renewed economic and market difficulties.Disclosure: Long HON, MET and PRU, no position BA"

The diversified technology and manufacturing company reported earnings last week that were not overly impressive as management ratcheted down guidance, but this does not scare away Cramer.Last week we wrote about how Honeywell actually reported what was, in our eyes, a better quarter than 3M (NYSE:MMM) but the tone of the conference calls of the two firms would have made you think that they opposite were true (Underestimating the Economy Hurts Honeywell). 3M’s CEO focused on the positives, most importantly that he sees the broad economic recovering in the next three to six months.

This seems to be the wonderful example of a company that has been brutally beaten down in the market, far worse than seems warranted by the slight declines in fundamentals.

For example, RMG’s gas flow meters and regulating devices complement Honeywell’s pressure and temperature transmitters, as well as liquid natural gas level gauges. Also, the acquisition of RMG supports Honeywell’s strategy to offer solutions that enhance energy efficiency; nearly 50% of Honeywell’s current technology delivers energy savings and efficiency. Natural gas is a clean fuel alternative that is becoming increasingly popular in both mature and emerging markets around the world.   Honeywell is a diversified technology and manufacturing company, serving customers worldwide with aerospace products and services, control, sensing and security technologies for buildings, homes and industry, turbochargers, automotive products, specialty chemicals, electronic and advanced materials, process technology  for refining and petrochemicals and energy efficient products and solutions for homes, business and transportation. Its nearest competitors are Johnson Controls Inc. (JCI - Analyst Report), Goodrich Corp. (GR - Snapshot Report) and United Technologies (UTX - Analyst Report).

122612,21435,2009-02-25T11:56:17-05:00,,"Tuesday night on Mad Money, Jim Cramer went in-depth on Honeywell (NYSE:HON) stock. For someone who specializes in his quick reactions to a barrage of stocks in the “lightening round”, you know that when he spends 15 minutes on one company, he really has something to say. Cramer loves the way that CEO David Cote is running the business of the diversified technology and manufacturing company saying,Ockham’s Take: We have to agree with Mr. Cramer on this one. Honeywell is a fabulous company that is down more than 50% in the last year. As Cramer described, the company has more than 400 new products being unveiled this year alone, many of them with innovations towards energy efficiency. This should help the company continue its strong historical sales growth of about 8% over each of the last 5 years. However, even more impressive is the company’s near doubling of cash flow over that same 5 year period. This is a strong endorsement to the management that Cramer praised. But as of right now, the market is not giving Honeywell enough credit for their cash, as the company has historically traded between 6.2x and 10.7x multiples of price-to-cash flow, but at present levels that metric is only 5.2x. So, Honeywell looks better equipped than most to ride out the storm and the 4.2% yield is not a bad return until the market begins to come around. As you can see, it is no surprise that we currently have an Undervalued valuation on Honeywell.Original post"

100509,21435,2008-10-17T14:50:43-04:00,,"Honeywell (NYSE:HON) reported third quarter profit gains of 16% on revenue of $9.3 billion which was also an increase of 6%. Shares are trading down more than 7% because the company narrowed guidance and lowered their full year revenue forecast. For those that follow HON, this should not be a surprise as the stock has been crushed already by these recession fears. Honeywell — down 51% year to date — has performed far worse than most of its diversified industrial peers which have fallen 24% on average. Furthermore, this recession has been on the mind of the HON management team, as CEO Dave Cote stated:In anticipation of operating difficulties, the company has been cutting costs by lowering discretionary spending and by implementing a hiring freeze. The company has sold off non-performing business segments such as the sale of the aircraft parts division to BE Aerospace Inc. (BEAV). What’s more, the company has a supremely diversified product set and has continued to emphasize growth in their aerospace and defense business lines. Profit slipped a bit (8%) in this division as Honeywell spent money developing and improving products which they anticipate will hedge them against a probable slowdown in their home building area. Despite the global slowdown, emerging market demand for airplanes continues to be strong. In 2008 Honeywell Aerospace forecast a record number of deliveries of business jets, nearly 1,200, up 20% with further growth projected next year.As we all saw this morning, home starts continue to slip and are currently at their second lowest rate in 50 years. So, it was a bit of a surprise that the building controls unit (maker of thermostats, fire safety equipment, and the like) was the star of the earnings report with revenue growth of 15%. The automation and control unit was the largest in 2007 accounting for 36% of revenue, slightly edging out aerospace products and services with 35% of revenue.So, there are certainly going to be some challenges ahead for Honeywell. However, the current market tendency has been to over react to just about every piece of news or guidance.Let’s get some perspective here. Was there anything in the results that was unexpected? Honeywell issued conservative guidance which is prudent going into what could be a very difficult operating environment. The revised full year earnings guidance is $3.76 to $3.80, which if you will recall is simply a narrowing of previous estimates of $3.75 to $3.85. Also, keep in mind that they did beat estimates in this quarter as analysts polled by Thompson Reuters anticipated 95 cents per share, but actual results were 97 cents. The falling price of oil surely assisted the company in managing costs.The merits of valuation analysis in this investing environment dominated by fear and uncertainty are debatable in the short term. However, such valuations are (at the very least) more informative and useful than reacting to news and price swings without a point of reference.By standard valuation metrics Honeywell is clearly out of favor with the market. As sales have increased consistently, HON stock has gotten less credit for those sales as demonstrated by our price-to-sales analysis. Over the last 10 years, HON has normally traded in a price-to-sales range of .83x and 1.32x, but the current level is only .58. Also of note is that price-to-cash flow for Honeywell has oscillated in the range of 11.7x to 19.97x and right now that valuation metric is 5.6x. If the stock were to appreciate to just the price that would bring these historical metrics into line give current sales and cash, a share of HON would trade around $58.So, ask yourself, “Were the 3rd quarter results bad enough to require an already depressed stock to continue to slide?” Did the market learn something that it did not already know? Ockham would have to say, “clearly not.”The fear of recession was a large reason for the stock’s recent performance. We think that for those investors with a long term focus, a cheap and diversified stock with sales continuing to grow and a dividend yield approaching 4.0% may be appealing in this difficult environment."

The contract is valued at more than $16 billion over the next 20-25 years. The deal also is unique because it will have Honeywell take more of a responsibility for integrating major parts into the aircraft. ""From an industry point of view, it's more of a partnership than a buyer-supplier relationship,"" said Robert Gillette, president and chief executive of Honeywell Aerospace. Honeywell is interested in building radar systems for the A350 as well, said Gillette, but details on that deal will be provided later. Honeywell shares were up 1.7% to $58.26 Wednesday.

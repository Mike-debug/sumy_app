4382138,56142,2020-10-28T13:50:30-04:00,"H&R Block could be a big winner in coming months, if Democrats take control of Washington politics and increase tax rates and regulations during 2021.Trading at 8x normalized earnings and 1.1x trailing sales, Block may be the smartest ""value"" stock available right now.A high 6% dividend yield is uniquely sustainable, and the payout has plenty of room to grow in the future.","I wrote an article on H&R Block (HRB) in late 2019 here, explaining how a Democrat election victory this year would likely be a boon to tax accounting firms. The idea was Trump’s tax cuts and simplification of the tax code would be reversed by new leaders focused on cutting the deficit. Of course, this story was penned long before COVID-19 appeared. In the end, I have been long and short H&R Block four or five times since October 2019, for a variety of portfolio design reasons.Right on schedule, the stock price bottomed during the summer. It seems to be rising into a Democratic sweep of the Washington levers of power, if you believe the vast majority of voter polls. Presidential candidate Joe Biden is promising to rescind the tax breaks and rate cuts for the individuals/families earning over $400,000 a year. By the time progressives and special interests are done, the tax code generally could be even more complicated into the middle of 2021, than it was when Donald Trump grabbed the reins of power.Since Block is the largest tax preparation firm for individuals in the U.S. with 23 million returns filed in 2019, I suspect it could be one of the big turnaround winners of 2021 from an election victory for Democrats. Whether you use a full-service tax preparer at a physical location or buy a computer program to do-it-yourself, this company provides a vast network of locations and a suite of online/electronic software for the average American to access professional help cheaply.Image Source: Company WebsiteAnalysts and investors in the company have been trained to fear the TurboTax software competition from Intuit (INTU) over the years. However, a revamped and more difficult to figure tax code will likely translate into an uptrend in the number of Americans seeking in-person, assisted preparation help starting in late 2021. For this reason in particular, flipping the slow market share loss trend (away from online and software prep competition) could reverse years of revenue stagnation at H&R Block.Government-mandated COVID-19 pandemic store closures, coronavirus-related spread fears when facing in-person tax preparers between March-July, and the federal income tax deadline extension to July 15th made a mess of H&R Block’s operations the last nine months. The stock valuation, which looked like a bargain at $24 a share 12 months ago, suffered from problematic earnings and cash flow generation through the summer. Its stock quote reached a panic selling low of $11 in March, and only recovered tepidly into September.Another headwind during August-September was Standard & Poor’s decision to drop Block from the S&P 500 index. In effect, millions of shares were sold by ETFs and mutual funds required to mechanically follow weightings in the index.Coincidentally or not, H&R Block’s stock has risen smartly from the September 21st S&P 500 index change. Amazingly it closed higher 14 of 15 trading days into early October. The stock quote became such a bargain, two insiders including CEO Jeffrey Jones purchased shares in early September.Today, a strong accumulation trend is clearly apparent on Block’s 6-month chart, pictured below. I am forecasting a Biden/Democrat sweep of the Presidency and control of both chambers of Congress, combined with the technical setup of the 200-day moving average around $16.50 will provide support for the quote, even if a double-dip recession appears in the U.S. economy.I have the S&P 500 index participation change date marked with a purple arrow. A relatively robust Negative Volume Index [NVI] line over the short term, marked with a red arrow, is also drawn. NVI measures trading activity only on falling volume days vs. the previous session. Basically, Block’s rising price on low volume the last month is signaling little overhead supply exists each day, a bullish sign traditionally for owners. Lastly, the basic On Balance Volume [OBV] creation has witnessed a bump higher since August, a function of positive closes on a regular basis. OBV reached a new 7-month high a week ago, marked with the blue arrow.You have to go back to early 2019 to find a similar instance of rising accumulation trends in H&R Block. The combination of a stock price zig-zagging higher faster than the S&P 500 index, alongside advances in the NVI and OBV, has been a rare find in this equity for several years.Block’s operating business has been quite profitable during normal economic times. Assuming the coronavirus pandemic ends next year, and tax deadlines remain on schedule, a nice rebound in profitability is already forecasted by Wall Street analysts. On the plus side, revenues and income should be quite strong in fiscal 2021 (the current tax preparation year ending late April) with much of last year’s expected tax preparation filings pushed into the Q1 July period.Below is the current consensus estimate picture for both fiscal 2021 and 2022 available on Seeking Alpha.Cash flow to sales, returns on assets employed and net after-tax profit margins are super high for H&R Block, each in the 10-18% range during normal operating circumstances. I have all three pictured below on a decade-long graph.The good news for investors in Block today – its quality brand name business model, with strong returns/margins, and the opportunity for an upswing in preparation demand from changes in the tax code are all available at the cheapest ownership valuation in a decade. On trailing sales and operating earnings, H&R Block has turned into a unique bargain during 2020. Against a record price to sales ratio of 2.5x for the main U.S. large cap index, the company’s ultra-low 1.15x is borderline too good to be true. Compared to S&P 500 price to earnings ratios of 25-30x for 2020-21, Block’s 6-8x multiple may be the best “value” proposition available in the market today. Essentially, investor expectations are in the gutter after years of underperformance and stagnation. For contrarian buyers, Block has reached a status where it gets no respect in late 2020. But is this bearish sentiment about to morph into a bright future with a Biden victory?The best argument for long-term investors to buy Block may be its high and sustainable dividend yield. Income-hungry owners will love the current 5.7% yield, more than 3x the equivalent S&P 500 annual cash distribution. Notice on the chart below, the dividend payout previously represented a rate on par with the large cap index five years ago. However, new purchasers today are getting cash yields 4% ABOVE the typical U.S. equity. Plus, the $1.04 annual payout is easily covered by $2-3 in per share operating earnings and cash flow projections above $3 a share yearly during 2021-22.H&R Block is slated to become one of the top investment beneficiaries of a big Democratic election win next week. Operations are already swinging higher, recovering from the difficult economic shutdowns caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The stock valuation is incredibly cheap, and the dividend yield is extremely attractive. Block’s stock price turnaround since August seems to have a solid long-term foundation, while a more complicated tax code may be the “catalyst” for a multi-year uptrend.Using historical valuations on past 10-year fundamental data point averages and a relative price discount closer to S&P 500 multiples, H&R Block should be trading in the $25-30 share range presently. If a flood of new tax laws and regulations take effect in 2021-22, pumping the company’s profitability and margins, a target price of $35-40 in 18-24 months is not an exaggeration.Another possible outcome for the inexpensive valuation is Block becomes a takeover or private equity target. If you can borrow money at less than 5% for interest expense, why not purchase a brand name company, in business for 60 years [Nothing in life is sure, but death and taxes.], and capture the income spread measured from an earnings yield in the 10-12% range? A single owner could put a steady and reliable $300+ million in his/her pocket each year for taking the LBO risk (assuming a $25 HRB takeout price, and factoring in related goodwill amortization).On the downside, if Biden is not elected and/or Republicans keep their Senate majority, substantial tax code changes may not materialize. An additional risk is a larger wave of coronavirus spread during the winter could keep walk-in business on the slow side into the April tax filing deadline. Even if these two circumstances come to pass, H&R Block’s value and dividend story would not change materially. My guess is the negatives would only be able to hold the stock price in check under $20 for 6-9 months, before the enterprise’s high level of earnings and cash flow lead to accretive growth by 2022.I personally sold my latest position around $17.50 a few week ago. I believed the stock was getting somewhat overbought. I have also been anticipating a large stock market sell-off wave into the election. As of this writing, my battle plan for H&R Block is to acquire a new position before Tuesday’s U.S. vote, hopefully at slightly lower prices closer to $17 a share.Thanks for reading.

4376432,20599,2020-09-25T17:32:23-04:00,"H&R Block operates in a market that has very little scope for growth. The number of DIY tax filers is increasing gradually, further lowering the revenue pie.The economic outlook remains uncertain and the unemployment rate is high. The market is also swarming with competitors.Though the company’s dividend yield of 6.94% is attractive, the issues related to its market size and growth suggest that it is best avoided.","H&R Block (HRB) reported solid Q1 2021 (ended July 2020) year-over-year numbers because about 7.5 million people filed tax returns to become eligible for receiving stimulus payments. The company estimates a normal tax season in 2021. It is also cutting costs and expects to do reasonably well in the medium term. HRB has frozen hiring, is planning to renegotiate rents, and cut back on capital expenditure. Plans are on to slash vendor spend too.Though this cost-cutting and a normal 2021 tax season will combine to boost HRB's net income in 2021, growth is just not visible on the horizon. Even a healthy dividend yield of 6.94% is not attractive enough to justify an investment in the stock. Here's my self-assessment:As of May 2020, about 119.5 million Americans did not hire tax preparation firms; instead, they self-prepared (using online paid and free resources) and e-filed their tax returns for the tax year 2019. The total tax filers in 2020 are estimated at 134 million.Source: eFile.comI deep-dived and found some bad news for the industry. In 2018, about 71.43 million Americans hired tax preparation firms to e-file their returns. In 2019, the number had dropped to 70.97 million because many people had taken to self-preparation of their returns. They may have used DIY tools or free online services that assist with tax filing.Source: Accounting TodayTax filing in 2021 will be dictated by how much the virus torments the economy. In 2020, many people filed tax returns to get stimulus money. Tax filing was also delayed because the deadline was extended. No one is sure how 2021 will play out especially if the demand for goods and services falls or stagnates, and the unemployment rate rises. The folks who filed to get the stimulus money are not likely to file again in 2021.The market is dull and limited, its estimated growth is too sluggish, taxpayers have taken to self-filing, and there are just too many tax preparers competing for a shrinking slice of an old, stale pie.Source: HRB's Quarterly AccountsHRB experienced a brilliant Q4 2020 (ended April 2020) and Q1 2021 (ended July 2020) because people filed $1 tax returns to obtain stimulus funds. On an annual basis, HRB's revenues seem to be stuck in a narrow wedge since 2016. Its annual revenues have fluctuated between $3.04 billion and $3.16 billion, a narrow range, from 2016 up to TTM July 2020.As of July 2020, HRB's debt is a massive $3.5 billion. The company has recently issued $650 million worth of 10-year notes at 3.875%. The proceeds will be used to retire higher-cost existing debt maturing in October 2020. That will leave the company with a debt of $2.85 billion by the end of its Q2 2021. Its goodwill and intangible assets were $1.12 billion, and cash and equivalents were $2.6 billion as of Q1 2021.In the quarters ended January 2020 and April 2020, HRB obtained net debt of $1.86 billion, which was used to shore up liquidity, pay dividends, and repurchase stock.Source: Seeking AlphaA major part of the total balance sheet size of $5 billion is represented by cash and equivalents ($2.6 billion) and goodwill and intangibles ($1.12 billion) on the asset side, and $3.5 billion in long-term debt on the liabilities side. The total equity including additional paid-in capital is $775 million and the retained earnings are just $83 million. As the growth estimates are muted, the scope for balance sheet expansion is virtually non-existent.The company's forward annual dividend payout is estimated at $1.04, which works to a yield of 6.94% on its market price of $14.99 as of September 17, 2020. But dividend yield is the last thing you should be thinking about before investing in HRB.HRB is not a dividend stock despite its attractive dividend yield. Those who invested in the stock for long-term growth have been disappointed by its price momentum.With estimates of a forward revenue growth of 0.75%, forward EBITDA growth of -0.79%, and a forward return on equity growth of 0.67%, HRB looks like a stagnant, touch-me-not kind of stock, especially because there are many other stocks available that are likely to become leaders in the post-COVID-19 era. HRB is not one of those.Tax filers are going DIY and the sales pool for tax preparers is shrinking by the day. It costs much less to file a tax return using DIY software as compared to the costs charged by a tax preparer. Though HRB allows taxpayers to file returns using a variety of methods, the problem is that the market is limited and swamped by competitors. Plus, the unemployment rate is very high, the economy is down in the dumps, and the company has tanked up on debt. Its lackluster performance at the bourses also has got it shunted out of the S&P 500 (SP500).I would avoid investing in HRB because there are other exciting growth and value plays that are in momentum, that are available at investable prices.*Like this article?

Find out how you can get the best content on Seeking Alpha here.H&R Block (HRB) is down over 40% this year and there is absolutely no reason why it should be. Compared on a true apples to apples basis with the previous year, COVID had almost no impact on H&R Block's business. H&R Block's stable cash flows and 7.5% yield, coupled with the Fed's promise to keep interest rates near 0% through 2023, should have driven shares higher than last year.Data by YChartsThe primary reason I believe shares are still down stems from confusion around operating performance between this year and last. Since the deadline for filing taxes was extended by 3 months to July 15 and H&R Block's fiscal year ends April 30th, it made year over year comparisons difficult. Indeed, just looking at the year over year results in a vacuum paints an ugly pictureHowever, if we update the numbers to compare the trailing 12 months to the previous 12 months, or July-July instead of April-April, it shows a very different picture. Increased expenses were the primary driver of a 10% EBITDA decline, but Revenue and EPS were on par with the previous year and free cash flow was up. Overall H&R Block prepared 3.3% more returns, with assisted filings of 11.5M (down 2.8%) and DIY online filings (excluding Free File returns) of 6.7M, up 11%.This was great performance given the difficult circumstances.In two words: Silly LowUsing an average of the past 8 quarters, we have free cash flow of $450 million/year and EPS of $2.15/year. At a share price of $13.90 and a market cap of $2.7 billion, that gives us Price / Sales: 0.87xPrice/Earnings: 6.5xPrice/Free Cash Flow: 6xThese are numbers I would expect from a economically sensitive, capital intensive business with no moat/brand advantage. H&R Block has significant brand strength, is not capital intensive, and is nearly recession proof (and pandemic resistant, apparently.)From the last earnings call, CFO Tony Bowen said the followingOccupancy is a huge expense for H&R Block, totaling $410 million in the last year, equaling ~13% of revenues and almost equal to free cash flow. The retail rent outlook for 2021 is not good: one report shows retail rents in NYC dropping 12% to 2011 levels. JLL reports that retail vacancy might not return to pre-crisis levels until 2024. Many retail leasees did not pay their rent during the shutdown. H&R Block, with its stable and recession proof business should be able to leverage this and drive reductions in their occupancy expense. Most H&R Block offices are pretty basic. They should be able to be moved easily, giving them a lot of leverage over landlords. A 15% reduction would add another $60 million to the bottom line, and I wouldn't be surprised if they could do better than this.Additional positives:Many of the concerns I've seen cited for H&R Block are non-concerns for me.1. Limited/No GrowthAt the current valuation, it doesn't matter. As long as the business is stable (and I believe it is very stable) buying at 6x free cash flow is enough to provide a great return, especially in this interest rate environment. Share repurchases are extremely accretive at this level, and management routinely purchased shares at prices in the low-mid $20's over the past year. 2. Dividend Safety I'm not sure why there is concern about this. The dividend costs the company ~$200 million a year. They've averaged $450 million/year in free cash flow over the past 2 years and $437 million/year over the past 5 years. This is not a capital intensive business, nor are they highly leveraged.Worth noting that another benefit of meaningful share repurchases (especially at 6x cash flow) is that it decreases dividend expense.3. The shift to online/DIY tax filingsThe shift is slow, gradual, and likely has a floor. The COVID pandemic only decreased assisted filings by 2.8%. I see that as an enormous positive and I'll bet it swings back the other way next year.The concerns I do have are relatively manageable.1. Expense ControlConsidering revenue was down FY19 to FY20, it's hard for me to rationalize how non-payroll expenses were up 12% year over year, even considering that some of this is due to the inclusion of Wave. I would like to see this improved in 2021, and from the last conference call, I believe management is focused on it.2. AcquisitionsHRB has a history of wasting capital and creating distractions buying unrelated businesses. It purchased Option One Mortgage Corp in 1997 before ceasing mortgage loan origination in December 2007 and selling its servicing business in April 2008. There is still lingering litigation related to it.I worry that the $405 million cash acquisition of Wave financial is another example. A provider of ""accounting, invoicing, payroll, and payments software solutions, as well as bookkeeping services, built into a comprehensive platform used by over 400,000 small businesses every month"" has little to do with tax preparation.I don't understand why it's so hard for some companies to just run their core business and not purchase unrelated businesses in search of growth. It rarely works out. I would rather have seen the $410 million used to retire debt or repurchase shares at this level. This acquisition is why I passed on the shares previously. I'll be cautiously optimistic that this turns into a great business for them, and hope this is the last big acquisition I see.If all the above isn't enough reason to be bullish, here's another: Shares have been artificially depressed by forced selling for weeks, culminating with an insane day on Friday, September 18th, where shares traded more than 15 times average volume.Why? Because the shares have dropped so much this year, the S&P committee decided to move them out of the S&P500 index and into the MidCap 400 index. Because the amount of money in S&P500 index funds is so much greater than the Midcap 400 index, this leads to a large amount of forced selling in a relatively short amount of time. This should be over as of now.I believe the lingering concern that was holding back shares was resolved when H&R Block released their Q1 results on Tuesday, September 1st, and confirmed that the business in Q4 was just shifted into the next quarter and not lost. In fact, the shares outperformed the S&P500 by almost 11% in the week after earnings.Data by YChartsThe S&P500 committee ruined the party a few days later. Next week, I think the outperformance resumes. This is just too good of a business trading at too low of a multiple to stay down here for long, and between the direct insider buying and underwater stock options, management should be very incentivized to get expenses under control and have shares rebound.I think shares could easily rebound into the $16-18 level over the next month, and back to $25 by next June."
4376854,105865,2020-09-29T13:38:10-04:00,"I present my Atlas portfolio and its quantitative and qualitative selection criteria.I review 3 existing Atlas members, Altria, Verizon and Kroger.I introduce Atlas' latest addition - H&R Block and explain how it fits Atlas selection criteria as a deep value play.","Atlas is one of my three investment portfolios. Each portfolio has a set of selection criteria to identify companies with similar traits. The picture below visualizes what a qualified Atlas member looks like.picture creditAs its name suggests, companies in Atlas are no-drama heavy lifters, behind-the-scene heroes that hold weight for our society to operate smoothly.The investment goal of the Atlas portfolio is an average annual return of 7-10%, with relatively low volatility especially during major market turmoil such as the 2007-2008 financial crisis and the current pandemic crisis. The investment strategy is mostly Buy and Hold unless events that fundamentally change a company's future outlook take place. It is most suitable for cautious/conservative investors with lower risk tolerance, who prefer buy-and-hold with 10+ years investment horizon, and not be bothered by daily news/noises from capital markets. As most companies in my Atlas portfolio pays between 2-5% dividends, the portfolio is also a good fit for income investors. Furthermore, for these who don't immediately rely on the income generated from the portfolio, I recommend setting up a DRIP plan to reinvest dividends and using a tax-deferred or exempt account (e.g. Traditional/RothIRA) so that compounding effects can do its magic to the fullest. If it is not yet clear by now, for these hunting for multi-bagger winners in a short period of time, I am afraid Atlas is not your answer. I developed a set of quantitative and qualitative attributes so I can evaluate companies in a systematic fashion. Let us start with some qualitative criteria: A sizeable essential business: Essential means my grandma (or grandpa) shall immediately get what this business is without much confusion. The company doesn't have to be No.1 in the industry, but represents a sizeable market share, and/or service a large customer base. A well-oiled money-printing machine: The company has a long history of stable operating margin. It runs a sensible business model so that it doesn't have to make risky bets to make a high return for years/decades to come. Shareholders friendly: shareholders friendly, especially for lower growth companies, could be best demonstrated in its prudent capital allocation with a high dividend payout/share buyback ratio. No reckless bets to acquire non-essential businesses. Fair valuation: assuming nothing changes (a big if), I would like to see the company's market cap equates to its next 7-12 years of total profits. Growth is secondary: We all love growth. But for Atlas companies, we value predictability and certainty first, and our baseline model often projects zero future growth, in some cases even negative growth, and that's ok.I also use quantitative criteria to provide concrete data points to support qualitative ones. They are a much larger set, and I think it is best to use some examples to explain. Altria (MO), Verizon (VZ), and Kroger (KR) are current Atlas members. I use the Atlas evaluation sheet below so that readers can get a general idea of what it takes to be an Atlas member. As I evaluate H&R Block (HRB), I find it matches with Atlas criteria, especially after its price drop since June. Now let us examine it.Sizeable essential business: Tax is an essential business. In the span of the last 20 years including the 2007-2008 financial crisis and the current pandemic crisis, tax filing stayed strong as expected. In 2019, H&R Block handled 20.2 million total US tax returns, about 13% total returns in the US, a sizeable market share. Money-printing machine: as a seasonal business, H&R gets most revenue in the fiscal quarter ended in Apr. Over the last few years, its trailing 12 months data shows steady ~$3 billion revenue and $500-600 million free operating cash flow.Shareholders friendly: Almost 90%+ free cash flow goes to dividend and stock buyback, with dividend payout ratio is quite stable at 40% free cash flow over the years. Fair valuation: At the current price of $15/share, H&R Block is valued at 2.9 billion, less than 6x free cash flow, and around 7x net income. For an asset-light company with a 20%+ operating margin, that is a bargain.Growth: its revenue has been hovering around $3 billion since 2016, no growth, but still holds the ground. So far so good. Its price chart shows significant weakness relative to the S&P500 index, especially since June 2020. Data by YCharts2 recent events contributed significantly to its price weakness. In H&R fiscal 2020 report (June 16, 2020), it reported its revenue and profit declined significantly year over year and stock dropped over 10% after the earning. Examining the footnotes and listening to the script, it is clear the revenue decline was due to this year's tax-filing extension to July 15. Source: HRB fiscal 2020 press releaseThen in earlier September, S&P dropped H&R from the ranks of the S&P 500 index.These 2 events are what I consider noises that often bring knee-jerk reactions in the market, yet it has almost no long-term effect on the company. These events, along with its punished stock price, often lead me to initiate a position and welcome the company to the Atlas portfolio. And at $15/share, H&R Block makes the cut. H&R Block acquired Wave Financial in June 2019 for $405 million. It was positioned to enhance H&R small business offering as Wave provides bookkeeping and cash flow management solutions, and could further provide seamless tax preparation experience for H&R Block SMB users. I am not yet sold, and its topline contribution of 37 million in 2020 is still a drop in the bucket to H&R's $3 billion revenue. I will monitor in future quarterly reports. The other noticeable trend is people gradually move from assisted filing to DIY. For the 2019 tax year, assisted tax filers spent an average of $160 per filing, while DIY spent an average of $29 per filing. That trend shift hurts revenue and operating margin in a non-trivial way. From 2019 to 2020, DIY filing increased by 2.3% from 40.7% to 43%. A 1% shift from assisted filing to DIY contributes to a $26 million revenue decline, not devastating but significant enough to closely monitor. H&R Block's long-term debt increased quite significantly from $1.5 billion in July 2019 to $3.5 billion in July 2020. Reading H&R Block's 1Q2021 quarterly report, it drew the full amount of $2 billion committed Line of Credit to strengthen its liquidity during the global pandemic, and expect to repay in full in Sep 2020. I will monitor closely as it is important that management keeps its word. Source: H&R Block 1Q2021 quarterly reportIt also issued $650 million of 3.875% 10-year senior notes, while paying in full $650 million remaining current debt at 4.125%. I think both moves are prudent and responsible debt management. At $15/share, HRB is valued at 7x P/E, 6x EV/EBITDA. It runs a stable and essential tax business with light assets and a high operating margin. It has a respectable market share in the US and has a competitive product offering (compared to TurboTax, TaxAct). Some risks and concerns discussed above deserve close monitoring, yet none are deal-breakers currently. I think the stock is mispriced, while I don't know how long it would take the market to sort it out, I am happy holding it while collecting a 7% dividend yield. If you have stock((s)) that might be a great fit for the Atlas portfolio, please kindly share it in the comments section with a brief introduction. I will evaluate them as I see fit. I would appreciate your following me, and best luck with your investments."
4375830,103182,2020-09-23T00:55:44-04:00,"Despite facing secular headwinds in its assisted tax preparation segment, H&R Block continues to deliver on the shareholder value creation front.The company drastically reduced its share count in the last decade, but a massive blunder overshadows management’s self-proclaimed “opportunistic approach”.With its shares trading close to economic book value, it is hard to make a case where this stock is not a table-pounding buy at today’s levels.","Written by the FALCON TeamFollowing our recent coverage of the integrated pharmacy behemoth, CVS Health (CVS), we now move on to one of the largest tax preparation service providers, H&R Block (HRB), to supplement our monthly heat map of Dividend Champions by providing another interesting research-worthy candidate, both from an income and total return standpoint.In light of Buffett’s teachings distilled from his 50+ years of shareholder letters, our analysis is based on the three dimensions that truly matter: operations, capital allocation, and valuation. Before we do that, however, let’s jump into what makes H&R Block an interesting candidate today.Image SourceH&R Block provides income tax return preparation services through its company-owned offices and franchise locations, as well as digital do-it-yourself tax solutions via its online tax software. On average, total U.S. filings grow ~1% annually and are highly correlated to employment, although there is a secular shift from assisted towards the online DIY category, with the latter growing twice as fast as the market. This trend is well reflected in H&R Block’s year-over-year performance, as the 2.8% decline in assisted filing volume was offset by a 10.6% increase in its do-it-yourself online segment, leading to an overall 3.3% increase in U.S. tax filing volume. Although the YoY growth figures might look promising, they are temporarily skewed by a large number of filings this year made exclusively for stimulus payments, while the company’s mid-term revenue outlook is overshadowed by the pandemic-induced unemployment rate spike, causing H&R Block’s shares to plummet -40% since the beginning of the year.It is important to note that even if the company’s efforts to replace the lost in-office service customers with virtual assistance users bear fruit, H&R Block will still face a secular revenue decline, as the online services are typically priced well below the traditional in-office alternatives. On top of that, although H&R Block dominates the more profitable assisted tax preparation sector, it is not well-positioned for the shift towards do-it-yourself services, lagging behind rival Intuit (INTU) in DIY tax-prep software, as the latter is taking 55% of the segment compared to H&R Block’s mere ~15% market share. In an effort to transition the business and offset the growth headwinds, H&R Block extended its portfolio with accounting, invoicing, payment, and other services to small businesses via its Wave Financial acquisition. Although still marginal in terms of revenue contribution, Wave posted a 20% year-over-year growth despite the negative impact of the pandemic, while over the long term, it could also serve as a catalyst to draw small-business customers to H&R Block’s core tax preparation business.As a general rule of thumb, a company has authentic earnings power when it has both defensive and enterprising profits. Thus, when assessing a firm’s operations, we care about two fundamental aspects: it has to pass the cash flow-based stability test, and it must be a consistent shareholder value creator measured in the EVA framework.As Hewitt Heiserman writes in his book “It's Earnings That Count,” the most ruinous mistake you can make as a buyer of common stocks is to own a company that goes bankrupt. For this reason, the defensive investor judges the quality of a firm’s accrual profit on the basis of its ability to self-fund. That is, whether it produces more cash from ongoing operations than it consumes, and not go deeper into debt or dilute current stockholders. When we look at the conventional financial statements, our primary concern, therefore, is the stability of the company’s cash generation.Source: MorningstarThe mature stage of H&R Block’s core market is well-reflected in its cash flow figures, with the company struggling to grow its operating cash flow over the past decade. It is worth noting that the plummeting OCF figures of 2020 were caused by the federal government extending the tax filing deadline from April 15 to July 15 in light of the pandemic, thus the TTM figures containing Q1 FY2021 numbers are more suitable for an apples-to-apples comparison. With CapEx accounting for ~18% of OCF over the past 10 years, the underlying business is only moderately capital-intensive, with an improving trend due in large to the ongoing digital transformation of the company. The remarkable stability of the historical free cash flow figures enables H&R Block to pass our stability criteria with ease, yet the sluggish growth on the operating cash flow front is a telltale sign of a mature company. In the next step, we move on to the EVA (Economic Value Added) framework, examining if the company is able to consistently create shareholder value, as EVA cuts through accounting distortions and charges for the use of capital.We tend to prefer companies whose businesses are protected by large and enduring economic moats, as buying those companies at the right price generally leads to overperformance, as outlined in our research article. In the EVA framework, the EVA Margin (EVA/Sales) can serve as our ratio to define a company’s moat. A 5% EVA Margin can be used as an indicator for a “good” company, whereas persistence of a 5%+ EVA Margin for 10 years makes a company great and thus “moaty.”Let’s start by looking at the chart: H&R Block has posted remarkably positive historical EVA Margin levels (averaging 8.7% over the past decade), supported by its fairly capital-light business model and the strong pricing power of its assisted tax preparation services (worth noting again that the plummeting 2020 EVA Margin figure is misleading due to the tax filing deadline extension). While the secular shift towards the DIY tax filing model and the resulting digitalization might put pressure on the company’s top line (given the lower average revenue per client), we expect EVA Margin levels to stabilize around the historical average levels, due to the inevitable streamlining of the business and the resulting reduction in the capital charge.Source: evaexpress.comThe consistently positive EVA Margin over the past 15 years is a telltale sign of an existing competitive edge, thus from a purely quantitative standpoint, a wide-moat rating might seem warranted for H&R Block at this point. That being said, from a qualitative perspective, we would feel very uncomfortable with a wide-moat rating, considering the secular shift the company’s core business is facing.EVA Momentum measures the growth rate in EVA, scaled to the size of the business (measured by its sales). It is the EVA framework’s equivalent for Return On Incremental Invested Capital or ROIIC. Any positive EVA Momentum is good because it means EVA has increased, and it is an indication that it is worthwhile to reinvest capital in the underlying business. Instead of pinpointing any single-year performance, we prefer to look at the long-term trailing averages in EVA Momentum.Source: Author’s calculation based on data from evaexpress.comOver the past decade, H&R Block has generated an underwhelming -0.4% EVA Momentum on average, as the company struggled to grow its sales, while its EVA Margin has remained relatively stable despite the ongoing transition from a highly lucrative brick & mortar model towards a multichannel tax service portfolio. This sluggish performance stands in stark contrast to the broader market, as the long-run average EVA Momentum for the 50th percentile of the U.S. stock market (represented by the Russell 3000) has been a positive 0.4% percent. It is readily apparent by the negative compound average EVA Momentum in the case of H&R Block that the reinvested capital fails to deliver incremental EVA generation for the company's shareholders, clearly reflecting the secular decline in its core business model.The EVA framework enabled us so far to prove from a rearview-mirror perspective, whether the company has an economic moat based on its historical consistency of shareholder value creation. In the case of H&R Block, its scale-related cost advantage (resulting from its leading position in the assisted segment), coupled with a well-established brand, makes it a preferred choice as an assisted tax service provider. Despite the significant market share of the DIY filings, the assisted category (still representing ~55% of the overall filing volume) remains resilient, as a large portion of the population is not confident in preparing their taxes on their own, or they put a higher emphasis on getting the maximum refund with the assistance of a certified tax professional. That said, the company’s DIY segment’s “moatiness” is hardly justifiable, since Intuit’s TurboTax is an undisputed leader of the DIY category, while H&R Block is only playing catch-up in the field.As a conclusion, a narrow moat rating is warranted for H&R Block from a qualitative standpoint that enables the company to retain its competitive position, thus outearn its WACC for an extended period.Taking a brief snapshot at the company’s debt profile: H&R Block has a long-term debt to capital ratio of 91% (as per FactSet data retrieved from F.A.S.T. Graphs) coupled with an S&P Credit Rating of BBB. Although this high indebtedness is reflected in the company’s current Vulnerability Score, it is worth noting that the debt metric is currently skewed by the company’s recent $2 billion credit drawdown in an effort to assure flexibility and liquidity amid the pandemic. As to the temporary nature of the high leverage, the CFO indicated on the latest earnings call that they “intend to pay down the full balance of the draw” in the coming weeks.The EVA framework’s Quality Score is a comprehensive way to assess a company’s overall quality, by combining its EVA-based Profitability (EVA Margin and Trend) and Risk (e.g. Volatility and Vulnerability) metrics into a single score, measured against the broader market. In the case of extraordinary companies, we would like to see a Quality Score consistently above 80 over a long period. As outlined in our research article, the upper quintile tends to outperform the market historically.In the case of H&R Block, its exceptionally strong return on capital (offset by a weak EVA profit trend), results in a strong, 69th percentile Profitability Score, while the firm’s pronounced volatility and vulnerability combine for a very high, 100th percentile Risk Score against all global companies. The resulting composite Quality Score of 43 falls in line with the lower edge of H&R Block’s historical 40-80 range. Unless the EVA Momentum metrics improve, it is unlikely that H&R Block will enter the league of exceptional quality companies in the foreseeable future. Source: evaexpress.comAs a final assessment: H&R Block’s market-leading position in the assisted tax preparation category is clearly reflected within the EVA Framework, as its scale-related cost advantages have successfully translated to economic profit generation, while its efforts to take on the undisputed leader in the DIY field are yet to bear fruit. That said, the company passes our operational criteria (although we must note that the overall quality leaves a lot to be desired compared to top-notch enterprises), and H&R Block’s narrow-moat rating seems fully warranted both from a quantitative and a qualitative standpoint.After looking at the operations dimension, we continue investigating the company through the capital allocation lens. Remember, the incremental return on invested capital (measured by EVA Momentum) is a crucial element when it comes to the assessment of successful capital allocation by management. If the company can earn a positive EVA by reinvesting all the cash generated by the underlying business, shareholders are better off if the firm retains most of its earnings. In the table below, we have dissected all the possible uses of cash for H&R Block for the past decade.Source: MorningstarAs outlined earlier, H&R Block’s operations require a relatively low level of reinvestment, with CapEx averaging ~18% of OCF over the last 10 years. The firm’s capital intensity will likely trend lower in the coming years, as the company is slowly shifting away from brick-and-mortar assisted services to DIY tax preparation, which requires significantly lower levels of capital spending than the traditional in-office segment.Since the company’s average EVA Momentum for the last 10 years comes in at a negative 0.4%, the current level of reinvestment is questionable, since capital expenditures failed to translate to incremental shareholder value creation in the past. This is important to understand, as this means that H&R Block is struggling to find investment opportunities where it can outearn its true cost of capital, and as a result, increase EVA. The best this firm seems to achieve through CapEx is to retain a competitive position where it can maintain its current level of economic profit generation.Nevertheless, the company has a clear capital allocation plan to help drive growth while also rewarding shareholders, as outlined by the CFO during the latest earnings call:H&R Block returns all the available FCF to shareholders, and then some. Between 2011 and 2020, the company generated an aggregate of $4.95 billion in free cash flow, while buybacks and dividend payments amounted to $5.90 billion (or 119% of FCF), with the difference being financed by the issuance of long-term debt.Source: Author’s illustration based on Morningstar data(Note: Data for 2020 is not meaningful since the extended tax filing deadline caused a collapse in FCF for FY 2020.)H&R Block is a significant repurchaser of its own shares, as the firm managed to decrease its diluted share count by roughly 37% since 2011, translating to a compounded annual reduction rate of over 5%. While the repurchase program got suspended in April to preserve liquidity, management since decided to resume their practice of buybacks to offset dilution from equity grants.In terms of shareholder value creation, it is always crucial to assess whether share buybacks are executed in an opportunistic manner. In the case of H&R Block, the company bought back the majority of shares in 2011, 2013, and 2016-17. Even though it seems obvious that shares appeared to be undervalued in 2011 and 2013 measured by the Future Growth Reliance, we have reservations regarding the attractiveness of valuation in 2016 in historical comparison. The truly bitter side of the story is that the company spent a massive $2 billion that year alone (more than all the other years combined from 2011 to 2020) to buy back shares at an average price of ~$35, reducing the share count by 20%. (Remember, we are talking about fiscal years here, which end in April, not calendar years.)Source: evaexpress.comThis leads us to the conclusion that despite management’s supposedly opportunistic attitude towards repurchases, this major blunder in 2016 led to zero value creation for shareholders in the most optimistic scenario.H&R Block has put together an uninterrupted dividend streak of 22 years without a reduction, while the company did not miss a quarterly payout since going public nearly 60 years ago. Management seems fully committed to the dividend, even as the board decided not to raise the payout this year in light of the pandemic.Growth rates of the past are reasonable (with the 5-year CAGR coming in at 5%), and while the underlying business will most likely fail to deliver substantial (if any) growth, a continued reduction in the share count could support future increases in the low single-digits. Regarding safety, the current level of payout is amply covered, both on an earnings and cash flow basis. If we consider the juicy entry yield of 7.3%, there is nothing to dislike here from an income standpoint. It is very rare to find a safe (!), high-yielding dividend stock in today’s market, but H&R Block is certainly one of the few. (This stock provided a higher than 7.0% entry yield in only 5.4% of the time in the last 5 years.)In an effort to diversify the company away from its fading assisted, in-office tax-prep business, H&R Block announced the acquisition of Wave Financial in June 2019. Wave is a company that provides financial services and software for small businesses, with only 1-9 employees. This transaction makes sense since the small-business-services market is vast and the number of self-employed people and small enterprises (all possible customers of Wave) has been growing at 4-6% annually since the Great Recession. We must note, though, that the coronavirus-induced economic situation caused the demise of many small businesses, yet Wave is back at 20% year-over-year revenue growth in Q1 2020.Nevertheless, Wave is unlikely to make up for the declines in H&R Block's assisted tax-prep business anytime soon. Even if we assume extreme revenue growth (+50%) over the next 5 years, Wave would still only produce roughly 6% of H&R Block’s pre-pandemic revenue, not to mention that Wave has operating losses as of today, which makes it very tough to foresee what kind of profit margins will be sustainable for the company. We believe H&R Block needs to make several bolt-on acquisitions in the future to effectively compete in this market.While we prefer this type of M&A activity as opposed to large, transformative deals since the risk of integration is much smaller, there is always a danger of overpayment, no matter the size of the transaction. H&R Block paid $405 million, and the company already recorded a $106 million goodwill impairment charge on the valuation of Wave due to the negative impact of the pandemic on client volumes and revenues, leading us to a conclusion that the purchase price might have been a bit too steep at near 10 times TTM sales, but it is still too early to judge. At this stage, it is immensely hard to predict whether this deal has the potential to become a home-run for H&R Block, but we can comfortably say that these types of acquisitions will be necessary in the future, as the assisted tax-prep segment is a melting ice cube that must be replaced.Future Growth RelianceOur prime historical valuation indicator in the EVA world is the Future Growth Reliance (FGR), which is the percent proportion of the firm’s market value that is derived from, and depends on, growth in EVA. As outlined in our research article, it is the best-of-breed sentiment indicator that addresses accounting distortions, thus gives us a true picture of which companies seem attractively valued in historical terms. Source: evaexpress.comBy looking at the chart of H&R Block, it becomes obvious that the market does not give much credit to the sustainability of the prevailing EVA fundamentals of the company at any given time, as its shares have rarely traded with a positive FGR over the past 15 years. That said, the current valuation level seems utterly pessimistic even in historical comparison, with the market pricing in only a razor-thin long-term EVA scenario, essentially valuing H&R Block near its economic book value.Even if we consider a historically unprecedented 3% EVA Margin with 0 growth in EVA going forward (factoring in the secular pressure from the rapidly-growing DIY tax preparation field), we arrive at a fair value estimate of $23, indicating a massive undervaluation of H&R Block at current levels. Such a disconnect between fundamental performance and market expectations is very rare to come by these days with widely-followed companies. Based on this metric, it is hard to make a case that there is no value in H&R Block today since baked-in expectations are so low that it might be very easy to surprise on the upside.As a second step, we use Morningstar’s valuation system, where analysts create industry and company-specific assumptions, and then all the inputs are used in a discounted cash flow model. In order to reflect all moving parts within the business, the analyst firm also evaluates the level of uncertainty with all the stocks they actively assess. H&R Block is not formally covered by a Morningstar analyst (only an algorithm-generated fair value estimate is available based on analyst-covered peer companies), thus the results are to be taken with a grain of salt.Morningstar assigns H&R Block a high uncertainty rating with a $15.9 quantitative fair value estimate (as of September 20). The thresholds between the different star ratings are illustrated below: Source: Author’s illustration based on Morningstar dataWith the stock currently trading at $14.2, a 3-star rating is warranted, implying that H&R Block’s shares are close to fair value territory based on Morningstar’s quantitative estimate. It is important to note that we view the analyst firm’s algorithm-generated valuation as utterly pessimistic in light of the company’s EVA fundamentals, since the $15.9 fair value estimate would factor in a historically unprecedented, ~0.7% EVA Margin (assuming a flat top line) over the long run, coupled with zero expectation for future growth in EVA. On top of that, the analyst firm’s 4-star threshold of $13.5 would imply a valuation precisely at economic book value. No matter from which angle we look at it, H&R Block’s shares seem to be trading at true bargain-basement valuation levels as of today.PRVit score - heat map vs. marketAfter all our due diligence, we turn to the PRVit model for a final judgment of the overall attractiveness of a stock. The PRVit is a multifactor quantitative stock selection model based on EVA-centric measures of Performance, Risk, and Valuation. Combining a company's Quality Score with its actual Valuation Score can be visualized on a heat map like the one below, where the gradient diagonal line signals fair value. We want to see a stock in the upper-right hand corner of this heat map, but we are more concerned with the Quality Score, as we believe that over the long run, we are better off with a truly exceptional business bought at a fair price, rather than a fair company bought at an exceptionally attractive price.Source: evaexpress.comAs the heat map above shows, H&R Block represents an attractive investment candidate within the EVA framework, showcasing an example where mediocre quality meets bargain-basement valuation levels. We have indicated previously that this is not a growth story, this investment is about waiting patiently for valuation multiples to recover near historical averages while being handsomely rewarded with a fat and seemingly sustainable dividend. H&R Block’s all-time high 7%+ entry yield coupled with significant insider purchases around the $15 mark indicates an unprecedented buying opportunity at today’s levels for enterprising investors who are willing to compromise on quality if they are compensated on the valuation front. That said, we would not feel comfortable with an oversized position, as this is not the type of top-quality business we wish to buy and hold for decades. As a consequence, we would not be hesitant to sell if the price climbs back near fair value, representing a roughly 60% upside potential in the stock price, not counting the dividends harvested along the way.If you liked this analysis and don't want to miss any of the upcoming articles by our evidence-based stock selection process exclusive for SA readers, please scroll up and click ""Follow"" to be notified of future releases."

Without going too much into the details of the breakdown of the company’s expenses and cash flows, we believe that the company’s financials for FY20 and FY21 would be drastically different because of the government-imposed tax filing delay of at least 90 days (15th July). We recommend investors to look at this defensive stock again once the company releases its next earnings report on 16th June before making any investments. With that being said, we expect revenues to continue to be stable and recurring in the long run and our target price is $26.26 which represents a 47.5% upside to the current price of $17.80.Source: WSJThe company primarily provides assisted, DIY and virtual tax preparation solutions and other related services and products to the general public of the US, Canada and Australia. In addition, HRB distributes H&R Block branded products and services through their franchisees and derives royalty revenues through these channels.Data: Company Annual Report93% of the company's revenues originates from the US while the international market only makes up 7%. Thus, we will be gearing our analysis and content towards the US market.Data: Company Annual ReportIn FY19, the company and its franchisees prepared 23.6mm tax returns worldwide, representing a 1.2% increase from the 23.3mm prepared in FY18. The company achieves this through retail and online operations where tax professionals assist and guide customers in filing their taxes, which gets notoriously complicated in the US. In recent years, the government has strived to make this process simpler and HRB responded by coming up with a DIY tax filing service where an AI-based program would assist taxpayers in filing the forms. I will not delve too much into the details of their products, but you can find more information on the company’s annual report (pg 14) and their website.On 1st July 2019, the company completed its acquisition of Wave, a financial solutions platform that assists small business owners in managing their financials. Wave brought in $25.7mm of revenue for the first 3 quarters of FY20, making up 3.1% of the total revenue for that period.Tax filing has been and will always be a necessity in any economic condition. Looking at the share price movement, we can see that the share price rose in the 00/01 crisis and traded sideways in 08/09 with a slight general downtrend.Data: TradingViewLooking at revenue, we can see the figures were growing even in recessionary periods. From 2010 onwards, revenues seem to stabilize at around $2.5-3bn as the company completed its restructuring process. Since then, revenue has grown from $2.4bn in 2010 to $2.7bn in 2019. Stable revenue growth is always a plus and further adds to our thesis of resilience.Data: Company Annual ReportsThrough our analysis, we found that the company’s revenue is closely correlated to the number of income taxes filed in the US (reported by the IRS). We performed a regression analysis looking at the service revenue figures, and the total number of individual income tax filed from 2009 to 2019 (both for 12 months ending April) to derive an R-square value of 0.866703. This means that 86.7% of the firm’s services revenue can be explained by the number of income taxes filings received by the IRS. This may seem obvious, but it is critical that the data backs our hypothesis. Next, we performed the same analysis for the firm’s total revenue and against the total number of individual income tax filed from 2009 to 2019 to derive an R-square value of 0.667011. This translates to 66.7% of the total revenue that can be explained by the number of tax filing, which is still substantial.Thus, we could use the individual income tax filed to project the company’s service revenue for the last quarter of FY20. From the table below, we can see that the numbers for the 12 months ending April took a substantial hit. This is predominantly because of the US government allowing taxpayers to file their taxes 90 days later than the original deadline.Data: IRSWe modeled this into projections for the taxes filed, including the spillover of taxes to be filed in the first quarter (May to July) of FY21 instead. We did this by first projecting the number of taxes filed if the delay did not occur. We used an average historical growth rate of 0.71%, which is pretty conservative. Now we have the difference between the filings without delay and the actual number of filings to estimate the number of delayed filings. We then added this number to the estimated number of filings for FY21 (without the delay).Data: IRS, Author’s AnalysisData: IRS, Author’s AnalysisLooking at the company financials, we can see that revenues and profits have been stable over the past 5 years. We expect this trend to continue, other than a disruption in FY20 and FY21 for the reasons mentioned above.Data: Company Annual ReportsZooming in into the quarterly financials of the company, we can see that there is a pattern which follows the tax filing seasons. We see the greatest number of tax filings occurring in January to April, evident by the company’s peak revenues during that quarter. As a result, profits are usually negative in the first 3 quarters of each fiscal year and peaks in the last quarter. Due to the aforementioned delay of tax filing for FY20, we expect a disruption in this pattern where the peak revenues expected in the last quarter will be spilled over to the first quarter of FY21 (shown in the next section).Data: Company Annual ReportsAs mentioned previously, the company’s services revenue is closely tied to the number of incomes taxes filed. Thus, we established a factor between these variables and found that we have a ratio that has been constant over the past 10 years (other than in 2009).Data: Company Annual Reports, Author’s AnalysisWith the above assumptions in place, we built our revenue model and extended the company’s stable margins. From this graph, you can see that FY20 Q4 revenue and profits are adversely affected and spilled over to the following quarter (FY21 Q1). This forms a disruption to the pattern where the first quarters of each fiscal year historically did not produce positive earnings.Data: Company Annual Reports, Author’s AnalysisOur projections give us an FY20 EPS of $1.27 (vs. $2.1 in FY19) and FY21 EPS of $3.49. The delay of tax filings also shows an impact to EPS where a substantial portion of FY20’s earnings spilled over to FY21.Data: Company Annual Reports, Author’s AnalysisLooking at the company’s historical multiples over the past few years, we performed a relative valuation to determine a possible price range of the company’s shares. As you can see, the price would range from a low of $12.13 to a high $35.35 depending on the results released next week. The current share price is at $17.80, which suggests that our range of valuation presents more upside to the company shares than down. Regardless of the composition of revenues and profits over the next 2 quarters, we believe that the company’s shares could face some weakness when the company reports “lower than expected” earnings for FY20 Q4 next week. That could be a great opportunity for investors to pick up some shares at a discount.Source: Author’s AnalysisLooking at the figures, we decided that performing a relative valuation may not be the most optimal choice. Thus, we built a quick and dirty DCF model, assuming stable revenue growth of 0.7% and FCFF margin of 14-15% based on historical trends. We used a WACC of 7.07% based on latest capitalization structure and an extremely conservative 0.7% terminal growth rate (taken from historical growth rate of number of income taxes filed). We derived a target price of $26.26, representing a 47.5% upside.Source: Author’s AnalysisWe then did a sensitivity analysis to test the underlying assumptions for WACC and terminal growth. The results showed that all of our scenarios present an upside to the current price of $17.80.Source: Author’s AnalysisThe company has always been striving towards an optimal capital structure. We can see that the debt-to-capital ratio has historically always been over 20% and has recently spiked up in 2017. However, ever since the new CEO took over in 2018, that ratio has gone down.Data: Company Annual ReportsComing 1st October this year, the company has a senior note due with a principal amount of US$650mm. This is a substantial portion of debt, about 3.38x of the current cash position. Based on historical trends, it is likely that the company would want to refinance this note. The company has $750mm of undrawn RCF which they might use to refinance temporarily. While we believe that the company should have no issues refinancing, investors should note that S&P Global Ratings has recently revised HRB’s outlook from stable to negative while maintaining its BBB rating. We recognize this risk and investors who might be worried about the refinancing should keep this in mind.Data: Company Annual ReportsThe company has committed to paying regular dividends and purchasing its own shares. Dividends have been increasing consecutively for 4 years and is expected to continue for the foreseeable future. Cuts to dividends and share buybacks are unlikely unless the company has issues refinancing. If the economic slowdown persists, we believe that the strong and consistent dividend payouts of HRB would be a compelling reason to buy into the stock.Data: Company Annual ReportsData: Company Quarterly ReportThe key investor takeaway is that we have a defensive stock with stable dividends, albeit the slight disruptions to earnings in FY20 Q4 and FY21 Q1. Our DCF valuation projects a strong upside case for the company and we recommend investors with a long-term horizon to consider adding HRB to their portfolio once share prices show weakness when FY20 Q4 earnings are released next week. More risk-averse investors with shorter investment horizons might want to wait for the FY21 Q1 earnings release and further updates on the company’s ability to refinance."

An exceptional yield tainted by concerns around safety & growth.Source: Seeking AlphaAs I'll show through this article, standard models aren't handling HRB's pandemic measures such as drawing on their credit as well as the pandemic-related revenue shift. While there are strategic concerns around revenue growth & legal risks, this has generated a discount excessive to the risks that should resolve in the near to medium term. HRB is willing to pay you, the investor, 6.94% to wait.HRB is best understood as an annual stock. While they do offer products & services beyond seasonal tax preparation, these lines of business account for less than 10% of revenue, which I will cover in the next session. Instead, the vast majority of revenue occurs during filing season which aligns to HRB's Q4. Here are the prior 5 years per the 10k.Source: 10KFrom 2016 to 2019, we see a remarkably stable revenue ($3B) and income ($400-500M). Against this backdrop, it's intriguing to see the stock price chart against both the S&P 500 and tax preparation titan Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU).Source: Seeking AlphaThe level of market hate for HRB shown in this chart is staggering. HRB investors were cut in half while the S&P doubled and Intuit quadrupled. It's two-fold, both HRB's lag in the run up to March 2020 and the pronounced lack of recovery in the share price.

Consider this chart of the short interest over a ten-year time frame.Source: GuruFocusSo, our growth thesis needs to account for bearish sentiment. Meanwhile, our 6.94% yield fans have one simple question. How sustainable is the dividend?As we see above, for full year fiscal 2020, HRB paid $1.04 per share in dividends on a $.04 loss per share in net income. Management also elected to draw the maximum available amount from their $2B credit line due to concerns around continuity of operations as well as the need to refinance a note. This would give the strong impression that HRB was funding its dividend via borrowing rather than operations. Paradoxically drawing on this credit line led to a marked deterioration of key financial ratios such as debt:equity (5.1 in Q4FY19 to 71(!) in Q4FY20) as well as a troubling Altman Z score as the higher asset base of undeployed cash + liabilities took their toll.However, one key observation from above to keep in mind, HRB is best assessed on an annual basis. Due to the pandemic, the filing deadline was extended to July 15th. As a result, a significant percentage of HRB customers delayed filing until HRB's Q1FY21. While necessarily an estimate, consider the Q1FY21 10Q Income Statement.Source: 10Q FY21 + Author's calculations in blueThe blue represents a simple attempt to normalize earnings, given the deadline shift. Adding back these numbers to their proper filing year yields the following results:While an 85% payout ratio is on the higher side, given some of the more colorful financial gymnastics being deployed to maintain dividend status, this does not appear excessive. More importantly, HRB is showing consistency at the $3B revenue mark for another year. While many would prefer growth (and more on that later), the constancy of revenue is a strong indicator of dividend support.HRB provides useful dis-aggregated metrics on revenue. Using the same technique, here's the normalized FY20 revenue vs. FY19 by stream.Source: 10k + Author's calculationsA few sharp-eyed readers will note that I didn't add back the service plan revenue as it's most likely recognized ratably. It's also useful to bridge some of the assumptions I'm making in my FY21 revenue projections.Source: 10k + Author's calculationsFor this 1st presentation, I'll note that I'm being excessively pessimistic in laying out the assumptions. I'll explore upside potential in the next section. However, if you are concerned about the dividend, a 1% revenue dip is worth considering. Even holding operating costs as fixed with the lower revenue base yields net income ~$415M. This revenue deterioration can continue to ~9% under these assumptions before impacting the ability to pay the dividend out of earnings.This chart provides a useful launching point to start discussing the relative strengths and weaknesses of HRB's revenue sources. I'll focus on three categories of revenue:Royalties and International were a weak spot for HRB in FY20. Royalties are net revenue paid by franchisee-owned stores back to HRB. Franchises represent approximately 30% of US offices, with International offices representing 15-20% of the worldwide total. Consider this FY20 vs. FY19 office comparison from the 10K.Source: 10kThe delta in revenue is almost entirely explained by the count reduction in franchise and international office. Therefore, it's more useful to consider this weakness in relation to the core business.Assisted tax prep is the core driver of HRB's revenue. Beyond its 60% share of revenue, it leads to additional pull-through revenue opportunities via credit cards and other services. While HRB won't provide formal guidance until December, they did provide this limited guidance during the Q1 conference call.Source: Q1FY21 earnings transcriptSo, the ""flat to down"" squares with our -1% to -3% revenue growth assumptions above incorporating the weakness in franchise-owned stores. When the CEO refers to ""EIP only"", these were people who only filed due to the stimulus check requirements. HRB is (rightly) being conservative in not assuming these will be repeat customers.Long term, HRB is in the middle of a transition from brick & mortar to an omnichannel strategy to serve customers via a mix of stores and online. Under this approach, there will be cannibalization of Assisted Revenue by DIY. However, it's largely priced into the stock price and should stabilize.Far greater risk of revenue deterioration has been due to the simplification of the US Tax Code. With the stated goal of allowing more taxpayers to file via post card, this also conveniently ties to the above chart showing short interest in HRB from 3% during Trump's primary run in January 2016 to 30% last fall. However, looking at the most recent IRS databook (preliminary as of June 2020) vs two years ago shows a minimal impact.Source: IRS Databook (2020) & 2017Practitioner online returns have proven remarkably resilient in the face of tax code simplification. Fundamentally, I'd ascribe it to trust. Perhaps not trust in HRB directly, but there will always be a significant percentage of the population who does not trust themselves to advocate effectively for themselves in the face of financial requirements with full legal force behind them. These last few years have tested the lower bound of what that population is. There's reason to believe that the next few years will remove those headwinds.Looking forward, there is a strong probability of the US government needing to raise additional funds via increased taxes. The current favorite (75% at 538) has explicitly stated his intent to restore taxes to the prior rate as well as interject additional complexity. Additionally, Biden's need to balance several constituencies within his coalition will potentially lead more horse trading in the final bill. This uncertainty around the tax changes will only add to the HRB's customer base. While Trump has triumphed as an underdog in the media before, there's still a sizable ($3.3T) deficit to worry about making a tax raise probable. These two outcomes could best be described as strong positive vs. moderately positive revenue influences.Two bright spots in the HRB revenue portfolio are Wave and DIY. Wave was a recent acquisition supporting Small Business. While small, the revenue growth trends are favorable (+5% year over year) and more importantly do not cannibalize HRB's existing revenue streams. Meanwhile, DIY is poised to overtake royalties as the 2nd largest revenue stream for HRB. Per ProPublica's analysis of market share taken from IRS data, HRB's DIY has increased share each year rising from 13.8% in 2017 to 14.6% in 2019. Given TurboTax's (INTU) willingness to increase price, this represents an attractive opportunity for HRB to either increase revenue or take even more share.Having covered both the sustainability of the dividend using fairly pessimistic revenue projections as well as upside potential, I'd like to directly address the bankruptcy risk. As mentioned above, Q4FY20's debt to equity was a dire 70:1. However, management has publicly committed to multiple actions to address those risks. Please see the below bridge to fiscal respectability.Note A is discussed above in the calculation of the revenue shift from FY21 to FY20. Note B represents the ""natural"" seasonal earnings in Q1FY21 and along with the other Q1 activity helps bridge to the Q1FY21 10Q. Since it's also incorporated into the full year FY21 # in note D, it's added back to avoid double counting. Note C is where it begins to get more interesting. Management has publicly committed to repaying the credit line this month. From Tony Bowen, HRB CFO, on the Q1 earnings call.Source: Q1FY21 earnings transcriptFinally, with note D, this is the earnings projected for FY21 largely based on the dividend section above. This amount is slightly increased by factoring in the cost savings projections from the Meta deal to replace Emerald. Excluding that $8 million nudges the Debt:Equity up to 4.14.A few more points to address before moving away from balance sheet repairs. Beyond the pandemic, management also had concerns around refinancing a $650M note due this year. In August, HRB successfully refinanced that note to a lower interest rate (3.875%) compared to the prior note (4.125%). The next note is due in FY23. Finally, for those who prefer Altman Z as a bankruptcy risk metrics, these measures raise the score more than a full point from 1.4 to 2.8. My calculations are not normalized for the impact of leases like Seeking Alpha and I'm also only including the FY21 # in my sales totals for that metric. So, the actual Altman Z future scores posted on this site will be even higher.I've touched on some of the core risks above. However, I'd like to explore the two largest so that investors may make an informed decision; competition & regulation. Intuit has generated tremendous returns over the previous 5 years while facing the exact same tax law environment. In the minds of many, this is a retelling of the classic Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) vs. brick & mortar story. From a stock market return chart above, it's fair to say that this is exactly the way it's played out. However, Intuit has not shown AMZN's willingness to sacrifice margin to increase share. Witness the recent price increases to Intuit's flagship product TurboTax described above. It's probable with INTU already drawing antitrust scrutiny from the Credit Karma deal that they realize the value of a competitor. The risk of a hardening of competitive attitude bears watching, but it's reasonable to believe that the two can coexist.The saga around free file is absolutely fascinating from a legislative process. Briefly (although I can't recommend the podcast enough), there was a movement to allow tax filing for free for taxpayers under a determined income level. Reviewing the paltry free file usage rate from the IRS databook above, it was largely defeated via a combination of the tax preparation lobby and human nature. However, the impacts of the debate continue to overhang the industry. INTU and HRB are both named in a lawsuit by Los Angeles. There is a companion consumer class action lawsuit. In both cases, HRB has not accrued any potential liability on the balance sheet. In a similar vein, the noncompete agreement from the IRS was allowed to lapse at the beginning of the year. With a Democratic administration, it's more probable the IRS free file program would be revived. I would have a hard time crediting that this would be their first priority especially if they fail to secure the Senate. Additionally, there are some genuine security concerns raised in other countries where tax compliance has been mandated.To recap, there are three events over the next 90 days which will act to either reinforce or disprove my investment thesis. In chronological order:Logically, this creates four buying windows during which to build a long position. Depending on your appetite for risk, you can allocate accordingly to earlier or later windows. Fundamentally, this is an undervalued stock with ample room to support the current yield."
4374367,105526,2020-09-15T09:49:33-04:00,"H&R Block beats on the bottom line in FQ1, but assisted volume declines are a concern.
        Amid a structural shift toward digital DIY, margins look set to contract from both volume declines and pricing pressure.
        The c. 7% yield is appealing at first glance, but considering the challenging backdrop, I remain cautious on the name.","As H&R Block's (HRB) recent quarter showed, the secular shift from assisted to digital DIY tax prep has further accelerated following the COVID-19 pandemic, creating a very challenging backdrop for the company going forward. Current trends point toward assisted volumes at HRB continuing to decline in the 2021 tax season as the ongoing shift to digital DIY and competition from independents drive share losses. All in all, the stock needs a re-acceleration in assisted volumes to work, but I just don't see that happening anytime soon. Instead, I see structural margin pressure ahead, and therefore, remain cautious despite the c.7% yield.For the latest quarter, HRB's top line rose c. 300% Y/Y, on the back of strong tax return volumes through May, June, and July. Encouragingly, Wave Financial also saw a recovery despite the pressure on small businesses from COVID-19 throughout the quarter, with revenue rising c. 10% Q/Q (c. 233% Y/Y). The cost performance was also strong despite operating expenses rising 29.7% Y/Y, as cost increases were largely variable (taxable compensation and credit card transaction fees). As a result, HRB reported an EPS beat at $0.55 (well above consensus of $0.34).Source: H&R Block Presentation (Q1 2021)The key to the quarter was the cost performance, which performed better than expected, especially at the gross margin line. Opex also benefited from more efficient labor management in the quarter, as successful allocation of tax professionals to clients in assisted, along with an adjusted compensation model (vs. regular tax season), helped lower expenses and will likely boost efficiency moving forward.Looking ahead to fiscal 2021, HRB plans to extend its cost control measures further, with a hiring freeze, implementation of merit increases, a re-examination of vendor spend, rent re-negotiations, and capex cuts on the agenda. The initiatives may be positive for margins near-term, but the structural implications are questionable. I would also note that the focus on expenses contrasts with management's prior commentary on driving higher EBITDA margins by focusing on top-line growth.Overall, HRB volumes were up – tax filings posted growth of 3.3% Y/Y. However, much of this was attributable to DIY growth (+10.6% Y/Y), while assisted volumes weighed on overall growth, at down 2.8% Y/Y for the tax season.Source: H&R Block Presentation (Q1 2021)Notably, assisted volume declines at HRB were wider than industry, pointing toward market share loss for the period. Per IRS data, industry assisted volumes fell 0.5% Y/Y through mid-July, slightly narrower relative to the 0.7% Y/Y decline in the 2019 tax season. Considering HRB saw a 2.8% Y/Y decline, however, it likely implies the company suffered share losses this time around. Management attributed the decline to widespread office closures during the latter months of the tax season in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, but the fact that HRB's professionally-prepared net average charge (i.e., pricing) also declined 0.7% Y/Y is a key negative.Within the Do-It-Yourself (DIY) tax prep category, on the other hand, HRB saw +11.5% Y/Y volume growth, driven mainly by a 53% Y/Y growth in Free File Alliance (vs. +8% Y/Y in Commercial DIY). In this regard, HRB's growth appears to be in line with market growth, though I would note the distorting influence of the IRS stimulus filers this tax season. Nonetheless, HRB's DIY pricing declined 4.4% Y/Y, highlighting its more assertive pricing approach to hold share. The approach seems that paid off for now – DIY retention increased c. 2%, and excluding the 7-8 million stimulus filers, the company held share as of quarter-end.On a more positive note, HRB's recent acquisition, Wave Financial, returned to growth, with its top-line rising c. 10% Q/Q. Considering its value proposition as a free platform to organize finances, the quick rebound is encouraging and, hopefully, points toward further synergy potential as the company begins to introduce the product to clients.Wave differs from existing solutions such as QuickBooks by offering a free, easy to use interface targeted at small business owners (vs. QuickBooks' accounting-focused interface). It also does, however, come with added charges for running payroll through the app. While I do acknowledge that Wave could be a driver of long-term upside, I struggle to see clear synergies at this point, with the increasingly competitive market also making it hard to justify the ROI.In light of the volume declines and pricing pressures in FQ1, I see HRB's long-term EBITDA margins moving lower from here. With share losses particularly acute in its assisted business, I see further pricing pressure as management more closely aligns pricing with value going forward. Much like in 2019, continued step-downs in pricing should reset margins structurally lower.Nonetheless, management continues to guide toward HRB's assisted pricing remaining resilient, as it sees pricing as well-aligned with the value provided based on customer surveys. Instead, it is guiding toward pricing increases in line with inflation over the coming years, which could prove optimistic. I would also point to HRB's stated intent to reinvest in the business via technology, facilities, and operations as potential margin detractors going forward. Near-term, I see EBITDA margins at HRB lurking below fiscal 2019 levels of c. 26% in a base case scenario, consistent with trends in assisted tax volumes.Having pulled its repurchase guidance for fiscal 2021, management has, encouragingly, resumed repurchases, but only to offset dilution from equity grants. Going forward, any additional repurchases will be opportunistic, with the focus still firmly on the dividend. Recall that in August, the company had already signaled toward flat dividend growth, with no plans to adjust the dividend payout for this fiscal year. It still aims to increase the dividend over the longer term, but with margins set to come under pressure, I am not as confident on the prospect of a dividend hike.Some of the cash flow has been allocated toward debt paydown - the company paid the full balance of its credit line this month and will return to its normal cycle of seasonal borrowings for this upcoming tax season. HRB also successfully refinanced its 5-year notes, exchanging them for 10-year notes at a lower 3.875% coupon.Source: H&R Block Presentation (Q1 2021)Net-net, I am neutral on HRB shares. I do agree that the valuation is more compelling at current levels, but I remain cautious about HRB's volumes and pricing pressures going forward, both of which will be key drivers of share performance. The market seems to largely agree with this view - sentiment on the name is cautious, as reflected by the discounted multiple. Considering the potential for a structural reset in margins following a challenging fiscal 2020 tax season, I remain cautious on the name despite the appealing c. 7% dividend yield."
4330924,104171,2020-03-10T12:21:48-04:00,H&R Block has shown up on my stock screener multiple years.A deeper looks explores the company deeper than what I screened for.Ultimately there is no growth catalyst for this company.,"H&R Block Inc. (HRB) is a company that has come up on my stock screens for the past couple years due to the company's high return on assets and lower price earnings ratio, two traits that I primarily look for in investment opportunities. Because H&R Block has come up a few times I wanted to look deeper into the company to see why this tax advisory business that generates high returns is trading at a relatively low valuation.Source: H&R Block WebsiteH&R Block, Inc. is a tax preparation service business that provides assisted income tax preparation, do it yourself (DIY) tax services, and various other income tax preparation products. The company operates in the United States, Canada, and Australia. H&R Block derives revenue from company owned retail locations, royalties from franchises, online service fees, and various other product sales.RevenuesSales at H&R Block have been stable over the past 5 years showing very little growth, if any. This past fiscal year reported revenue came in at $3.094 Billion which was a -2.1% in comparison to prior year. As can be seen in the table above revenue is down year over year but up 0.49% over the past 5 year span.The DIY segment saw revenue increase year over year of 7% due to a 5.9% increase in DIY tax return volume.For H&R Block in 2019 total worldwide tax returns increased 1.2% but the year over year revenue decline was attributable to changes in the pricing structure which offered lower prices for assisted returns. This is the largest issue with this company, the fact that the assisted returns segment is a laggard. The revenue from assisted returns accounts for 60.07% of all of H&R Block's revenue. With the majority of revenue coming from this segment it is hard to see the volume of assisted tax returns decrease every year. The table below shows just how bad these decreases in volume are. The company is holding up revenues every year by increasing pricing with some help from the increasing volumes in the DIY segment. As a note the DIY segment saw revenue increase year over year of 7% due to a 5.9% increase in DIY tax return volume.Financial StandingH&R Block has been showing up on my stock screens for a while primarily due to high return on assets. H&R has shown great ROA over the years with a 10 year average of 11.18%. In fiscal year 2019 the company reported an ROA of 13.12% with help of a very low tax rate in fiscal 2018 the company posted ROA of 21.02%.H&R has bad liquidity with a current ratio of 0.48x and a quick ratio of 0.39x as of most recent quarter. On that note the company is very highly leveraged with the debt to equity in the MRQ unable to be calculated do to negative stockholder equity. For a business that has no large growth catalyst and doesn't have high growth rates I would like to see way better financial standing.Source: Intuit WebsiteI wanted to also point out the scale of competition that H&R Block has. Because it seems that assisted tax returns won't be the growth engine for the company it is important to take a look at the competitive landscape for the growing DIY segment. The largest competitor in the DIY tax return space is TurboTax (INTU). Looking at Intuit's 2019 year end filing we can see the difference in scale of the segments. TurboTax creates revenue of $2.775 Billion for Intuit while H&R Block's DIY segment creates revenue of $260 Million. That means TurboTax as a whole is over 10x larger than H&R Block's DIY segment. Also just to note TurboTax has seen revenue growth of 11% over the past year while H&R Block DIY has had 7%. Not only is TurboTax have considerable market share but is also growing faster.ValuationAnother reason H&R Block has shown up on my screener so many times is the low valuation. If you use the 2019 diluted EPS of $2.04 the P/E right now is around 9.75x. With a P/FCF of 7.82x this stock looks to have a low valuation considering the ROA's.For my screens I only use a few criteria; high ROA, low P/E, and current ratio above 0.5x. H&R Block met all these requirements for a while and therefore I had to look deeper. After looking into this company I see why it is valued the way it is. With a lack of a growth catalyst and a very small market share in the growing DIY tax return space I do not see a great reason why H&R Block will succeed in the long run. Couple this with poor financial standing and that high return on assets doesn't mean much. In the end I decided not to pass on a purchase of H&R Block."
4334322,104099,2020-03-26T07:47:02-04:00,"In my estimation, there are many compelling reasons to buy H&R Block at these levels.The last time the shares traded at these levels, they went on to do very well. While history doesn't repeat, I think it certainly rhymes.For those still nervous about buying at these levels, I offer what I consider to be a great options trade.","Obviously 2020 has not been kind to shareholders of H&R Block (HRB) so far, with shares down about 45% since the beginning of January. When shares fall this far this fast, I obviously become interested, so I thought I'd review the name to see if it makes sense to buy or sell at these levels. For those who missed the title of this article, and who can stand neither the suspense nor my writing, I'd say that shares now represent great value. While I think buybacks have been a waste for this company as with so many others, management has been quite shareholder friendly in my estimation. I consider this to be a necessary precondition to investing, because an unfriendly management virtually guarantees a loss. In addition, I think the company has sufficient cash on hand to weather the current storm, and I think the dividend is reasonably safe. Most compelling of all, in my view, is the fact that the shares haven't traded at these levels for many years, and last time they traded at this valuation, they went on to do very well. For those who are still nervous about buying shares, I recommend a short put trade that I think offers investors a ""win-win."" I'll go through my arguments in greater detail below.There is a Canadian billionaire investor named Stephen Jarislowsky that I met years ago, and we talked for about 3 hours about investing, history, and the Anglo-Francophone relations in his home province of Quebec. I think one of his observations about the company Alcan can be applied to H&R Block. ""It's like a cork bobbing in the ocean...it's got little direction, but you can't sink it."" There's been little growth from H&R Block over the past several years, but I think the dividends are secure in light of the fact that the payout ratio remains consistently around 50%. It seems that some investors have been premature in calling for the death of H&R Block in the teeth of the DIY tax providers. I think this is a great investment for people who are interested in buying a relatively secure, boring, cash cow. In my estimation, ""boring"" is ideal, especially now that the dividend yield has breached 8%.Digging into the financial history here reveals some interesting findings. I know. It's odd to find financial history interesting. I have issues, obviously. Moving focus away from my various eccentricities, sales have grown very slowly at this firm for years. Specifically, H&R Block has managed to improve revenue at a CAGR of about .38% over the past six years. Unfortunately, net income has fallen at a CAGR of about 2% over the same period. That hasn't stopped dividends per share and earnings per share growing at CAGRs of 2.9%, and 3.8% respectively. This improvement in earnings per share in the face of dropping net income is obviously a function of a share buyback program, about which more below. The $2.766 billion buyback program is one of the ways in which management has returned capital to owners over the past seven years. They have also returned just under $1.39 billion to shareholders in dividends since 2014.Turning to the capital structure, it appears that cash on the balance sheet has deteriorated markedly since I last looked in on the name. This is relatively normal, given the seasonality of this business. For example, at the same time last year, cash was just over $203 million, and three months later it had climbed to $1.572 billion. For that reason, I think drawing conclusions about the health of the balance sheet from its current state would be naive. In addition, in spite of the fact that long term debt has grown at a CAGR of about 11% over the past 6 ¾ years, interest expense has been falling fairly dramatically over the past three years. This is obviously a function of lower lending costs. For my part, I'd like to see management reduce long term debt, obviously, but I don't think there's much risk of a credit or solvency crisis here anytime soon.I think the most recent nine months relative to the same period a year ago has been quite good in my estimation. Specifically, revenue and net income were up by 8.9% and 2.75% respectively, suggesting that worries about the imminent death of H&R Block are slightly exaggerated. Earnings per share have grown by just under 7%, and dividends are up by 4%.For me, the current market downturn has put a highlight on share buybacks. This is a problem with most companies I cover, but I'll pick on H&R Block as an example in order to make the broader point. When I was back in business school in the late 19th century, I was introduced to the idea that investors should be indifferent between receiving a dividend or having management plow the returns back into the company. I've also heard frequently that a share buyback is the same as a dividend. I disagree with this notion, and I'd like to use H&R Block as an example. Over the past 6 ¾ years, management has spent just over $2.76 billion on stock buybacks and reduced the shares outstanding by 81,753. This means that management bought these shares back at an average price of $33.84 per share. Had management left the number of shares constant, they could have returned this to shareholders and they could have consumed it. Six years ago, shares were trading at approximately $30, and they currently trade for just under $13. Had investors received the money that management spent on share buybacks, they would have received just over $10 in dividends. This, plus the dividends they've received over the past 6 ¾ years, would have meant that investors were closer to a breakeven than they currently are.In addition, there's something paternalistic about share buybacks, because it implies that management knows better than investors about how to spend their capital. Investors are owners of the enterprise, and therefore it should be run for their benefit. To deprive investors of the freedom to decide how to spend their profits is troublesome, and I think management should stop the practice immediately.Source: Company filingsI've said on at least a few occasions that there's a disconnect between underlying businesses and the stock that supposedly represents the fortunes of that business. In my estimation, stocks are actually very poor proxies for the health of the underlying enterprise, and the past few weeks have demonstrated that fact. In my view, investors have the opportunity to exploit the disconnect between the enterprise and the stock that supposedly represents that enterprise. I think price and value can remain unmoored for some time, but will inevitably meet at some future point. This means that investors can buy stocks when they are out of favor and ride them higher, or sell stocks that are very popular but overpriced.With that out of the way as a prelude, I want to try to work out whether the shares of H&R Block currently represent good value or not. In other words, I want to answer whether shares will eventually rise to match value. I make this determination in a host of ways, from the simple to the more complex. On the simple side, I look at the ratio of price to some measure of economic value like earnings, free cash flow and the like. I want the stock in question to trade at a discount to the overall market and to its own history. At the moment, I'd say shares of H&R Block meets these criteria, given that they're trade at a discount to the overall market and to their own history, per the following. While I don't believe history repeats, it certainly rhymes. I'd note that it's been about a decade since the shares were this inexpensive, and they subsequently went on to do very well over the next five years. H&R Block stock adds weight to the claim that the lower the price an investor pays for a stock, the greater will be their subsequent returns.Data by YChartsSource: YchartsIn addition to a simple ratio of price to economic value, I want to try to understand the assumptions embedded in the current price, and what that says about the market's expectations about future growth. In order to do this, I turn to the methodology described by Professor Stephen Penman in his book ""Accounting for Value."" In this book, Penman describes how an investor can use a standard finance formula, and isolate the ""g"" (growth) variable to work out what the market must be assuming about the company's future. Applying this to H&R Block suggests that the market is assuming the company will be bankrupt over the next 10 years. In my view, this is an excessively pessimistic forecast, and I like to find very pessimistic forecasts.In my view, now is a good time to buy H&R Block, but I can fully understand why an investor might have been a bit traumatized by market behavior over the past few weeks. For such people, I would recommend selling put options at strike prices that represent excellent value. I think such a trade represents a ""win-win"", because investors either pocket premia if the stock remains above the strike price, or the investor buys what I consider to be a great business at an even more attractive price.At the moment, my preferred short put is the October 2020 with a strike of $10. These are currently bid-asked at $.90-$1.50. If the shares find support at current depressed levels, the seller of these puts simply pockets the premium. If the investor sells at the bid and the shares continue to fall, the investor will be obliged to buy at a net price about 29% below the current level. Ceteris paribus, that represents a forward PE of ~4.5 times, and a dividend yield of about 11%. Note that these shares didn't reach that level during the slough of despond in 2008, and haven't changed hands at $10 since January of 2001.I think there's much to like about H&R Block. I dislike that it appears that management has overpaid for shares over the past six years, but H&R Block is hardly unique in this regard. The company has managed to grow revenues slightly over the past 6 ¾ years in spite of the encroachment of DIY tax solutions. In my experience, the market has assumed (wrongly) that H&R Block will go the route of Blockbuster because everyone will suddenly start doing their own taxes. In my estimation, doing taxes is an annual trauma akin to root canal. I think there'll always be customers willing to pay to offload the painishment of taxes to a professional. More compelling than the state of the business is the fact that the shares are trading for multi-year lows. The last time they traded at these levels, they went on to do very well over the next five years. For those who want an added advantage, I think short put options present a ""win-win"" trade at this point. As I wrote earlier, I think price and value can remain un-moored for some time, but at some point they will meet. I think investors would be wise to buy the shares and/or sell the put options mentioned above."

A misunderstood shift to digital tax preparation has spread concern to anybody lacking the time to understand the strength of the company’s competitive product offering, effectively relegating the company from portfolios. It doesn’t help that the company has struggled to grow in recent years, failing to garner any attention from investors that favor high flying technology stocks. Add on COVID-19 complications that closed many of the company’s locations, and it’s no surprise that the market has pushed the stock price well below the company’s intrinsic value.But there are still some of those archaic investigators known as value investors sifting through the fundamentals, shunned as they may be, that can identify a misunderstood company when they see one. Contrary to what many believe, H&R Block will benefit from the shift to digital tax preparation as the industry transforms into an oligopoly. Assisted tax preparation is not disappearing but rather blending with digital tools to offer tax payers more options and convenience. H&R Block now has a leading product offering and is the driver of that transformation, improving growth prospects. Value investors digging for mispriced assets will discover a dividend yield of 7% and potentially 100% upside for a high-quality company. It seems a lucrative time to consider H&R Block while others are not.We hear endless stories about how H&R Block is doomed because the world is shifting rapidly to Do-It-Yourself (DIY) digital tax preparation, eliminating the need for the company’s tax expertise. But the reality is quite the opposite. First of all, there isn’t a rapid decline in what has historically been referred to as assisted tax preparation like the kind you can get by visiting an H&R Block location. We challenge anybody to find a rapid decline in the chart below. There just isn’t one. It’s a trickle at worst. Assisted actually grew in 2 of the past 5 tax seasons. Even with COVID-19 rampant in the US, people scared to leave their homes and physical locations closed across the country, volumes in assisted tax preparation hardly moved. H&R Block CEO Jeff Jones summarized the situation nicely on their recent Q1 2021 earnings call,So assisted tax preparation is rather stable, contrary to popular belief.Source: H&R Block Investor Presentation, July 2020Second of all, there aren’t separate assisted and DIY categories anymore. The reality is that these two areas are blending together with both areas leveraging digital tools. The future of tax preparation is omnichannel. H&R Block leads the way in omnichannel tax preparation with features such as:So now assisted is often digital, and DIY blends into assisted should largely-independent filers find any of the company’s digital services helpful. It might not seem important that tax preparation now covers the whole spectrum from completely DIY to completely assisted as well as various ways to get help entirely in-person or entirely digital (or a combination of both), but it is critical to understand the implications of this new reality.H&R Block is the only major company offering a complete set of competitive solutions across the whole spectrum. So while many view the shift to digital as a death knell for the company, we see it as an incredible opportunity. Perhaps doubters aren’t aware that H&R Block has leading solutions in the digital space or that H&R Block actually has a higher market share in DIY than it does in assisted. Third-party accolades for the DIY product include a #1 rating in TheStreet.com’s rankings of the best online software and NerdWallet’s designation as the best software for simple returns. As the only complete service provider with a leading set of solutions, the outcome may very well be market share gains. That means growth, not decline. We don’t want to get investors too excited however. As we have seen, shifts in tax preparation tend to happen slowly. So we don’t see rapid growth coming from market share gains in the next couple years, but rather steady growth over the long term as smaller tax preparers unable to provide a competitive omnichannel solution will gradually be driven out of the market, in favor of H&R Block.Source: H&R Block Investor Presentation, July 2020Third of all, there seems to be a misconception about industry structure and H&R Block’s position in the industry. The assisted category is highly fragmented with most peers being unsophisticated and having limited resources. H&R Block is one of the only competitors large enough and with a big enough budget to offer the digital offering that is more and more desired in tax preparation, even for the assisted category. As such, H&R Block should have an easy time taking share from smaller competitors that simply can’t keep up, as we have seen with much of retail as it moves to omnichannel solutions and high technology requirements.The DIY category has low fragmentation with well-resourced peers. Using an oversimplified view, the DIY category is essentially just H&R Block and Intuit (INTU) with their TurboTax offering. Intuit is a disciplined competitor used to high levels of profitability and value creation. So the more that tax preparation moves to digital or DIY solutions, the more of an oligopoly the industry becomes and the more both Intuit and H&R Block will benefit. Intuit may also start gaining share in the assisted category as digital solutions invade the area (Intuit does not have physical locations like H&R Block), but that market share gain will be at the expense of smaller, ineffective competitors, not H&R Block. Essentially, the industry will continue to consolidate and “oligopolize” with H&R Block and Intuit being the big winners. We should note that H&R Block is currently smaller than Intuit in DIY, but gaining share in the space.The bottom line is that changes in the tax preparation industry are beneficial to H&R Block over the long term, contrary to popular belief.In a market dominated by momentum and growth, few are interested in low-growth value stocks like H&R Block. Most take the anemic growth of the last several years and project it into the future, as evidenced by consensus revenue estimates for fiscal year 2022 essentially at the 2018 level. But it’s important to review why growth has been limited in recent years to understand how it might look going forward. A closer analysis reveals that growth may surprise to the upside, albeit from low expectations, as past headwinds turn into tailwinds.One element of industry growth is increases in the total number of tax filings. The industry benefits from impressive stability in this area, but the long term CAGR close to 1% won’t raise too many eyebrows and should keep growth expectations reasonable.Source: H&R Block Investor Presentation, July 2020Ultimately, growth will be reliant on market share gains and price increases, as well as growth in adjacent businesses. If we look to the recent past, we can identify a number of headwinds that kept growth at H&R Block to a minimum.One such headwind is related to the growth in DIY and digitally assisted tax preparation. Intuit, with its TurboTax offering, got a head start in the DIY space as H&R Block was too complacent in developing and marketing a leading DIY product. The result has relegated H&R Block to a distant second place behind Intuit in DIY. And revenue growth was hampered by Intuit taking tax preparation market share as filers switched to their digital offering. But what was once a headwind is now a tailwind. H&R Block may have dropped the ball in the early phases of the conversion to DIY, but the company realized its mistake and pushed to make up for lost time. H&R Block now has a leading DIY offering as evidenced by third party accolades and also by market share gains and improved retention rates at the company. An internet search for tax preparation software makes it clear that H&R Block and Intuit provide the leading solutions for DIY tax preparation with reviewers such as NerdWallet, Cnet and TheStreet rating them highly. In the past, filers switching from assisted to digital, or simply new filers wanting to take the DIY path, ended up at Intuit and growth at H&R Block suffered. Going forward, it’s more likely that a larger and larger share of DIY filers end up at H&R Block, turning a headwind into a tailwind, especially since H&R Block has the advantage of offering physical locations in combination with its digital tools, something Intuit can’t match.Another recent headwind for growth at H&R Block has been pricing. In the DIY business, the company has been transparent about pricing competitively in the past to compensate for their offering being less developed compared to TurboTax. Now, H&R Block offers a leading DIY product, and thus their pricing policy may very well change going forward. Management doesn’t want to give away too much competitively sensitive information, but recent comments from CEO Jeff Jones on DIY pricing make things rather obvious from our perspective.Perhaps more importantly, the company has also cleared a pricing hurdle in the assisted business. Specifically, a pricing reset a couple years ago. A pricing reset hinders revenue and profit growth, but it is also a one-off event. After a period of stable pricing in the assisted business, it seems the company is ready to start using pricing as a growth lever again. CFO Tony Bowen lays out the situation quite clearly.Pricing going forward will likely cease to be a headwind, and perhaps even provide a powerful lever for growth.We should also mention that H&R Block has scope to accelerate growth through its recent purchase of Wave, a provider of accounting, finance and tax solutions for small businesses. Wave might represent a small portion of the overall business currently, but it offers opportunities for cross-selling and was growing revenue at over 40% prior to the pandemic.H&R Block has essentially turned its two major growth headwinds of market share losses and pricing pressure into tailwinds, and with the addition of Wave, growth may very well surprise to the upside.The steady nature of the tax preparation industry allows companies to carry a reasonable amount of debt, that is, unless a pandemic hits and cancels the tax season. Fortunately, H&R Block was able to navigate the challenges presented by a COVID-19 delayed tax season and has since strengthened its balance sheet. The company refinanced through a $650 million issuance of 10-year notes at a coupon of 3.875%. The company also signaled confidence in its financial position through the planned pay down of the entire amount of its line of credit and the restart of some share repurchases.And that leads us to the dividend. Investors currently get a safe yield of approximately 7%, which is not easy to find these days. The company’s most recent quarterly reporting provided some comfort for investors looking for reliable income. The company confirmed there is no plan to change the dividend payout level this fiscal year, and reconfirmed the goal to increase the dividend over the long term, having increased it 30% over the past five years.With a solid balance sheet and commitment to returning cash to shareholders, the 7% yield should be enough to spark interest. But the sales pitch gets more interesting when we look at valuation. We might be reaching for attention a bit with the 100% upside tagline in the title of this article, but we have little doubt that H&R Block is materially undervalued currently. To be clear, the company is undervalued even if the company fails to grow. Let’s assume H&R Block is a zero growth company. Benjamin Graham would assign an 8.5x PE multiple to such a company. History and consensus would agree that the company can reliably produce earnings per share of $2.5. So a share price of $21.25 and upside of over 50% from the current share price near $14 seems perfectly reasonable. But let’s assume H&R Block fulfills our predictions of low single digit growth through market share gains and price increases, and the market assigns it a deserved earnings multiple closer to 12x. We quickly get to a fair value of $30 indicating more than 100% upside from the current share price. In summary, investors can get a 7% yield with 100% upside, and still almost nobody seems interested.There are risks of course, including potential black swan events that dramatically change the industry. Just imagine if the US government decides to pursue Modern Monetary Theory aggressively and simply prints money instead of collecting taxes. We control for such risks by keeping position sizing below average, but recently increased our holding near current share price levels. We are long term investors happy to accept a 7% return while we optimistically wait for the 100% upside to materialize.Source: H&R Block Investor Presentation, July 2020The conclusion is short and sweet. H&R Block offers a 7% yield with 100% upside which is an attractive proposition compared to low-yielding bonds or overvalued growth stocks. Growth is likely to surprise on the upside as H&R Block levers its leading product offering to gain market share and increase prices while benefiting from its recent Wave acquisition. Longer term, the increasingly oligopolistic nature of the industry will be supportive. Barring a black swan event, the risks are manageable and value investors should considered a measured position in H&R Block."
4374103,103373,2020-09-14T10:31:18-04:00,"Trends in key metrics over the past three-year and 10-year periods don't show signs of sustainable growth.There's a stark mismatch between broader historical trends in tax filings and the economy in general when compared against HRB's key performance indicators.This stock is a HOLD, at best. If you have it in your portfolio, let it sit and keep collecting the dividends to help somewhat offset the massive capital depreciation.","H&R Block, Inc. (HRB) had a tumultuous Q4-20 due to the onset of the pandemic but seems to have bounced back in Q1-21 because of the delayed 2020 tax season. For that reason, a typically down quarter has suddenly turned into an apparently great start to the fiscal year 2020. And for the same reason again, it's nearly impossible to do an apples-to-apples comparison on a YoY basis. However, using a sort of workaround, we can identify certain metrics, trends, and indicators in the current period that offer sufficient information with which to make an investment decision. Of course, this will be combined with relevant historical data to further strengthen the thesis.Thesis: The company's growth trends don't match up to economic and other indicators that show reasonable-to-strong growth in the tax preparation industry. As such, I do not see H&R Block as an attractive investment even at this low price.The first thing I typically look for is the state of historical revenue growth over time. In the case of HRB, the bulk of revenues are typically earned in the company's fourth quarter, which ends on April 30. This makes it a logical starting point for the analysis. Unfortunately, due to the timing of the pandemic and the subsequent extension of the filing deadline, the revenue normally realized during the February to April period is now spread from February to July 2020.For that reason, I've combined data from Q4-19 with data from Q1-20 (Current Period), and data from Q4-20 with data from Q1-21 (Current - 1 or Current Minus 1) to have something comparable to work with. In addition, because of the fact that this was an unusual tax filing time-frame, I've also included figures from Q4-18 combined with data from Q1-19 (Current - 2 or Current Minus 2) so we have a three-year period to look at.Source: Data from Company FilingsLooking at the three periods, as described above, we see that revenues, net income, and earnings per share have all shown consecutive declines over the past three years. The revenue drop is relatively gentle but the bottom line shows sharp declines. Under normal circumstances, we could have accepted a year-over-year decline between Current -1 and Current Period as being a one-time event considering the impact of the pandemic. However, a steady 2-year decline in revenue, as well as earnings per share, calls for longer-term analysis.Keeping in mind that the data above is for half-year periods over the last three years, let's look even further back; but this time, at annual trends for the same metrics.Source: Data from Company FilingsThe 10-year period shows an even more troubling trend: that the top and bottom lines have been flat-to-down during a period when the U.S. economy enjoyed the ""longest economic expansion on record."" In general, when the economy is growing and unemployment figures are on the decline, it bodes well for the tax prep market because there are increasingly more people to file returns for.There's more context to that when you look at U.S. federal tax revenues for the last ten years, which have grown from $2.16 trillion to $3.46 trillion between FY 2010 and FY2019, as the table below shows.Source: The BalanceIn an economy where total federal taxes collected grew by 60% in a 10-year period, a company that claimed this in 2010...Source: HRB 2010 Annual Report...should have been able to grow its revenues and profitability at a reasonable pace between then and now.Further, if you look at the total number of federal tax returns filed, you'll see that the figure grew from 235.3 million for FY 2010 to 255.3 million for FY 2019, representing an increase of 8.5% over that 10-year period. Logically, we should at least see similar growth in HRB's own figures because we're not even including state filings. For some additional color around HRB's long-term trends, I looked at the total number of returns prepared by the company in the 10-year period between FY-01 and FY-10, which experienced about 73 months of expansion before the December 2007 peak that marked the beginning of the Great Recession. This period showed a 6.4% increase.Source: HRB 2010 Annual ReportThat's reasonably close to the 8.5% growth in overall federal returns filed, as reported by the IRS. However, that was the 10-year period prior to the last 10 years. Looking at HRB's total returns prepared between 2011 and 2020, we see negative growth, with the number going down from 24.5 million in FY-11 to 23.6 million in FY-19. That's a decline of 3.7%.Source: HRB 2011 Annual ReportThat means there are declines across the board that the company has not been able to effectively address in the last three years. And that trend is strongly validated by historical data even during periods when numbers should have been on the rise. In the last five years, the tax preparation industry as a whole has grown by around 1.3% per year. So, my question is this: where's that growth showing up in HRB's numbers? The only answer I can come up with is that it is not.Surprisingly, the stock continued to trade in a relatively loose range around the $25 mark between Q4-18 and Q2-20. Investors seemed to have stuck around for the dividends, presumably hoping that the key 2017 change in management would help turn things around.Now, however, the market seems to have given up hope, sending the stock tumbling back to where it was in early 2012, below the $15 mark as of this writing. Since the steep decline following the Q3-20 earnings call that sent it plummeting to $12, the stock has recovered slightly to around $15 as of this writing.One thing we'll need to keep in mind is that the 2021 tax season will follow the regular schedule, which means a double gain for HRB in FY-21. Nevertheless, if the trends of the past three years and the decade behind us is any indication, it's hard to see long-term or even medium-term growth possibilities. Unless a major acquisition happens between now and FY22, or the company suddenly starts seeing a sharp rise in new clientele during the next two tax cycles, it will be back to flat growth again. For investors to see any sustainable capital appreciation in the next two years, the company needs a game-changing event or strategy. An H&R Unblock, if you will.In light of the current economic contraction and the unpredictability around how long it will last, and taking the factors discussed above into consideration, I would recommend that existing investors simply hold on to their position and allow dividends to ease some of the pain from the hit the stock took when the pandemic disrupted the economy."
4333667,103866,2020-03-23T12:25:51-04:00,H&R Block is a boring company in a boring industry.H&R Block's stock is historically cheap.H&R Block trades at a significant discount to its most well known peer.Management is shareholder friendly.The value proposition is intriguing.,"They say the only sure things in life are death and taxes. Whether you buy into that adage or not, there is at least an element of truth to it. And with that as a backdrop, an investor would think a company like H&R Block (HRB) would be relatively immune to the wild volatility the market has been experiencing lately. Not the case. In fact, in the past three months, while the overall market has dropped 25.75%, H&R Block has seen its price tank to the tune of 37%. Let's dive into the details and see whether the recent free fall is justified or if just maybe, the recent drop presents us with a buying opportunity.IMAGE SOURCE: H&R BLOCKThe first part of that answer is easy. The entire market has tanked. So, clearly the coronavirus, which has affected almost everyone across the globe, can be blamed for much of the decline. In addition, the company did miss 3rd quarter earnings estimates, coming in with an adjusted loss of 59 cents per share. Finally, the company recently withdrew full-year guidance after the Treasury Department gave taxpayers a 90-day extension in response to the coronavirus pandemic.I will get into the coronavirus a little later and while I don't want to minimize the other two items mentioned above, I don't find them terribly concerning. First off, the third quarter is not the most important quarter for a company that provides tax preparation services. The two quarters that follow matter the most. Secondly, the earnings miss was the result of higher expenses but the reasons for those increased expenses do not foretell a long term trend. One of the reasons was increased one-time expenses related to the acquisition of Wave Financial. Another reason was simply the timing of the accounting recognition of the company's marketing spend. I don't like an earnings miss but I am not too shook up about those things.Finally, the 90-day extension will hit the fourth quarter significantly but in the big picture, it won't affect revenue. Those revenues will simply be shifted to Q1 of the next year.H&R Block stock currently trades at a price of $13.08. I believe that makes it a value play. However, before you decide if the stock is worthy of your investing dollars, we should take a look at the stock from three different angles. These are the factors I suggest looking at:Coronavirus:The coronavirus matters. My goodness, it matters. In a matter of five weeks, the virus has effectively rocked 90-95% of the stocks on the publicly traded exchanges. Interestingly, H&R Block, a boring company in a predictable industry, has been hit harder than most. The chart below shows that H&R Block has dropped six percent more than the overall market since the market peak on Feb. 12th.Data by YCharts5 Week Price Change: Data Source: Y-ChartsThis is a good time to come right out and say I am not calling a bottom on the overall market. I don't think anyone really knows when the market will find a definitive bottom. The virus could wreak havoc on the economy for another month or it could be closer to a year. I generally like to look at investments with a two or three-year time horizon so as we look at the other two factors, I will both take the last five weeks out of the equation and then look at a reasonable valuation two years from now.Recent vs. Historical ValuationH&R Block currently carries a PE of 6.42. However, to be true to my word and to take the coronavirus out of the equation, at least for this metric, I looked at the five years before the coronavirus began. The chart shows that historically, the price to earnings ratio for HRB has trended around 15 and the forward PE has been in the 12-13 range. As of Feb. 12th, both metrics were significantly lower, indicating the stock may be in value territory.Data by YChartsHistorical Valuation Trends for HRB Data Source: YChartsValuation vs PeersH&R Block really has one notable publicly traded peer, which is Turbo Tax parent Intuit. (INTU) The chart below shows that Intuit has been trading at a valuation rough five times higher than H&R Block. Now, Intuit does have about double the revenue and it is normal for a larger company to trade at a little of a premium. However, little is the operative word. Intuit is trading at a 500% premium to H&R block when we look at the most commonly used valuation measures. By contrast, Home Depot(HD) which reports about twice as much revenue as Lowes(LOW) carries a valuation premium of 15%. The Intuit premium or H&R Block discount seems very disproportionate.Data by YChartsH&R Block Valuation vs Intuit Data Source: YChartsConservative investors who like a steady income stream may also be attracted to H&R Block's dividend and capital return policy. The stock company currently pays a 7.05% dividend and has increased its dividend to the tune of 30% over the past four years. In addition, the company has repurchased 15% of its outstanding shares in the last three years. The company certainly does have shareholders in mind when it comes to capital allocation.Image Source: H&R BlockThe market has been in a free-fall for five weeks and for a good reason. I am not arrogant enough to claim I can call a bottom. I don't think anyone can. However, I did start a small position Friday and am inclined to add a little more when market volatility seems ready to tame. When you are ready to put money to work, there is a lot to like here.In H&R Block, you are getting a company with predictable revenue streams that has gained market share two years in a row. It trades at a significant discount to its industry and pays a generous dividend. It also trades at a significant discount to its historical valuation. If the company can simply maintain earning of $2.04 for two years and the market applies a PE of 10, The stock will be trading at $20.40. That represents a 56% gain from today's price.Taxes aren't fun. Taxes are boring. But when you are ready to invest, this stock is worth exploring."
4311130,76005,2019-12-06T15:13:03-05:00,H&R Block has a strong positioning and compelling products to compete well in the tax preparation industry.H&R Block is a cash generating machine with a solid balance sheet.A valuation of 7.0x EBITDA is reasonable and makes HRB stock a compelling investment idea.,"Before I start, I'd like to thank my good friend RG for bringing H&R Block (HRB) to my attention.HRB is a strong company that not only generates boatloads of free cash flow, but also carries a well-capitalized balance sheet along with a strong track record of shareholder friendly returns of capital (via dividends and buybacks).HRB plays in the tax preparation services industry, which is currently under disruption. But HRB has a fairly strong competitive positioning that should allow them navigate the choppy waters. HRB appears to be a compelling investment opportunity for many reasons.Photo credit: GlassdoorOne key reason to like HRB is the necessity nature of its services. Everyone has to do their taxes, and that means HRB should have a durable demand during most economic periods (booms and recessions). Moreover, HRB is particularly compelling as the economic cycle is likely entering the late stages.The bread and butter of H&R Block is tax preparation services. The tax preparation industry may be mature, but it’s not going away anytime soon. Demand for tax preparation services has been fairly steady because the US tax code is too complex for most people to handle their taxes without any form of assistance.Whether assistance is a matter of doing it online or having it done by someone else, it’s safe to assume people will need help. H&R Block is well positioned to help customers with online DIY (do-it-yourself) software, virtual assistance, and thousands of brick and mortar locations with over 7,500 enrolled agents and CPAs.That’s one of H&R Block’s competitive advantage over other tax preparation services. Even though the personally assisted business may not grow as much anymore (as more people choose the convenience of online filing), other services (online and virtual assistance) will probably grow. H&R Block does offer compelling value for DIY online filers as well as for virtually assisted filers. I’ve tried their online filing service, and it’s just as easy to use as Intuit’s TurboTax.The images below show pricing of H&R Block and TurboTax. Note the pricing differential is favorable to H&R Block. Additionally, new technology features (such as drag and drop) could make easier to switch to H&R Block. The point is that for cheaper price, H&R Block offers pretty much the same service as TurboTax.Source: H&R BlockSource: TurboTaxIn particular, it is the virtual segment that can prove to be a competitive advantage as it allows customers to tap into H&R Block’s large network of professionals. Furthermore, integration of the recent acquisition of Wave could lead to incremental virtual customers.Source: H&R Block’s investor presentationAn argument I heard about HRB is that the tax code will get simpler. Some say that Trump tax cuts has made the code simpler. So, people won’t require as much help anymore. In addition to Trump’s tax cuts, the argument can be extrapolated into the future by simply assuming future tax code simplifications will cause even less need for tax preparation assistance. The political climate changes all the time. Politicians usually pitch simpler tax codes. Some deliver.That’s a risk to H&R Block, but there are obvious reasons to easily dismiss that risk. Over long-time periods, the US tax code has grown more complex, not simpler. That’s a fact. And the code will probably keep on getting more complex due to a simple reason that is best explained by the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center:Source: Tax Policy CenterSimplicity isn’t a high enough priority, as it turns out. Simplicity often loses to “deliver benefits for specific group and industries”, which by itself means more complexity in the US Tax System.The financial position of H&R Block is in good shape. Since tax season is just around the corner, most of this fiscal year’s profits will be derived in the upcoming US tax filing season that will last until April 15, 2020.Last fiscal year (ended in April 30, 2019), H&R Block generated $799M of EBITDA, producing approximately 25.8% EBITDA margin. Margins are probably going to stay flat (or slightly decline) due to the near-term integration of Wave HQ. But revenues are likely to grow.Last fiscal year, H&R Block generated $607M of cash flows after paying interest and taxes (a big chunk of which was invested in Wave HQ). H&R Block is a cash generating machine and that’s unlikely to change. Again, the necessity nature of the services causes demand to be stable. H&R Block is friendly with this cash, and pays a nice dividend that yields ~3% as of this writing. And often reinvest capital into the business via stock repurchases.H&R Block runs with a strong balance sheet that can withstand the technology disruption in tax preparation services. The balance sheet is a big positive factor for the stock to maintain its value over the long-run. As H&R Block invests to meet the needs of all potential customers, having balance sheet capacity to make such investments is a must. It can make all the difference.The latest example of the balance sheet strength is the acquisition of Wave HQ (formerly Wave Financial) that allowed them to pivot into a new business without betting the farm on it. H&R Block paid $405M from cash on hand for Wave HQ, which was approximately 8.1x revenue. The balance sheet easily absorbed this acquisition.The core business has plenty of capacity to manage total debt of ~$1.5B. HRB carries a fairly safe interest coverage ratio of 11x and D/EBITDA ratio of 1.9x (based on $799M of EBTDA previously discussed). HRB carries a manageable 23% debt to total capitalization. Unrestricted cash to total debt ratio stands at 41%. A big debt maturity of $650M (due October 2020) could be serviced by cash and credit line if needed, but that debt is likely going to be refinanced. All these ratios mean the balance sheet is in great shape. Bankruptcy is extremely unlikely, unlike many of the other retailers one could find near an H&R Block store.HRB valuation is fair at 7.0x last fiscal year’s EBITDA. I wouldn’t call it a deep value stock. But it is by no means an expensive stock either.Source: author's computationsThe resiliency of tax preparation business should cause profits to be stable over the next few years, and slowly increase over the long-term. H&R Block's products are easy to use, accurate in tax preparation, and have a price advantage over a key competitor.In addition, H&R Block is a cash generating machine with a solid balance sheet. A valuation of 7.0x EBITDA is reasonable and makes HRB stock a compelling investment idea."

Click here to find out more »H&R Block (HRB) is trading around 35% below its intrinsic value. I have calculated an intrinsic value of approximately $40 per share (currently priced around $24-$25). The stock is mispriced due to a poor outlook on assisted tax return demand, but HRB's ability to generate free cash flow (FCF), new strategy, and stable dividend have set it up for long-term success.HRB provides tax preparation services to millions of individuals each year (mainly in North America). The company offers assisted, DIY, and virtual tax preparation services. These services are provided through company and franchise offices, or online using their internally developed tax preparation services.Total revenue for FY19 (which ended on 4/30/2019) was $3.1B, with EBITDA of $783M (25% margin). The company has grown revenue at a CAGR of 0.4% over the last five years. For FY19, HRB lowered the cost of their assisted tax preparation services to increase volume. This change led to lower revenues in FY19 (4.5% lower YoY than FY18). U.S. Assisted tax returns accounted for 60% of HRB's revenue in FY19, which is down from 63% in FY18. HRB currently trades at approximately 12 times (TTM) earnings and has a TTM dividend yield of approximately 4.1%.Over the past five years HRB has significantly underperformed the S&P (HRB; -7.2%, S&P; 48%) when adjusted for both dividends and splits. The main driver of underperformance is the decline in U.S. Assisted tax filings (13.6M in FY14 to 11.8M in FY19). HRB's struggles led to a change in management; Jeffrey Jones was appointed as CEO in August 2017. He previously worked as an executive, focusing on marketing, at companies such as Target, Coca-Cola, and GAP.Since Mr. Jones joined HRB, a review of the pricing structure was undertaken and on Oct. 27th, 2018, they announced the following strategy changes:The change in strategy was expected to lead to a decline in revenue for FY19, and this proved true with a decrease of 4.5% (4% of this decrease was directly related to the pricing structure). In addition, the strategy did not increase the number of U.S. Assisted filers (decreasing from 11.8m in FY18 to 11.6m in FY19).HRB currently trades at very low multiple in relation to some of its main competitors: Intuit Inc. (owns TurboTax and QuickBooks) trades at 45x TTM earnings, whereas HRB trades at 12x.I believe HRB is imperfectly priced for the following reasons:1. Change in strategyThe impact of the change in strategy, and its effect on long-term growth for U.S. Assisted volumes, is being underappreciated by the market. Management was right about the need for a change in strategy as U.S. Assisted returns, which makes up over 60% of its revenue, had become overpriced in relation to the competition. The average charge for U.S. customers dropped from $241 in FY18 to $231 in FY19 (4.2% decrease). The short-term drop-in revenue for FY19 was required to reset the market's perception of their offerings. I expect volumes to be flat, or slightly increase in FY20 as the price reductions continue to take effect.2. Consistent FCFHRB has historically generated consistent positive operating cash flows for shareholders, and I expect this to continue. EBITDA margins may be squeezed due to the acquisition of Wave (which is cash flow negative), but management expects cost cuts to offset the majority of these losses. In the last three years HRB has generated $1.6B of FCF, and management has allocated this capital effectively through shareholder distributions (dividend yield of over 4%) and smart business acquisitions (see below). The current market capitalization of the HRB is around $5B, meaning that HRB is currently trading at an average of 10x FCF TTM. The average FCF multiple for HRB's peers is 17.7x. The difference in these ratios appears very large, even if the market is expecting negative growth moving forward.3. Industry characteristicsThe tax return preparation industry has ""sticky"" customers who tend to stay with the service provider they previously used (like switching banks, the time and effort required to change isn't usually worth the cost for customers). This may well have led to HRB sticking with their old business model for longer as the poor strategy was slow to impact their financial performance. This is a positive now as the stock is priced with the expectation of negative growth going forward. I'd expect volumes to slowly rise, or be flat, in the same way the poor strategy slowly lowered volumes (volumes for U.S. Assisted have fallen at a CAGR of 2.8% from FY14 to FY19). The price reductions slowed this decrease in volumes (FY18 - FY19 saw a 1.8% drop in volumes). I believe we'll move closer to flat volumes in FY20 for U.S Assisted.4. Smart acquisitionsThe Wave acquisition (although not cheap at 8x revenue) adds long term value by allowing HRB to gain exposure to a fast-growing industry (small business software solutions). It also gives them the opportunity to offer tax services to current and future Wave customers. Wave currently has 400,000 active users, and I expect this to grow significantly over the forecast period (through FY25). The acquisition also makes sense strategically; HRB is gaining access to a growing user base that will utilize tax return services (most likely assisted). This will allow HRB to filter the small business users from the Wave platform towards their tax offerings without cannibalizing any of their own business; I expect this to be a longer-term play with growth beginning in FY21.Main catalysts over the next 12-18 months are:1. Strong economic performance and positive commentary by management in relation to the Wave acquisition.The acquisition of Wave for $405M represents approximately 15% of HRB's market cap, and therefore, the performance of Wave will have a significant impact on the future economic performance of HRB.Potential scenarios for Wave (numbers below are on a per share basis): Wave operates as a small cap software company and has been modeled with the following assumptions:i. Used revenue as the basis of the valuation as Wave is cash flow negative, and then grown that revenue at a constant rate over the forecast period (through FY25). Base case: 20%Due to limited information available on Wave's growth rate it is hard to estimate, but companies such as Xero and QuickBooks, who operate in the same industry as Wave have been growing their business at around 30% annually.ii. Applied an exit multiple at the end of the forecast period. Base case: 5.0xSmall cap software companies in the U.S have been trading at around 4.0x - 5.0x. Due to Wave's established revenue, and being in a high growth industry, a multiple at the high end of that range has been selected. There is potential for significant upside here if the integration of Wave beats HRB's and the market's expectations.iii. Discounted the value back to today. Base case: 9%WACC used for our DCF model (see below for reasoning).For the base case, using the assumptions above, I've computed a per share value of $2.31 (market cap of $450M after discounting) for Wave.Source: Created by author using data from model2. Lowering U.S. Assisted prices leads to an increase in return volumes and revenues.FY20 earnings release will have a large impact on the stock price as HRB is a seasonal business. The company operates at a loss for three quarters, and then makes over 100% of its profit for the year in 4Q. This makes it hard for the market to see how HRB has performed until it releases its full year results. If 4Q earnings shows an increase in volumes for U.S. Assisted tax returns, with positive management commentary, I'd expect to see a resetting of performance expectations by analysts moving forward. The market is currently pricing the stock assuming slightly negative growth, and any outperformance should fall to the bottom line due to their ability to turn revenue into earnings; EBITDA margins have averaged 28% over the last three years, and operating cash flow yield is approximately 12% for FY19.Valuation of HRB has been performed using a DCF model. The following base case assumptions have been used:Below is the output P&L table from the model for three historical years and the forecast period (six years):Source: Created by author using data from modelHere is a sensitivity table based on WACC and terminal growth rate:Source: Created by author using data from modelThe analysis is highly sensitive to both WACC and the terminal growth rate. However, even if a negative 2% terminal growth rate is used, the stock still appears underpriced based on the DCF analysis.Top risk factors identified include:1. Strategy change does not increase volumes as expected and revenue continues to drop.If the lowering of prices does not increase U.S. Assisted volumes, and they fall significantly from FY19 levels, this would fall into our worst-case scenario (4% drop in U.S assisted and 0% growth in other revenue throughout the forecast period). This would lead to a loss of confidence in HRB and its ability to hold market share moving forward.Even given this scenario, the solid dividend yield (approximately 4%) and FCF discussed above put a high floor on the stock (around $20 a share).2. Wave acquisition becomes a drain on the FCF the company currently creates for its shareholders.The Wave purchase is a strategic acquisition by management that has allowed the company to access a fast-growing industry. The purchase price of $405M (8x projected revenue) looks expensive on the surface, and if not managed correctly it could lead to a drain on HRB's operating cash flow. As mentioned above, the strong FCF is what keeps the floor on this investment idea high, so a significant deterioration in this area will lead to a large drop in the stock price.3. There is a decline in demand for assisted tax preparation as consumers move towards online DIY tax solutions.This is probably the largest risk factor in determining HRB's value. As 60% of HRB's revenue is generated through assisted returns it will be majorly affected by a decline in the size of the assisted return industry. The reliance on this revenue stream is trending downwards, but it will still be the main driver of HRB's success over the next five to ten years. Software solutions have been increasing their efficiency and have started to cut into the assisted tax preparation industry. In addition, the changes in tax law (TCJA), which has doubled the standard deduction, has simplified a significant number of individuals returns, and could lead to a significant drop in their need to seek in-person advice.HRB stock does come with risk. Any turnaround story is going to be a battle against the odds, but I believe there is an opportunity here where the risk is worth the potential upside. With strong cash flow keeping the floor on the stock high, and the opportunity for growth moving forward with the acquisition of Wave, I believe this stock can perform strongly over a three to five-year time horizon."
4293913,104099,2019-09-27T12:40:34-04:00,I think the shares of H&R Block are trading at a significant discount to their worth at the moment.I think investors should do what some talented institutional investors have recently done and buy.The short put strategy I wrote about last January worked out very well. I offer a very similar trade for investors here.,"Since writing my most recent bullish piece on H&R Block Inc. (HRB), the puts I suggested selling expired worthless, which was quite good. The shares rallied into the summer, but have since dropped quite a bit back in price, and are now down ~5.5% since I last wrote about the business. I thought I'd look in on the name to see if I should hold, buy more, or take my losses. I'll go through the analysis by updating the financial history, and by looking at the stock itself. Once again, I'll recommend an options trade that I think offers the best risk/reward for investors. I'll also offer an appeal to authority.The financial history of the firm remains relatively impressive, and it seems that fears of a simplification of the American tax code harming the business were perhaps overblown. Both revenue and net income have remained somewhat stable over the years, in spite of the continued existence of various DIY tax solutions.In my view, management at H&R Block is quite shareholder friendly, in light of the fact that they've returned ~$3.8 billion to shareholders over the past 6 ¼ years ($2.5 billion of this came from stock buybacks, the balance from dividends). A shareholder friendly management is critical in my view, because an unfriendly management virtually guarantees a disappointing outcome. In any case, the combination of share buybacks and constantly growing dividends has allowed the dividend per share to grow at a CAGR of ~3.9% over the past seven years, and for EPS to grow at a CAGR of 2.9%. All of this in spite of relatively flat net income.Turning quickly to the capital structure, the balance sheet is in great shape in my view. The reason I think this is because cash on hand typically dwarfs the amount of long-term debt. Although we're currently in a seasonal low level of cash on the balance sheet, it still represents ~41% of long-term debt. Although fully 40% of debt is due in 2020, I don't anticipate the company having any problems to repay or refinance at that time.Source: Company filingsA wonderful business can be a terrible investment if you overpay for it. If the shares have too much optimism embedded in the price, any future hiccup will cause them to drop, and for that reason, I like to mitigate risk by buying when the market is excessively pessimistic. At the very least, we likely won't be disappointed if some bad news comes in. At the moment, I think the shares are priced relatively pessimistically, where investors are paying only 13 times free cash flow. While history may not repeat, it certainly rhymes, and I would point out that the last time the shares traded at these multiples, they went on to do quite well, per the chart below.Source: GurufocusIn addition to looking at simple price to free cash, I also unbundle the assumptions the market is making about the future growth of the company. The way that I do this is by employing the methodology outlined by Professor Stephen Penman in his excellent book ""Accounting for Value."" In this book, Penman takes a fairly standard finance formula, and, using the magic of grade 10 algebra, isolates the ""g"" (growth) variable to work out what the market must be assuming about future growth. At the moment, the market seems to be assuming that H&R Block's long-term growth rate is about 2%. I consider that to be a reasonable assumption about growth embedded in the shares going forward.I think one of the many reasons I don't get invited to parties much anymore relates to the fact that I can be a bit of a broken record. It's a fair criticism, because when I get an idea I like to share it ... repeatedly. I'm about to do the same. It is the case that not all investors are created equal. Many people, by virtue of their training or emotional disposition are simply better at this activity than the rest of us. Thankfully, filings allow us to follow their activities, and I think we would be wise to make ourselves aware of their actions. After all, if an investor with the skill of a Buffett or a Greenblatt disagrees with you, you would be wise to find out why before risking capital. At the same time, being on the same side of the table as one of these people may help investors sleep at night.All that said, I would point out that Greenblatt made his first purchase of H&R Block this past June, and now owns 7,318 shares. In addition, Richard Pzena has been adding to his position and now owns ~11,900 shares. Finally, First Eagle Investment owns fully 5,670,746 as of the most recent filing (though I should point out that First Eagle has been reducing exposure in 2019). In my view, the actions of insiders or institutional investors are not sufficient reason to buy a given name, but they act as great confirmation. I'd rather be on the same side of the table as these people than opposite them.In my previous article about H&R Block, I suggested an options trade that turned out to be quite profitable, and I think there's a similar opportunity at this point. The interesting thing about short options here is that they set up what I consider to be a win-win trade. If, as I suspect, the shares rise from these levels, the investor simply pockets the premium as we did with the short puts I wrote about in my previous article. If the shares decline from these already depressed levels, the investor will be obliged to buy, but at a very advantageous price that I think guarantees a good long-term return.At the moment I favor the H&R Block April 2020 puts with a strike of $21. These are currently bid-asked at $.95-$1.10, having last traded hands at $1.05. If the investor simply takes the bid and is eventually obliged to buy, they will be doing so at a price about 15% below the current market price. Such a price will drive the dividend yield north of 5%.I remain bullish on H&R Block. The company continues to chug along, in spite of all of the fears I've heard about DIY taxation doing away with the need for this business. In addition, management treats shareholders very well. Also, there's little risk from the balance sheet in my view. In addition, the shares are priced with an assumption of only 2% growth going forward, which I consider to be very reasonable. Also, the last time they were priced this inexpensively, the shares went on to perform quite well. The shares also have some support from some very talented institutional investors. Finally, for those nervous about buying this 4% yielding stock, I would recommend making some money in the options market. This worked out well before, and I think will work out well again. I think there's a 20-25% upside in these shares from these levels, and I think investors would be wise to buy while that opportunity lasts."
4273053,71655,2019-07-01T21:07:24-04:00,"H&R Block is a solid play for an income investor with around a 3.73% yield at current levels.The firm recently acquired Wave, which will benefit H&R Block long term. It plays into larger macro trends of increased freelancers and small businesses. Also the increased digital migration.H&R Block has also increased its digital offering in a number of other different areas, which has helped it attract new clients and retain them, leading to earnings growth.","HRB has a number of catalysts moving forward that make the company a buy. This includes improved digital products, the acquisition of Wave, which is positive for the company moving forward, and a healthy 3.73% dividend.DigitalHRB is continuing to added new virtual offerings which have grown 75%. This has attracted new clients to HRB and therefore further increased earnings. HRB has reported strong financial results recently and an improved offering digitally has been a reason for this. H&R Block is the only taxation company that has been able to serve customers no matter how little or much help they want. An example of a virtual product is the Tax Pro Review for DIY consumers who want an expert review before submitting their tax return. This has seen a 40% increase in new clients. This highlights how HRB has been able to report strong financial results recently, and an improved offering digitally has been a major reason for this. HRB also released a mobile first fully assisted experience called Tax Pro Go. This has been popular with the younger higher income filers, and is the easiest way for consumers to have an expert prepare their taxes.Wave AcquisitionHRB made a solid long-term focused acquisition by acquiring Wave. The acquisition expands H&R Block’s market. The acquisition was funded by cash mainly and is great for the company moving forward for a number of reasons. The acquisition expands HRB’s reach within the large and growing small business market. There are 57 million freelancers in the US, with 87 million expected by 2027 (half of the work force). There are also 31 million small businesses with 100k new ones a month. Wave offers a product for them to easily sort out their tax and accounting work. This includes with their cash flow, bookkeeping, payroll and tax preparation. The platform therefore helps with the future, which accelerating their small business strategy by allowing the cross selling of HRB products to Wave’s huge database of clients. This will attract new tax business. The result will be increased revenue for HRB moving forward. At the moment, it’s expected that 3% of total HRB comes from Wave. However when you factor in future earnings, Wave’s long term appeal and the ability to cross-sell, Wave is a huge acquisition for HRB moving forward.Dividend & Share RepurchasesHRB itself has a solid balance sheet to fund its dividends. There is $1.6 billion in cash at the end of the year. This has allowed the firm to have an on-going share repurchases program. This has led to $7.9 million shares being bought for $185 million at an average of $23.51. This included 3 million shares at $75 million in the fourth quarter.HRB is also a solid dividend play. There is a current yield of 3.73% with a respectable payout ratio of 53%. HRB is a good stock for an investor looking for dividends. This is because the company has consistently grown dividends over the long term. This has included a 5.4% annual growth rate in dividends over the past 10 years alone. This makes HRB a solid dividend play.There is a continued plan to return money to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. This is balanced by strategic long term investments like Wave, while maintaining a strong capital position. We believe this makes HRB a good company to buy, especially if there are any dips. It’s going to keep returning money to shareholders, leading to a better EPS in the long term.The tax preparation space is highly competitive and there is a risk of competitors taking up HRB’s market share. However, I would counter this by saying that HRB has built up a substantial reputation, that gives it an economic moat over competitors. This highlights reputation risk, HRB has to continue the stellar reputation that it has. In addition to this it is in a position to compete with the emerging online competitors in the long term with its acquisition of Wave. The business by nature is highly cyclical, with most of the revenue earned at the end of the financial year.Overall HRB is a strong investment for an income investor with a 3.73% yield. The firm has a number of catalysts going forward in the digital space and from its acquisition of Wave. The firm will continue to increase EPS through its share repurchases."
4221924,104099,2018-11-13T20:10:07-05:00,"Shares of H&R Block are up about 27% since I wrote my bullish article about the company a few months ago.I found the first-quarter results to be uninspiring.In spite of that, the shares are much more expensive on a price-to-free cash flow basis than they were months ago. This may be driven by share buybacks.Given the valuations in the overall market, and given the capricious nature of buybacks, I'm growing very cautious on the name. I'm taking my money and running.","Those who follow my stuff know that a key component of my investment strategy involves taking advantage of undue pessimism amongst investors. A business may have a well-publicized challenge, and this alone causes people to eschew the stock. People avoid it thinking, “I wouldn’t buy that company because of X,” as if they alone know about the problem and that the market hasn’t priced in the challenge already.I want to find companies where the market has more than priced in problems, as these can be profitable mispricings. H&R Block (NYSE:HRB) was an example of such a mis-pricing. I recommended that people buy it a few months ago, based on ridiculously pessimistic forecasts, and the stock is up 27% since then. The criticisms of my stance back then were almost comical. They could be summed up by: “DIY technology has moved fast.” The presumption that someone who disagrees with them is simply unaware is astounding. (“Really?! What is this ‘internet’ of which you speak?” “Soft...ware? Please slow down! My head’s starting to hurt!”). I’m a victim of a Canadian education, but even I am aware of some of these trends and am willing to buy anyway if the crowd is pessimistic enough.Just like I try to take advantage of excessive pessimism, I also think it wise to take advantage of excessive optimism. This is why I’m selling my H&R Block shares. I’ll go through my reasoning below by looking at the financial statements that have been released since June and by looking at the stock itself.Since I published my article, H&R Block has released its financials. Although I didn’t expect much, as this is a slow time of the year for the firm, I was unpleasantly surprised. In particular, relative to the same period a year ago, net loss for the quarter ballooned in spite of growing revenues. Loss per share is 17.5% higher, in spite of a rather large share repurchase during the quarter (bringing the share count to just over 205 million).I think it was wise of management to buy back shares during the quarter, as they were underpriced, but I don’t like the company's financial performance. Also, I think the recent uptick in the share price may be a direct consequence of this share buyback, which makes me wonder what will happen if this source of demand goes away.(Source: Company filings)Given my process, I need to review the behavior of the stock as a thing distinct from the underlying business. Obviously, if a sustainable business is priced as though it’s going bankrupt, the stock is probably a good bargain.(Source: GuruFocus)On a price-to-free cash flow basis, the stock is about 17.5% more expensive than it was when I first wrote about it on this forum. It’s still inexpensive by historical standards, but the confluence of simpler tax codes and improved software may... I repeat, may... mean that the future doesn’t resemble the past. In my view, there’s a real chance that we’re in a new regime, and that the market will apply a lower multiple to this company going forward.I’m quite prepared to admit to my fellow longs that I may be leaving money - perhaps a great deal of money - on the table, but I have a process, and over time it’s served me well. In my view, HRB shares are no longer “pessimistically priced,” and for that reason I’m selling them. The company's financial results in the first quarter were uninspiring, in my view, and therefore, there’s little reason to hold at these levels. I’m also concerned about what will happen if there’s a significant drop in the broader market over the next six months. For these reasons, I’ll be taking my profits in H&R Block, and will buy back in if the shares return to a more pessimistic level."
4296826,56142,2019-10-16T12:22:22-04:00,A more complicated U.S. tax code is coming if the Democrats win next year's election.H&R Block is quite inexpensive and priced for zero growth.Free cash flow generation is underappreciated by Wall Street.Stock selling momentum the past three months appears to be fading.,"“Nothing in life is certain, but death and taxes!” is the tag line we have all heard repeated in various forms throughout history.Of course, the U.S. tax code is continually being tweaked by Congress, the President, regulators, plus state and local governments. H&R Block (HRB) was founded 60 years ago to help individual taxpayers get through the maze of rules and laws enacted each year. Why not have someone trained in tax code changes review your income tax filing each year, to get the full refund entitled by law into your bank account (or lowest tax payment to the IRS)? Block is the largest tax preparing firm for individuals in the U.S. with 23 million returns filed in 2019.Over the years, H&R Block has used its steady cash flow generation from its core individual and small business tax return operations to venture into sometimes unrelated fields. It has invested in the online computer access business, banking operations, and larger company accounting entities. While the arguments for each seemed somewhat reasonable at the time, H&R Block was not able to run them successfully, and eventually sold them over the decades. In total, Block's efforts to diversify since the 1990s have held back its core operations and focus. For investors, the stock price today is not much different than 2001.The final large non-core banking unit was sold in 2015. Block's stock price was turning around and rising nicely, with Wall Street repricing the company based on the income and growth prospects of the tax return business alone. The share quote was $37 in early 2016.Then came President Trump. Trump campaigned on a simpler tax code in 2016 that would put H&R Block ""out of business."" Again in 2017, he mentioned the reform goal of a one or two-page tax return for many Americans specifically hurting Block's operations. Republicans moved to simplify taxes for the little guy in 2017-18. The changes were an effort to make filing your individual income tax returns something you could do at home, without a tax preparer. The fear for H&R Block investors was the new simpler tax code would mean far fewer customers and revenues.The table below highlights the change in revenues from tax reform between 2017-19. Fiscal 2019 revenues (ending April 30) from Tax Preparers, boxed in red, fell 5% from 2018 and 2% from 2017 levels. Nevertheless, a nice uptick in sales from U.S. taxpayers directly loading through and filed by H&R Block computers has appeared for several years. Plus, extra fees collected for security and identity guarantees have offset much of the decline attributed to simplified tax codes. The positive growth is highlighted with green boxes. Overall 2019 revenues fell just 2% company-wide vs. 2018, but were actually HIGHER than 2017.All told, H&R Block’s business has held up better than Wall Street initially expected from tax reform. For the current fiscal year, analyst consensus is projecting flat to slightly improved revenues vs. last year, with a small down-tick in earnings. Estimates for 2020-21 are calling for slow growth to continue vs. this year. But can H&R Block deliver better than Wall Street projected results going forward?Given a Democratic President and Congress come to power after the 2020 election, we may actually witness a slew of new deductions, rule changes, tax rate increases, and more, requiring a greater level of tax preparation expertise for 2020-21. All of the top contenders for the Democratic Presidential nomination are on record for repealing the Trump 2017 tax code changes, bringing back deductions and complicating how returns are figured. Plus, Senators Warren and Sanders are proponents of adding ""extra"" taxes for Medicare-for-All health benefits, expanded welfare programs, and repaying college loans, for starters. If one of the more progressive thinkers is elected President, a likely result is a truly messy tax code starting in 2021.If President Trump and the Republicans in the Senate are defeated in next year’s election (which is looking increasingly probable), smart Wall Street investors may gravitate back towards H&R Block in 2020, as opposed to drifting away from it during 2016-19.If H&R Block’s business prospects are reaching for a bottom in late 2019, what’s the upside?Source: www.hrblock.comThe corporation’s last 12 months have witnessed $600 million in cash flow and $500 million in “free” cash flow generation. Against $2 billion in net long-term liabilities (total liabilities minus current assets) H&R Block retains a relatively conservative balance sheet. Versus peer S&P 500 companies holding a ratio of net long-term liabilities to cash flow of 7x, H&R Block’s number closer to 3x allows for better than normal financial flexibility in operations.Block’s current dividend yield of 4.4% is easily covered at a 35% ratio of cash flow creation (45% of income). In addition, while the company has been dealing with a slower tax preparation environment the past few years, it has still been able to reinvest cash flow into share buybacks and smaller accretive acquisitions. Block’s high and rising 4.4% yield for investors compares quite favorably with today’s 2.4% bank and financial services dividend yield, or 2.0% equivalent yield for the average S&P 500 corporation.H&R Block has a trailing price to GAAP earnings [P/E] ratio of less than 12x. The operating company’s 8.5% earnings yield on a $23 share price (10% free cash flow yield) from a stable, brand name business is difficult to duplicate anywhere in today’s richly priced equity market environment. For comparison, financials are priced around 15x trailing earnings, and the large cap S&P 500 index around 21x GAAP income generation.The weak 2019 stock performance trend appears to be reaching for a bottom in October. After a late August earnings report that missed by a few pennies, investors liquidated H&R Block at an exceptionally high rate into September, pictured on the graph below. The quote declined from $29 a share in June to $23 today.However, subtle signs of a turnaround in buying interest are now present. First, the selloff during the fall has failed to break the low trade around $22 in January 2019. Second, notice how the stock price made new lows vs. September above $23, while selling momentum indicators have been rising from oversold levels. You can argue the rising blue lines from the standard RSI and MFI indicators today are quite similar to the January-February situation. H&R Block rallied roughly 30% from early February to June.The last point of interest on the chart I would like to mention is the ADX momentum trend in selling may have been broken last week. Readings above 40 usually highlight a consistent intermediate trend in either buying or selling. In this instance for H&R Block, the selling trend was quite steady for a good three months. The slight breakdown in this line suggests last week’s buying action is different than the regular selling of September. The longer Block can hold the $22-$23 area in coming weeks, the better the odds new buyers will start scooping up this deep value play.I believe H&R Block represents a potential takeover play at today’s low valuation. Holding stable, yet underappreciated operating prospects far into the future, Block’s 10% free cash flow generation is quite noteworthy. The situation looks prepackaged for a private equity purchase. Synthesize reliable and growing free cash flow at a discounted price - using amortization on the goodwill buyout number to pocket the difference versus fixed to falling interest costs. In addition, every significant nationwide bank or insurance company could use Block's stores to cross-promote and directly sell their financial products to tens of millions of consumers.If the tax code is about to get truly messy with the Democrats taking control of the U.S. government after November 2020, H&R Block's future may be particularly bright. I can argue this conservative, higher profit margin business should actually be trading at a premium valuation to peer financial service entities and near a par valuation to the typical S&P 500 enterprise. Using this logic, H&R Block is 30%-50% undervalued at $23 a share.H&R Block’s business results and stock price performance have proven to be relatively recession-proof. Any uptick in operating sales and profitability, alongside a bearish market and U.S economic outlook for 2020, could spark a large up-move in the share price next year.Block will likely outperform the general market over the next 6-12 months, at a minimum. I believe it is an excellent selection right now when used as a long holding in a diversified, hedged portfolio design. The strong dividend yield should attract the retirement crowd hungry for better yields than available in other blue-chip stocks, high grade bonds, bank savings, or insurance company annuity investments.

So we thought it was a good time to write an article about H&R Block (HRB). This article focuses on the shift of tax preparation to digital do-it-yourself (DIY) solutions and what we believe is a misconception some people have about the impacts that shift will have on H&R Block longer-term, specifically related to the dynamics of oligopolies. We will also address some related misperceptions related to digital disruption in the tax business and overall industry growth.H&R Block is one of the world’s largest tax service providers, having prepared more than 720 million tax returns since 1955. There are approximately 12,000 company-owned and franchise retail locations in all 50 states, Puerto Rico and other U.S. territories, and on U.S. military bases around the world. An H&R Block branded retail office is located within five miles of most Americans. The Company provides assisted income tax return preparation, digital DIY tax solutions and other services and products related to income tax return preparation.In fiscal 2018, H&R Block had revenues of $3.2 billion and prepared over 20 million tax returns worldwide.The US tax preparation industry has long been a fragmented market with thousands of participants ranging from giants like H&R Block to individual CPAs or even just a family friend. It is also a big industry representing a $20 billion opportunity for the thousands of businesses and hundreds of thousands of employees trying to get in on the action. Historically, industry fragmentation was quite extreme resulting in an ultra-competitive landscape with no one company able to achieve a commanding share. The industry was based on offline, assisted tax filings with the aid of a tax professional in a physical location. As we can see from the chart below, even H&R Block as the largest assisted preparer in the US has only been able to carve out a 15% share in the category.Source: H&R Block Investor Presentation, July 2018According to Franchise Help, the vast majority of tax preparers are small businesses – 37% are run by a single person, while 53% employ less than ten people. Literally thousands of people and businesses are competing for a share of the opportunity created by 78 million tax filers. So the old assisted tax preparation industry is far from an oligopoly type of environment where a few powerful players can exercise pricing power.But the industry is now experiencing the rise of DIY, online tax filing. More and more tax filers are converting to online tax software to complete one of the least-loved activities of the year. Growth rates of DIY filers around 10% versus the average recent industry growth closer to 3% do indeed confirm the shift to DIY software with IRS data and H&R Block confirming that over 40% of US taxpayers are choosing DIY. It is important for investors to understand the dynamics of this industry change.Many investors are claiming that the move to online DIY will doom H&R Block due to a shift away from assisted tax filings. Pessimists envision a sharp reduction in the number of assisted filings, where H&R Block is the leader, and a grand increase in online DIY where Intuit (INTU), with its tax software TurboTax is the dominant player. It is true that TurboTax has a strong lead in the DIY space, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that a shift to DIY is bad for H&R Block. It also doesn’t mean that H&R Block’s assisted business is destined to aggressively crumble and fail.What many investors overlook is that the digital DIY tax preparation industry in the US is an oligopoly. Intuit controls about 65% while H&R Block comes in second with about 15%. With a combined market share of near 80%, these two companies might even claim duopoly status. H&R Block tried to cement that duopoly status by buying TaxAct, but the acquisition was blocked in an unusual show of strength by the Department of Justice. There are a couple key points to keep in mind regarding the shift to DIY. First of all, H&R Block has about a 15% market share in assisted and DIY, so despite a shift to a world where TurboTax is the leader, they are not necessarily losing overall market share. They are simply moving from an incredibly fragmented industry to an oligopoly. They might not be the leader anymore, but their market strength is improving significantly. It is also important to point out that H&R Block is gaining share in the DIY space, so reports that TurboTax will rule the world are at least premature. The other critical point is demonstrated by the below graph. The growth in online DIY has come primarily from taking share from pen & paper DIY. That shift resulted in a great opportunity for TurboTax, but it didn’t tank the assisted category. To be clear, the online DIY business is growing faster than assisted currently and is very slowly eating away at assisted’s share, but it’s hardly a blood bath for H&R Block’s more traditional business. The majority of US taxpayers still opt for assisted tax preparation in fact.Source: H&R Block Investor Presentation, July 2018So the reality is that H&R Block’s assisted business is not collapsing and that the company is not losing share in the overall tax preparation industry. In fact, H&R Block is gaining share in online DIY. More importantly perhaps, H&R Block is moving from a fragmented industry to an oligopoly with disciplined participants. While many investors are concerned about possible short-term impacts to revenues and profit margins with the shift to online DIY, we are more positive for the long-term regarding the financial outcome considering the normal dynamics that result from oligopolies, as we will review below.Investors shouldn’t underestimate the power of oligopolies. There is a reason why anti-trust laws exist to prevent the over-consolidation of industries. Powerful players in an industry really can control pricing to some degree and ultimately achieve more attractive returns. Market domination helps keep competitors out, acting as a barrier to entry, and the reduced competition leaves the remaining companies with the ability to focus more on their own bottom line.Over about the last couple decades, nearly all big industries in the US have become more consolidated. Concentration has resulted through a number of factors including dramatic merger and acquisition volume unhindered by antitrust cases which has not been offset by new company starts. It certainly seems as though antitrust restrictions have loosened up and allowed for increasing industry concentration.Source: Merger Manias: 1890 – 2015, Taylor Mann, Pine CapitalThis phenomenon is particularly dramatic when viewed through the scope of publicly listed companies in the US. According to a recent Credit Suisse study, the number of US listed companies declined by about 50 percent between 1996 and 2016. US industries have fewer companies which end up being larger and older players with more control. Competition seems to be dissipating into thin air.Source: Charles Schwab, World Bank data as of October 29, 2017So there are fewer and fewer companies fighting for the same pie with the top companies gobbling up a higher and higher percentage of the profits. But does the higher level of industry concentration really lead to tangible advantages? A fascinating study by Gustavo Grullon, Yelena Larkin and Roni Michaely titled, “Are Industries Becoming More Concentrated?” sheds some light on the subject. The study concludes that the more concentrated an industry is, the higher the return on assets. And more importantly, it determined the source of the higher return finding that “the higher returns on assets are mainly driven by firms’ ability to extract higher profit margins.” With the effect being highly material, we can only conclude that oligopolies really do mean companies can focus less on competition and more on their bottom line.At this point, some investors might be wondering if H&R Block’s gradual move into an oligopoly is relevant for its future stock price performance. Lucky for us, Grullon and his colleagues also investigated whether investing in increasingly concentrated industries would result in superior investment returns. Their findings are quite spectacular and best described using their own words.“To examine the changes to investors’ welfare, we look at the performance of portfolios sorted on the change in concentration levels in their respective industries. Unlike in earlier periods, we find that over the period of 2001-2014, a zero-investment strategy of buying firms in industries with the largest increase in concentration levels and shorting firms in industries with the largest decrease in concentration levels, generates excess returns of approximately 9% per year, after controlling for standard risk factors. Thus, the higher profit margins that firms enjoy as a consequence of the change in concentration since the turn of the century are reflected in higher returns to shareholders.”That conclusion paints a rather rosy picture for H&R Block and Intuit and their strong positioning in the online DIY tax preparation oligopoly. For more information on the topic, including a mention of H&R Block and the online DIY tax preparation industry, we can recommend Jonathan Tepper’s new book, The Myth of Capitalism. Investors may also want to review our recent article on the topic focusing on the North American recreational vehicle market and Thor Industries (THO). Returning to the tax preparation industry, we also note that both H&R Block and Intuit are companies with a long track record of strong double-digit levels of return on invested capital, so we hardly expect either of them to run anything less than a solidly profitable online DIY business over the long-term. Oligopoly pricing power would certainly help them to do so.There is some misperception regarding growth in the tax preparation industry, namely that there isn’t any. The reality is that the industry is growing and resilient, providing a defensive back-drop for business and investment.Source: H&R Block Investor Presentation, July 2018There are also several opportunities for H&R Block to beat industry growth. As mentioned, they are gaining market share in the DIY category which may continue for some time. We also see some opportunity in the changing landscape of tax preparation. People generally think of a gradual shift from assisted preparation to DIY, but the reality is that the lines between the two are starting to blur. Both H&R Block and TurboTax have launched hybrid solutions which offer online assistance to DIY customers. The future will likely offer assisted, DIY and everything in-between. Some might be concerned that this metamorphosis will allow TurboTax to encroach on H&R Block’s assisted business, but the reality is that very few companies will be able to offer a competitive hybrid solution meaning that the two leaders in the industry may eventually be able to turn more of the assisted category into an oligopoly as well as they steal share from helpless CPAs and Independents which simply cannot offer a competitive online product with all the necessary data security and technology spend. It is perhaps a monumental opportunity for both companies to gain substantial market share in the assisted category over time.We did not go into the complete fundamentals of H&R Block in detail in this article, but a quick glance would reveal consistently high levels of return on invested capital, a solid balance sheet, an attractive and growing dividend and a valuation that looks quite reasonable with a free cash flow yield around 11.6% and an EV/EBITDA multiple around 6.5. And the company has exceptional market positioning with a strong hold on its leading spot in the assisted tax preparation industry, a well-recognized brand and a large and growing piece of the online DIY oligopoly. Investors can certainly purchase a large amount of return on equity or return on invested capital for the price.Regarding growth, the underlying industry is growing slowly and is resilient even in recessions (something investors might want to look for in this stage of the business cycle). And the company has scope to continue to gain market share. Emerging consumer expectations for a competitive online product and flexibility in how tax returns ultimately get done also provide huge scope for H&R Block to gradually consolidate more of the assisted returns space with hybrid product offerings. In any case, there is no catastrophic decline happening in the assisted category and no real indication that DIY will suddenly increase the rate at which it is nibbling away at assisted tax preparation. H&R Block is well positioned regardless.Keeping the fundamental attributes of H&R Block’s investment case in mind, this article focuses more on the potential longer-term benefits of the developing oligopoly in the online DIY space (a factor often overlooked by investors). Industry concentration should lead to more pricing control and higher barriers to entry. Ultimately, H&R Block should reach attractive levels of profitability and return on investment in the online DIY space over time thanks to its strong position in an oligopoly with disciplined players. In turn, investors will stand a better chance at achieving market-beating returns with H&R Block stock."
4235251,104099,2019-01-24T09:34:19-05:00,"Since I sold my shares of H&R Block at a 25% gain, the stock has fallen about 11%. I think they're worth buying again.In addition, I think it's possible for investors to make some money selling puts on the name.While I don't like falling net income in the face of rising revenue, the recent financial performance was fine in my view, and demonstrated that management is still shareholder friendly.","2018 was a good year for me in regard to H&R Block Inc. (HRB). I bought in June when the shares were in the slough of despond, and sold just before they fell in price in November for a 25% gain. The shares are down about 11% from my sale price, and I thought I’d look in on the company to see if I should buy back in. Since my latest missive on the company, H&R Block has released new financials, so I should update my financial statement analysis. For those who can’t stand the suspense, I’m at the very least selling puts on this name. I’ll go through my reasoning below by reviewing the financials and by looking at the stock as a thing distinct from the business. I want to pay particular attention to the sustainability of the dividend, as the current yield is one of the key attractants for this stock at the moment in my view.Since I last wrote about the stock, H&R Block has released another set of financials. There is both good and bad in these numbers, and I’ll go through my impressions below. Revenue was 5.5% higher in the first two quarters of the latest FY relative to the same period in 2018, while net income declined by 16%! This is troublesome because it prompts the question, if growing sales don’t cause profits to grow, what does?,Source: Company filings .On the bright side, as of the latest investor conference call, the company is maintaining its guidance. According to the CFO, Tony Bowen:Source: H&R Block Inc. Q2 Conference call, 2018In addition, the company continues to treat shareholders well by buying back stock and upping the dividend materially. The company paid out an additional $3 million in dividends and an additional $119.9 million in stock buybacks relative to the same period a year ago. Finally, the capital structure has improved somewhat with debt down about $2 million from the year ago period. Debt will continue to drop in my view, given that fully 43.46% of long term debt is due next year. Thankfully, the company has a sizable ($600 million) cash hoard to cover this.In sum, I think the financial performance was adequate and there’s abundant evidence that this is still a very viable and profitable company.Successful investing involves more than simply finding a company that generates decent sales and earnings. That is a necessary, but not sufficient precondition for success in this game. At least as important is the need to buy those future cash flows at a reasonable price. It’s for that reason that I must spend some time looking at the stock as thing distinct from the business.When I first wrote about the stock back in June, I described how I thought the bad news around tax simplification, the emergence of DIY software and other headwinds was already baked into the price. Thus, any criticism of a bullish thesis based on the movement toward DIY tax preparation was silly in my estimation. I pointed out that such criticisms assumed for some strange reason that bulls hadn’t heard of these trends. When I first wrote about the stock, it was trading at a price to free cash of ~7.3 times. I then went on to sell the stock when price to free cash flow jumped to 8.6 times. As of now, the stock is trading back below 8 times, and I’m intrigued once again.Source: GurufocusFor your education and edification, I’ve circled in red the last time the shares were this inexpensive on a price to free cash flow basis. The shares subsequently rallied from that level. Now I don’t think history necessarily repeats itself, but in my view there’s a very good chance that it’ll rhyme. At the very least, people who buy now can take some comfort in the fact that they’ll be doing so near the bottom of this stock’s valuation range. That’s frequently a positive in my view.In my view, the dividend yield is a significant inducement for investors to own this company. Thus, any threat to the dividend will obviously impact shareholders, so I must spend some time reviewing the relationship between the dividend and free cash per share. The following graphic demonstrates to me that for the past several years, free cash has been more than sufficient to cover dividends. This is important, because I don’t want to buy a company at risk of a dividend cut for obvious reasons.Source: GurufocusI’ve established for myself that the dividend yield is well supported by cash flows, and thus, I’d be happy owning this stock over the long term. My return, though, will be a function of entry price, as the more an investor pays for a stream of future cash flows, the lower will be their future returns. With that in mind, I’ll present a way for prospective shareholders to either generate some “free” money or acquire shares of H&R Block at an even more attractive price.As of this writing, the July H&R Block put with a strike price of $25 is bid-ask at $2.10-$2.35. If an investor sells this put at the market (i.e. receives $2.10 for each one sold), they’ll be faced with the following possibilities between now and the 3rd Friday of July. If the shares rally from here as I suspect they will, the investor will simply keep the premium. If the shares languish from here, the investor will buy these shares at a net price of $22.90. I consider this to be a very favorable entry price. If you buy these shares at that price, you’d be acquiring them at a net price to free cash multiple of around 7, which I consider to be “screaming buy” territory.The underlying business seems to remain quite good, and the company has maintained their financial guidance. The software that has been touted as an H&R Block killer has been around for some time, and it could be said that stories of H&R Blocks demise have been wildly exaggerated. At the same time, the dividend is sustainable in my estimation given the strong free cash flow the firm generates. Finally, the options market is handing investors a gift of puts that are priced very aggressively in my estimation. For my part, I’ll be buying back some shares and will be selling the puts mentioned in this article and I think investors would be wise to do the same."

The deal makes excellent strategic sense.Toronto, Ontario-based Wave was founded in 2009 to provide free accounting, invoicing, and receipt-tracking software while generating revenue by offering payment processing, payroll services, as well as bookkeeping services.Management is headed by Co-Founder and CEO Kirk Simpson, who has previously co-founded Outdoorsica.com and served as a board member at Sustainability Network.Below is an overview video of the company’s offerings:Source: Wave AppsWave’s primary offerings include accounting, invoicing and receipts solutions.Company major customers include:Source: WaveInvestors have invested at least $79.5 million in the company and include Social Capital, CRV, HarbourVest Partners, Exhibition Ventures, BDC Venture Capital, OMERS Ventures, NAB Ventures, National Australia Bank, OurCrowd, and Portag3 Ventures, among others (Source: Crunchbase).According to a market research report by Transparency Market Research, the global accounting software market was valued at $5.72 billion in 2017 and is projected to reach $11.77 billion by 2026.This represents a CAGR of 8.6% between 2018 and 2026.The main drivers for this expected growth are the need for better accounting software and nearly consumer-like interface, as well as its many benefits, such as rapid identification of cash flows, broad reporting possibilities, cost- and time-effectiveness, and gaining valuable insight.The North American region is projected to dominate the market during the forecast period due to the integration of accounting software with smartphones, tablets, and computers across the region.Major competitive vendors that provide accounting software include:Source: SentieoHRB disclosed the acquisition price and terms as $405 million in cash and said it would fund the deal from available cash.Based on its estimate that Wave will generate $42.5 million of revenue for fiscal 2020, it is likely at an annual run rate of around $50 million, leading to a price multiple of approximately 8.1x.While not cheap, this multiple isn’t unreasonable given the strategic nature of the acquisition.HRB did not provide a change in financial guidance, as it said ‘the financial impact of this transaction is subject to the timing of the actual close of the transaction.’A review of the firm’s most recent 10-K filing indicates that as of April 30, 2019, HRB had $1.6 billion in cash and equivalents and $2.8 billion in total liabilities, of which $1.5 billion was long-term debt and $350 million was deferred revenue and other current or non-current liabilities.Free cash flow for the twelve months ended April 30, 2019, was $511 million.In the past 12 months, HRB’s stock price has risen 23.3% vs. Intuit’s rise of 32.5%, as the chart below indicates:Source: SentieoEarnings surprises have been positive in seven of the last twelve quarters:Source: Seeking AlphaAnalyst sentiment in recent earnings calls has dropped markedly into negative territory, as the linguistic analysis shows below:Source: SentieoHRB is acquiring Wave as part of a strategic move into providing a much broader range of services to small business and freelancer customer segments.As HRB president and CEO stated in the deal announcement:With the deal, HRB will be able to expand its ‘share of wallet’ for its existing customer base with new and synergistic cross-selling opportunities as well adding Wave’s 400,000 strong customer base.This deal appears to make natural sense as HRB seeks to build on its tax-based core business by providing a wider service offering to the roughly 31 million small businesses in North America and millions more freelancers.HRB has much room to grow with the deal, especially targeting Intuit’s small business service offerings with competing solutions."
4182571,33291,2018-06-19T10:32:58-04:00,"H&R Block stock has been crushed, down over 20% since reporting earnings.A shift in the way taxes are filed coupled with a change in strategy for the company is in large part to blame.The ramifications of tax reform on filing approaches should have been obvious 6 months ago so we see this reaction as overdone considering projected revenues.A growing dividend now offers a 4.1% yield.A good company at a fair price, or a value trap?","H&R Block (HRB) has been suffering since it reported earnings. We consider the action in the stock a bit of a bad beat, given that performance was solid, and the name has now been pushed into value territory. There is a question however of whether this is a true bad beat, which investors should be buying, or whether it is a value trap that has further downside.At issue here is the new tax law in the United States as well as a bit of a shift in strategy for the company. The company really wants to focus on those who do their taxes themselves (or DIY), and de-emphasize the direct tax preparation assistance it has provided at brick and mortar establishmentsThe impact of the new tax law, along with many Americans moving to DIY as the preferred way of filing taxes (the present authors included), has the potential to put some pressure on H&R Block's revenues. However, we all know that DIY tax filing through the use of the company's (and the competition's) DIY software has been on the rise in the last decade, and nearly half of the country prepares their taxes at home:Those who fall under the ""having accountant do taxes"" or having a ""brick and mortar"" service complete them almost always have more complex taxes that require itemization, special forms, unique situations, etc. As a result of the new tax law in the United States however, the standard deduction was almost doubled, which many believe will encourage a lot more American households to file their own taxes because they will no longer have to itemize. There is truth to this is about 18 million people filing taxes will itemize their 2018 taxes versus the 46.5 million who did so in 2017.As such, H&R block will close 400 physical locations. This does not mean all hope is lost. Even those who will DIY will still have requests for assistance from a number of those filing their own taxes, but it could be a hit to revenues. That said, what we expect the company to do is charge a little more for its software. We expect other competitors to do the same. Right now, the fear has driven the stock down, but it is our opinion that these fears are a bit overblown.The Street is pounding the name. We believe this has less to do with actual performance of the name, which for all intents and purposes, was generally ahead of what was expected, and more to do with uncertainty for the future. You see, right now the company is in transition, and the pressure on the stock is evident:Source: BAD BEAT InvestingThe question is, can you now buy this 20% dip today which has put the name at about at less than ten times forward earnings, or should you let it fall? Are better days ahead? Let's check in on the name to see where we are at, independent of uncertainty regarding the future.The truth is that performance is generally strong for the name, at least over the last few quarters. Of course, a cursory glance at the last few years of earnings show unpredictable results relative to expectations. But in the quarter last week the company beat earnings on the top and bottom line but this strategy shift was good enough to knock the stock down to a one-year low.This hit to the stock helped to drive the valuation to 8 times trailing earnings, levels we have not seen in recent history. The Street is compressing the multiple as it foresees dull results coming forward thanks to the new tax law. That said, should the company deliver the stock is really going to move. However, the Street is pricing the stock for performance that will not be recognized until early 2019, for the most part. Sure, there are quarterly filers now, but most of these are businesses and self-employed individuals, and we do not see the new standard deduction and tax rate impacting the way they file. As such, we find shares attractive at $23.50. We are further encouraged by growing dividend, which now offers a 4.1% yield.This yield protection could cushion some downside, but momentum can be a powerful force in investing. As such strong yields have been unable to help establish a floor under many names when the bears attack. Still, looking at the action in the last week it appears the name is searching for a floor. With the stock is looking for direction, we think that initiating a small position here, especially for dividend growth, makes sense here, even with the headwinds facing the company. In our opinion we have a good company at a fair price. We find it interesting that the stock only now is reacting to fear of DIY tax preparation, when this should have been obvious six month ago. In terms of performance, in Q4, we saw revenues climb. Revenue as a whole came in at $2.39 billion, and this beat estimates by $50 million. However, this was also up 3% year-over-year, continuing a string of winning quarters on the top line.While sales were quite stronger than expected, we must understand that the bottom line is a losing line in all other quarters except Q4. Frankly, no one is really using tax services in the summer, relatively speaking, other than those aforementioned quarterly filers, or those purchasing services ahead of tax season. The big money months are in the height of tax season, as you can imagine. Revenues this quarter were driven by some increases in services related to assisting with tax preparation, as well as with sales of the extended tax service protection plans offered. Operating income really impressed, as operating expenses rose very slightly. With the rise in revenues, we have to be on the lookout for rising expenses. That said, total operating expenses increased from $1.09 billion to $1.14 billion.In terms of cash flow, H&R Block saw a net income of $613 million from operations in the year, widening from $408 million last year. The company entered the quarter with $1.117 billion in cash and cash equivalents. Between the income and dividends paid in the quarter, it ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1.664 billion. This was a hidden positive in the quarter, as cash was up on the year. Long-term debt is reasonable at $1.494 billion. Factoring everything in, the company saw earnings of $5.43 per share. This was ahead of consensus by $0.16 per share.To try to boost value, the company will return to repurchasing shares in fiscal 2019, but in a limited fashion it seems. It will repurchase shares to offset dilution from equity grants in order to at a minimum prevent an increase in its shares outstanding. We do like the increased dividend to $1.00 per share annually. Now, what killed the stock was disappointing guidance.On the conference call the company stated it sees $3.05 billion to $3.1 billion in revenues for fiscal 2019. This would of course be a slight decline from fiscal 2018. Is the slight decline worth a haircut of 20% in share price value? We do not believe so. While it is a challenging environment and headwinds persist, we look at this as an opportunity to get long the stock. Keep in mind that with the closing of 400 or so shops, the company will save money on the operating expense front. Further, with a lower tax rate, earnings per share for fiscal 2019 will likely not suffer relative to 2018.Given that value is tough to find in this market, we believe under $23.50 represents a fair entry point into this name, but we do not expect a quick snap back in share prices. Instead, we see value here, and think this level represents a good time to initiate a first round of buying for a new position.Quad 7 Capital has been a leading contributor with Seeking Alpha since early 2012.

4209061,103830,2018-09-30T18:36:26-04:00,Predictable industry with minimal prospects for growth.A certain proportion of the population will always want assistance with tax.Cash generative business that should focus primarily on buybacks and dividends.,"Every year millions of Americans and Canadians dread the inevitable time when they are required to submit a tax return to their governments respective revenue collecting agency. For many it can be a very complicated and time-consuming task that is too much for them to personally take on, which is why H&R Block (NYSE: HRB) continues to see returning customers year after year. For decades HRB has been one of the most recognizable brands for people who want hands on assistance in tax preparation. You could always find one of their office locations nearby, which mostly look like a quiet cemetery for most of the year until the mad dash for refunds begins. As of today, HRB has a market capitalization of $5.1 billion, an enterprise value of $5.6 billion and is trading at a PE of 9 and an EV to EBITDA multiple of just under 6. With these types of metrics, HRB tends to show up on a lot of value investors' screens. This low valuation has been driven by a few things. First, investors fear that that a simplified tax code in the U.S. will drive significantly more people to perform their own tax returns and thus drive people away from HRB’s traditional ""Assisted"" business model. The second concern for investors is that HRB is losing (if it has not already lost) the battle for Do-It-Yourself (DIY) customers who prefer to use the online tax preparation programs. I believe the low valuation mostly reflects an over exaggerated threat from the simplified U.S. tax code. HRB does have a strong brand and service where there will always be a certain proportion of the population that find value in having a walk-in, assisted tax preparation service model even though it will likely decline gradually overtime as DIY technology increasingly becomes better. With HRB being a very healthy cash generative business they are unlikely to go out of business anytime soon, and I believe that with the efficient allocation of access capital, the company’s management can still add a lot of value for its shareholders in the next 10 years through buybacks and dividends.For many years HRB has been a crutch for a proportion of the population who do not feel confident or have the time to spend doing their own taxes via pen and paper, online or desktop (Source: 2018 HRB Presentation). Of the 78 million tax filers who choose the “Assisted” route for doing their taxes, HRB owns 15% of the market, which is a sizable chunk for any one individual company when you put them up against the thousands of independent CPA’s who are working out of their home or a small office located in a strip mall.(Source: 2018 HRB Presentation)To many people’s surprise the percentage of filers who go the assisted route has not moved nearly as much as one would have thought with the introduction of DIY online and desktop programs. For the past 16 years approximately 40% of filers in the United States continue to decide to go with the Assisted option when doing their own taxes. Most of the market that these online and desktop DIY products have displaced, are the “Pen and Paper” crowd who generally feel competent enough to do their own taxes, but have now found a much simpler way (relative to the cost) with the assistance of these programs.(Source: 2018 HRB Presentation)I think most people would have assumed that the online DIY options would be eating HRB’s lunch and that in order for HRB to survive they would have to completely transition away from the brick and motor locations and move everyone to their online business as fast as possible. I think HRB can survive in the existing environment as long as they manage to maintain their market share in the Assisted category of tax preparation. The pricing for Assisted returns seems fairly predictable and cost increases for inflation do not seem to get resistance from consumers when they are passed on. HRB should not be overly concerned with a strategy of competing with companies like Intuit (NASDAQ: INTU) or others for DIY customers. (Source HRB SEC Filings - Compiled by Author)Competitors like INTU have already developed a very sticky business which have a tremendous lead over HRB’s equivalent product. With decades of experience of INTU building a foundation of trust with its customers, it will be very difficult for HRB to regain a lot of ground on them. HRB has a moat for their main Assisted business model, and they should put most of their efforts into maximizing that part of their business and ensuring profits are returned to shareholders in the most optimal way.(Source HRB SEC Filings - Compiled by Author)The best-case scenario for HRB is if they lose an Assisted customer to DIY, then the hope is that that customer at least stays committed to the HRB brand and uses their product. That being said, the amount of revenue generated from a DIY customer for HRB is just over $30 per return while the revenue generated by an Assisted return on average is closer to $240 (Source: HRB SEC Filings).The best possible strategy for HRB in my opinion is for them to focus on maintaining their market share in the Assisted return market. I don’t think there is much room for growth, but it is a business that can continually produce good cash flow and return it to shareholders via opportune buybacks or dividends. In reality there is not going to be a major transition for HRB to grab a significant portion of the US online DIY business with INTU already generating over $2.5 billion of revenue from their Consumer division. HRB has a long hill to climb to reach these same numbers given they are sitting at less than $250 million revenue for the same group of business. HRB would have to dedicate a lot of resources to even making a very marginal dent in their business over the span of many years if not decades given the foreseeable technology advances. The most optimistic growth you could expect with HRB’s existing business is a combination of incremental growth in the number of filers driven by population increases as well as inflationary growth in the revenue earned per filing. This would equate to an optimist top line growth from anywhere between 3-4% per year.(Source: IRS Statistics - Compiled by Author)What is the probability of this growth happening? I think it's fairly high because tax preparation is fairly recession resistant. People will still file tax returns if they become unemployed during a recession though there is some risk that they may not be willing to pay $240 for the help. Another threat may be that a simpler tax code will eventually convince a lot of people to go the DIY route, which is also very credible but I don’t think is likely to happen so drastically that you see your investment go to zero. HRB will still produce good cash flow off the filers that they do get year over year even if there is gradually less and less filers over time that choose their Assisted service. Unfortunately, it is fairly late in the online DIY game for HRB to offset any potential losses in this area given how established INTU is in this market segment now. (Source HRB SEC Filings - Compiled by Author)Based on the prospective of 3-4% growth, one could justify paying up to an earnings multiple of 12 for the stock. This is approximately what HRB is trading for today so if you bought HRB it may be a good bet over the next 10 years if you think the S&P is significantly overvalued at today’s prices. I would prefer to wait to look at HRB at today's price less 10-15% discount so that I am working with some margin of safety. I would not consider starting a position until the share price were to fall to at least somewhere between $22-$23."
4202152,99986,2018-08-26T21:22:31-04:00,"H&R Block is up seven of the last eight weeks after plummeting on its most recent earnings report.The company's earnings trend going continues to look lackluster as it is unable to put together any real consistent growth.The stock has reclaimed its 200-day moving average, but I'm skeptical it is ready for a turnaround just yet.","While most companies have seen strong share price appreciation since the Q1 2016 bottom in the S&P 500 (NYSEARCA:SPY), H&R Block (NYSE:HRB) has been unable to gain any real traction. The S&P 500 is up over 55% since the 2016 lows, yet H&R Block is down 1% and has been unable to put together any real rallies. The company got whacked on its last earnings report for nearly 20% in a day, and those that got caught in the downdraft have been fortunate to see it drift back up. I do not see this bottoming pattern as all that constructive, and see a complete turnaround in the technicals here as unlikely. If I were long the stock, I would be exiting my position, or at the minimum, cutting it in half at these levels. While it's possible that the stock can continue to rally up to the $27.70-28.00 level where strong resistance lies, I think this rally has squeezed a lot of the juice out of this lemon already.As we can see from the below chart, H&R Block belongs to the laggard group of the market. The stock has been stuck in a nasty downtrend with violent sell-offs along the way since 2015, while the S&P 500 has only endured one bear market and has been off to the races since. Laggard stocks can have a tough time getting back into their stride, and H&R Block has been no exception. Typically, the way a stock climbs out of the laggard bin is through a resurgence in earnings growth or revenue growth, or a new business plan/product that can turn things around. The company has stated that it is making an effort to turn things around with investments in a new pricing structure and improved technology going forward, but I'm not convinced yet that this turnaround has legs.Taking a look at H&R Block's annual earnings trend, there's no question that the company is seeing a surge in annual EPS for 2018. It reported $1.96 in EPS in fiscal 2017 and managed to put up $2.98 in EPS for fiscal 2018. On the surface, this is clearly a nice boost in annual EPS and is an impressive turnaround. The issue is that as current estimates show, this is not sustainable. While 2018 saw a massive increase in annual EPS up 52% for the year, annual EPS is expected to drop back down to the $2.00 level and not sustain any of these gains going forward. Given that the market is forward-looking, I don't see this as a confirmed turnaround just yet.Annual EPSThe other issue I see with the current turnaround thesis is that it's not coming on the back of robust revenue growth. While revenue growth has been able to move out of the slump we saw in 2016 and early 2017 with zero quarterly growth, the past four quarters of revenue growth have been quite mixed. The revenue growth trend is shown below:There's no question there's been an improvement since the weak stretch of non-existent revenue growth between Q2 2016 and Q2 2017, but the most recent quarter isn't all that impressive. I typically don't put too much weight into a single quarter, but 3% revenue growth is not the number I'm looking for to indicate a turnaround is in place. Turnarounds come on the back of robust revenue growth like Axon Enterprise (NASDAQ:AAXN) saw over the past two years, and this was a reason I spent most of the year long the stock, before selling out recently in the low $60s.A more robust revenue growth trend that is indicative of a turnaround is shown below for Axon Enterprise:What gave me confidence in the potential for a turnaround in Axon Enterprise was the fact that strong revenue growth was bolstering a surge in annual EPS. These are the types of turnarounds that are typically the most sustainable. H&R Block does not have revenue growth to support this turnaround, and is instead trying to orchestrate this turnaround based on restructuring, new investments and improved technology. While this plan is a step in the right direction, and it's nice to see the company making a concerted effort to stay relevant going forward in an attempt to continue to gain market share, it's still too early to confirm a turnaround, in my opinion. Based on these facts, I would expect any sharp rallies like the one we've seen to be head-fakes and more likely to be sold into versus sustainable bottoms on the back of strong fundamental performance in both the current year and looking forward.To summarize the fundamental picture, H&R Block is trying to turn things around, but I believe the jury to still be out on this thesis. The brief surge in earnings in 2018 was a one-off if estimates for 2019 and 2020 EPS are accurate, and this surge in profits did not come on the back of powerful revenue growth - it came on the back of single-digit quarterly revenue growth. There is the possibility that the stock can turn things around by late 2019 or early 2020, but I don't expect the technicals to start racing ahead anticipating a potential turnaround that's still likely a year or two out.Taking a look at the technical picture, it is confirming the idea that we're still likely early in the turnaround phase. As we can see from the weekly chart of the stock below, the $27.70 level has been strong resistance for nearly two years now, after it failed as support and sent the stock tumbling into the bear market it's currently in. While there have been short periods that the stock has been able to trade above this $27.70 level, any time spent above here has been on borrowed time. The most recent rally is coming off of a 52-week low put in at $22.45 and is not the most constructive setup to indicate the stock is ready to break out above this resistance. I would expect any rallies into this $27.70 level to be sold into - as they have in the past. For this reason, I believe it makes more sense to be lightening up long positions as we head near this resistance and enjoy a relief rally versus trying to squeeze every last penny out of this rally.(Source: TC2000.com)(Source: TC2000.com)Moving down to the daily chart below, we can see that we saw heavy selling off the most recent earnings report and have seen very little accumulation since then. Transitions from bear markets into bull markets are typically characterized by constructive bases off of 52-week lows and a surge in upside volume to show that big money is accumulating the stock. This rally off of the lows is not constructive at all, in my opinion, as it has run up in a wedged fashion and has not been supported by any real strong volume. For this reason, I see this rally as more likely to taper off the closer we get to the $27.70 resistance.(Source: TC2000.com)Finally, looking at the below daily chart from a trend-following perspective, we've got the moving averages all over the place with no real uniformity in their directions. The 200-day moving average is attempting to flatten out but has no real clean trend, and the 50-day moving average is in a clear downtrend and is also trying to flatten out. This moving average setup is also more prone to rally failures, as a declining 50-day moving average below a flat 200-day moving average is no confirmation of a bottom yet. The first sign that a bottom might be in would be the 50-day moving average getting back above the 200-day moving average for more than eight weeks to confirm a new uptrend might be starting.As we can also see from the below chart, this setup looks much more like a rounded top within a bear market than it does a constructive double-bottom base. I believe the bulls are on borrowed time here in terms of this rally, and I think the best case is likely $27.70-28.00 before we see a retrace or rally failure.(Source: TC2000.com)H&R Block is trying to turn things around, but that turnaround is likely going to show up in 2020-2021, if at all. The company's new investments are going to contribute to a margin contraction of 500 basis points short term, and these new investments have no guarantee that they can turn things around for the company. The market clearly said this in a loud and clear fashion based on the significant drop on the last earnings report on heavy volume, and I believe this rally up here on low volume to be more of a sucker's rally. I currently have no long position in H&R Block and typically stay away from shorting stocks that are paying a dividend yield of 4% or greater. For this reason, I see H&R Block as a suboptimal short opportunity, but I do believe the stock to be a trim or sell if I were currently holding a long position.H&R Block is upbeat about the potential of a turnaround, and the new CEO is making an effort to turn things around, but I still think we're 18-24 months early for a turnaround at this time. Based on the fact that I don't see a confirmation of a turnaround and the fact that any such should come after some margin contraction and heavy spending, I don't believe the stock to be ready to start a new bull market just yet. I see better opportunities elsewhere and believe the stock to be a stock worth trimming into this strength, and one to liquidate more into the $27.70-28.00 resistance area. There is, of course, the possibility that the stock can start a new trend and finally break out through this resistance, but I see it as lows odds at this. The opportunity cost of holding laggards in a bull market is high, and I believe longs that have managed to sit through the earnings report and see themselves at a loss are getting an excellent opportunity to get a much better price for their shares by selling into this strength."
4182006,47521,2018-06-15T14:44:48-04:00,Long-term viability of its business model remains a big concern.Company has tied its future to differentiating via its cross-channel strategy.Weak projected 2019 EBITDA margins and failure to repurchase shares weigh on market sentiment.Moody's downwardly revises its outlook to negative.,"source: WSJH&R Block (NYSE:HRB) is struggling against the reality that any market sector that can be disrupted digitally, will be. For that reason the company was hammered recently after its earnings report, as the market wasn't impressed with its failure to buy back share, or its lowered EBITDA margin guidance as it boosts spending in an attempt to differentiate from its competitors in an increasingly commoditized business.The major problem as I see it is the company hasn't convinced investors the additional spending will allow the company to differentiate in a manner that it will be able to consistently and sustainably grow in the future.What that means is the short-term pain of lower margins, and presumably earnings, may not yield the desired results over the long term.It also didn't help in my opinion when asked about the ROI from the increased spending, CEO Jeffrey Jones said he isn't thinking in terms of the ""next two or three years, but 10 or 20 years..."", pointing to it being a viable company over a prolonged period of time.That suggests there could be some downward pressure on margins and earnings over the next several years. It could also mean if it fails to achieve the desired results, it would take away the short-term value of the company.Even so, I do think the company has to take the risk. The point is it appears the market isn't convinced it will be able to turn things around in a way that is able to offset the powerful trend for taxpayers to go the DIY route. Neither am I.The impact of the new tax law, along with the transition to DIY as the preferred way of filing taxes, will put a lot of pressure on H&R Block to come up with answers to quickly offset the inevitable loss of revenue in its assisted taxpayer business.As a result of the new tax law in the U.S., the standard deduction was almost doubled, which will encourage many households to file their own taxes.The congressional Joint Committee on Taxation said that only 18 million people filing taxes will itemize their 2018 taxes, according to the Wall Street Journal, down from the 46.5 million who did so in 2017.While there will be some requests for assistance from a number of those filing their own taxes, it won't be as much as it was in the past. That means less fees for the company.There is no doubt this, when combined with the ongoing trend of DIY taxes, is a major headwind the company will struggle to overcome.As for the 2018 tax season, overall U.S. return growth was 1.5 percent. The company noted that assisted growth was 0.5 percent, while DIY growth was 2.5 percent, calling it a ""slight shift,"" and moderate when measured against the prior several years.That may be true, but when you extrapolate that out even over a few years, the gap between the two become huge, even if DIY continues to moderate some going forward. The importance of that is less revenue, and possibly earnings.The reason I mention there will be less revenue and possibly less earnings is because of the potential residing in the assisted taxpayer segment of the business.An example of another industry that has lost customers, but is able to maintain revenue and earnings, is the theater industry. while foot traffic has dropped significantly in the digital age because of alternative ways of consuming video content, the industry has been able to offset that by consistently raising prices during that same period of time. The reason it has been able to do so is the customer base that still wants to watch a film on the big screen. It's also probably because of the desire for certain customers to experience it in a larger social setting.Another example in relationship to the strategy H&R Block is attempting to employ, is Wal-Mart and its strategy of leveraging its physical stores to attract online shoppers. Customers can order online and go to the physical store to pick it up. That's especially attractive to those wanting to see fresh produce before taking it home.Amazon has done the reverse in its decision to acquire Whole Foods when it failed to convince consumers to buy fresh produce by ordering it online and having it delivered to their homes.The point in all of this is Wal-Mart and Amazon, from different competitive positions, are both going the digital and physical store route. H&R Block is attempting a similar strategy.Since tax preparation, by being digitized and offering DIY for simple returns, which represent the bulk of the market, is becoming commoditized, H&R Block, if it is to survive over the long term, has to find a way to differentiate.It believes it has found the answer in being the only company to offer an online and physical store option, along with assistance or DIY in the case of filing using the Internet. It is the increase in spending in order to develop a seamless experience across the two channels that the company is looking for long-term survival and success.There are two things to consider here. The first is the tax company can offer assistance with a live person in the store. The second is, if the customer files online, it can do it by themselves or get assistance over the Internet. The company's spending is related to the latter, where it wants to build out the service in a way users can easily go back and forth between the two with little or no friction to disrupt the experience. That's where H&R Block believes it can differentiate over the long term.Without a doubt the future of the business will be determined by whether or not it has accurately identified that as a legitimate differentiator, and if it can successfully execute the plan.Jones said in the earnings report that ""“By differentiating ourselves and demonstrating why we are the best choice for consumers, we will position H&R Block as a modern brand with momentum.”I agree with his word momentum. That is the key to the viability of the company over time. If it can prove it can overcome the DIY trend and ride it with its cross-channel strategy, it has a chance of taking market share back. The problem it has is it could take years to do so, and the results may be modest at best.Moody's recently revised its outlook for H&R Block or Block Financial LLC, from stable to negative, citing ""....strategy changes could prompt an unexpected competitive response or lead to other unanticipated adverse consequences that result in greater or longer-lasting revenue and profit declines,"" according to Edmond DeForest, Moody's Senior Credit Officer.The rating agency also noted that 2019 revenues will be down by as much as 3 percent and EBITDA margins will drop by more than 350 basis points as measured against 2018.Its senior unsecured rating remained at Baa3, with its senior unsecured shelf at Baa3 and its short term rating at Prime-3.Moody's said the credit profile of the company was ""constrained by the competitive nature of the industry which includes a large competitor in the do-it-yourself segment (Intuit Inc., A3 stable), the extremely seasonal nature of the company's revenues and cash flows and a slow shift by consumers toward do-it-yourself tax filing solutions and away from store-based paid providers which provides the preponderance of Block's profits and free cash flow.""At the same time, the benefit of the one-off $150 million added to its cash flow because of the 2017 Tax and Jobs Act, along with its position in the market, means its retains a strong liquidity position to launch it strategy.The Baa3 senior unsecured rating assigned to the company comes from the expected $300 million or so in free cash flow for 2019 and debt to EBITDA of approximately 2.5 times. Moody's also mentioned the fact it has 16 percent share and a highly recognizable brand in the tax business.On the negative side, it also is far behind the market leader in DIY market, where the primary growth in tax filing will be for a long time.The reason behind the downward revision in its outlook for H&R Block came from possibility it may not be able to stop the declines in revenue and profit margin in 2019, which would in turn reduce its free cash flow, boost its financial leverage, and result in a competitive disadvantage. Moody's said if it can grow revenue and profit margin during the year, it would adjust its outlook for the company back to stable. With a negative ratings outlook, Moody's won't look at a possible ratings upgrade within 12 months, and possibly not until 18 months.Moody's would consider an upgrade H&R Block can grow its revenue in the 3 percent to 5 percent range, have its debt to EBITDA at about 2 times, and its mix of assisted and DIY customers becomes more balanced. On the other hand, if it isn't able to do so, or the numbers drop further, H&R could find itself with a further downgrade in its ratings.Based upon comments from the management in relationship to its growth strategy going forward, and Moody's confirming it needs to be successful in order to grow revenue, it's obvious that the future of the company will be determined by its ability to execute on its plan to build a seamless cross-channel experience for its customers.It also means it has correctly identified what consumers want, which means they should be attracted to the idea of being able to engage in DIY and online assistance in order to successfully complete their taxes.With the comments of its CEO concerning the time he is thinking of related to ROI, going back to the 10 to 20 years he mentioned, it suggests he's not confident concerning the length of time it'll take to make the transition.The question is, how much pricing power does the company have on the assisted side of the business, as it pushes to transition to a cross-channel firm.Since it acknowledged it must find away to differentiate, and that differentiation has been determined to come from the implementation of a cross-channel strategy, the fate of the company is totally tied into the success of failure of the initiative.All of this sounds potentially ominous, and it could be over the long term, but the fact is, even with its many challenges, H&R Block does generate a lot of free cash flow, and it isn't likely to experience a sudden and significant drop in that part of its performance.A lot of the transition to DIY tax preparation has happened already in the U.S. Consequently, it has slowed down to a more moderate pace. That means if H&R Block wants to generate meaningful growth, it'll have to not only win some of the remaining business in that segment of the market, but win market share from its competitors as well.What remains to be seen is how the company will be able to find price support if it successfully navigates the waters leading to a cross-channel business, and what the margins and earnings will be afterwards, along with the level of free cash flow it can produce.On the share repurchase side of things, with the share price getting hammered, it would be relatively inexpensive to buy back some shares in order to support the share price. I think the company, with its increase in spending, is hesitant to do so until it sees its strategy starting to take hold.That isn't to say I don't think it will. What I mean is if it does take a long time to get a ROI on its spending, it could put downward pressure on its balance sheet, which could put it in danger of having its ratings outlook downwardly revised again.A key challenge for H&R Block is, even under the best-case scenario, its going to be hard to take back share from its larger competitor in the DIY segment of the market, which is where future growth resides. And if it does, the transition to DIY means the market for assisted tax returns continues to slow down, pointing to modest growth if it succeeds in its strategy.H&R Block will fail or succeed based upon its decision to differentiate with its cross-channel strategy. If if doesn't succeed with it, it'll gradually diminish in size in all parts of its business from year to year.For that reason I see it as a stock to trade more than a stock to invest in for the long term. As for shorting it, at this time it could be a mistake because the negative news has been priced in.Until there is confirmation one way or the other concerning its growth strategy, the stock will probably be rangebound."
4184252,104099,2018-06-27T10:59:02-04:00,"I think the shares of H&R Block have gotten ahead of themselves on the downside. The explanations I've heard for the share price drop don't stand up to scrutiny.I think investors would be wise to follow an insider and buy.The last time the shares have been this inexpensive, they rallied nicely.","Over the past year, the shares of H&R Block (NYSE:HRB) are down about 27% and that price move has put the company on my radar. I think investors would be wise to buy in at these levels, and I’ll go through my reasoning below by looking at the financial history here, and by modeling what I think is a reasonable forecast of future price based on dividend growth. I’ll also look at the stock itself, noting that the last time that it was this inexpensive on a price to free cash flow basis was the early summer of 2011. The shares subsequently rallied sharply. I’ll conclude with an appeal to authority. Before getting to all of that, though, I’ll comment on the market’s perceptions of the company’s woes. I’ll point out that some of the explanations I’ve heard for the share price drop don’t hold up under scrutiny. There may be some problems here, but the shares have gotten ahead of themselves on the downside. I plan to take advantage of the market’s despondency and I suggest other investors do the same.I’m confused about the reason for the recent share price drop. Did it drop because taxes are going to be simpler going forward? Did the shares tank because the company gave soft guidance?The explanation for the recent share price drop seems to be that the new simplified tax code will decimate companies like H&R Block. After all, when talking about the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, President Trump singled out H&R Block. He said, “The only people that aren’t going to like this (the tax bill) is H&R Block, they’re not going to be very happy. That’s probably one of the only companies in the country that’s not going to be thrilled.”So the market’s “thinking” went something like: Simpler tax codes means that fewer people need brick-and-mortar tax preparers like H&R Block. There are a few problems with this line of thinking though. First, the simplified tax code was hardly news when it was announced. If it was going to have such a revolutionary impact on tax returns, why did it not immediately crater H&R Block’s share price? Second, the assisted returns side of the business has been declining for years. It was down 60 basis points in 2018, and down 2.5% the year before that, and down 6% the year before that. The obvious (and ongoing) trend is that a greater percentage of the U.S. population is filing taxes themselves. The company seems to be capturing much of that growth, and is now positioned as the only tax preparer that allows consumers to be served however they want. I don’t believe the simplicity of the tax code will erode this competitive advantage.I also have a difficulty with the “revenue drop” explanation for the share price cratering. The company guided 2019 revenue between $3 billion and $3.05 billion (down ~4%), which would return revenue to what it was in 2017. Did this cause a 20% drop in the share price? That wouldn’t make sense in light of the fact that between 2015 and 2016, revenue declined - although by only 1.4% - and the shares didn’t suffer.All of this leaves me scratching my head wondering why the shares fell. When I can’t find a reasonable reason for a share price drop, that usually spells opportunity, which prompts me to delve more deeply.A quick review of the financial history here indicates that this is a fairly stable, but sometimes volatile business. Although revenue hasn’t grown much (at a CAGR of about .9%) over the past five years, net income is up at a CAGR of about 5% since 2014. I like finding companies that have the capacity to grow net income at a faster rate than revenue, as this suggests that the business model is scalable (i.e., a greater percentage of marginal revenue gets thrown directly to the bottom line). In addition, earnings per share are up at a CAGR of about 11% since 2014 on the back of reduced share count.I find it exceedingly difficult to judge the quality of management based on qualitative factors. How do you measure management’s “vision” when it seems that the only constant in business is change? Some unforeseeable change in market dynamics may make a particular strategy obsolete. When it comes to judging how shareholder friendly management is, then, I prefer to judge them based on what can be measured. I rate management as being “fairly” shareholder friendly by virtue of the fact that they have returned just over $2.65 billion to shareholders over the past five years alone (just over $1 billion from dividends, the balance from net share buybacks). I say “fairly” only because in 2018 they broke with tradition and diluted somewhat. I don’t consider this to be a deal breaker, especially in light of the fact that the company stated the following on the most recent earnings call:If I had influence on the company, I would say that now is a great time to opportunistically buy shares.Turning very quickly to the capital structure, I would suggest that this is one of the cleanest balance sheets I’ve seen in quite a while. There is a greater level of cash on hand than there is long-term debt. Additionally, the first significant maturity is in 2020 (43% of debt is due), then in 2022 (when 33.5% of debt is due), and then in 2025 (when 23.11% of debt is due). All of this suggests to me that the company is in no danger of a credit or solvency crisis anytime soon.Source: Company filings, 10-KWhile the financial history here has been fairly good, investors are understandably more interested in the future than in the past. With that in mind, I must spend some time trying to model a future price expectation for the shares. In order to do that, I’ll zero in on what I consider to be the most relevant driver of value (in this case the dividend) while holding all else constant.Since 2016, the dividend per share has grown at a CAGR of about 9.5%.While I think the combination of very strong cash position and low payout ratio (33%) means that this rate of growth is sustainable, I prefer to be conservative in my estimates. For that reason I’m going to assume an 8% growth rate for the dividends over the next four years. When I run that forecast, I estimate a CAGR for the shares of about 12%. I consider this to be a decent rate of return.Source: Author ForecastSuccessful investing involves finding the combination of great company and cheap stock. It’s possible to get one or the other of these things, but to do well at this, we need to find that perfect combination. I think I’ve demonstrated that this is a decent cash generator, but I must now focus in on the stock and answer whether it’s cheap or not. There are a few ways to do this, one of which I’ll outline below.The graphic below indicates that the stock is trading near the low end of its valuation on a price to free cash flow basis. Additionally, the last time the shares were this inexpensive (indicated by the red circle drawn by my very unsteady hand), the shares rallied nicely. While this is hardly a guarantee, it does indicate that anyone buying today will be buying near the low end of the valuation.Source: GurufocusThe fact of the matter is that not all investors are created equal. Some investors earn superior returns because they’re (forgive the redundancy) politicians of dubious moral character. Some, by dint of training and temperment, are simply better at this than the crowd. Some are talented investors because they happen to know about the company at which they work. When any of the last two of these make a move, we would be wise to at least take note. It’s with that in mind that I’d point out that filings indicate that Robert Gerard recently bought 1,000 shares of the company. I take some comfort when someone with intimate knowledge of the company is on the same side of a trade as me.There are a host of reasons to buy shares of H&R Block in my view. Although there may be some reasonable concern about the continuing switch from brick-and-mortar to DIY tax filing, the market seems to have gotten ahead of itself. The shares have not been this inexpensive for years, and when they were last this inexpensive, they rallied nicely. An insider is putting his own capital to work, which I consider to be a very good sign also. Although there may be some disruptions to this business (as there is to most), tax is one of those unfortunate inevitables, and this company will continue to help people file it. I think the current dividend yield is great compensation for investors while they wait for price and value to inevitably intersect."
4179317,101450,2018-06-04T18:06:54-04:00,"Despite claims by President Trump that new tax reform will be bad for H&R Block, the tax company posts its first filing volume growth in 5 years.H&R Block added 10.4 percent to its total online filing volume after revamping its digital offerings last year.Against its rival TurboTax, H&R Block posts higher volume growth numbers despite spending less on marketing suggesting the market leader could lose some market share.","On June 12, 2018, H&R Block (HRB) will report its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings after the market closes. Due to tax seasonality, this quarter will be the strongest of the year and the only one that does not result in a loss. Shares of HRB have been trending lower since tax reform was passed to simplify the tax code. Shares fell below $30 in September after tax reform passed and have remained below a resistance around $28.50. Since the beginning of 2018, trading has bounced off the $24.50 support line and is finally trending upwards on positive news.From FinvizNot many mid-caps manage to get targeted by the President of the United States, but HRB has been the exception. According to CNN, President Trump has mentioned H&R Block and its tax business multiple times. On the campaign trail, Trump said, ""I want to put H&R Block out of business"" and later this February, he commented on HRB's potential disproval of the new tax reform. The argument goes that a simplified tax filing system will eliminate the need for the everyday American to require assistance on its taxes. The threat was straightforward but not necessarily valid.From Kansas City Business JournalPresident Trump's claims that H&R Block would be hurting this tax season were partially invalidated by tax filing data reported by the Kansas City Business Journal. The source wrote on April 25th that HRB ""stemmed a five-year skid in total tax returns prepared"" in 2018 as returns prepared grew 2.6 percent to 19.87 million. A small decrease of 0.6 percent in assisted tax returns was offset by a larger increase in (DIY) online returns of 7 percent. Online clients alone increased 10.4 percent and drove most of the growth in volume.The positive results for the 2018 tax season suggest that, at least this year, more individuals felt the need to be assisted in filing taxes. With the new tax legislation only 6 months old and its effects being constantly debated in the media, this makes sense. Tax professionals are expected to be the experts on changes in the tax code, so naturally, they should see more demand when uncertainty surrounding tax legislation is introduced.Trump's comments, in fact, may have been more of a positive for H&R Block. Not only was it free publicity to help it boost its efforts against its major competitor Turbo Tax but the promise of lower taxes (no matter how valid the claim) might have pushed taxpayers to find a professional so they could get the most out of the credits and cuts for which they are eligible. However, this is not a sustainable trend, and 2019 numbers would be either flat or down.To boost organic growth, HRB is focusing more on the (DIY) segment where it sees more potential for growth in digital assistance. On top of the ""More Zero promotion"" which allows some taxpayers to file state and federal taxes for free, HRB released the new ""Tax Pro Go"" which allows consumers access to choose the type of assistance they want from H&R Block. These initiatives sparked growth that outperformed the market as ""IRS (DIY) e-files increased 2.4% on a day-to-day basis and comparable H&R Block volume increased 6.2%"" according to management in the Q3 conference call.Financially, HRB had a solid early tax season. Results in 2017 were relatively mixed major contractions of -8.7 percent and -21.7 percent in the assisted and (DIY) fee categories. Those numbers contradict the positive growth across the board seen in 2018 early season. DIY revenues still fell $8 million short of 2016 (DIY) revenues, but the ""reset"" in strategy helped boost volumes as seen in the Kansas City Business Journal numbers. Most importantly though, 2018 total revenue levels grew 8.1 percent and topped 2016 numbers by about $14 million. With the (DIY) digital category looking to grow the fastest in the coming years, that category should pick up the pace and continue to bolster total top-line growth.TurboTax data from IntuitHRB's expansion into the digital space will be met with resistance from Intuit's TurboTax which already claims a large share of the market. However, filing data for filings made up to April 25th representing the early tax season suggest HRB made some headway on its rivals. In both online and desktop filing volumes, HRB saw higher growth rates against its rival. In total, the company outgrew TurboTax by 3.0 percent.According to Accounting Today, marketing analyst Kantar Media reported that H&R Block spent less money than TurboTax on advertising, $93.4 million versus $81.2 million. Amazingly, this number is less than what HRB spent marketing and advertising in the 2017 and 2016 third quarters, $84.1 million and $93.7 million. The trend in lower marketing and higher growth could be caused by a migration of HRB's customers after the reset in (DIY) operations which would obscure new customer growth, but there's no way to be sure. Based on the numbers, it appears that HRB's focus on the (DIY) digital side is paying off and there may be more market share to take off of TurboTax.The upcoming earnings will be crucial as the final tax season numbers will be revealed, and investors will find out if the ""early season growth story"" can be extended. Keep an eye on how it performs against its competitor TurboTax, as these two players are the largest in the space at the moment. On positive results, shares of HRB might look to solidify a bullish upward trend on a breakout above the resistance above $28.50. Additionally, management guidance will be important to note as they may provide insight on whether the early season growth was caused by temporary forces or whether long-term prospects for growth look good."
4103067,33291,2017-08-30T14:08:40-04:00,"HRB has just reported earnings and the Street is punishing the name.We discuss financial performance but the outlook will not be better in view until the second quarter conference call when there is a clearer view on the upcoming tax season.Share's are being battered not due to performance, but uncertainty regarding the future.","H&R Block (HRB) has just reported earnings and the Street is pounding the name. We believe this has less to do with actual performance of the name, which for all intents and purposes, was generally in line with what was expected, and more to do with uncertainty for the future. You see, right now the company is in transition. A new CEO, Jeff Jones, has been appointed and will take the reins October 7th from acting interim CEO Tom Gerke. Management changes always lead to some volatility as there can be fears or excitement over the future direction of the company. In addition, Intuit (INTU) is seen a growing and genuine threat to the company as it continues to take market share, which was evidenced in its recent quarterly performance. In fact, not counting today's selloff, in the last year INTU shares have outperformed HRB shares by nearly 25%. That is noticeable. The question is, can you now buy this 7% dip today which has put the name at about 13.5 times 2018 expected earnings, or should you let it fall? Are better days ahead? Let's check in on the name to see where we are at, independent of uncertainty regarding the future.The truth is that performance is generally strong for the name, at least over the last few quarters. Of course, a cursory glance at the last few years of earnings show that the company historically has hit or miss results one way or the other. That helps drive the valuation at 14.5 times trailing earnings. The name is priced to see rather dull results. When it delivers, the stock moves higher. Today, the mostly in line report and uncertainty looking ahead is causing the bears to go after the name. While the bears are at work today, let us not forget that as the stock gets hit the dividend yield rises. Coming into today the report the stock yield was 3.28%. With today's selling the name now yields 3.51%. This yield protection could cushion some downside, but in today's market strong yields have been unable to help establish a floor under many names when the bears attack. The name is 4 points off a 52 week high, and so the stock is looking for direction. To continue higher we need to ensure that we have growth. Well, here in Q2, we saw revenues climb. Revenue as a whole came in at $137.8 million, and this beat estimates by $8.7 million. However, this was also up 10.1% year-over-year, continuing a string of winning quarters on the top line. In addition, the pace of rising revenues seems to be picking up steam.While sales were a stronger than expected, we must understand that the company posts losses in the fiscal first quarter due to the seasonality of the tax business. Frankly, no one is really using tax services in the summer, relatively speaking. The big money months are in the height of tax season, as you can imagine. Revenues this quarter were driven by some increases in services related to assisting with tax preparation, as well as with sales of the extended tax service protection plans offered. operating income really impressed. With the rise in revenues, we have to be on the lookout for rising expenses. That said, total operating expenses increased 13 million, or 4% to $323 million. Before taxes, we see a loss of $205 million, which was a wider loss than last yearIn terms of cash flow, H&R Block saw a net loss of $130.5 million from operations in the year, widening from negative $123.6 million last year. The company entered the quarter with $1.117 billion in cash and cash equivalents. Between the losses and dividends paid in the quarter, it ended the quarter with a cash balance of $668 million. This was a hidden positive in the quarter, as cash was up from $428 million a year ago. Factoring everything in, the company saw earnings of a loss of $0.62 per share. This was perfectly in line with consensus expectations.To try to boost value, the company has been buying back shares and bought $7.5 million worth of stock this quarter, far below last year's pace. In addition, the company paid out its quarterly dividend and that was good for $50 million returned to shareholders. The dividend was of course recently hiked to $0.24 quarterly. Looking ahead, for fiscal 2018, we won't get updated guidance on the year until the second quarter conference call when the company will have a better grasp on the upcoming tax season, possible competitive threats, and where the company is heading. With the uncertainty in the name right now and the company transitioning, we think it best if you remain on the sidelines here.Quad 7 Capital has been a leading contributor with Seeking Alpha since early 2012.

4136763,102830,2018-01-10T19:52:33-05:00,"H&R Block's dividend payment has consistently grown since 1996 (current yield of 3.63%).
        H&R Block's dividend has ample room to grow given a payout ratio of less than 50%.
        H&R Block's effective tax rate is high (~34%), so will see a meaningful benefit from the federal tax overhaul.","I'm always on the hunt for the next great dividend stock and H&R Block (HRB) satisfies all of the primary qualities I look for:H&R Block's stock has not really performed that well over the last couple of years and I consider it deeply undervalued. Better yet, H&R Block is in a good position to benefit from the federal tax overhaul, which I expect to boost earnings by around 20%.H&R Block's sales have been flat and its net income has actually trended down a bit over the last couple of years. However, earnings-per-share increased in 2017. That was a result of an aggressive stock buyback strategy that started in 2016 (you can see in the table below that H&R Block used some of its cash reserves and debt to drastically reduce share count). That sets H&R Block up for a record year in 2018 (Analysts expect earnings-per-share to come in at $1.98). My favorite thing about H&R Block is its quarterly dividend. Quite simply, any investor would have a hard time finding a more consistent dividend stock. H&R block has been increasing its dividend since 1996, a 21 year streak.The most important factor I look at in analyzing a dividend stock is its payout ratio, which tells me if the dividend payment is sustainable and if there's room to grow. I've seen a lot of stocks lately that have big yields, but are having trouble producing enough cash flow and must tap cash reserves or use debt to fund payments (Verizon (VZ) and Chevron (CVX) are examples). This is a big red flag to me, but H&R block doesn't fall into this category. Even though H&R Block has a nice 3.63% annual yield, their payout ratio in 2017 was only 41%. That's consistent with previous year's averages and leaves plenty of room to grow. As you can see by the statistics and charts below, H&R Block currently trades at discounts across the board. H&R Block does most of its business in the United States, so has a relatively high effective tax rate, which has averaged approximately 34% over the last 4 fiscal years. This means significant savings are coming in future years as a result of the new federal tax overhaul. H&R Block would have recorded an additional $349 million in net income from 2014 to 2017, which would be a 20% increase in profits.In today's bull market, it can be very difficult to find value, especially in dividend stocks given low interest rates. If you are an income-oriented investor, I consider now an excellent time to pick up H&R Block's stock. Overall, H&R Block is a consistent performer with ample free cash flow production, a growing dividend, and attractive valuations. H&R Block trades below all of its main historical averages and I've calculated significant upside potential based on a single-stage free cash flow model. I also like the earnings and cash flow boost that should come from the tax overhaul in future years."

However, the history of H&R Block (NYSE:HRB) shows otherwise. Per Chris Mayer's excellent book ""100 Baggers,"" the shares of H&R Block have given investors a total return from 1966 through 2014 of 2,873%. That is a compound annual return of 17.6% annually! This is an amazing return over such a long time period. The business is so good that it has previously ended up in the portfolio of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A) (NYSE:BRK.B) back in 2001.H&R Block has had some set-backs in recent years that have brought the stock price down from a high of $37 in December 2015 to just about $20 today. The stock is trading at a P/E ratio on 2016 earnings of 13.3 and yields over 4.2%. The main reason for the declining stock price was a ""miss"" in revenues due to a decrease in taxes filed in 2016 vs. 2015. Also another recent problem has been President's Trump rhetoric about simplifying the Tax Code so that H&R Block would not be happy.However, as we discuss below with some help from management slides, H&R Block still has much going for it and should be able to maintain excellent economics for a long time to come. In the last five years, H&R Block's new management has 1) simplified the business to focus on tax only, 2) returned lots of capital to shareholder via share repurchases and dividends, and 3) continued to invest in the future of the tax franchise. The basic model of helping people with their taxes, either in person or with software, will continue to provide shareholders very nice returns on equity for long time to come.New management took over H&R Block in 2011 and has aggressively altered the company from a diversified financial services company into only a ""tax"" and ""tax-plus"" company. This has made the company much more focused and simpler to understand and allowed management to buy back shares at an impressive rate.In addition to simplifying the company, management has repurchased more than 25% of the outstanding shares and raised the dividend by 33%. They have returned about 70% of the current $4.2 billion dollar market cap of the company to shareholders over the last 5 years!It may seem like H&R Block doesn't have much room to grow considering it has been around for such a long time and now Turbotax (NASDAQ:INTU) is a fierce competitor. However, there is still much market share for both Turbotax and H&R Block to take over the years from independent players and CPAs.One of the more recent worries around H&R Block stock has been that President Trump plans on killing the company by simplifying the tax code. It is interesting that no matter how simple or difficult the tax code is, people still want help with it. See this slide about how the tax code has grown since H&R Block was founded, but people still wanted help when the tax code was much simpler:ConclusionH&R Block is currently trading at a very reasonable price for such a stable and successful company. The company is making the right moves to focus on tax and capital allocation. Current fears over tax simplification are overblown and the company has room to grow. If the company can continue increasing its dividend and repurchasing its share as it has been, investors should see very good gains in the coming years as fears about tax reform effecting the company subside. As additional catalysts for growth, the company's recent marketing campaign featuring actor Jon Hamm (from Mad Men) and its partnership with IBM's Watson should provide some additional momentum this tax season."

(NASDAQ:INTU) and H&R Block (NYSE:HRB), have seen consistent growth over the years and are poised to continue that trend. Both companies report their quarterly earnings in the next 2 weeks.These companies, focused on customer expansion, cost management and operational efficiency have solid growth and value prospects that we believe will outperform the overall market in years to come. Over the past 5 years, both Intuit and H&R Block have outperformed the S&P500.The company operates in 3 segments: Small Business, Consumer Tax and ProConnect. Its small business segment includes financial accounting and payroll services, consumer tax includes its TurboTax product to allow individuals to submit their tax forms and ProConnect offers accounting and tax services for professional accountant in the United States and Canada.(Note: 1 year price chart for INTU, Money.net)The company has seen substantial and consistent growth over the past several years on behalf of its continued product innovation and offerings alongside rising employment in its consumer tax segment which generates 42% of revenues, rising over 10% year over year. Its international expansion has further aided market share growth and recent acquisitions are boosting inorganic sales and profit within the SMB (Small Business) segment.Notably, the company's online tax preparation software, QuickBooks Online for businesses and QuickBook Self-Employed for self-employed individuals, grew sequentially at a rapid pace of 59% and 100%, respectively.Intuit's market share capture and rapid growth in the self-employed market estimated to cover over 9M people, according to the Department of Labor Statistics, is a key growth driver and allows it to stay ahead of smaller players and ward off some competitors with customer retention.A look into Intuit's sales growth over the years alongside expectations for 2017 and 2018 shows a solid growth rate holding strong:Earnings growth shows a very similar picture with a solid uptick since 2015 and upbeat projections heading to FY 2018.Operation income should remain under some pressure in the upcoming quarters due to higher operating expenses on higher promotional, acquisition and expansion costs. The company expects, however, that higher revenues and cost cutting should minimize the effects on operating income.The company provides income tax return assistance for individuals and digital do-it-yourself services. The company operates in the United States, Canada, Australia and their respective territories.(Note: 1 year price chart for HRB, Money.net)The company is consistently working on enhancing its client base by expanding its product portfolio and its DIY (Do-It-Yourself) category. New digital initiatives should enhance monetization for its digital offerings and push solid sales growth as seen by historical sales figures and future expectations:A look at the company's profitability paints a slightly more optimistic picture:The company is working to aggressively lower costs and enhance operational efficiency through different initiatives which should help boost earnings growth over the long run.A major risk for the overall industry is stiff competition. With the likes of Paycom Software (NYSE:PAYC) and Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP), market share growth will be limited over the long run with client retention efforts and promotional activity to draw new customers.A further risk is the nature of the accounting business where sales are determined by client relations. Intuit has done a fine job maintaining good relationships over the years but we expect other companies to focus heavily on this retention aspect and create a higher degree of competition.Looking at sales and earnings growth alone, we see that Intuit is enjoying a stronger market share in the SMB and individual consumer tax segments, a trend that will likely continue throughout the upcoming years.A further compelling argument for Intuit is its low debt (~$500M) with a healthy cash flow vs. H&R Block which holds $1.49B in long term debt, paying roughly $22M in interest expense quarterly. This will hurt cash flows in the long run and create an unsustainable shareholder value environment. Intuit should continue to enjoy a healthy cash flow and shareholder value offering.Overall, we believe Intuit will generate solid returns through the upcoming years and outperform market benchmarks and peers with a solid online presence, inorganic growth and diverse business."

        This would be a premium of over 40% on the current share price.
        We don’t feel the original source is credible and that this is unlikely to occur.
        But we do think there is a potential turnaround coming in FY17 that makes this a good investment option.","We've fortunately had good success in the markets overall this year, but easily our most disappointing investment has been H&R Block (NYSE:HRB). Although a reasonably solid fourth quarter that beat analyst estimates and improved on last year's performance helped retrace a lot of its share price declines, we are still sitting on a 10% loss since our investment in March. But that would certainly change if recent speculation about the tax specialist looking to sell itself were to be true.According to the report on Zero Hedge by Cincarious Research, insiders have revealed that H&R Block has appointed Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) as the banker on a deal which it hopes will raise $35 per share. This is a 42% premium to the current share price and would value the company at approximately $7.5 billion.But is there any truth to this speculation? As fantastic as this would be for shareholders of this beaten down company, we don't believe there is. Well first things first, we're not entirely sure that we can class the source as being entirely credible. Cincarious Research is a new contributor to Zero Hedge with only one other article existing in the two weeks it has been a member. That article proclaimed that Dubai-based airline Emirates was going to announce the purchase of a controlling stake in rival Qatar Airways within a few days. Nothing has since eventuated as promised, other than one particular expert from Airline Reporter ridiculing this speculation as nonsensical.Credibility aside, would anyone actually pay $35 per share for H&R Block right now? Based on full year earnings per share of $1.59, this would equate to 22 times earnings. In our opinion this isn't by any means too far fetched. After all, its shares have traded in or around that range a fair bit in the last five years. But perhaps one thing to take into account is the differing earnings growth potential. Five years ago H&R Block was growing earnings at an incredibly rapid clip, whereas things have taken a real turn for the worse recently as the company gives up market share to its big online rivals and independents.But still, if a private equity firm thinks it can do a better job than management (not hard) and turnaround the company's fortunes then we feel $35 per share might be achievable. If H&R Block can get back to its glory days, then it will be worth a whole lot more than that.But we wouldn't suggest investing in its shares on the back of this news. This is of course only speculation and is very likely to be completely untrue unfortunately.However, we would suggest making an investment in H&R Block for its turnaround potential. Whilst we are not big fans of CEO Bill Cobb and feel his poor leadership is largely to blame for the decline in the company's fortunes, we do believe that Bill and the rest of his management team have learnt a great deal from this terrible tax season and will be better for it.On the recent earnings call he advised that the company will be aggressive in recapturing clients and arresting the volume decline that were seen on both sides of the business in the last tax season. We expect the next tax season to be just as competitive as this one, but this time management will approach it better. We can't imagine his tenure as CEO would continue much longer should he fail on this next year, especially after saying: ""Let me be clear, we will change the client loss trajectory and are hard at work to make this happen. Next season will not be all the same.""This fighting talk fills us with hope that H&R Block will indeed bounce back stronger next year. With this in mind we have forecast FY17 earnings per share of $1.77, up from the $1.59 this year. Due to its poor performance this year we feel investors may not be prepared to pay the 18 times earnings we have previously felt was a fair multiple for the shares to trade on. Instead we deem 16 times earnings to be about fair. As the chart at the top shows this is a discount to its usual range, but these are hard times after all.Based on this and our forecast we have a one-year price target of $28.32, equating to a return of around 15% from the current price. In our opinion this makes it a great option for investors, and one that provides enough upside potential to offset the downside risk."
4112056,103690,2017-10-06T07:58:27-04:00,H&R Block and Intuit have significantly different business models.H&R Block exhibits relatively flat revenue and operating income.Individual tax reform would significantly impact H&R Block if implemented.Conservative valuation of the company suggests the current decline may not represent a buying opportunity.,"H&R Block (NYSE: HRB) is a company that has become synonymous with individual tax preparation. With the recent decline in stock price, I looked to evaluate whether this presents a buying opportunity for investors. After reviewing the company's business and financial health, while also evaluating the looming concerns of increase competition from Intuit and potential tax reform, the stock seems to be fairly valued.HRB has seen a significant drop in its share price in the past month. The stock is currently trading at $26 which is 15% below its recent closing high year-to-date of $31, but also well above its recent closing low year-to-date of $20.(Source: Yahoo Finance)At first glance, there are aspects of the stock that make it attractive to a value investor, and suggest that the decline in HRB stock price could represent a potential buying opportunity. We see the following: (1) the stock price has seen a significant decline, (2) the company exceeded and met analysts' estimates for revenue and earnings, respectively, in the recent quarter, (3) the stock trades at a relative low P/E ratio of 13, and (4) the stock offers an attractive dividend yield of 3.7%. However, before making any quick judgement, the company's current operating environment, financial health, and its growth prospects must be taken into consideration.Each tax season, many individual do-it-yourself taxpayers think of two companies when preparing their tax return - H&R Block and Intuit. Both companies have become synonymous with tax preparation and are quite often viewed and compared to one another as rivals. In a quick look at the most recent five year time period, we see that INTU has significantly outperformed HRB and INTU currently trades at a premium valuation P/E ratio of 38 in comparison to HRB P/E ratio of 13.(Source: Yahoo Finance)To more appropriately compare H&R Block and Intuit, it is important to understand that the companies have significantly different business models. H&R Block's business focuses on services rendered to the general public, specifically individual taxpayers. In general, the company provides products and services in line with ""assisted income tax return preparation"" and ""digital do-it-yourself (DIY) tax solutions"" as described in the company's recent 10-K filing. The majority of the company's revenues are generated from U.S. assisted tax preparation and royalties from its franchises accounting for 71% of total revenue, while U.S. DIY tax preparation accounted for 7% in 2017.(Source: Chart created by Author, derived from information disclosed in Company's 10-K Filing)In contrast, Intuit provides products and services to small businesses and self-employed tax professionals in addition to individual taxpayers. Intuit currently has three business segments and is prominently known for its TurboTax products included in its Consumer Tax segment, its QuickBook products included in its Small Business segment, and its ProConnect products for self-employed tax professionals included in its ProConnect segment. Under the company's current business structure, the majority of its revenue is generated almost evenly by its Small Business and Consumer Tax segments - only an 8% difference between the two segments. From this, we see that Intuit has managed to diversify its revenue stream evenly between small business and individuals, which should provide for better financial stability for the company.(Source: Chart created by Author, derived from information disclosed in Company's 10-K Filing)Fears of H&R Block losing market share to rival Intuit have recently resurfaced. Interestingly, I reviewed the operating statistics disclosed by H&R Block, with a specific focus on the number of ""tax returns prepared."" I summarized the statistics below, but excluded ""free file"" tax returns from the analysis.(Source: Table created by Author, derived from information disclosed in Company's 10-K Filing)Per the table above, the number of U.S. assisted tax returns prepared by H&R Block is down 8% over three years, while the number of DIY and international tax returns have remained relatively constant. The decline in the number of assisted tax returns is not too surprising, given that there have been improvements and added product features to individual do-it-yourself tax preparation software, coupled with the general population becoming more literate with technology. However, what I had hoped to find was an increase in the number of DIY tax returns to offset the decline in assisted tax returns. This does not seem to be the case for H&R Block. While a decline in the number of U.S. assisted tax returns does raise some concern, it does not necessarily translate to a decline in profitability since preparation fees for each tax return vary based on complexity. For a clearer picture, we should look further at H&R Block's revenues and operating income.(Source: Chart and Table created by Author, derived from information disclosed in Company's 10-K and 10-Q Filings)The above chart shows that both total revenue and operating income in the past three years and recent first quarter have remained relatively flat to slightly lower.In contrast, Intuit has seen consistent growth in its revenues and operating income. In particular, to more closely compare to H&R Block, I looked at Intuit's Consumer Tax Segment which focuses on individual taxpayers. Intuit's Consumer Tax Segment has also seen consistent growth within the recent three year time period.(Source: Chart and Table created by Author, derived from information disclosed in Company's 10-K Filing)President Trump has begun to push efforts on implementing tax reform for not only businesses, but individual taxpayers as well. This has investors wary of the implications this could cause on the tax preparation industry as a whole.For the individual taxpayer, The New York Times reported that:So what's the impact to the tax preparation industry if tax reform is implemented? The details surrounding the tax reform are currently vague and there are genuine concerns on the feasibility. Thus, it is both a question of whether the tax reform will take place, and if so, what form will it take. From my perspective, and having worked in public accounting, if the tax reform does in fact simplify the tax preparation process for the general public and businesses, it will most certainly have a large impact on accounting firms and self-employed tax professionals that generate income due to the complexity of the tax law. In a previous section of this article, we have seen that H&R Block generates 71% of its revenue from U.S. assisted tax return preparation and royalty fees, thus a simplified tax code would obviously hurt its business. Logically, a simplified tax code would prompt more individual taxpayers to use DIY tax software as opposed to paying more to see an actual tax accountant or enrolled agent. H&R Block could still gain business in its DIY segment; however, its U.S. DIY business segment currently accounts for only 7% of total revenue. On the other hand, Intuit has a broader customer base which is expanded to small businesses and individuals. I would also classify Intuit as a software driven company, which prompts me to believe that Intuit is better poised to survive the tax reform, if implemented.To evaluate the current stock price of HRB, I utilized the discounted cash flow model. From what we have seen thus far, H&R Block is currently not a growth company, but there may still be some value in holding the stock for its attractive dividend yield, coupled with any slight appreciation in stock price.According to Reuters, the consensus analyst estimates for revenue for 2018 and 2019 are $3.07 million and $3.11 million, respectively. This would lead to about a 1% year-over-year increase for both 2018 and 2019. This seems fair, given that both revenue and operating income have remained relatively flat in the past three years.I utilized a conservative approach for the discounted cash flow model with (1) a cash flow time period of five years, (2) long-term growth rate of 1% for each of the five years, and (3) 0% perpetuity growth rate which significantly lowers the terminal value. The other inputs can be seen below.(Source: Selected information has been derived from the Company's 10-K and 10-Q Filings, with further assumptions and calculations by the author)The calculated weighted cost of capital was 5.0%; however, I would suggest using a higher discount rate given the concerns surrounding the company. A sensitivity analysis has been provided further below for this exact reason.Per the above, by utilizing the company's WACC of 5.0%, I arrive at an intrinsic value of $37; however, after evaluating the company's relatively flat revenue and operating income, along with the concerns revolving increased competition and tax reform, I personally would use a higher discount rate closer to 7%; which would imply that the stock is currently fairly valued and the decline in price may not necessarily be a buying opportunity.In conclusion, the recent significant decline in stock price for H&R Block does not seem to be a screaming buying opportunity and the stock seems to be trading close to fair value. That being said, H&R Block continues to currently ""hold ground"" in the tax preparation industry, alongside competitor Intuit. The company is exhibiting little growth, but it also is not on the decline. We see that revenues and operating income has remained relatively flat suggesting that it is not losing market share to Intuit as of yet. However, there are continued concerns of increased competition from Intuit, and looming potential tax reform which I believe would could certainly hurt H&R Block's business more so than Intuit's business. Simplifying the tax code would push more taxpayers down the do-it-yourself route, while H&R Block only generates a small portion of its revenue from its DIY products and services. If the company can attract more consumers and generate more revenue from its DIY products and services, the company will be better poised for the future. Tax preparation software companies will not go away with tax reform; as not many individuals will take the time to ""put pen to paper"" in manually filing out tax forms. This includes me as well, and I have worked on the ""other side"" as an accountant. Like many of you, I utilize the same readily available individual do-it-yourself tax software to prepare my family's tax returns, which is a save on time and energy. With all that said, I believe H&R Block stock is currently fairly valued after the recent decline in price; however, the price could decline further for the concerns discussed previously in this article. The dividend yield is attractive at 3.7%, but the current valuation and risks prevent me from initiating a new position in the stock.Thank you for taking the time to read my article and I hope that you found the information interesting and/or useful.

4025219,102469,2016-11-21T14:24:11-05:00,"Tax reform is one of key priorities of President-elect Donald Trump and Speaker Paul Ryan.Republican Blueprint wants to reduce the tax code from 73,000 to 1,000 pages. Our tax filing will fit on a 14-line postcard (picture below).Even without tax reform, H&R Block is structurally losing share to online filings like TurboTax from Intuit.But the tax reform will accelerate the shift to online filing and H&R Block's revenues could fall in half within 3-4 years.","H&R Block (NYSE:HRB) is facing three major headwindsOn that basis H&R Block's core U.S. assisted business might decline by more than 50% within 3-4 years.If that was the case and given the fixed nature of the SG&A, the H&R Block stock would fall significantly more than 50% and be seen as a candidate to join Circuit City, Borders, RadioShack and Blockbuster as the victims of digitalization.This is the proposal from the House Republicans for a 2018 tax filingOn Speaker Paul Ryan's initiative and under oversight from Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, the House Republicans published a blueprint for a tax reform. This blueprint shows what the Republicans have in mind in terms of tax simplification. Our tax filings could fit on a postcard (literally!):This is not just another legislative proposal. This is the one main area of competence and conviction of Paul Ryan. Tax reform is supported by virtually every Republican in the House. Every Republican presidential candidate had tax reform as one of their main policy angle.You get to a postcard-sized filing by reducing the number of pages in the tax code by as much as 98%The tax law is now 70,000 pages. Paul Ryan's proposal would shrink it to 1,000 pages.Donald Trump is a strong supporter of deregulation in general and particularly a simpler tax systemThat's what President-Elect Donald Trump had to say at his economic speech in Detroit:Mike Pence will play a key role in the tax reformVice-President Mike Pence is also a champion of low and simple taxes. His track record in Indiana: he cut taxes several times, killed the inheritance tax and repealed the estate tax. He wanted to repeal the personal property tax for businesses although the legislation only reduced it in the end. He also simplified the taxing of the sale of certain manufacturing equipment.It will be helpful that Pence is gaining influence in Donald Trump's inner circle by replacing Chris Christie as Chairman of the transition team. Mike Pence will also oversee liaison with Congress for the White House. As Pence and Ryan are good friends, the personal chemistry is aligned with the same policy convictions.This is not just a Republican priority; Senator Elizabeth Warren also strongly supports tax simplificationIn fact Elizabeth Warren introduced the Tax Filing Simplification Act earlier this year. This was strongly supported by both Democratic candidates Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton.Change doesn't happen… until it doesA situation of Republican sweep like now where Republicans control the White House and Congress is very rare. The only times it happened in the last 50 years was under George W. Bush between 2003-2007. The condition is as good as it gets for tax reform. This is two-in-fifty-years opportunity to make it happen. Conditions are even more favorable for tax reform than under Ronald Reagan, where the House was controlled by the Democrats.We have been used to six years of gridlock in Washington as legislative and executive power were split across party lines. But this has not always been the case. In 2008 Democrats had control of White House, House and Senate. Obama's key policy priority was Obamacare stimulus. It became law and had massive impact on healthcare sector. If your investments failed to benefit from healthcare reform under Obama, here is your chance to take advantage of the tax reform. Obama also passed the fiscal stimulus.The obvious beneficiary of the tax reform will be Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Apple has 42% of its market cap in cash. Assuming a 10% tax on repatriation, Apple could initiate a buyback or special dividend worth 38% of market cap. This would reduce its FY2017 P/E from 11.7x to 7.3x.Stanley Druckenmiller looks ahead and he sees a ""serious tax reform""Forget the last six years of gridlock in DC and imagine for a moment that tax reform can happen. You would be in good company. Stanley Druckenmiller mentioned on CNBC last week:What is the market for assisted tax-returns?Out of 170m households in America, 94m pay taxes and 76m don't (remember Mitt Romney deriding the 47% of Americans who don't pay taxes?).But 143m of households file an income tax return. And 84m of those do use professional assistance in the filing.H&R Block helps 21m out of those 84m households that file their tax returns with professional assistance (about 25% market share).The easy win in tax simplificationThere are around 50m households who file a tax return and don't pay any taxes. Both the House Republican blueprint and Donald Trump are acutely aware of that and want to address this cumbersome process.The House GOP blueprint wants to simplify tax breaks and tax credits and replace them with sizeable standard deductions. The standard deduction would be between $12,000 and $24,000.Obamacare was a significant tailwind for the tax preparation industry but this is about to be amendedThe Affordable Care Act (NYSE:ACA) requires nearly everyone in the U.S. to have health insurance or face potential tax penalties. This led to a demand for tax advice over the last couple years that is unlikely to be repeated.H&R Block is a shrinking business in any case as income tax filers prefer online software from competitorsOver 80% of the revenues are from the U.S. so I will focus on this.Assisted returns in the U.S. have come down by over 10% or 1.35m in the last two years. This compares to an increase of 0.25m in the DIY segment (Desktop, Online and Free File Alliance). H&R Block has lost close over 5% of its filers in the last two years as people switch to other online services like TurboTax from Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) and Liberty Tax (NASDAQ:TAX-OLD).More worrying, even the Desktop and Online version of H&R Block is losing customers:But even for the customers that shift to the H&R Block online services, the margin is much lowerDIY revenues (Desktop and Online) represent less than 10% of firmwide revenues and are 8x smaller than assisted returnsRevenues per assisted returns was $154 in FY2015. That compares to $35 of revenues for the DIY/software filers. Even assigning all the firmwide cost base to the Assisted Returns, the margin is much higher in Assisted Returns ($105) than in DIY Returns ($33). The shift to DIY returns is hence very dilutive to profitability.Note that the Free File Alliance is a service that H&R Block provides for free to households with income below $60,000 so I exclude them from the DIY returns.Pricing power has largely been tapped and benefits will decrease in futureAs can be seen in the table above, H&R Block resourced to price increases in its Assisted Returns business to defend revenues. Revenue per Assisted Return rose from $132 in 2013 to $154 in 2016. I don't think this is good news:As a result any untapped pricing power has largely been tapped.The bullish angle: stock buybacksStock buybacks have been a driver of the stock for a long time given its capital-light structure and low reinvestment possibilities. Berkshire even owed the stock for that very same reason. In fact shares outstanding are down close to 50% over the last 50 years.This buyback has been accelerated as H&R Block divested its bank subsidiary in 2015, freed itself from banking regulation and was able to relever to return cash to shareholders. This has been a bull angle on the stock as shares outstanding shrunk from 275m in April 2015 to 219m in July 2016.But now with leverage at 1.5x net debt/EBITDA, with shrinking EBITDA and rising interest rates, stock buybacks are unlikely to be a driver of the stock going forward.Net income trajectory and valuationNet income from continuing operations (excluding bank subsidiary) has gone from $474m in FY2015 to $374m in FY2016. The first quarter of FY 2017 is a seasonally low quarter for H&R Block given limited filings. Yet its net income deteriorated by $24m yoy. This leaves an LTM net income of $350m or $1.60 per share. This leaves the stock at 14.8x LTM P/E or a 2ppt discount to the S&P500. This is way too high for shrinking earnings (down 21% in the last year), particularly with a high likelihood of disruptive event coming.ConclusionI assume a third of the filers assisted by H&R Block can shift to self-filing thanks to the abolishment of the Alternative Minimum Tax, as well as simplification of deductions such that very few households will benefit from itemizing their deductions rather than using the higher standard deduction.Furthermore, the simplification of the tax return will accelerate the shift to online filings. On that basis H&R Block's top-line could decrease by more than 50% within a few years. In that case the stock would fall even more given the fixed nature of SG&A and the financial leverage."
4021684,101614,2016-11-12T15:12:52-05:00,"This company prepares about one in seven of all U.S. tax returns, and as the inventor of its business continues to stand above its peers.Its common stock is significantly down in the past year due to uncertain revenue and market share trends in the face of outperforming competition.A sure hand by management in the face of jadedness and overconfidence of Wall Street can still be telling in the long haul.","Rationale for this ArticleH&R Block (NYSE:HRB) is an S&P 500 company with a steadily growing 3.8% (at present) dividend. This company presented a turnaround story in 2011-12 by a well-credentialed new CEO. Reduced revenue in 2016 versus 2015, some loss of market share, and layoffs have been accompanied by a significant correction in common stock price over the past year, as well as fresh business model concerns by analysts. As a holder of a recently acquired position, I propose to reply to this situation.Most HRB revenue occurs during the January thru April tax season. At the next earnings release (Dec. 9), analysts will be looking for clues as to new direction and strategy by management. A new effect on the equation could be from U.S. election results with a traditional sounding Republican tax agenda in the wings.BackgroundH&R Block is a mid-cap business services company, with about 2,400 permanent employees; close to 95,000 total workers during the 2016 peak season; and a market cap of about $5 billion. It is in the business of providing services and tools for assisted as well as ""do-it-yourself"" U.S. federal and state tax returns for both straightforward and higher complexity situations.The 2016 HRB 10-K (pg. 2 and pg. 21-22) puts fiscal year 2016 revenue of H&R Block at $3.0 billion from 23.2 million tax returns. The company interacts with as many as 10,000 franchise offices in the U.S. and 12,000 worldwide. These offices are normally set up under 10-year terms. The cited 10-K pages illustrate flattening out and loss of revenue and tax return volume over the period 2014-15-16.While the business model might seem nearly as straightforward as that of e.g. Robert Half Inc. (NYSE:RHI), i.e. a network of local offices and staff, these resources could be considered to be a liability to HRB in the face of do-it-yourself trends, at least from a certain viewpoint. It must also be remembered that custom software development together with continuously changing requirements for do-it-yourself products add up to a significant undertaking.CompetitionThere are a number of other U.S. participants in the tax return sector. The largest of these are: Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU); Jackson Hewitt Tax Service Inc. (privately held); and Liberty Tax Inc. (NASDAQ:TAX-OLD).Jackson went thru bankruptcy in 2011, but still is the second largest tax preparer behind HRB, with over 2.5 million 2016 returns. Nearly 3,000 of its 5,700+ locations are within Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) stores across the country.Liberty, with its in-person sidewalk promoters, is the third largest U.S. tax preparer with 3,400 offices, 2.4 million assisted and online returns, and about $175 million in 2015 revenue.Intuit has about 7,900 employees, about 1,100 seasonal workers, and 2016 consumer tax product revenue of $1.97 billion. This company certainly has the attention of Wall Street with its robustly increasing Turbo Tax revenue (Intuit 2016 10-K pg. 37-38). The INTU stock price has been bid up beyond its present moneymaking trajectory, and an entry should be approached with caution.The Free File Alliance is a consortium of tax preparation companies, in partnership with the IRS, which provide online tax prep and filing for low complexity returns. While its mandate expires in 2020, this program might be expanded going forward, and should be considered a further risk to the business plan of H&R Block.Identity theft and other fraud, even targeting tax professionals, is a present threat which is being taken seriously by the IRS and the industry. The IRS has cautioned against unscrupulous tax preparers who take advantage of the 2010 Affordable Care Act.The Regulatory EnvironmentPreparation of individual tax returns is a lightly regulated business, under the ostensible assumption that accountability to the IRS is sufficient. The American Institute of CPAs opposes regulation of tax professionals on the grounds of low consumer benefit, additional expense, and unwanted strengthening of the IRS. The U.S. treasury inspector general report for the 2015 tax filing season can be viewed here.Since 2010, a bitter and increasingly polarized feud between Washington Republicans and Democrats spilled over into IRS funding reductions. This is reported to have been a reply by Republicans to IRS targeting of conservative groups, but seems to also be a reply to other perceived administration excesses. This situation puts a spotlight on a profound level of friction in our highest levels of government; however, 2016 election results offer the hope of considerable easing.Congressional Republicans and other interest groups have long sought to simplify our complex tax reporting process, e.g. with a VAT (goods and service) tax, a national sales tax, or a flat tax. For a side-by-side analysis of several proposed methods, see here.During the Reagan years (1981 thru 1987), a push was made for a flat tax with two postcard size forms (personal and business). This method was presented by its proponents in many venues across the country, and was cross-examined by tough audiences including radio call-in shows with remarkable success.A number of Russian republics and satellites adopted this type of tax return after the iron curtain came up in 1990. See here (article and reader comments) for a collection of views on the aftermath.A nonpartisan U.S. government effort needs to find a way to implement a simplified and efficient tax collection method, in the tradition of Alexander Hamilton and his revenue cutter concept. In the final analysis, such innovation has seemed too different and thus too hard to pass given our style and evolved legacy of government. Such legislation could pose a threat to HRB and its competitors. We will have to see if Washington can now accomplish what was not doable in previous decades.Tax Preparation at the Grass RootsPractically everyone has to report taxes each year, and the subject no doubt generates a significant amount of black humor due in no small part to the over-the-top and grotesque complexity of the tax code. Among a set of associated statistics, it is estimated that as many as 60% of individuals still seek professional assistance for their returns.For an interesting history of the 1040 form, see here. For a survey of the cost of a prepared return (as a function of schedules needed), see here.I prepared my own taxes since university days, and have routinely made use of Intuit products both for estimating and for mail-in filing. However, after a string of corrections without explanations by my state revenue service, as well as stubborn Turbo Tax errors which repeatedly prevented electronic filing over a period of years, I finally retained a local accountant to complete my returns as well as strategize from time to time. Another reason I do this is for assurance of backup if an audit ever occurs.Not a few individuals have had difficulties in the last few years with do-it-yourself products from both H&R Block and from Intuit, with evidence found in numerous Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) reviews. There is still a place for assisted filing, not only for computer-illiterate parents, but for individuals who want to make sure to get it right.H&R Block supports do-it-yourself returns; straightforward returns (by most of its offices); and more involved situations (by Block Advisors). HRB continuously seeks to partner with or acquire independent accountant businesses (10-K pg. 23-24), and maintains other programs to incentivize customers, e.g. cash advances for the upcoming 2016 tax return season.Balance Sheet Through 2016The 2016 HRB 10-K pg. 40 reported $13.00/share in total assets at the end of fiscal 2016, based on 220 million shares of diluted common (10-K pg. 42).This is comparable with $12.15/share in total contractual obligations, which is categorized in the following table (10-K pg. 32).A repurchase of $2 billion in common stock during FY 2016 at an average price of $35.46/share (10-K pg. 30) virtually reset shareholder equity for this company. All share buybacks since 2011 add up to 25% of outstanding shares at $26.38/share (investor presentation slide 21).Moody's and S&P have set investment grade ratings for H&R Block debt, as noted in the table below. S&P put its credit rating on negative watch as of June 2016.Funds from OperationCourtesy: FAST GraphsThe above chart indicates operating cash flow (orange line) for HRB over the last 20 years compared to its stock price (black line). The FAST Graphs chart concept recognizes that the balance sheet and other intangibles can significantly color the overall investment picture; nonetheless, takeaways from the chart are:1. The growing dividend (white line and light green area) is well covered by cash flow;2. The stock valuation has been in a buy range for several years (in the dark green area). A historic comparison of stock price versus operating cash flow indicates to me that the market has maintained a cautious view of this company for some time.3. Operating cash flow in previous years has been inconsistent; however, turnaround and simplification efforts beginning in 2011-12 were meant to improve on this situation.It should be mentioned that Federal and state settlements over historic company activities (i.e. corporate tax reporting methods, loan practices, IRA account marketing, unfairness to those with disabilities) have also held HRB back.Synopsis of an Investor Viewpoint1. Dividend growth remains a priority for a wide group of investors. As long as operating cash flow is maintained to safely support a growing dividend, this should be viewed as a shareholder-friendly company.2. There may have been tax or other corporate advantages to 2015 share buybacks, but I propose that this company find better usage for shareholder equity. Share buybacks ought to be scheduled on a steady and yearly basis rather than in large increments.3. Since 2011-12, this company simplified its model from a supermarket of financial services to tax management, i.e. before-during-after tax season (investor presentation slides 14-15). HRB also divested its H&R Block Bank in 2015 (10-K pg. 46-47), thereby eliminating Federal Reserve regulation upon itself as a savings and loan entity. These steps make sense for the business.4. HRB has designated a chief innovation officer to find new ways of attracting clients. A perusal of its news releases over the past few years (e.g. school initiatives) indicates that this company is using its head to utilize its presence on the ground as a competitive advantage. I would suggest professionally taken photos for all long-term employees as well as practical classes at local offices during tax season, with questions and answers to support do-it-yourselfers.5. This company should emphasize its strengths, and not be spooked by the success of its competition. Revenue trends are only established over multiple years, and HRB can still respond to apparent trend shifts in the past few years.Analyst and Ownership ProfileAccording to exchange records, out of 219 million HRB shares outstanding at present, about 95% of these shares are held by 472 financial institutions of various types. I consider this to be a vote of confidence by those who manage large sets of funds.Several insider purchases of common stock have occurred in the past year. Short interest has recently grown from 10 days to 15.5 days to cover, evidence that short sellers are still circling. Stock price can be volatile at the next earnings call, and an entry level should be established with caution. Nonetheless, I propose that this stock has a bottom in place at 20, and a position may be built from here.Mood of the MarketThis security was bid up swiftly during 2012 thru 2015, consistent with turnaround hopes after poor performance up thru 2011. The significant drop in 2016 is consistent with disappointments over revenue and market share behavior.While company strategy is the only news item in the next earnings call, major market players may not approve, or hedge funds may see HRB as a target for their short side activities.Having said this, the market's response to the June 2016 10-K release/earnings call was not negative, perhaps due to year-over-year loss of revenue being less severe than expected.ConclusionWith all things considered, I have taken partial positions in this security at this time (long in an IRA account, short puts in a retail account). I may add to these positions depending on the approach of management and the attitude of major market players going forward."

Market share loss more severe than market expectations. Sell side attributes this to a weak start to the tax season but volumes processed by H&R Block (NYSE:HRB) for Q3 were down 8% for company, 19% for franchises, and 12% year on year for 2015. Returns per office were down 11.2% for both company-owned and franchised offices. The IRS reported that total returns received was down 1.3% and self-prepared/DIY up 3% season to date. This shows DIY category share gain compared to assisted but also shows H&R Block volumes are weak even within assisted category, suggesting share loss in assisted and lack of competitive positioning in DIY (16% market share compared to Turbotax's 62% and a 5-point lower net promoter score).Full 2016 filing statistics show that weakness in returns filing persisted through the entire season, which shows weakness we saw earlier in the season is not just delayed filing (Returns received down 5.8% for the full season). Revenue growth driven by fee/return growth of 4% instead of volume growth. As more government pressure on tax preparer pricing mounts and DIY competition product quality increases, fee increase driven growth is not sustainable, especially in the context of 1040 form filers who pay in office fees of over $100.2. Franchise buyback hides economics of market share loss by inflating revenue (recognizing full return revenue instead of 30% of return revenue in the form of royalties) and volume processed by the company and is reflected in EBITDA margin deterioration. Also, management guides to repurchase an additional 260 franchises in 2016, totaling 600 franchise repurchases down from 650 and cannot clearly articulate the thesis for repurchases. Franchise underperformance also points to branding weakness, since strong software, training programs, and marketing should make H&R Block an attractive franchising opportunity.Amortization for reacquired franchise rights is also understated, since management has changed weighted average life for reacquired franchise rights from 6 years to 7 years sometime between end of FY 2015 and Q3 2016 so that total amortization now is calculated over an average of 6 instead of 5 years. Management articulation of purpose of franchise buybacks varies from call to call over the past year and comes just a few years after selling those franchises in the first place.Not obviously true, franchise returns/unit and fee/unit growth are stronger than company-owned (need to look at per unit for 2015 due to reacquisitions) with returns/office declining 4.6% for company but only 2.6% for franchisees and fees/unit increasing 1.4% for franchisees and basically flat for company.CEO in another call:""I think they're doing marginally better than the company side, which is driving the company side crazy because they're sort of competitive with each other.""3. Block Advisors is questionable initiativeThis has been tried before and failed: CEO Mark Ernst purchased Olde Discount Brokerage, tried to turn into full service brokerage, later sold off Airbnb (AIRB) partnership, which led to Yelp (NYSE:YELP) reviews claiming tax advisor did not know how to deal with Airbnb income. H&R Block depends on quality of advisors it either attracts or trains. It cannot attract very good advisors since good advisors can charge lower fees than H&R Block and keep more than H&R Block's hourly wage. H&R Block's training seems subpar/highly variable for initial recruits. If H&R Block increases investment in training, EBITDA margin will significantly suffer and it's unclear H&R Block has an advantage in training.4. Sell side bullish on share buybacks - interestingly, share buybacks are occurring at the same time insiders have sold net 402,296 shares in 2015 with no purchases.No certainties in life other than death and taxes - does not mean market share maintenance is a certainty.(Editors' Note: This is a republication of an entry in the Sohn Investment Idea Contest.

3968624,97176,2016-04-27T15:47:58-04:00,"H&R Block handled 5.8% fewer returns this tax season, and looks likely to have lost market share to Intuit.Although this has been a terrible tax season, the company is expecting revenue to come in around the same level as last year.CEO William Cobb has vowed that action will be taken and FY 2017 will be very different.With the shares paying a dividend which yields 3.6%, this could be a great long-term investment for income investors.We expect the dividend to grow strongly over the next few years as its earnings grow.","Normally such a reliable performer, H&R Block (NYSE:HRB) has become anything but that currently. The company has had a disastrous tax season as consumers seemingly shift to filing returns electronically. Whilst this shouldn't necessarily be a huge problem as the company provides software for this exact purpose, it appears the consumer has turned to rival Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) for their software needs, leaving H&R Block questioning how things could go wrong so quickly.Every year millions of tax returns are filed, and every year as technology advances it becomes more and more apparent that people are switching to filing them electronically rather than face-to-face through one of H&R Block's tax advisors. So much so, it has just announced it is laying off 250 employees as part of its cost-cutting plans. This will reduce the current workforce by 12.6% to a total of 1,735. A difficult decision, but arguably a smart move by management in this challenging environment.The cost-cutting came as a result of the company handling 5.8% fewer tax returns this season as volume fell to 12.2 million. Perhaps the most worrying aspect of this is that it wasn't just face-to-face filings that fell, its software filings also fell. This time by 2.6% as companies like Intuit appeared to steal market share away from the company through price cuts.We are sure there are many now wondering if CEO William Cobb is up to the job. But in fairness, he has held his hand up and taken personal responsibility for these failings. Although the company has lost well over a third of its market value in the last six months, we feel he should be given time to get things right in fiscal 2017.He does seem confident that the company will come back stronger from this, which does make the shares a very tempting option when the market opens today. At present the shares are expected to open down by around 6%. This would leave the shares yielding a 3.6% dividend, as well as offer the prospect for share price gains in the future.As the chart shows above, the company has grown its dividend at a reasonable rate in the past 10 years whilst maintaining a modest payout ratio. We do believe the company will be able to get its act together in the future and start growing its earnings again. This should allow it to grow its dividend at a similarly consistent rate, making this a great long-term pick for income investors.Although many are calling this tax season a disaster, it is worth noting that the company managed to pull in reasonably strong levels of revenue, all things considered, and is still expected to produce earnings per share only a little lower than what was produced last year.So by next year we expect cost-cuttings and an overhaul of the business strategy to help the company grow its earnings in the region of 10%. We see the dividend growing at this rate, or maybe even greater as the company rewards shareholders for keeping the faith, meaning potentially a FY 2017 dividend of at least 88 cents.All the while its share price, which has been sold to three-year low, has plenty of room to grow in the next twelve months. It is for this reason we do plan on snapping up shares when the market opens today. We have a tendency to buy and hold with certain investments and this looks like one that we will be doing that with.If the company does grow both its earnings and dividend at a reasonably good rate for the next five years then the total returns we would expect from buying in at this price will be mouth-watering. The company may be going through an incredibly tough time as technology catches up on it, but it has the knowledge, the name, and the resources to get back on track and start to grow its bottom line once again.Even at a modest price-to-earnings ratio of 15, which is far lower than its 5-year average of 18.76, we would see the stock being fair value at $26.10 today. As we expect earnings to come in flat for the year that is also our one-year price target. Depending on where the stock opens at today, this will be a total return of at least 14% when you include the dividend.Troubling times, but things will improve."

3962525,25120,2016-04-01T10:24:15-04:00,"H&R Block has become a pure-play on prepared tax returns in recent years.While the company failed to grow topline sales, share repurchases have created value for investors.A focus on the core and appealing valuation, outweigh the impact of a somewhat leveraged balance sheet and poor growth track record.","H&R Block (NYSE:HRB) is the largest tax service provider which has turned itself into a pure play in recent years.The company prepared over 24 million tax returns in its fiscal year of 2014, generating $3.0 billion in revenues. This translates into average revenues of $125 per tax return, yet it was certainly worthwhile for its average customer. In total, H&R claims that its clients obtained more than $50 billion in refunds, credits and benefits, for an average of little over $2,000 per return.A Focus On The CoreThe last decade has been kind of sloppy for H&R Block. The company has been a target of activist investors, while management turnover was very high. No less than 4 different CEOs were leading the company in the period 2007-2011.Under the current leadership, the company has rapidly increased its focus on the core tax preparation businesses. This meant exiting the mortgage and banking activities, while the company introduced new products such as the ""New tax plus"" strategy in order to be busier during the non-tax season.New products include the provision of credit ahead of tax returns, Emerald debit cards, as well as after-tax services. While it is very lucrative for H&R Block to service its customers through its professionals, it offers (online) services for do-it-yourself customers as well. The company remains very much leveraged to the US. The vast majority of the 24 million tax preparations are done in the US. Canada is good for some 2.7 million filing and Australia for another 0.8 million filings per annum.This more simple structure and exit of capital-intensive banking businesses freed up a low of cash. This cash has largely been used to buy back shares. The company bought back over 76 million shares since 2011 at an average price of little over $26 per share. Painful have been the 40 million shares which have been bought back at $37 per share last summer. These ""rushed"" buybacks, following the divestiture of the banking activities, have been executed at high prices and have leveraged up the balance sheet.The company believes that the tax-preparation business continues to see a bright long term future. The increased complexity of the tax code, additional complexity from the Affordable Care Act, and increased crackdown on fraud, should all drive this growth.As always, tax preparation is a very seasonable business. In January and February there is an early season peak, followed by a greater peak at the end of April as the season is ending.The Transformation Still Has To Prove ItselfThe focus to become a pure-tax preparer has resulted in some lost revenues. The company posted sales of $4.9 billion in 2006, a number which has fallen towards $2.9 billion in 2012/2013. Revenues have been largely stable ever since, coming in just above the $3 billion mark at the moment.While this look very unsatisfactory, the increased focus allowed for operating margins to rise from their high-teens in 2006, towards 25% for the fiscal year of 2015. Even better, a lot of capital has been released, allowing for sizable share buybacks. The outstanding share base has been reduced from 334 million shares in 2006 towards 224 million at the moment, marking a reduction in the outstanding float by roughly a third.The share price has kept reasonable track with the earnings per share developments. Shares traded around $20 in 2006, only to fall to $10 in the years thereafter as the diversified strategy was not working. The pure-focus strategy led to a recovery towards a $25-$35 trading range since 2013. At the moment shares have fallen towards the lower end of the range following recent disappointments.What Is The Problem?Until the autumn of 2015, nothing was going wrong, at least for the shareholders in H&R Block. The divestiture of the bank activities, and share repurchases which followed, have pushed shares to a level of $37 per share, accompanied by a decent dividend. A weaker second quarter, but notably the third quarter results in early March put significant pressure on the shares. At the moment shares have fallen towards the $26 mark, translating into a 25-30% retreat from recent highs.Third quarter revenues, as reported early in March, fell by nearly 7% to $475 million. Part of this relates to the divestiture of the bank activities, while the strong dollar had a limited impact as well. The real issue is that the company saw weakness in tax preparation volumes. The good news is that part of this results from a trend towards later filings, suggesting that part of these revenues could be caught up with.What is worse is the impact of these revenue declines on the bottom line. A $34 million reduction in revenues resulted in net losses increasing by $44 million to $79 million. Part of the increase in losses was the result of the increase in leverage being taken on by the company.Buybacks continued and reduced the outstanding share base to 224 million shares. The more stable business model allows for an increase in leverage, as management was eager to benefit from the lower share price as well. At the moment, H&R Block holds merely $260 million in cash and equivalents while the debt load has risen towards $2.6 billion, for a net debt load of $2.3 billion.What About The Tax Season?H&R Block posted a loss of $81 million for the first three quarters of the year, up from $37 million in the corresponding period a year earlier. All of this was ahead of the key tax season which corresponds to the fourth quarter of the company's fiscal year.These results are pretty meaningless as all of the company's profits and roughly 75% of sales are generated in the fiscal fourth quarter. Last year, the company posted annual sales of roughly $3.0 billion, (of which $2.3 billion in the fourth quarter), while full year earnings amounted to $473 million and adjusted EBITDA totaled $950 million.While the company is behind schedule in the third quarter, it is not unthinkable to repeat last year's full year results. Based on 224 million shares, earnings could come in at roughly $2.00 per share, implying a merely 13 times earnings multiple. Even if the results are not attainable, the multiple seems to be quite appealing.This is not very high for a stable margin and revenue business. The net debt load of $2.3 billion is somewhat elevated due to continued share buybacks, as leverage is seen around 2.5 times adjusted EBITDA. As the strong fourth quarter cash flows are currently coming in, the leverage ratio is likely to fall significantly in the coming quarter.Final ThoughtsI think that H&R Block has made the right strategic moves and benefits from long term favorable trends, including the continued complexity of the tax code and crackdown on fraud. Worrying are the trends of do-it-yourself as sophisticated software packages which could offset the continued increase in complexity of the tax code.The trouble is that the company relies more heavily on the tax strategy following the strategy to become a pure-play. This creates a lot of earnings volatility, something which investors generally do not like.This volatility and the somewhat elevated leverage ratio are both small concerns of mine, certainly as these buybacks have been ill-timed. That being said, a 25-30% decline from last year's high is sizable for a generally stable business, even as leverage is on the higher side. If earnings of $2.00 per share are reasonably within reach, (either this year, or next year) I see no reason why shares could not recover to a range of $30-35 per share following the fourth quarter."
3742536,23757,2015-12-08T18:19:52-05:00,"Total federal tax returns are expected rise only 1% annually over the next decade.Despite an improving economy and employment, paid tax prep share is falling.New customers due to ACA and the company's new ""Block Advisors"" initiative may drive growth.","We have been long-time holders of H&R Block (NYSE:HRB), with our first investment in the shares dating back to 2009. With many of the previous overhangs on the company now in the past, the shares are trading at post-recession highs as of this writing. With this in mind, we thought it would be a good time to evaluate whether H&R Block still remains an attractive investment going into this year's tax season, or if it might be time to finally sell in favor of investing in a more undervalued company.Before we dive to deep into discussing the outlook for H&R Block, let's get one of the most important things out of the way first. With HRB finally consummating the sale of its bank assets, the stock has a speculative acquisition premium built in. Now that it is not subject to any banking regulations, many are speculating the company would be an attractive candidate for a buyout by a private equity firm due to its large, stable cash flows. This scenario is a little less likely, with HRB recently expanding its credit facility by $500M and issuing $1B in new long-term debt to fund share buybacks (primarily to adjust the company's capital structure in the wake of the sale of its banking operations). With that out of the way, let's take a look at what the next few tax seasons should bring.Slow Growth in Number of Tax Filers and Paid Tax PrepThe biggest driver of revenue and profit growth for HRB over the long term will be the total number of tax returns filed. On that front, there is something to worry about. According to IRS projections, the total number of federal tax filings is expected to grow, on average, only 1% per year from 2013 (the newest data available) to 2022. Total federal tax returns are expected to grow from 209.6M in 2013 to 231.5M in 2022. It's worth noting that individual tax returns (of which there were approximately 147M filed for the last tax year) are primarily what H&R Block deals with; however, we would expect individual tax returns to grow at approximately the same rate as the overall tax return market.Perhaps a bit more worrying is that the number of filers using paid tax preparers has been declining, as the graph below shows. (Data sources: IRS data, HRB corporate presentations)This chart should be particularly alarming, because unemployment has gone down during the last few years. While the economy isn't running at full steam, it is improving or, at worse, flatlining, so we should have seen more people utilizing paid tax prep services as their economic situation improved and they had both more complicated tax returns and money to pay a preparer. Instead, we see preparer returns falling slightly, which means the traditional paid tax preparation industry may be under greater threat from the tax prep software industry than was first thought. However, there is a ray of hope for paid tax preparers with new regulations and increased personal income tax complications from the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The current sentiment is that the ACA will drive more business to paid preparers and reverse the small declines in tax prep share that they have seen over the past few years.In any case, it's no surprise that HRB is now focusing on more than just individual tax returns. The company's latest investor presentation highlights its new ""Block Advisors"" line of business, which aims to serve individuals and small businesses that require year-round tax services.For HRB, growth above the 1% annual increase in individual tax filers is going to have to come from other adjacent tax markets, and the company seems to realize this with its new expansions.HRB Trading at Premium Valuation Whether or not the stock is worth holding on to or investing in depends upon the price as well the market's expectations for the company. H&R Block currently sports a P/E of 20.6, according to Morningstar, which means it is roughly in line with the market. Value Line is estimating that the company will grow net income from $487.5M this year to $645M in the 2018-2020 time frame. That's an average annual increase of 5.8% (from calendar year 2014 to calendar year 2019). That strikes us as a bit aggressive considering the long-term trends at work in the tax market.Another way to look at what the market is expecting, and our preferred method, is a reverse DCF model. For H&R Block, we are using a discount rate of 10% and assuming a long-term perpetual growth rate of 3%. HRB had 266.3M shares outstanding, with $1.7B in cash on hand, $505M in long-term debt (HRB's recapitalization had not yet taken place as of its latest quarterly filing) as well as $230M in held-to-maturity mortgage securities (leftover from its mortgage operations during the housing bubble). During its last fiscal year, the company generated a little less than $600M ($595.87M, to be exact) in free cash flow after accounting for working capital fluctuations. Working backwards from a share price of approximately $37 as of this writing implies a ten-year growth rate of around 3%.SummaryIn summary, it looks like H&R Block is probably fairly to perhaps slightly overvalued at this point. Our preferred reverse discounted cash flow model is implying growth of 3%, which, while difficult, is certainly achievable. HRB will have a tailwind of a 1% increase in total tax filers now. Add in an increase in customers due to the ACA and some moderate success with the company's new ""Block Advisors"" and online DIY and assisted initiatives, and you could make a case for 3% annual growth in cash flows. On the flip side, the gradual decline in the share of paid tax prep could make it tough for H&R Block to meet expectations.Right now, I don't think investors would be wise to jump into shares of H&R Block, nor do I think current investors should worry about selling. Currently, HRB seems to be one of those fairly valued investments that might be worth selling if a better opportunity comes along. With the currently volatility in the market, some better opportunities might just show up!"

One company that will be hoping to be in the thoughts of the millions of tax payers is H&R Block Inc. (NYSE:HRB).H&R Block is the world's largest provider of tax return preparation and related services and products. Although it provides its services worldwide, its main source of revenue is the US market.After years of not quite knowing what it actually wanted to be, much like a child in school thinking about their future, H&R Block finally seems to have found itself by going back to its roots and concentrating on tax. The divestiture of its bank was a great move, freeing up capital and allowing it to repurchase some $3.5 billion worth of shares through to 2019.(Source: Company Presentation)Last year the company handled 1 out of 7 tax returns in the United States. We expect this to hold firm in 2016 which, with increased tax returns expected to be filed, should produce good levels of revenue growth. Unemployment levels being at seven-year lows will undoubtedly provide the company with an expanding target market, as well as its growing international businesses.At the company's investor day management stated its belief that tax returns will grow at a steady rate.While this growth is hardly going to make investors sprint to their phones to call their brokerages, one thing we must consider is the growth in market share that the company can potentially achieve.We're sure most people will agree that Obamacare has made taxes that little bit trickier. These added complexities are all it takes to have people seek assistance and who better to go to than H&R Block with their 11,000 US locations? This number of locations means that according to their 2015 Annual Report the company is situated within 5 miles of most Americans. We believe this level of omnipresence is what will give them an edge over its competitors.On the promotional side of things the company is currently undertaking a 32 day $32 million giveaway promotion, which we believe is a great way raise awareness at just the right time as tax season begins.We believe that the digital segment will be key to accelerating growth in the future. Other than when you have a complex tax return, you're very likely to be able to handle it by filing it online. The digital service provided will be key to capturing this business. It's not the only player in the arena though. The company faces stiff competition from Liberty Tax (NASDAQ:TAX) and Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) which provides the TurboTax software.But we feel the company will prevail here due in part to its overwhelming presence and association with the industry.(Source: Company Presentation)With consumer awareness up to 67% and growing by the year, we feel the company's digital offering will be the first stop for those that file online, providing the software is up to scratch. The feedback from users so far has being positive, which gives us confidence moving forward.Looking ahead we expect margins to expand in fiscal 2016. As shown below, they have been improving in the last few years. Most recently they have come under a bit of pressure from negative impacts of the bank divestiture, but we expect this to ease allowing for improvements in fiscal years 2016 and 2017. In the medium-term we expect the EBITDA to trend up towards the 32% mark, as per management guidance at its recent investor day.(Source: Ycharts)So what does this all mean for shareholders? Well, firstly, looking at the current share price it means great things. In the last three months the share price has lost over 10%, which has really brought the stock to a very investable price for us.For fiscal 2016 we anticipate revenue of $3.2 billion dollars and earnings per share of $1.96 from it. This is an increase of 3.9% and 12%, respectively, year over year.(Source: Ycharts)Trading at an average price to earnings ratio of 18 in the last five years, we see great gains for shareholders, based on this and our earnings forecast. We have set a one-year price target of $35.10, or approximately a 10% return from where it is trading now.Due to our expectation of the company growing market share further in 2017 we anticipate earnings growth to continue in the mid-teens and the share price to appreciate in line with this growth.TakeawayFor us, H&R Block represents a great investment. Tax will always be around, as will consumers wanting to maximise their returns. As the unemployment level reaches record 7 year lows, we see tax returns increasing steadily and H&R Block being positioned perfectly to benefit."

Having recommended the shares, and seen great gains, those gains were completely wiped out in one fell swoop. While we are very disappointed, we do feel that the selloff was overly excessive and have averaged down in anticipation of a rebound.We were a little surprised by the selloff. The report was not good, by any means, but we are still in the middle of tax season, so we feel the company's performance would be better judged on its full-year results. This could make for a good buying opportunity with some quick and easy gains.Management has blamed a lot of the third quarter's failings on a delay in tax filing. It estimates that 2 million fewer Americans have filed their tax returns as they had this time last year. Why they have decided to delay filing their tax returns is a good question, and one H&R Block can only speculate on. Management had this to say on its earnings call:Perhaps fraud was far worse than it appeared and, as such, these figures are the new normal. Whatever the true reason, the fourth quarter is going to be very revealing.We still maintain that H&R Block is a good long-term investment. As the company transitions into small business services with its Block Advisors brand, we see it producing a new revenue stream to help boost its top line growth. Block Advisors will use highly qualified advisors to provide tax, accounting, payroll, and accounts receivable.This does, of course, put it up against Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) in more than one way now. Previously, it had been competing solely with Intuit's Turbo Tax software, but now it is squaring off with its QuickBooks software also. We do feel there is a market for both companies. There are those that like to manage things themselves and will happily use specialized software. Then there are those that would rather speak to someone and have it handled by a professional. We fall into the former, but admittedly do at times come across tax questions that even Google can't help us with. The more complex your business structure gets, the more likely you are to seek professional support. The recent rise in small businesses in the United States could be a catalyst for growth for H&R Block moving forward.Sourced from Finviz.comThe poor third quarter has been met by a couple of downgrades from analysts, as shown above. Both Wedbush and BMO Capital have lowered H&R Block's price target to $32. This is still representative of an upside of 15%. So, it's actually not a bad time to invest or average down.The market has lowered its full-year earnings expectation now from $1.91 to $1.79. This for us is very much achievable, and we would expect a decent rally should the company achieve it. We've always felt 18 times earnings was appropriate for H&R Block, and following this recent selloff, it is more or less exactly where the shares have ended up. With trailing earnings per share coming in at $1.57, this means the shares currently trade on a trailing price-to-earnings ratio of 17.7.If the company can produce earnings per share of $1.79, then this gives us a price target of $32.22, and upside of 16%. At this price, we feel H&R Block is primed for strong shareholder returns, and due to our losses we have averaged down accordingly.It is a hard time to be a shareholder of H&R Block, but we have high hopes that the third quarter was just a blip and put our faith in management turning this sinking ship around."
3957313,23757,2016-03-10T08:16:31-05:00,The US Treasury publishes a daily report that includes information on the IRS and tax refunds.You can compare this years refunds to last year's refunds to get a picture of how fast returns are being filed.This report would have given investors advance notice of H&R Block's poor Q3 earnings.,"A few months ago we wrote an article detailing why we were considering selling our long held stake in H&R Block (NYSE:HRB) if a better opportunity came along. A few months after publishing that article and prior to H&R Block reporting third quarter earnings we sold out of the stock. It's a good thing we did!On March 3rd, 2016 H&R Block reported third quarter earnings for 2016. They reported below consensus results with a drop in tax returns prepared and revenue compared to the prior year. The next day the stock finished down over 15%. In their press release H&R Block reported ""The decline in the company's U.S. tax return volumes followed the industry-wide decline in filings through mid-February, which the company believes are primarily the result of the ongoing impact of tax fraud and related prevention measures, delayed refunds, and the effect of the Affordable Care Act (ACA).""Now, I'll let you in on a little secret that would have let you know about these problems and how you can use what amounts to ""inside information"" to monitor an important part of the tax preparation sector.Every business day the US Department of the Treasury Bureau of the Fiscal Service publishes the Daily Treasury Statement. This invaluable report details all of the money flowing in and out of the US Treasury and Federal Reserve. This report includes the all important tax refund information. If you go to the website and pull up any of the daily statements you will be greeted with a two page report. The information we want is at the very bottom of the last page on the right hand side. I've highlighted in red in the graphic below where to find the tax refund information.Since H&R Block primarily caters to individuals we are just concerned with refunds issued to individuals and not those issued to businesses. This report gives readers real time (ok, lagged by one business day) insight into the IRS and the tax return world. By comparing how fast tax refunds are being sent out we can see how quickly people are filing their taxes and how fast the IRS is sending out refunds.What I did is graphed the cumulative daily refunds by check and EFT for individuals this year (TY2015) compared to last year (TY2014).As you can see the refunds have been slow to go out with most not being sent out until February 10th this year and as of the end of February refunds still have not caught up to the same pace as the previous year.H&R Block's third quarter ended on January 31st so the big jump in February would not have been included.With this data investors could see that H&R Block was likely to report weak results. True, you would not have known if it was a company specific problem or issues with the IRS but you would know that H&R Block was likely to disappoint. As we can see things started to improve by mid February. If March and April continue to show improvement and we see refunds start to accelerate and rise above last year's level H&R Block should report decent fourth quarter results. If you are currently an investor in H&R Block I'd suggest paying close attention to the refund data the US Treasury makes available as it can give you valuable insight into how the company may perform. Also, any traders out there who like to make beats on a company's earnings should find this little known data source gives them a leg up on everyone else."
3959567,98366,2016-03-18T12:40:39-04:00,"H&R Block shares are down 21% in the last month.A disappointing third quarter caused a mass exodus.We believe the fourth quarter could produce bumper earnings, setting things right again.Rising levels of disposable income could mean the public have been putting off doing their tax returns, as there is less urgency for many compared to previous years.","They say that nothing in life is certain but death and taxes. Whilst that may be true, one thing that is uncertain is how American's are filing their tax returns. In its third quarter results H&R Block (NYSE:HRB) revealed that they have now suffered their fourth consecutive year of volume declines. The third quarter is a loss-maker for the company traditionally, but this was quarter's loss was far greater than the market expected. But could there be an opportunity for an investment here? We think there might be.H&R Block's third quarter saw the company post a 7% decline in revenue year over year to $475 million in revenue. The market had been expecting $502 million. On the bottom line things were much worse, where the company went from a $37 million loss in the third quarter of 2015, to a $79 million loss in the latest period. This meant a loss per share of 34 cents, when the market was expecting a loss of just 24 cents. This makes for terrible reading and it comes as no surprise that the share price has cratered because of it.Shareholders have had to endure a decline of 22.1% in the last 30 days. We can't imagine the shares staying down at these low levels for a prolonged period though, and believe there is potential for an investment here if we can see light at the end of the tunnel.The tunnel certainly is dark, though. The third quarter is a difficult quarter to judge the company on, as it is the fourth quarter which is the real bread-winner. But the early indications haven't been too good. The company has placed the blame for this on a general decline in the volume of tax returns, as well as the impact of the divestiture of the H&R Block bank.One thing that market clearly isn't too pleased with is the company's interest expense which is shown on the chart above. Whilst this isn't necessarily excessive, it certainly hurts the bottom line on the three loss-making quarters. The reason for the jump is that the company issued $1 billion of debt as part of its share repurchase program. We are all for company's buying back stock when they have excess cash reserves. It's a great way of returning money to shareholders. But to take on debt, even in a low interest environment, to conduct a buyback is not something we are too keen on. We feel this will be another thing contributing to negative sentiment in the market.There are positives though. The new small business service that the company launched could become a big revenue driver for the company in the future. Block Advisors will go a step further than tax and cover things like payroll and bookkeeping. This seems like a great initiative and we look forward to seeing how it progresses.As we have said earlier, the fourth quarter is the big quarter. If it is just a question of people filing tax returns late then it promises to be a bumper quarter for the company. If it is that they are filing themselves online or through another provider like Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) then things could become a little worrying.We do have suspicions that it will prove to be the former. Therefore, we see a long-term investment now having a strong probability of success. Let's be honest, tax is not going away as much as we would love it to. Should face-to-face tax preparation become a dying breed, we are sure that H&R Block are positioned better than anyone to shift their focus to whatever the tax return trend becomes. Because of this we feel a long-term investment is quite secure here.We are expecting full-year earnings to come in at $1.80 per share thanks to higher levels of tax returns than the market is expecting. We put this down to procrastination of the public. Tax returns are becoming that little bit more complex and its easy to keep putting it off. Also, the higher levels of disposable income from savings on low energy and fuel costs mean there may not be as much urgency as in previous years. If the public are that little bit better off, they can afford themselves the luxury of a little bit of procrastination.As you can see on the chart shown above, 18 times earnings seems to be a fair multiple for the shares to trade at traditionally. Sentiment may keep it from reaching this level for a little while, but we have little doubt that a strong fourth quarter will take it there. Priced at 18 times earnings gives us a target price of $32.40, equating to a return of 20% from the current share price.This makes it a great investment in our opinion and ticks all our boxes for a great turnaround story. For all the troubles the company has had in the third quarter, the fourth quarter has the potential to ease market concerns and we fully expect it to do so."

We follow a value discipline in our investments. Our portfolios have two components. Generally undervalued companies that are profitable, free cash flow producing companies with solid balance sheets trading below our calculated intrinsic value. The other component of our portfolio is special situations.Tender offers are one of the types of special situations we look at. Often companies repurchase their shares via tender offers. This could be due to lack of trading volume among other reasons.In this article I will discuss the tender offer by H&R Block.H&R Block (NYSE:HRB) is the company that helps consumers file their tax returns. On September 1, HRB closed the deal to sell their Bank division to BOFI. As a result, HRB is no longer regulated as a savings and loan company. That is a pretty big change for them. HRB announced a $3.5Billion share repurchase program and capital structure plan. As the first step in this program, HRB launched a modified dutch tender auction on September 2nd to repurchase up to $1.5 Billion of common stock or 16% of shares outstanding. That is a pretty big buyback!Key StatsMarket Cap $9.75 BillionShares 276MShare Price $35.3 ( September 28, 2015)Here is some language from the press releaseShare Repurchase ProgramConsistent with its long-standing philosophy on shareholder returns, the company announced today that its Board of Directors has approved a new $3.5 billion share repurchase program, effective through June 2019. The company currently intends to repurchase its shares over time through a combination of the tender offer referred to below and open market purchases, and may also repurchase shares through private transactions, exchange offers, additional tender offers or other means. The company intends to fund this program through available cash, borrowings and incremental debt as described below, and funds from ongoing business operations.Overall Leverage CapacityH&R Block believes it has capacity to increase its leverage while maintaining investment grade credit ratings metrics. The company currently believes that a ratio of adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) of approximately 2.5x to 3.0x would be consistent with the company's previously stated intention to maintain investment grade ratings metrics. The company calculates adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDA using a fiscal four-quarter rolling average of total outstanding gross debt (both short-term and long-term) and includes adjustments for items such as operating leases which are not capitalized on the company's balance sheet.""Modified Dutch Auction"" Tender OfferUnder the new share repurchase program, the company announced today that it plans to launch a ""modified Dutch auction"" tender offer to purchase up to $1.5 billion of its common stock, at a price per share of not less than $32.25 and not greater than $37.00. The tender offer will be contingent upon, among other customary items, the successful closing of a new Committed Line of Credit, as described below, and satisfaction of other customary conditions. Additional details regarding the pricing and other terms will be provided upon formal commencement of the tender offer.As of Aug. 31, 2015, H&R Block had approximately 276.4 million shares outstanding. The company intends to use a combination of available cash, borrowings and incremental debt to fund the tender offer and related expenses.Now lets get to the tender offer.Price range:The price range for the offer is $32.25 to $37.Expiration Date:October 2, 2015Number of shares being bought:At the min price of $32.25, 46.5M shares will be purchased. (16.8% of shares)At the max price of $37, 40.5M shares will be purchased. (14.7% of shares)Source of funds:The maximum aggregate purchase price for the Shares purchased in the Offer will be $1,500,000,000, unless the Offer is amended. We expect to fund the purchase of Shares in the Offer with a combination of available cash, borrowings under the 2015 Credit Facility (as defined below) that Block Financial intends to enter into prior to the consummation of the Offer (and that will be guaranteed by the Company) and/or proceeds of any incremental debt Block Financial may issue prior to the consummation of the Offer. The Offer is subject to satisfaction or waiver of the Financing Condition. This means that if we are not able to satisfy the Financing Condition, we will not be required to close the Offer. Proceeds from the borrowings under the 2015 Credit Facility are expected to be available at least five business days prior to the Expiration Time.Block Financial is a party to a five-year, $1.5 billion unsecured committed line of credit governed by a Credit and Guarantee Agreement, dated as of August 17, 2012 (the ""2012 Credit Facility""). We expect that prior to the consummation of the Offer, Block Financial will enter into a new credit agreement (the ""2015 Credit Facility"") that will replace the 2012 Credit Facility. The 2015 Credit Facility amount and terms will be determined based upon market conditions at the time of the closing of the 2015 Credit Facility. If the Financing Condition is satisfied or waived, we will promptly disclose this information and extend the Offer to the extent required by Rule 13e-4 under the Exchange Act.Potential UpsideBased on current price of $35.3 and the tender range of $32.25 to $37, the downside to the min price is -8.7% and upside to the max price is 4.8%. At current prices, the risk reward is not great. With 4 days to expiry, Mr. Market may provide a better entry point in this tender offer.Risks:Any tender offer has risks. The risk of the tender offer being cancelled or modified is present in each offer. While it is possible, this seems a less likely risk as the company has outlined its long term repurchase plan and this tender is part of the capital structure changes.The key risk is the proration risk. If more shares are tendered than being repurchased, then the company will buy back only the max 40-46M shares. An additional 2% shares may be purchased at the choice of the company. If an investor is only buying shares for the tender offer and does not want to hold post tender, he will have to sell the remaining shares. The eventual outcome of the tender offer will then depend on what price he can sell the returned shares. There is no way to estimate what the price action would be post tender offer. There is no way to know if there will be any proration or not.The other minor risk was the financing condition that was discussed in the Source of funds section above. That has been satisfied as per the recent press release.HRB as a Value investment?In a filing, HRB released pro-forma numbers for the year ended April 30, 2015. This excludes the Bank segment.Here are some key numbersRevenues: $3BillionEBT: $712MNet Income: $468MEPS: $1.7Net Cash $800MFrom a quick look at the recent 10-K, it appears that FCF was $500M. This includes both businesses but I am thinking if anything this number would be higher as the bank was a drag on HRB profitability.Assume 40M shares are bought back in the tender offer, Shares outstanding would drop to 236M.Market cap ($37*236): $8.7BEPS : $2 ( ignoring the effects of interest)P/E: 18.5xP/FCF: 17.5xWhile not immediately attractive on the surface, given the aggressive plans to return excess capital to shareholders via dividends and buybacks, HRB is certainly one to keep an eye on.Conclusion: HRB has a large tender offer in place to purchase 14-16% of outstanding shares. Assuming there is proration in the offer, the outcome of the investment likely depends on the proration amount and price action post the tender offer. Mr. Market may provide a better entry price for the tender offer in the coming days. HRB is also worth keeping an eye on as a potential long term investment."
3723246,97176,2015-12-01T05:57:13-05:00,"H&R Block  stand to benefit greatly from current low unemployment levels in the US.As 93.5% of revenue comes from the US, the company is largely unaffected by a strong USD.H&R Block Bank has been closed, and the company are now focusing on its core business.","The PitchWith the US unemployment rate at its lowest level since before the global financial crisis, a number of businesses stand to benefit greatly. None, in my opinion, more so directly than a rejuvenated H&R Block (NYSE:HRB), which provides tax preparation services to the general public.The ThesisAs you can see on the chart below, H&R Block's revenues have a lagging but strong correlation with US Total Nonfarm Payrolls. From the company's 2015 10-K, it was apparent that 93.5% of revenue came from the US market, which makes this increase in Nonfarm Payrolls extremely significant for H&R Block. More employed persons of course means more tax returns filed overall, and a larger market to operate in. The catalyst needed to take the stock even higher.(Source: YCharts, BLS)The Overseas GrowthThe other 6.5% of revenue comes largely from two growing markets overseas: Canada and Australia. Although their respective currencies have depreciated quite considerably versus the US dollar, the Canadian dollar down 14.47% YTD and the Australian dollar down around 12% YTD, revenues in US dollars have still increased encouragingly this year.There are also operations in Brazil and India, which, although small now, could offer substantial future growth in coming years. Management has stated numerous times, most recently in the company's 2015 10-K, that it has no plans to repatriate cash from overseas, and intends instead to reinvest it in overseas operations indefinitely. For this reason, to evaluate performance overseas, I feel it is best to judge the growth in returns filed rather than USD revenue. Looking at it this way, we can see that the 4-year CAGR for returns filed overseas is a healthy 3.76%.The Repurchase ProgramNow that H&R Block Bank has been closed, HRB, no longer regulated as the savings and loan holding company, is implementing a new capital structure plan highlighted by a $3.5 billion share repurchase program. With a market cap of $10.14 billion, this is a huge program for the company. I have great confidence that the changes HRB makes will add great value to shareholders. It promises some fantastic returns, and should hold firm the already impressive margins.Management has done a great job of increasing margins. Against the competition, Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) and Liberty Tax (TAX), H&R Block is producing much stronger operating margins, currently at 25.37% on a trailing twelve-month basis.The Affordable Health Act (ACA) opportunityIn 2015, taxes and healthcare intersected for the first time, which caused confusion and affected millions. CEO William C. Cobb said on a recent conference call that he believes HRB ""is the best positioned tax preparation company to meet taxpayers' ACA needs, and the work we have done has positioned us to be their trusted advisor going forward."" I tend to agree with his statement. I believe that if people are worried about the penalties imposed for not having healthcare insurance, there could be a large uptake, and a large uptake presents itself with more and more people that will potentially be in need of a trusted advisor to help them with their tax returns. This could steer people away from Intuit's software and into the welcoming arms of H&R Block's agents.The ValuationAs the company pays a consistent dividend, I have used a dividend discount model (""DDM"") earnings multiplier to determine a fair price-to-earnings ratio of 20.43.In its 2015 10-K, HRB stated that it handles 1 in 7 tax returns in the United States. I estimate this to be 1 in 7.28 (13.74%), and forecast in our financial model that this will become 1 in 7.3 (13.7% of 150.75 million tax returns) in 2016 and 1 in 7.4 (13.51% of 151.13 million tax returns) in 2017, due to the predicted increase in total tax returns filed. The table below explains how a change of just 10 basis points in the share of total tax returns filed could affect the company's top and bottom lines.I am forecasting 2016 revenue of $3.141 billion, up 2.07% YoY, and diluted earnings per share of $2.11, up 20.36% YoY. In 2017, I anticipate similar growth, with earnings per share of $2.35 on revenue of $3.195 billion.Now we've got our earnings forecast, we can look at what this means to you, the shareholder. I believe that the company's fair price-to-earnings ratio is 20.5x, which I've rounded up from the DDM earnings multiplier result of 20.43. As you can see below, if forecasted earnings are achieved, then I would reason a share price of $43.27 in 2016 and $48.20 in 2017 as being fair. This promises returns of 17.95% and 31.36%, respectively. Add your dividend of approximately 2% per annum in there too, and you're looking at a fantastic total return.As always, I like to look at a worst-case scenario situation and what that means for shareholders. In this case, it's an earnings miss coming in at the low end of analysts' expectations, with diluted earnings per share of $1.95 and $2.25 in 2016 and 2017, respectively. In this scenario, I feel a drop in the P/E ratio is probable, as expectations are dampened. Thus, my expectations are for a 2016 target price of $37.05 and a 2017 target price of $42.95. This means little by way of reward initially, but by being patient, there's still a return of 16.52% waiting for you in 2017, as well as the approximate annual 2% dividend yield. Not a terrible worst-case scenario.ConclusionH&R Block is a great company with a strong management team and business model. At the current share price, it becomes a fantastic long investment opportunity for investors, with little downside risk due to the aggressive repurchase plans in place."
3966446,23142,2016-04-20T01:10:26-04:00,"Baseball and investing have their similarities and the beginning of spring is a great time to think about both of them.In baseball terms, we have little interest in guessing which years our companies will produce the highest batting average.What matters is the totality of their work, not their volatility from season to season.","""It breaks your heart. It is designed to break your heart. The game begins in the spring, when everything else begins again, and it blossoms in the summer, filling the afternoons and evenings, and then as soon as the chill rains come, it stops and leaves you to face the fall alone. You count on it, rely on it to buffer the passage of time.""― A. Bartlett GiamattiAs we enter April, baseball comes to mind while the Major League Baseball Season begins. Commissioner Giamatti's thoughts are apropos and reflect on baseball across the seasons of the year for players and the fanatics of the sport. Baseball carries many similarities to investing. There are a myriad of investment opportunities among stocks, bonds and other investment products much like there are thousands of events in a baseball season, like plate appearances, outs and runs. The one constant in the investment world and baseball is change. Change during the year. Change over the years.Both games reset all the time, asking the competitors on the field to bring their highest level of competition. There is the excitement of twilight in the summer and success in investment holdings. There can be disappointment at the end of most seasons in the fall and sometimes poor investment results. Both are part of the constancy of the games. For baseball fans, they have a team or a player they root for. However, in the world of investing, some advocate for an approach of not trying to root for or own a winner. The urge to passively participate in investing without a team to root for lies in industry jargon like volatility and risk-adjusted returns, but do those views on investing ever spell outright success like a World Series Championship or a Hall of Fame induction?A Player to OwnTed Williams is regarded as one of the greatest hitters in baseball history. Williams' batting average in 1941 was .406. For non-baseball enthusiasts, a batting average above .300 is widely regarded as above average. That 1941 season was the last year a player has hit over .400! In hindsight, it is easy to evaluate the success that Ted Williams had during the 1941 season, but was it easy to sit through as the owner of his contract?The 1941 season was only Ted's third in the major league. He didn't have a large body of work to prove his prowess as a great hitter. He started off the season with an injury that nagged him and as he saw more at bats in early May, his batting average plummeted to .310 for the season. A change in batting average like that sounds like a lot of volatility for an outstanding hitter to have. At that point in the season, the naysayers were probably assuming the worst for Ted's batting average. However, by the close of the season, he had produced a most remarkable year.Owning a Great Season vs. Owning a Great CareerWilliams' career is one of consistency, but it was not one without stumbles. He followed his 1941 season batting .356 in 1942. The owner of the team had to continue to feel good about his ownership of Williams' contract. This all ended as Williams went to fight in World War II, missing three seasons from 1943-1945. After the war ended, Williams picked up where he left off, batting .342, .343, .369 and .343 in the four years that followed.In 1950, Williams' games were limited by injury, batting only .317 that year, a far cry from where his career had been up to that point. How did the owner feel about his lack of production that year? There was a lot of ""volatility"" in his plate appearances and batting average. He returned in 1951 to a full season of games, but still didn't hit near as well as his prior years and finished the year hitting .317.Prior to the 1954 season, Williams had missed parts of five seasons to the military, one season to injury and in his last full season (1951) had one of the lowest batting averages of his career. What is an owner to do? Frustrating? Yes. Did this make it pointless to continue on with Ted Williams on your roster? Indexing probably looked very attractive at this point.Willie Mays (who some regard as the greatest baseball player ever) commented on Williams saying, ""Ted Williams was the best pure hitter I ever saw."" He proved this through the remainder of his career starting in the 1954 season when he hit .345, followed by .356 in 1955 and .345 in 1956. Maybe the greatest achievement of Williams' career was in 1957, when, at the age of 39, he led the league with a .388 average (with 33 intentional walks). A 39-year old man hitting .388 is unheard of, but was indicative of the great hitter that people came to know as he built his Hall of Fame body of work.Where are the Great Pure Hitters in Stocks Today?Thanks to the use and popularity of passive investments, many market participants are asking if it is possible to find pure hitters among individual stocks. The claims are that the volatility and the lack of consistency make it impossible for investors to stay with a ten-to-twenty year contract. At Smead Capital Management, our eight criteria guide us to seek out pure hitters in stocks among the shares of companies that have already exhibited greatness in their past, much like Ted Williams.H&R Block (NYSE:HRB)H&R Block was started by brothers Henry and Richard Bloch in 1946 in Kansas City, Missouri. H&R Block is the largest and most widely recognized tax preparation company in the United States of America. The original H&R Block franchise was actually a creation of circumstance. Henry and Richard tried to sell their H&R Block tax preparation practice to new operators to move to New York City to expand the H&R Block clientele. The buyers weren't able to pay the price, so the Blochs took a payment that included future royalties on their Kansas City-based practice. Born from this situation is a large franchise model for tax professionals to leverage the H&R Block brand.Going back to the earliest data that we can get our hands on, H&R Block has produced an 88.33 fold increase in value versus a 42.92 fold increase in the S&P 500 Index from July 31, 1980, to March 31, 2016. This was a return of 13.41% compounded over the almost 36-year period. Today, H&R Block has a market cap of around $5 billion. The company is anticipated to produce $488 million in free cash flow in 2016. Below is a look at their return on equity from 2011 through their fiscal year-end April 30, 2015.1Much like Williams hitting .388 at the age of 39, H&R Block could produce returns on equity, which are unheard of. It's unlike almost anything we've ever seen in a company. It shows the investor how little capital is needed in the day-to-day operations of their business.H&R Block hit an all-time high in December of last year at $37.53 before a lonely fall to a price around $24.15. The depressed price is the product of both political parties promoting simplified tax code ideas and fears of consumer adoption of do-it-yourself tax preparation. Hearkening back to Giamatti, that kind of price movement ""breaks your heart"" leaving you to ""face the fall alone."" Investing, much like baseball, does that regularly. This has brought the stock to trading at 11.56 times the next 12-month earnings estimates. You can hear the naysayers in the stadium crowd complaining over the sub-par plate appearances in the interim.Baseball and investing have their similarities and the beginning of spring is a great time to think about both of them. At Smead Capital Management, we look for meritorious companies which have stumbled or are fighting off tough seasons with an injury. In baseball terms, we have little interest in guessing which years our companies will produce the highest batting average. We'd rather understand how long they can have strong plate appearances year after year. What matters is the totality of their work, not their volatility from season to season.1 Source: BloombergThe information contained in this missive represents Smead Capital Management's opinions, and should not be construed as personalized or individualized investment advice and are subject to change.

The company's 90,000 accountants provide retail tax services, finding and obtaining tax credits and refunds for its clients. H&R Block reports filing 24.2 million tax returns over the past fiscal year and claims to have filed 1 out of every 7 tax returns the United States. The second portion of HRB's tax services, digital tax services, allows clients to use software to file and complete tax forms, which are then reviewed and approved by HRB employees. HRB's main competitors are INTU, which focuses on the digital tax services side of the business, and TAX, which has hands in both sides of the tax services business.Investment ThesisWe believe that H&R Block has a better business model than its competitors, and financial metrics support the theory that HRB will grow at a faster rate and for a longer period of time than competitors like INTU and TAX. P/E ratios support the idea that HRB will grow in order to match patterns of the industry, and other financial indicators that we will examine strengthen this claim further.The only two things that are certain in life are death and taxes. The task of legally and efficiently filing tax reports will continue to exist for at least the duration of the United States in its current form, and increasingly complex tax laws are only making it more and more difficult for individuals and businesses to work independently of tax preparers like HRB. For these reasons, HRB should be a low-risk investment relative to companies in sectors that depend heavily on innovation or public taste. The market for tax services also seems to be significantly undersaturated, with only two or three other major companies competing for the very large market share of clients. Finally, HRB is ahead of the game in terms of anticipating the increasingly digital world of tax filings, building software and expanding its digital tax services sector in order to anticipate the growing need for these services.Support for ThesisHRB has not only demonstrated consistency in producing positive EPS values, but has shown over the course of several years that it is successfully working to grow EPS numbers with each coming year. From 2012 to 2013 the company saw a 24.2% increase in EPS from $1.28 to $1.59, an increase up to $1.67 over the next year, and a predicted 2015 EPS value of $1.79.Even more impressive is HRB's revenue, which has been increasing steadily over the past three years (1.58 Billion Gross Profit in 2012, 1.68 Billion Gross Profit in 2013, and 1.75 Billion Gross Profit in 2014) and, as demonstrated by the profit numbers, has been able to overcome increasing costs incurred by the business without any trouble. Competitors TAX and INTU have shown similar increasing revenues over the past several years, which is reflective of the strength of this service sector and the increasing need for these services, which HRB can provide more efficiently than other companies. (INTU focuses solely on software, and TAX simply does not have the market cap to handle a huge chunk of the tax preparation market.)Why do we believe that HRB can provide better services and be a more profitable company than its competitors? H&R Block has a higher net profit margin (20.11%) than both INTU (17.57%) and TAX (8.56%). This means that it will be able to expand more efficiently as a business into the larger market space. HRB also demonstrates significantly higher Return on Assets metrics (17% versus TAX's 5.41%) as well as excelling in both the Return on Equity and Return on Investment categories (73.21% and 39.88% respectively) when compared to its competitors, INTU (35% and 27%) and TAX (17% and 7%). In terms of using employees efficiently, and in terms of making sure that all employees are of the highest quality and of the best training, H&R Block excels, as can be observed in the following statistics. While INTU and TAX employees only bring in $573K and $359K per employee respectively, HRB manages to yield a whopping $1.52M per employee, or almost triple that of the average INTU employee. This kind of raw efficiency and talent in the work pool is what sets HRB up to be the biggest competitor and most effective business in the tax space.Additionally, when looking at Long-Term Debt to Equity ratios as a way to assess the level of leverage in a company, and therefore determine the risk/benefit analysis of the investment, HRB seems to be at a happy medium. While companies like TAX appear to be far too leveraged for their current financial situations (185% Debt to Equity ratio) and companies like INTU are not taking risks in order to grow and expand (21% Debt to Equity ratio), HRB is sitting at a 44% long-term Debt to Equity ratio, meaning that this is a worthwhile investment that also does not put investors at undue risk caused by reckless management.One key financial metric that stood out when comparing H&R Block to similar companies in the tax preparation space was the Price to Earnings ratios. INTU and TAX are at very high valuations in the market in respect to their current earnings, with P/E ratios of 35.75 and 31.78 respectively, which makes them unattractive investments at this point in time. As we have demonstrated through looking at marginal metrics and at trends in revenue and income, HRB is significantly more financially healthy than these companies. The market is currently undervaluing this company, which has a current P/E ratio of just 13.12. This is slightly more than one third of INTU's P/E ratio, which indicates that it is likely that the market will see a huge jump in the price of HRB stock over the next several months. Once HRB's value is realized by the market, as demonstrated in its employees' abilities to bring in nearly three times as much revenue per capita than INTU, H&R Block's main competitor, and as demonstrated in its strong earnings reports, with profits increasing steadily over the past few years, the valuation that is placed on HRB will adjust, and the stock price will increase significantly.Another important indicator of the financial health of a company is cash flow. How does HRB compare on this front? When looking at cash per share of common stock, H&R Block beats both TAX and INTU by a significant amount (HRB; $5.33, INTU; $4.94, TAX; $.25). While it has a lower Cash Flow per Share value than INTU, it still stands in strong competition with $2.91 per share compared with $3.50 per share for INTU.ConclusionIn summary, it is clear that HRB is a financially strong company on its own. With a great business model, and with work in a burgeoning and developing market sector, it is clear that HRB's business can only be expanding. Taxes are an inelastic necessity, a staple in our society, and increasingly complex tax laws will necessitate the use of companies like H&R Block by both individuals and businesses in order to deal with forms legally and efficiently.Furthermore, the comparison of financial metrics between HRB's competitors and the tax filing industry in general reveals the true strength in this investment. While the numbers and margin ratios only serve to show the advantages that H&R Block has over its competitors, the comparatively low P/E ratio that HRB has would imply that it is a much worse company than INTU and TAX. Since this is clearly not the case, it is highly probable that the market's view of this company will shift over the next several months, and there will be a steady increase of significant magnitude in price (and a rise in the P/E ratio) in order to accurately reflect the true value of H&R Block relative to its competitors and to the market.SourcesSchwab Trade SourceSeeking AlphaYahoo FinanceH&R Block WebsiteH&R Block Press ReleasesWall Street Journal"
2795195,63723,2015-01-04T05:09:24-05:00,"Health insurance reform already began to be phased into action in 2012.Since January 2012, H&R Block (HRB) has gained approximately 100%, while the S&P 500 gained 60%.The 2015 tax season will reflect income made during 2014. 2014 is the first year that people will be taxed or penalized for not having health insurance.Tax service providers are in a seasonal business, generally reporting profits during the 2nd and 3rd quarters of the year.","Since the start of 2014, all Americans are now required to have health insurance, or else pay an additional tax. The tax/penalty for not having health insurance will be phased in over three years. It is $95 for 2014, $325 for 2015, and $695 for 2016.However, it may even be more than the numbers listed if your income is high enough. It could be 1% of your income for 2014, 2% of your income of 2015, or 2.5% for 2016. If these percentages are higher than the numbers initially listed above, then you will have to pay that percentage instead.Since taxes filed in the year 2015 are based on income made during 2014, this represents the first tax season to deal with the complications of the individual insurance mandate.As the transition of health reform makes tax matters more complicated, this may drive more business to tax services providers such as H&R Block (NYSE:HRB), Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU), and Liberty Tax Inc. (NASDAQ:TAX-OLD).Of these three competitors, I would strongly recommend to go with H&R Block for multiple reasons;H&R Block is the dominant leader in the field, preparing about one in every seven tax returns in the United States, with an established, well-recognized brand serving customers in over 12,000 retail locations.H&R Block has a better track record of returning capital through share buybacks and currently yields 2.5%, and also has past history of raising its dividend. By contrast, Intuit only yields about 1% and Liberty Tax Inc. does not pay any dividend at all.Insider trading activity appears to look a lot more favorable for H & R Block with 22 buys and 18 sells during the last 12 months. By contrast, Intuit has had 60 sells and ZERO buys. Liberty Tax Inc. has had 31 sells and 4 buys.H&R Block's valuation is quite reasonable with a P/E ratio of approximately 18. Intuit appears to be a lot more expensive with a P/E ratio over 30. Liberty Tax Inc. has a P/E ratio of 35.H&R Block is much cheaper than Intuit not only from the perspective of the P/E ratio, but also on pure price; $33 is a lot cheaper than $91. I realize many investors believe that the pure price is irrelevant, but it still may have a psychological impact on traders by giving the appearance of being lower and modestly priced.Risks or Concerns:-H&R Block has been restructuring its offices, and it is uncertain if that may end up hurting their business, but on surface appears to be saving money by downsizing.-There is a growing demand for online filing and digital products that are offered for free. Intuit offers online products that may have more appeal to tech-savvy younger generations. H & R Block does offer free online products as well, but it cannot make money by giving their services away for free. However, the complications of the health insurance reform may persuade people to pay a trustworthy professional to take care of the work for them as an assurance that they will get someone who knows how to handle the ongoing changes in the law.Conclusion: 2015 looks like it may be shaping up to be a strong year for tax service providers, and H&R Block is clearly the best of breed."
2559875,55272,2014-10-15T08:54:21-04:00,"HRB announced the delay in approval of its bank sale, thus, closing before '15 tax season is highly unlikely. HRB dropped 5.5% on the news and is down over 10%.
        GDOT and WMT announced the formation of GoBank which has the potential to take revenue from the tax preparation industry.
        HRB represents the best overall value in the tax preparation industry and is positioned to take advantage of industry and firm specific drivers while dampening any effect from GoBank.","H&R Block Inc, (NYSE:HRB) and BofI Holding, Inc (NYSE:BOFI) announced that regulatory approval of the Purchase and Assumption agreement of HRB Bank will most likely not be obtained this calendar year. HRB shares fell 5.5% on the day of the announcement and have fallen over 10% since the October 5th press release.Deal Delayed Not DeadOn both HRB and BOFI's conference calls, it was emphasized that they view regulators request for more time as simply a delay and neither a deal killer, nor attributable to anything but the regulators needing more time. Analysts poked and prodded for more detail but management for both firms did not have answers except to say that the regulators need more time. BOFI and HRB remain committed to each other. HRB mentioned that they view the economics of the deal unchanged.Because the Republic-HRB Bank bank deal fell through, one should not assume that this one will as well. The situation is quite different. The BOFI-HRB Bank transaction has been under informal review since 12/13 and formal review since 4/14. If there were major issues with the seemingly simple P&A transaction, one would assume that the regulators would have voiced their concern by now. The Republic-HRB Bank transaction was terminated after Republic withdrew its application for a national charter (it had a state charter) which was a requirement for closing. BOFI already has a national charter. Republic had been under scrutiny for its RALs, BOFI has not made RALs.Time is of the EssenceWith the approval not anticipated this calendar year, timing of the approval and events after closing become of higher importance. As written previously, after closing, HRB can rid itself of its regulation as a SLHC and can freely return capital to shareholders. However, HRB's share repurchase program is authorized through June 2015. If approval is granted in calendar Q1 of 2015, HRB would most likely chose to close after tax season ends 4/15/15. Therefore, the share repurchase effects would be felt in HRB's FY 2016.HRB and the CFPBThe Thursday before the Sunday bank delay press release, HRB announced that it will be working with the CFPB in a program under Project Catalyst called ""Savings at Tax Time."" HRB will anonymously collect data through 2017 and share it with the CFPB in its quest to encourage consumer savings. While I find the timing of the partnership curious, given that the OCC and CFPB have stepped up efforts to protect the consumer from certain financial products, including some used by the tax preparation industry, the partnership may open up paths for HRB to additional revenue with products that are viewed by the CPFB as consumer friendly.Cash Position~Sequential comparisons for the cash position do not make sense for a hyper-seasonal firm, so yoy comparisons are used.Cash has increased, yet HRB remains unable to repurchase shares. It remains to be seen how management will use the cash. HRB has $400 million in senior notes due in October and no announcement has been made regarding the refinancing of the notes. Another option for cash usage would be to change the order of events, regulator permitting, from bank approval, divestiture, buyback to approval, buyback, divestiture.GoBank's Potential Threat to Financial Product RevenueGreen Dot Corp (NYSE:GDOT) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) announced the formation of GoBank, whose target customer is unbanked or underbanked. This customer is the same that utilizes tax preparation industry financial products. The motivations for purchasing financial products vary greatly but among them is the lack of a bank account to deposit a refund. With GoBank presumably capturing some of the un- or underbanked market, the need for a RAC or prepaid card (and the associated fees) may decline since the consumer can choose to deposit the funds into his or her bank account. Of course, this assumes that they can pay the tax preparation fee upfront.Hypothetically, let's say that 1 in 10 tax payers no longer purchase a financial product that previously purchased one.Note - even though HRB plans to divest its bank, it will still share in revenues and losses through a participation agreement.HRB derives less revenue from financial products than TAX does and thus its revenues are less affected. This scenario assumes that the client bases are equally penetrated, which may or not be the case. TAX generally has a lower income tax payer client than HRB and therefore may be more susceptible to any change. Moreover, the Emerald line of credit, a product HRB offers, features a different set of benefits that someone that is already banked may still desire. Therefore, if any change in tax payer's financial product purchasing habits results from the un- or underbanked receiving checking accounts, HRB is likely to be less afflicted than TAX.Notes on EarningsWith the transaction not set to close before tax season, which is HRB 2015 Q4, FY '15 EPS estimates should now include the $0.07-0.09 that was expected to dilute earnings post transaction before any share repurchases were taken into account. Additionally, the expected charges of $0.02-0.03 will not be incurred until the completion of the transaction, possibly in FY15, ending 4/30/15, or FY16.Last week, the IRS announced that tax season may yet again be delayed which could push revenue from early filers into Q4 from Q3, ending 1/31.Valuation ConsiderationsWith the repurchase program pushed back, the shorts have and may continue to sell HRB. The major negative catalysts that could cause further decline are obviously a termination of the bank sale or a new development in the SCC litigation. However, the recent share price decline should be viewed as temporary. The long-term thesis for HRB still remains intact. HRB, which has outperformed peers, will benefit from industry drivers such as the ACA and an increasingly complex tax code and firm specific drivers such as international growth, capturing profitable market share (higher value returns) and expansion into different service lines. Moreover, any threat to financial product revenue from GoBank should not weigh as heavily upon HRB as other firms. The new program with the CFPB is an interesting development that may prove fruitful in additional streams of financial product revenue. The delay in approval for the bank sale should be viewed as nothing more than a delay."

Portfolio123 has a powerful ranking system which allows the user to create complex formulas according to many different criteria. They also have highly useful several groups of pre-built ranking systems, I used one of them; the ""All-Stars: Greenblatt"" in this article. The ranking system is based on investing principles of the well-known investor Joel Greenblatt.The ""All-Stars: Greenblatt"" ranking system is taking into account just two factors; return on capital and earnings yield (E/P) in equal proportions.I recommend investors to read Joel Greenblatt's impressive book ""The Little Book That Beats the Market."" Mr. Greenblatt proposed, what he called ""the magic formula,"" to rank all the stocks according to just two factors; return on capital and earnings yield (E/P) in equal proportions, and to select the first twenty to thirty stocks for the portfolio.In order to find out how such a ranking formula would have performed during the last 16 years, I ran a back-test, which is available by the Portfolio123's screener. For the back-test, I took all the 7,014 stocks in the Portfolio123's database. The back-test results are shown in the chart below. For the back-test, I divided the 7,014 companies into twenty groups according to their ranking. The chart clearly shows that the average annual return has a very significant positive correlation to the ""All-Stars: Greenblatt"" rank. The highest ranked group with the ranking score of 95-100, which is shown by the light blue column in the chart, has given by far the best return, an average annual return of about 19%, while the average annual return of the S&P 500 index during the same period was about 3.5% (the red column at the left part of the chart). Also, the second and the third group (scored: 85-90 and 90-95) have given superior returns. This brings me to the conclusion that the ranking system is very useful.After running ""All-Stars: Greenblatt"" ranking system on all S&P 500 stocks, on May 23, I discovered the twenty best stocks, which are shown in the table below. In this article, I will focus on the fourth-ranked stock; H&R Block (NYSE:HRB). See my article about the second-ranked stock Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD).I consider H&R Block an excellent combination of a good value and high growth dividend stock. HRB has compelling valuation metrics and strong earnings growth prospects; its EV/EBITDA ratio is very low at 6.72, and its average annual earnings growth estimates for the next five years is high at 11%. The forward annual dividend yield is pretty high at 2.49%.According to the company, H&R Block is the world's largest tax services provider, having prepared more than 650 million tax returns since 1955. There are approximately 12,000 company-owned and franchise retail locations in all 50 states, Puerto Rico and other U.S. territories, and on U.S. military bases around the world. An H&R Block branded retail office is located within five miles of most Americans.HRB's current stock price is down 10.4% from its 52-week high of $35.8 from February '02, mainly due to a lower-than-expected impact on tax preparation volume from the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) through the first half of the tax season. However, in my opinion, the latest retreat in HRB's stock price creates an excellent opportunity to buy the stock at a relatively cheap price since its business is poised to grow significantly.Chart: TradeStation Group, Inc.On April 23, H&R Block reported its U.S. tax results through April 16, 2015. According to the company, assisted returns prepared declined due to the carryover impact of eliminating a promotion in the prior year and continued behavioral shifts in tax filers who claim the Earned Income Tax Credit. H&R Block tax software returns prepared through online, desktop and mobile applications grew 8.2% over the prior year; monetization improved significantly. Total U.S. revenues increased compared to the prior year despite a 0.9% decrease in returns prepared to 20.5 million. The company said that it continues to expect EBITDA margins of approximately 30%.Bill Cobb, H&R Block's president and chief executive officer, commented:Despite a decline in its assisted returns this tax season, I see some promising developments in the company's business. HRB's U.S. desktop and online returns prepared increased 6.9% and 8.7% year-over-year respectively. This compared to the industry growth of 3.7% in self-prepared e-file returns. Moreover, management guided positive growth in revenues for the current fiscal year. Also, according to the company, this was the first tax season in what HRB has said will be a multi-year journey to fully realize the impacts of the ACA, and HRB believes that it is well positioned as the industry's ACA experts.In my opinion, HRB is poised to see a healthy growth in the following quarters. The extending tax complexities from the Affordable Care Act should increase tax-preparation volumes during the second half of the tax season. The Affordable Care Act intersected with tax preparation for the first time in tax season 2015, requiring millions of taxpayers to file additional forms and in many cases resulting in modified refunds and tax penalties. According to the company, it invested in its tax professionals to enable them to provide valuable ACA guidance to its clients.DividendH&R Block has been paying uninterrupted dividends since 1986. The forward annual dividend yield is at 2.49%, and the payout ratio is only 33.9%. The annual rate of dividend growth over the past three years was high at 21.1%, over the past five years was at 6.3%, and over the past ten years was at 7.4%.HRB Dividend data by YChartsSummaryIn my opinion, HRB is poised to see a healthy growth in the following quarters. The extending tax complexities from the Affordable Care Act should increase tax-preparation volumes during the second half of the tax season. Also, H&R Block tax software returns prepared through online, desktop and mobile applications is growing fast, and monetization is improving significantly. HRB has compelling valuation metrics and strong earnings growth prospects; its EV/EBITDA ratio is very low at 6.72, and its average annual earnings growth estimates for the next five years is high at 11%. In my view, the latest retreat in HRB's stock price creates an excellent opportunity to buy the stock at a relatively cheap price since its business is poised to grow significantly."
2498285,55272,2014-09-17T08:43:08-04:00,"Sale of HRB Bank to BofI is expected to close this fall, clearing the path to HRB's $858 million share repurchase program.
        HRB has built its cash position and the current share repurchase program expires in June 2015.
        Shares trade at a discount to peers (P/E basis) even though HRB has growth opportunities, management has executed its strategy well and outperformed peers.","H&R Block, Inc (NYSE:HRB) currently trades at trailing P/E of 19 and a forward P/E of 16 and has a yield of 2.5%. It is in the process of divesting its bank, HRB Bank, to BofI Holding Inc. (NYSE:BOFI). After the divestiture, HRB can freely engage in its share repurchase program. HRB is beginning to implement its long term growth plan surrounding its core business, tax preparation.Background of HRB Bank P&A AgreementIn April 2014, HRB Bank and BOFI entered into a purchase and assumption agreement whereby all of HRB Bank's deposit liabilities and certain assets will be sold to BOFI. The deal is expected to close this fall. Upon closing, BOFI will become the bank for HRB financial products branded, including Refund Transfer Products, Emerald lines of credit and Emerald Prepaid Mastercard. It is expected to dilute annual earnings in the range of $0.07-$0.09. If approved, it will take approximately 30 days to close the transaction. BOFI and HRB have given no indication of any delays on their end as of last earnings calls, 8/7 and 9/3, respectively.Financial ProductsEmerald Products and refund transfer products are slightly more than 10% of HRB revenue. Refund transfer products are the subject of numerous lawsuits nationwide and refund transfer products may eventually become regulated with possible caps of fees, etc. By having a bank administer the programs, HRB's risk is potentially diminished.HRB and BOFI intend to enter a Program Management Agreement and Receivables Participation Agreement. The RPA is designed so that HRB periodically purchases 90% of participation interests in the receivables of certain Emerald related products from BOFI. Therefore, if HRB can grow the Emerald advance line as it believes it can with added features, it will increase its revenue.Benefits to HRBBy dissolving its ownership of HRB Bank, HRB will no longer be subject to regulation by the Federal Reserve as a SLHC. Thus, it can freely return capital to shareholders.HRB intends to use Block Financial's AFS securities for a portion of the transfer.The financial statements ending in April reveal that HRB would have had to bring $321 million to close. However as of the end of Q1, 7/31, HRB Bank's deposits shrank and it would only have to bring $61 million to close.The Q1 ending balance of deposits dropped significantly more than in previous periods. It is unclear if this Q1 drop was anticipated upon entering the agreement. In any case, HRB will have to bring less cash to close and its cash position has been increasing.~10k,10q dataSince HRB is in a particularly seasonal it is appropriate to look at its cash position versus prior quarter and not sequentially. One can see a build up in non-Block Financial, unrestricted cash, even higher than at fiscal 2012 end. In Q1 2013, HRB repurchased shares in of $315 million. In the April press release, HRB mentions the deal would yield $200-$250 million in immediate excess capital which is an increase from its December investor day comments of $100-$150 million excess capital. Investors may (or may not) have priced this into the stock already. Immediately after the P&A Agreement was announced HRB fell 3% but gained back this loss within a week.Note - P/E is higher than normal on 4/11 since it experienced a $0.27 loss (higher than normal) in discontinued operations.Timing and Other Issues Concerning RepurchaseSince the selling season of certain financial products starts around Thanksgiving, it is in BOFI and HRB's interest to close the deal by early-mid-October.The current repurchase authorization totals $858 million and it expires in June. If approval for the bank transaction is given, the repurchase should come sooner rather than later.HRB has $400 million in long-term debt maturing in October 2014 and it desires an investment grade credit rating after the divestiture. Given that the agencies expect a share repurchase after the divestiture and the highly seasonal nature of tax preparation business, how much of the repurchase program may hinder on Moody's and S&P's evaluation.Management ExecutionIn the late 2000s, HRB's business was rather unfocused with lines in mortgage, banking, consulting, financial advising, broker dealer operations in addition to its tax preparation business. Current management has implemented a strategy known as ""Tax Plus"" that focuses on its analyzing its core business, exploiting opportunities surrounding it while divesting non-core lines. It has outperformed its closest peer in EBITDA and net income margins.Some have commented that HRB is losing US market share based on the number of returns prepared. This is true.But it also analyzed its customers and found some were less loyal and less valuable. It decided to stop certain discounting programs and to eliminate the in-office free 1040EZ, lowering wait times for in-office higher value customers in FY2014. Although the number of returns declined, the tax preparation revenue increased. Moreover, these customers did not add to other ""Tax Plus"" revenues. Total tax preparation revenue and margins increased.Management can view pricing more strategically as it moves away from the ""commoditized"" portion of the tax return business.Growth OpportunitiesTax returns filed are highly correlated to non-farm payrolls. The BLS statistics continue to show improvement in non-farm payrolls.The design of the ACA puts the IRS at least on par with HHS in its importance in implementing the legislation. Those taxpayers that took the subsidy AKA an advanced tax credit are lower income households who may have been eligible to file a 1040EZ (prior income limit of $100k), a form that many preparers prepare for free while trying to sell add on products, are not eligible, per the ACA, to file the 1040EZ moving them toward a higher revenue product.Moreover, those that took the advanced tax credit, planning of receiving the credit through a refund, are claiming certain exemptions or are having to calculate their penalty (surprising many that the much touted ""$95 penalty"" will actually be higher for 2014) will have to file more forms. More forms equals higher pricing opportunities. The IRS released draft forms (form 8962 and form 8965) about a month ago and some worksheets and forms still have not been released.Two other shifts are likely to occur given the level of complexity (monthly data is required) of the forms and taxpayers situations. First, many may become frustrated attempting to complete their taxes and switch from a DIY method to an assisted method which is a higher revenue service. Second, a shift within DIY may occur with those using pen and paper seeking a product to more timely and accurate filing. Both of these shifts will increase industry revenues, currently estimated at $19 billion.~US dataThese shifts are likely to occur over a few years. The IRS will kindly inform taxpayers of errors made in their returns, as the forms are filled out by month and depend on the taxpayer's household and circumstances, which change throughout the year and taxpayers will seek assisted services or products.Given that assisted preparation generates more revenue than DIY products, HRB is looking to pursue certain segments in the assisted market, those taxpayers who returns have a higher level of complexity.Last month, HRB announced that it has brought on Jennifer Katrulya, founder of BMRG Advisory Services, a firm that assists small CPA firms in their practices. She will continue to run her advisory practice. According to the AICPA, 75% of CPAs will be nearing or at retirement age by 2018. Planning for succession can be difficult for solo or small practices. HRB now has the opportunity to provide an exit for these practices which the bulk of business is derived from higher value tax clients. Thus it can begin to penetrate the 27% market share. The partnering with BMRG may allow HRB to possibly move into a quickbooks-esque type product and add additional services out of its offices that have synergies with its tax preparation operations.While the overall split between DIY:Assisted has remained semi-stable at 40:60, the method of DIY has changed, with online products now accounting for the bulk of DIY. HRB is making strides into the DIY category taking market share from other DIY firms until last year in terms of unit count but still increased revenue more than the industry leader. HRB is committed to being a strong competitor but appears unlikely to discount yet in order to gain market share.HRB believes it is the largest tax preparer in Australia and Canada. It has also expanded into Brazil and India and is evaluating other countries. The rise of the middle class in many nations has governments salivating to collect tax revenue. Many countries tax codes are not and will not be as complicated as the US IRC and therefore the possible footprint of retail locations may not be as deep and widespread as the US. But the opportunity for digital online, including mobile, DIY products is tremendous given some developing countries rapid penetration by mobile.Risk in LitigationThere are numerous lawsuits against tax preparation firms, including HRB, alleging that RACs are RALs and therefore require disclosures that were not given. Liberty has an injunction in California that essentially treats its RACs as RALs. Intuit settled one action against it regarding its refund transfer products. HRB's refund product litigation also includes a lawsuit alleging that its RAL disclosures were not adequate.Sand Canyon Corporation, formerly known as Option One Mortgage, ended its mortgage originating business in December 2007 and sold its servicing business in April 2008. There are numerous lawsuits against SCC, one of which named HRB, but HRB was voluntarily removed by the plaintiff. HRB believes its corporate veil is strong. Thus far, SCC has accrued $194 million in losses. It is in negotiations with counterparties but the end result may take years and further losses may be incurred.ValuationInvestors may be undervaluing HRB based on a peer comparison.It has viable growth opportunities in taking market share, opening new markets and product lines. Moreover, the industry growth changes outlined above should favor HRB since more revenue is derived from assisted preparation versus DIY products. HRB owns about two thirds of its stores. Even though TAX's customers may be more likely than HRB's to be affected by ACA advanced credit provisions since they are in the lower income brackets, TAX's model is almost exclusively as a franchisor. If there is industry revenue growth, it only captures a percentage. HRB also has pricing on its side. It can discount if it chooses to in order to gain share.If the bank transaction is approved, it has the cash to begin its share repurchase program immediately. The last time HRB repurchased shares was in Q1 FY2013, July 2012 and it repurchased the total amount within one quarter. HRB may rise on the amount of the share repurchase and in the longer term with continued strong execution and exploiting opportunities."

CEO Interview: Bill Cobb, H&R Block (NYSE:HRB)This is the first year Americans have to deal with Obamacare when filing taxes. Obamacare should be a big boost for H&R Block (HRB) The company is selling off its internal bank, and this will allow it to increase its buyback and dividend. ""Our job is to maximize your refund,"" said Bill Cobb. Cramer asked if there is competition from Mom and Pop operations, but Cobb thinks the complex nature of the tax system will cause people to go to a more established player like HRB.The Market is Becoming Rational: Home Depot (NYSE:HD), Keurig Green Mountain (NASDAQ:GMCR), Lowe's (NYSE:LOW), General Motors (NYSE:GM). Other stocks mentioned: Micron (NASDAQ:MU), Sirius XM (NASDAQ:SIRI), CSX (NASDAQ:CSX)Cramer said the market is finally rational on a day the Dow rallied 213 points. What has been making stocks fall is not the drop in oil prices but the velocity of the fall. There are more companies that benefit from low oil than those that do well when oil prices are high.Housing stocks are rising because mortgage rates are low. Housing related stocks like Home Depot (HD) and Lowe's (LOW) are going higher. Keurig Green Mountain (GMCR) rose on news of a cold drink machine. General Motors (GM) reported strong December sales, and it rallied.Cramer took some calls:Micron (MU): Cramer didn't like the conference call, and thinks management ""screwed up"" the call. It should have gone higher.Sirius XM (SIRI): ""I like this stock.""CSX (CSX) is having problems because of coal, but it will come back.9 Best Retailers: CarMax (NYSE:KMX), AutoZone (NYSE:AZO), CVS Health (NYSE:CVS), Dollar General (NYSE:DG), Home Depot (HD), Kroger (NYSE:KR), L Brands (NYSE:LB), Williams-Sonoma (NYSE:WSM), Restoration Hardware (NYSE:RH)1. CarMax (KMX) doesn't have exposure to Europe, and Cramer thinks expectations are too low, especially since it has easy comparisons.2. AutoZone (AZO) is the premier auto parts retailer and tends to bounce back after it disappoints. It rallied from 447 to 619 last year, and it should continue to move higher.3. CVS Health (CVS) rallied and should go higher. It will benefit from Obamacare. Cramer thinks it is one of the best healthcare companies in America.4. Dollar General (DG) is going higher whether or not it acquires Family Dollar (NYSE:FDO). It has a good private label strategy.5. Home Depot (HD) will benefit from the rebound in housing.6. Kroger (KR) has the strongest same store sales in the industry but only has a multiple of 18. It has a strong natural and organic store within a store, and its acquisition of an online vitamin company is a winner.7. L Brands (LB) owns Victoria's Secret and Bath and Body Works. The company keeps defying the odds in the shopping mall.8. Restoration Hardware (RH) reported 22% same store sales and a 55% increase in profit. It may be hard to keep that up, but Cramer thinks it is a ""retail wonder."" After every stumble, the stock comes back with a vengeance.9. Williams-Sonoma (WSM) has great management, and is an ""aspirational"" retailer.6 Winning Restaurant stocks: Buffalo Wild Wings (BWLD), Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG), Cracker Barrel (NASDAQ:CBRL), DineEquity (NYSE:DIN), Fiesta (NASDAQ:FRGI), Jack in the Box (NASDAQ:JACK). Other stocks mentioned: Hertz (NYSE:HTZ), Diageo (NYSE:DEO), Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ)1. Buffalo Wild Wings (BWLD) made an all-time high, but analysts have been obsessed with wing prices. The real money is made on beer, which has been a winner for the company. It has a rich multiple of 35 but has a 20% growth rate.2. Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) isn't cheap, and has made a 28.5% gain. It has the highest same store sales of any restaurant stock. It can expand its restaurants. Raw costs are declining, and that will be a plus for CMG.3. Cracker Barrel (CBRL) is not part of the healthy eating trend, but it has many roadside locations and is a great cheap gasoline play.4. DineEquity (DIN) has run from $78 to $106 and is the number one restaurant social media user.5. Fiesta (FRGI) had a volatile year. It has two concepts, a Caribbean chain and Taco Cabana, and the company is expanding location.6. Jack in the Box (JACK) ""is the key to the market,"" said Cramer and is the best restaurant play on low gasoline prices. It has undertaken remodeling and has Qdoba, which has been a winner. Cramer thinks it should spin off Qdoba.Cramer took some calls:Hertz (HTZ) has accounting irregularities, so he would stay away.Diageo (DEO): The Chinese cracked down on Diageo. Constellation Brands (STZ) is a better stock to buy. Cramer thinks it will go to $110.::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::Jim Cramer’s Action Alerts PLUS: Check out Cramer’s multi-million dollar charitable trust portfolio and uncover the stocks he thinks could be HUGE winners.

2744835,24349,2014-12-10T04:36:31-05:00,"H&R Block missed revenue estimates and reported a wider than expected loss for Q2 results.However, no new guidance or news on key drivers of the stock were disclosed.Therefore, yesterday's selloff may represent a buying opportunity.","H&R Block, Inc. (NYSE:HRB), the world's largest consumer tax services provider, dropped over 5% yesterday after announcing its financial results for the fiscal 2015 second quarter late Monday afternoon. The company typically reports negative earnings during non-tax season quarters, however, it missed both revenue and earnings estimates. A closer look at the release and management's outlook should help investors determine if this is an opportunity to buy on the dip, or if there are more serious issues with the company.Second Quarter ResultsRevenue for the second quarter of the fiscal year was $134.62M, increasing slightly by 0.2% year-over-year, but missing analysts' expectations by $7.37M. Additionally, the company reported non-GAAP, adjusted earnings loss per share from continuing operations of $0.45, also missing analysts' estimates by $0.03. Most importantly, the adjusted and actual EPS for Q2 both showed an increased loss compared to the same period y/y.H&R Block's main business segment Tax Services, which makes up over 95% of total revenues for the company, grew 1% to $129 million. This was primarily driven by higher tax prep fees in the U.S. and Australia, and improved off season usage of the H&R Block Prepaid MasterCard, the Emerald Card. However, total operating expenses increased 6% due to higher D&A expenses from planned office and technology upgrades, as well as increased wages. This caused the segment's adjusted non-GAAP pretax loss to expand 13%.Is Now The Time To Buy?H&R Block earnings miss on the top and bottom line seems to have caused investors to sell off the stock. However, there was no new news concerning several key drivers of the stock, including the delay of the sale of its banking unit to BofI Federal Bank that would allow the company to exit Federal Reserve oversight. H&R Block typically posts negative earnings during non-tax season periods, so the wider loss shouldn't be a huge concern, and the company is coming off of a particularly strong performance in Q4 FY14. Revenue for Q4 was up 16.5% y/y, net earnings were up 37% y/y, and adjusted earnings were solidly above consensus estimates.Furthermore, H&R Block is the leader in its space, as the largest tax preparer in the world, and filing one in every six tax returns in the US. This large footprint in a relatively fragmented industry gives the company a tremendous growth opportunity, especially as it expands its ""plus"" program to help DIY filers and as it positions itself to take advantage of increased tax preparation complexities resulting from healthcare reform. With the stock trading below 17x forward analysts' estimates for FY15, and its steady dividend payments, I think investors may want to take advantage of this pullback."
2151983,20568,2014-04-21T15:30:07-04:00,,"With tax season finally over, one company is probably still fresh in Americans' minds; H&R Block (NYSE:HRB). This Kansas City-based tax preparation company offers up tax advice, do-it-yourself tax return preparation, and advances on tax refunds across the country.And though while many Americans certainly used their services this past tax season, competitive pressures are certainly building for this company. This is largely thanks to the advent and popularity of Intuit's (NASDAQ:INTU) TurboTax software which is eating away at HRB's core market.Thanks in part to this pressure, HRB stock has been struggling as of late, as it has underperformed some of its key peers in the past year. Plus, it hasn't helped that HRB has seen sluggish results in international markets too, as this has forced the company to post pretty horrendous results at earnings season, suggesting that HRB has great trouble in meeting expectationsRecent EarningsIn fact, over the last four quarters, HRB has missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate every time, with an average surprise of -226%. The company's 'best' miss did come in the key tax season quarter though, but even then the firm missed by nearly 2% when compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate.With this recent weakness in mind and some serious competitive pressures building on its lofty stock, it shouldn't be too surprising to note that many earnings estimates have been falling for HRB as of late. In the past 30 days, not a single estimate has gone higher for HRB's earnings outlook, while several have gone lower.The pain is especially apparent when investors look to the current year and next year time frames, as estimates have gone from $1.67/share for the current year 60 days ago to just $1.62 today. Meanwhile, for the next year period, $2.01/share was the estimate two months ago, but once again this was pushed down, this time to $1.95/share, suggesting that analysts are ratcheting down their expectations for HRB not only in the near term, but over the long haul as well.These concerns have kept a lid on HRB's shares, as the stock has added over 65% in the past two years, but just 6% in the trailing 12 months. And from a YTD look, HRB has lost about 4% (underperforming the market) and it could face more trouble at its next earnings report if recent earnings estimate trends are any guide.This is particularly true when investors consider that HRB has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) and that its earnings ESP metric is negative. When combined, these factors are generally a harbinger of negative news at earnings season, and given how sluggish HRB has been at earnings season, it wouldn't be much of a shock at all to see another lackluster report from this tax preparation firm.Other PicksIf investors are searching for better picks in the consumer services space, it is worth noting that the sector currently has a poor Zacks Industry Rank and that many firms in the segment have seen earnings estimate revisions moving in the wrong direction. However, there is one standout, Outerwall (NASDAQ:OUTR), a stock that has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).This security saw a positive surprise in its most recent earnings report, and since its rank just moved from a #3 (Hold) to a #2 (buy), now might be the time to consider this stock instead of the embattled H&R Block, at least until the earnings estimate revision activity turns around for HRB.H&R Block (HRB): Free Stock Analysis Report (email registration required)"
2123613,52282,2014-04-03T05:10:32-04:00,"Simplification of the United States Tax System would be a huge big blow to H&R Block.HRB has experienced declining then sideways revenue growth due to intense competition.High Multiples and a history of earnings misses make HRB risky to own.Taking everything into consideration, H&R Block looks like a great long-term short sale opportunity.","H&R Block (NYSE:HRB), according to Google Finance, ""provides tax preparation and banking services. The Company's Tax Services segment provides assisted income tax return preparation, digital tax solutions and other services and products related to income tax return preparation to the general public primarily in the United States and its territories, Canada and Australia. This segment also offers financial services through H&R Block Bank (HRB Bank)."" Upon doing some basic research on the company, we found numerous caution signs throughout the company that make HRB a potential short sell target. In this article, we will discuss these caution signs in depth.How We Came Across HRBIn Equities Lab, I was brainstorming through strategies that return potential short sells. In the editor, I wrote multiple conditions that a stock must meet in order to pass the strategy. A screen shot of the conditions can be seen below:The conditions from top to bottom are saying: the EPS Estimate for the current fiscal year must have been revised downwards over the past month, the EPS estimates for the next fiscal year must have been revised downward over the past month, the stock's price to sales must rank in the top 25% of its industry, the stock's trailing 12 month sales growth must rank in the bottom 25% of its industry, and the stock's return over 251 trading days (1 year) must rank in the top 75% of its industry. The results of those conditions were 10 stocks including HRB.Threat of Tax ReformThe major risk for H&R Block is the threat of tax reform. There is no question that the United States' income tax code is extremely complex and that is what drives people to use tax preparation services like H&R Block. This article explains how tax forms are getting more and more complicated over time. The voice to push for tax simplification is getting stronger as time goes on and the threat of tax reform becomes more likely. Any simplification to the tax system would hurt H&R Block's revenue and likely send the stock tumbling as we will see more people filing their own taxes and electing not to pay tax preparation services.Weakening RevenueAccording to Factset, sales for 2009 totaled $4.08 billion then dropped 5.12% in 2010 to $3.87 billion. From 2010 to 2011, sales took another 2.6% drop to $3.77 billion then another massive drop of 23% from 2011 to 2012. From 2012 to 2013 sales increased a slight .7% from $2.89 billion to $2.91 billion. The drop in sales then sideways growth can be attributed to the emergence of heavy competition in the tax preparation services industry. When I did my taxes about a month ago I had a decision to make on what company to use. My options were vast with H&R Block, Jackson Hewitt, Liberty Tax Service, TurboTax, TaxACT, TaxSlayer, Locally owned tax preparation services, IRS E-File (a free service), etc., etc., and etc. The bottom line is that the space is heavily saturated and H&R Block faces a vast amount of competition that sometimes offer their services at a cheaper price.History Earnings MissesEarnings for the 4th Quarter of 2014 has yet to be announced. It is by far the most important quarter for HRB as it represents tax season. Revenue for the 4th quarter of 2013 was $2.2 billion and analysts are expecting revenue of $2.49 billion for the 4th quarter of 2014 representing a 13.2% year-over-year increase.Over the past 4 quarters, according to Yahoo Finance, HRB has missed its earnings estimates. I could not find Q4 or 2014 guidance that the company issued so I will be unable to comment on what we think Q4 numbers will look like. I can tell you that trailing 12 month sales growth for HRB is -1.7%.Overpriced?- Price-to-Sales AnalysisHRB currently trades at a price-to-sales ratio of 3.2. That ranks at the top 22% of companies in the personal services industry while their estimated 5 year growth rate of 11% ranks at the bottom 27% and sales growth over the past 5 years ranks at the bottom 14% of the personal services industry.- Price-to-Book AnalysisHRB currently has a price-to-book of 12.3. That ranks at the top 91% of companies in the personal services industry. HRB has a dividend adjusted trailing PEG ratio of 4.7 which ranks at the top 27%. JTH Holdings (TAX), a public company in the tax preparation industry, trades at a price-to-book of 4.7.- Price-to-Earnings AnalysisHRB currently has a high PE ratio of 37.5 which ranks at the top 42% of personal services companies. It also ranks at the top 23% of stocks, excluding financial and market cap under $5 billion, while reporting well below average growth.- Equities Lab Value ScoreHRB currently has an Equities Lab Value Score of 2 out of 10. A screen shot of the value score can be seen below:An explanation of the conditions in the score can be found in this article. Low value score stocks are generally overpriced and we have confirmed that theory with our back test. The graph below displays the back test results of stocks located in the personal services industry and a value score less than 3 can be found below:The green line represents the return of the strategy, while the grey line represents the return of the S&P 500 and blue line represents the Russell 2000. The green line returns -44% since 2010 while the S&P 500 has returned roughly 70%.- Bottom LineThe bottom line is that HRB is trading at above average multiples while experiencing below average sales and earnings growth.SummaryThe threat of tax reform, weakening sales, heavy competition, and high multiples make HRB a solid long-term short sell opportunity.The stock is up 69% since the start of 2013. Taking everything into consideration, including the technicals, we think it is a great time to short sell HRB.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1949331,59361,2014-01-16T10:28:48-05:00,,"H&R Block (NYSE:HRB) is already starting to get some attention from the rating agencies, as is usual shortly before the start of tax season. BTIG upgraded them from a Neutral to a Buy late last week on January 9th with a target share price of roughly $36.00. $36.00 would bring the share price to a multiple of roughly 15 times their future estimate for 2016 EPS which is $2.40. Barrington Research and Morgan Stanley also have H&R Block as a potential outperformer. Oddly enough, last year which was arguably one of the best for the share price of H&R Block, was preceded by downgrades.This chart shows how price and EPS increased after the downgrade last year:HRB data by YChartsAlso, for the most recently released January 10th earnings statement from H&R Block click here.So why are the rating agencies so optimistic this year, and should they be?BTIG's reason for the upgrade was as follows:Some of you might remember back in 2010, when HSBC Bank (NYSE:HSBC) stopped working with H&R Block to provide Refund Anticipation Loans which are a key service and competitive advantage within the tax preparation industry. As a result H&R Block, along with a few other tax chains such as Liberty Tax (NASDAQ:TAX-OLD), decided to create a separate entity to run banking products. The banking division referenced by the rating agency now runs the Emerald Card which offers 'pay-day-loans' in advance of the refund.Despite the positive outlook that BTIG has for H&R Block, I still see some trouble for the immediate tax season coming. I can't be sure that it will hurt their share price significantly, as it is quite possible that their banking counterpart will wash out any losses they have from their core tax preparation business. But there are two qualitative factors that I don't like much this year for HRB.1. The IRS RTRP Exam requirement: This requirement would have most likely decreased the number of people capable of preparing returns, thereby increasing demand for those still doing tax returns. However the jurisdiction of the IRS to regulate the industry was called into question in Loving vs. Commissioner. In this case, the court decided that the undue hardship on Loving's business and a lack of jurisdiction granted by congress on the part of the IRS rendered the regulation null.From the Court Decision:This case was then appealed by the IRS. However it was often thought that even had the IRS lost at court, eventually Congress would pass a bill enabling the IRS to have the appropriate jurisdiction. But, now we have a new IRS chairman who sees things a little differently. In a recent interview from just two weeks ago the IRS Chairman stated that he would prefer that tax return preparers voluntarily take the new certification test and that he would not press the issue which would force preparers to take the exam. If preparers are never required to take the exam, then major tax preparing companies will not benefit from a greater barrier to entry - this could hurt HRB at some point.2. The January 31st (or late start) for E-Filing: The IRS decided to delay the start of tax season till the end of January. Generally in the tax preparation industry it is helpful to get a person's tax return done immediately after they have the resources necessary to complete the tax return. This is especially the case now that online do-it-yourself programs have begun eating away at the market. Under the late start scenario, most people will get their W-2's by around the 20th (if not earlier) and then attempt to complete their return online. When the end of January approaches they will simply wait at their computer in their home and push 'send' at midnight.The effect of the delayed start to tax season has often been seen by local tax preparers when a snow storm arrives that shuts down businesses. Prior to the snow storm customers are plentiful, after the snow storm people don't need the service because they have completed the process at home. In other words, with the delayed start to tax season, people will spend their extra time finding a more economical method of filing.Conclusion:While points 1 & 2 may not severely impact H&R Block this coming tax season, I still think that these are issues that must be dealt with in some way (especially point 1). Perhaps H&R Block is a good buy, but I really doubt we will see the same $15 dollar jump in stock price that we saw last year.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1381471,47361,2013-04-29T12:50:06-04:00,,"Late last week, both H&R Block (NYSE:HRB) and Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) reported their volumes of tax filings each company did this year. Both companies admitted it was a rough tax season (Really? Because the rest of America loves tax season!) H&R Block reported .9% fewer filings than last year, at 22 million. H&R Block did report that its online filings increased by 10%, which is why Intuit's Turbo Tax saw declining numbers. Intuit had projected Turbo Tax filings to increase by 4%, but instead saw a 2% decrease. Intuit, which had similar growth in the last year to the S&P 500, saw most of its gains lost in one day as shares dropped 11% on Thursday.On April 15, I wrote that it was probably time to dump H&R Block given its tendency to see its stock price drop this time of year, regardless of the report. Last week's news about H&R Block shouldn't be surprising, and I think that is why the stock bounced back on Friday. However, the news from Intuit is surprising, which is why it dropped so dramatically.Take a look at the following charts. H&R Block does not display the growth and increase you want to see in sales, net income or EPS. Meanwhile over the last decade, Intuit has had steady and consistent improvements in each area.If you bought H&R Block before January, I congratulate you. Take those gains, along with your tax refund (and the $25 gift card you got from H&R Block if you experienced delays) and enjoy yourself! As for Intuit, it may be a good time to buy on the overreaction of last week.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1543832,41921,2013-07-11T08:36:35-04:00,,"As Congress kicks off its latest attempt at comprehensive tax reform, it would seem to be a prudent reminder for investors of H&R Block (NYSE:HRB) to understand that if this reform passes it could prove to be an existential threat to the company. Granted, tax reform is something that gets bandied about on an annual basis and special interests will go to war to protect sacred cows such as the mortgage interest and charitable giving tax deductions. Be that as it may, with other major policies such as Immigration reform looking bleak, and Obamacare unraveling before our eyes, tax reform may end up being the piece of legislation that is the least poisonous thus leading to a higher chance of actual passage. With H&R Block trading at close to a 52 week high, the market is treating this company as if it is a growth stock. The reality is that total tax return volume was stagnant in 2013 compared to the prior year, even as the employment picture brightened which theoretically increased the amount of individuals with a need to file a tax return. In the same vein, the company generates a significant portion of its revenue (the highest profit margin revenue) via refund anticipation loans or other short term installment loans that are directly tied to customers filing tax returns. Any type of legislation that lessens the need for those customers with simple tax returns, who are also the ones most likely to be getting force fed these highly profitable ancillary products for H&R Block, will have an outsized impact on the company.Why Tax Reform Possibility Makes H&R Block A Bad InvestmentH&R Block has seen a massive run up in its shares over the last 12 months as seen below:HRB data by YChartsShares are up almost 100% over the last 12 months, and the company now sports a market capitalization of ~$8.1B. The company trades at ~19x its trailing earnings and ~16x its forward earnings estimates. H&R Block is hardly cheap, and many investors pile into the name because it currently pays a moderate dividend yielding 2.8%.The company was slammed during the housing crash for its ill advised foray into the residential lending market, and saw massive losses on mortgage loans it carried. With the bulk of this disastrous move in the rear view mirror, the company is now once again being looked at a pure play tax preparer company. However, as I noted in the introduction, this industry is one that is heavily regulated with the potential to have its entire world turned upside down if sweeping tax reform is passed that simplifies the tax code.During FY 2013, about 13% of the total revenue for H&R Block came from services unrelated to tax preparation. These ranged from refund anticipation loans, fees on the cards used to receive the loans, and consumer loans bearing interest. In a nutshell, H&R Block still managed to generate close to $400M in revenue from products that essentially gouge those who are unable to wait the 21 days it takes to get their tax refund. The company is not doing anything that is not allowed, but if tax reform is instituted and these customers who need instant cash do not need to go to an H&R Block to have their taxes prepared, the company will lose what is certainly an extremely high margin portion of its business.Investment Outlook12 months ago, H&R Block paid a dividend that yielded over 5.5%. After an almost 100% increase in the stock price over the last 12 months, this is not nearly as an attractive of an income investment with a much lower dividend yield. With a business showing stagnating growth in the number of total tax returns prepared, and a wide range of potential legislation that could further lessen the need for consumers to use a tax preparation company, H&R Block is an investment I would avoid entirely at this time.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

As their fiscal year comes to a close at the end of April and they release their earnings report, I believe it is a critical time for them as a company.Post tax season has not been kind to H&R Block the last two Mays. Last year earnings was favorable and we saw a 13% drop. This was almost identical to what happened in 2011. The chart below shows the dramatic drop, and in both cases the stock made a slow and steady upward progression, before taking off in 2013.Also, as you can see from the chart Intuit has more closely mirrored the S&P 500 (I'm not saying that this is good or bad). Historically, H&R Block has a Beta of .98 while Intuit's is .75.Over the last 3 quarters, H&R Block has missed earnings expectations, as indicated in the chart below. The January miss was particularly bad. Then again, that hasn't seemed to deter investors. The EPS estimate for April 2013 is 2.65.In the short term, I am bearish on H&R Block and believe that selling/shorting is an option because there will be a regression for the following reasons:Here is the HRB over the last year, taken from Yahoo charts. I have added a purple line which shows the trending level of support. Take notice how from May 2012 - Jan 2013, it is dead on consistent and matches with the 50 day moving average, and carried out it is right about where the 200 day moving average is currently. I have added some other points of reference where, as I've stated, I believe the current P/E ratio is inflated a bit. The prices are labeled where the P/E ratio was in January and where the price would be if it mirrored the S&P 500.I believe the analysts are probably correct in that a year from now, HRB stock price will be around $29.00. However, I feel that a pullback to below $23 or 25% is very probable. I additionally feel that we will see the trend of dumping H&R Block in early May continue. When that happens, I for one will be monitoring to see if the stock will continue to decline or if it might be the right time to enter.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Because at the end of the day, if you are an investor, you are buying the business. The FAST Graphs™ presented with this article will focus first on the business behind the stock. The orange line on the graph plots earnings per share since 1999. A quick glance vividly reveals the historical operating record of the company.This article will reveal the business prospects of H&R Block Inc (NYSE:HRB) through the lens of FAST Graphs - fundamentals analyzer software tool. Therefore, it is offered as the first step before a more comprehensive research effort. Our objective is to provide companies that have excellent historical records and appear reasonably priced based on past, present and future data and expectations.A quick glance at the graph itself and the orange earnings justified valuation line will tell the readers volumes about how well the company has historically been managed and performed as an operating business. Simply put, the reader should ask whether this example is worthy of a greater investment of their time and effort based on the data as presented and organized. The FAST Graphs' unique advantage is the graphical articulation of the price value proposition.Earnings Determine Market Price: The following earnings and price correlated FAST Graphs™ clearly illustrates the importance of earnings. The Earnings Growth Rate Line or True Worth™ Line (orange line with white triangles) is correlated with the historical stock price line. On graph after graph the lines will move in tandem. If the stock price strays away from the earnings line (over or under), inevitably it will come back to earnings.Earnings & Price Correlated Fundamentals-at-a-GlanceA quick glance at the historical earnings and price correlated FAST Graphs™ on H&R Block Inc shows a picture of in-value based upon the historical earnings growth rate of 8.3% and a current P/E of 15.3. Analysts are forecasting the earnings growth to continue at about 11%, and when you look at the forecasting graph below, the stock appears in value (it's within of the value corridor of the five orange lines - based on future growth).H&R Block Inc: Historical Earnings, Price, Dividends and Normal P/E Since 1999Performance Table H&R Block IncThe associated performance results with the earnings and price correlated graph, validates the principles regarding the two components of total return: capital appreciation and dividend income. Dividends are included in the total return calculation and are assumed paid, but not reinvested.When presented separately like this, the additional rate of return a dividend paying stock produces for shareholders becomes undeniably evident. In addition to the 5.7% capital appreciation (green circle), long-term shareholders of H&R Block Inc, assuming an initial investment of $1,000, would have received an additional $585.10 in dividends (blue highlighting) that increased their total return from 5.7% to 7.5% per annum versus 2.6% in the S&P 500.The following graph plots the historical P/E ratio (the dark blue line) in conjunction with 10-year Treasury note interest. Notice that the current price earnings ratio on this quality company is as normal as it has been since 1999.A further indication of valuation can be seen by examining a company's current P/S ratio relative to its historical P/S ratio. The current P/S ratio for H&R Block Inc is 2.30 which is historically normal.Looking to the FutureExtensive research has provided a preponderance of conclusive evidence that future long-term returns are a function of two critical determinants:1. The rate of change (growth rate) of the company's earnings2. The price or valuation you pay to buy those earningsForecasting future earnings growth, bought at sound valuations, is the key to safe, sound and profitable performance.The Estimated Earnings and Return Calculator Tool is a simple yet powerful resource that empowers the user to calculate and run various investing scenarios that generate precise rate of return potentialities. Thinking the investment through to its logical conclusion is an important component towards making sound and prudent commonsense investing decisions.The consensus of 7 leading analysts reporting to Capital IQ forecast H&R Block Inc's long-term earnings growth at 11%. H&R Block Inc has medium long-term debt at 57% of capital. H&R Block Inc is currently trading at a P/E of 15.3, which is within the value corridor (defined by the five orange lines) of a maximum P/E of 18. If the earnings materialize as forecast, based upon forecasted earnings growth of 11 %, H&R Block Inc's share price would $41.22 at the end of 2018 (brown circle on EYE Chart), which would represent a 13.6% annual rate of total return which includes dividends paid (yellow highlighting).Earnings Yield EstimatesDiscounted Future Cash Flows: All companies derive their value from the future cash flows (earnings) they are capable of generating for their stakeholders over time. Therefore, because Earnings Determine Market Price in the long run, we expect the future earnings of a company to justify the price we pay.Since all investments potentially compete with all other investments, it is useful to compare investing in any prospective company to that of a comparable investment in low risk Treasury bonds. Comparing an investment in H&R Block Inc to an equal investment in 10-year Treasury bonds illustrates that H&R Block Inc's expected earnings would be 5.5 (purple circle) times that of the 10-year T-bond interest (see EYE chart below). This is the essence of the importance of proper valuation as a critical investing component.Summary & ConclusionsThis report presented essential ""fundamentals at a glance"" illustrating the past and present valuation based on earnings achievements as reported. Future forecasts for earnings growth are based on the consensus of leading analysts. Although with just a quick glance you can know a lot about the company, it's imperative that the reader conducts their own due diligence in order to validate whether the consensus estimates seem reasonable or not.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1205431,35501,2013-02-20T02:38:17-05:00,,"This past December we made a recommendation to consider a long position in H&R Block (NYSE:HRB) based upon pending tax changes and the benefit that tax software companies should see based upon those changes. Although Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) could also benefit from the changes, we felt that H&R Block was in a better position based upon providing both software and tax preparation services. At this point, the stock has increased over 42% in less than three months.When a stock increases a large amount in a short period of time, it is always a good idea to step back and listen to the voice of reason. There may be a good and completely justified reason for the increase, meaning that we should continue to hold the stock. However, the increase might also result in higher-than-justified price based upon demand, which would indicate that we should sell the stock and realize our gains.Changes In Valuation, Earnings, And IndicatorsThe recent price spike has pushed the TTM P/E above 20. This in itself is not an issue, but something to consider as it moves the stock out of what was clearly undervalued territory. Earnings are projected to increase for the next two years, indicating that the stock should generally increase in price. When we look at P/E from a forward-looking perspective, it returns back to a range near 15 - much more in line with what is a fair value with some room for expansion. Yet despite this, the increase seen over the past 30 days does seem to be excessive given the environment.There are six brokers providing price targets on H&R Block. The targets range from $17 to $27 with a mean target of $23.75, a little over 5% below the current price. The average recommendation does still fall in the Buy range, but analyst recommendations are often slow to change based upon market events. In fact, the most recent analyst recommendation came on December 18, 2012 when Compass Point downgraded the stock from Buy to Neutral.At this point the RSI for H&R Block is over 85, indicating the stock is now significantly overbought. All moving averages are trending upward very nicely, but the momentum does show indications of slowing.RecommendationsThose who bought this stock in December should set appropriate stops to guarantee a gain in case the stock price drops. There is potential for continued upward movement, but at this point any momentum appears to be slowing and the stock may have overshot a currently fair price. It is hard to argue with locking in a significant gain in under three months.Given the rapid rise in price, it is likely not a good time to consider establishing a long position. Although the price could continue upwards, this stock has not seen an event quite like this since the end of 2003. Likewise, with the uncertainty in price direction from this point I would not establish a short position at the current time without establishing some type of hedged position. Caution is advised from here.Disclosure: I am long HRB. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).

Not only have the dividends been continuous, but they have been growing nicely as well. Since 2005, the dividend has grown at an average annual rate of 8%. Last year alone, the company increased the dividend by 33%.The current yield now stands at 4.3%, which is significantly higher than the S&P 500 average. Since May of last year, H&R Block has been heavily committed to returning capital back to shareholders, the company has return nearly $900 million back in form of dividends and buybacks.H&R Block is not only a great buy due to its yield, but the fact that investors can feel safe investing in the company. The company is one of the largest tax preparers in the world. It maintains a strong market share of around 16.4%, which is actually a 30bps increase from where it initially was. In addition to this, the industry is constantly growing. Management expects growth to be stable between 1%-2%. This is mainly due to an increase in population growth. H&R Block has also been taking digital market share away from companies such as Intuit. It's estimated that H&R grabbed nearly a 100bps in market share from Intuit and TaxAct.H&R is also focusing on adding to the bottom line, but focusing on stronger saving initiatives that will help lower costs. Management has laid out a plan to save between $85 million - $100 million. The company has been shedding non-core assets such as its sale of RSM McGladrey and discontinuation of EXPRESSTAX. These assets were not large growth drivers for the company and by shedding them will add significant value. In addition to this, H&R has solved most of its pending litigation issues. All of these initiatives would mean at least an addition 30 cents per share.The company has also been focusing on international growth lately. In Australia alone, H&R grew revenue by 11%. This increase in growth alone helped H&R beat analyst expectations for last quarter. Analysts were expecting a loss of 40 cents per share, while the company reported a loss of 37 cents. Please note that due to the seasonal nature of H&R's business, the company typical reports losses for similar quarters.In a low interest rate environment such as this, investors often find themselves chasing yield. However, the issue is that this causes investors to go for riskier asset classes, which can have a damaging effect on your portfolio in the future. H&R is a stable company that is growing and will continue to take market share away from competitors. The tax preparation business is an industry that will always be around. H&R is a great company with a growing dividend. I recommend dividend growth investors should consider purchasing shares of H&R as they will be a great investment going forward.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

The whisper number is $0.02, three cents ahead of the analysts' estimate.

Knowing how likely a stock's price will move following an earnings report can help you determine the best action to take (long or short). In other words, we look at what happens when the company beats or misses the whisper number expectation.The table below indicates the average post earnings price movement within a one and 30 trading day timeframe:The strongest price movement of -3.2% comes within 10 trading days when the company reports earnings that beat the whisper number, and +1.6% within 20 trading days when the company reports earnings that miss the whisper number. This indicates an ""opposite price reaction.""The table below indicates the most recent earnings reports and short-term price reaction:The post earnings price movement within five trading days has been positive in four of the four most recent quarters with a whisper number. The company did beat the whisper number in only two out of four of these quarters. In the comparable quarter last year, the company reported earnings five cent shorts of the whisper number. Following that report, the stock realized an 8.9% gain in five trading days. The company did not have a whisper number last quarter.

1055531,25120,2012-12-10T15:26:16-05:00,,"Shares of H&R Block (HRB) gained more than 3% over the past trading week. The provider of tax preparation and banking services reported its second quarter results on Thursday before the market open. The results were well-received by the market.Second Quarter ResultsH&R Block reported second quarter revenues of $137.3 million for its fiscal 2013, up 6% on the year. Revenue growth was driven by strong performance in Australia. Revenues comfortably beat analysts consensus of $130.5 million. Note that the second quarter is traditionally a very quiet one for H&R Block, making up just 5% of annual revenues.The company reported a net loss of $101 million, compared to a loss of $123 million last year. Net losses came in at $0.37 per diluted share, after the company retired almost 10% of its shares outstanding over the past year. Analysts expected H&R Block to lose $0.40 per diluted share.Thanks to restructuring efforts, H&R Block remains on pace to deliver $85-$100 million in pre-tax cost savings for the fiscal year of 2013. CEO Bill Cob commented on the resultsValuationH&R Block ended its second quarter with $1.30 billion in cash, restricted cash and equivalents. The company operates with $1.51 billion in short- and long-term debt, for a net debt position of roughly $200 million.For the first six months of its fiscal 2013, H&R Block generated revenues of $233.8 million. Net losses, due to the seasonality of the business came in at $212.7 million for the period. Typically the company generates roughly 70% of its total revenues in the ""tax"" quarter, ending on April 30.The company is on track to generate revenues of $3 billion. The company could earn around $400 million for the year.The market currently values the company at $5.0 billion. This values the firm at 1.7 times annual revenues and roughly 12-13 times annual earnings, based on my estimates above.H&R Block currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.20 per diluted share for an annual dividend yield of 4.3%.Some Historical PerspectiveYear to date, shares of H&R Block have risen some 16%. Shares started the year around $16 in January and rose to $17 during spring. Shares fell back to $15 after a the company took measures to improve performance, after a slightly disappointing important ""tax"" quarter. Shares continued to recover, currently exchanging hands at the highest levels of this year around $18.50 per share.Over a longer time period, shares of H&R Block have fallen from highs of $25 in 2008 to lows of $10 in 2010. Revenues and earnings have been under pressure in recent years, as online tax tools started to take business away from H&R Block. The company retired roughly a fifth of its shares outstanding over the past 5 years, thereby maintaining earnings per share.Investment ThesisH&R Blocks looks with confidence into the future. The Affordable Care Act will boost revenues in the coming years as the increased complexity will drive business. The tax returns which H&R Block helps to prepare include much of the information needed under the act. The fiscal cliff discussions might be helpful as well as most commentators do not expect the tax code to get simplified. The changes in the tax code are really beneficial to firms like H&R Block and Intuit (INTU).The company furthermore focuses on creating business with its customers around the year, not just in the quarter ending April. The company hopes to reduce the seasonality of the business, and expand into foreign markets. The company continues to aim for $100 million of pre-tax cost savings for the fiscal 2012. In October, the company announced that it might drop its designation as a Savings & Loan company due to increased regulation and compliance costs.The company will furthermore focus on long-term expansion plans in India and Brazil. Last year, the company only generated $233 million in international revenues, less than 10% of total revenues.Long-term, the prospects for H&R Block look very good. The tax preparation market is very much fragmented with independents and CPA's having a total 70% market share. Despite the abundant online tax preparation tools, 90% of tax files still occur with assistance.I think shares offer outstanding long-term potential, given the strong value that shares represent. Value multiples are fair, while shareholders receive strong returns in the form of a decent dividend yield and continued share repurchases. Don't expect spectacular capital gains, but the dividend yield is very decent.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2264023,25120,2014-06-11T14:14:35-04:00,"H&R Block reported excellent results over tax season.Strategy to focus on profitable customers is paying off.Shares are fairly valued, and the dividend and rock solid balance sheet create a margin of safety.","H&R Block (NYSE:HRB) opened its books for the so important fourth quarter on Wednesday before the market open. With few businesses exhibiting such a large seasonality as H&R Block does, investors laid a close eye on the solid results.Shares are fairly valued as the company is focused on future growth. The company trades at 15 times current earnings and operates with a rock-solid balance sheet. I am a long-term buyer on dips.Fourth Quarter HighlightsH&R Block reported fourth-quarter revenues of $2.56 billion, up 16.5% compared to last year. Analysts were looking for revenues to rise to just $2.49 billion.The company posted net earnings of $910.0 million, up 37.0% compared to the year before. Given the modest dilution in the shareholder base, earnings per share rose by 36.0% to $3.29 on a diluted basis. Adjusted earnings of $3.36 came in comfortably ahead of consensus estimates at $3.23 per share.The So Important Tax SeasonThe solid performance is of crucial importance for H&R Block. The fourth-quarter revenues make up an astonishing 81% of total revenues for the year, making it hard to find a business out there seeing such a degree of seasonality in its business model.The fact that the company posted such impressive results in the final quarter is a huge relief for a company which is reporting losses in each of the other three quarters of the year.The company is clearly focusing on more profitable customers, reporting solid revenue growth on an annual basis despite serving fewer clients.Valuing H&R BlockThe company ended the tax season quarter with $2.19 billion in cash and equivalents, excluding restricted cash holdings. Total debt of $906 million still results in a comfortable net cash position of nearly $1.3 billion.Full-year revenues came in at $3.02 billion thanks to the strong final quarter. Earnings advanced to $500 million, up from $465 million last year. At $32 per share, H&R Block's equity is currently valued around $8.8 billion which on its turn values operating assets at roughly $7.5 billion.This values operating assets at 2.5 times annual revenues and 15 times annual earnings.H&R Block currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share for an annual dividend yield of 2.5%.Growth Potential In A Fragmented IndustryAt the end of last year, H&R Block held a very interesting presentation for its investors. The company is actually the largest tax preparer in the world, filing one in every six tax returns in the US.The company employs about 80,000 tax professionals with an average tenure of 8 years who assist customers with their taxes and related financial services. Over the past year, H&R generated $3 billion in revenues, predominantly by assisting in 24.2 million tax returns which translates into an ¨ARPU¨ of $124 per filing.The company continues to focus on taxes through its ¨plus¨ program while it sees huge opportunities thanks to changes in the healthcare system. The fragmented industry and lack of regulation for tax preparers is also providing H&R with a huge opportunity to benefit from consolidation in the coming years.Takeaway For InvestorsFiling taxes is not a preferred task of many consumers, a reason why roughly 60% of the population seeks assistance when filing taxes, a market growing at 1-2% per year.Investors have been happy with CEO William Cobb being onboard since 2011. The cost cutting moves and strategic directions have resulted in shares doubling from $15 to levels in the low thirties at the moment. Despite the move, shares have only moved up about 30% over the past decade as the company has witnessed a steady decline in revenues, only partially offset by share repurchases.Shareholders are betting on a rejuvenation of growth under the tenure of Cobb which is focusing on more profitable clients, while boosting prices to drive earnings. H&R Block aims to further grow in a still very fragmented market.Cobb also sold the company's banking unit in April of this year. Of course, this increases the reliance on the volatile tax season which makes investors a bit nervous to some degree. On the other hand, shares currently trade at just 15 times earnings after backing out the net cash holdings of the firm, which is reasonable.Double-digit revenue growth will be hard to replicate into the new year, yet the valuation is not too demanding. Shares offer a bit of value on potential pullbacks, and I would be a buyer in the $28-$30 region.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

In the do-it-yourself segment, the biggest competitor is Intuit.The catalyst for H&R Block is its decision to avoid the onerous regulations being imposed on the banking industry by divesting itself of its banking operation. HRB has engaged Goldman Sachs Group to explore options. Getting rid of the bank might place HRB into play as an acquisition target. imageREVENUEHRB reports on an April fiscal year.

Accounts payable have experienced a similar trend dropping from $1,391.3 million in 2006 to $414.6 million in 1Q13.Short term debt has fluctuated very widely over the years. It peaked in 2007 at $1,576.4 million and dropped to a low of $25.6 million in 2011. As of 1Q13, short term debt grew back to $600.6 million, just a little less than the $631.4 million at the close of F12.CAPITAL ALLOCATIONHRB pays an indicated dividend of $0.80 per year. The five year dividend growth rate is 5.7%. The indicated dividend provides for a 4.7% yield at the current share price and is above the five year average yield of 3.4% and the seven year average yield of 3.0%. The payout ratio is 66.4% which suggests little room for additional growth. The dividend represents 74.3 of free cash.The company has also been aggressively buying back shares. The average number of shares outstanding as of 1Q13 was 277.1 million. At the end of F12, the average number was 297.8 million. Since 2009, the average number of shares outstanding was reduced by 55.6 million or 16.7%.PROFITABILITYHRB is very profitable as measured by return on equity. ROE 12m is 34.7% compared to the industry median of 8.2%. Return on invested capital 12m is 47.41% compared to the industry median of 10.13%. The cash return on invested capital is 23.81% whereas the industry median is 11.17%.VALUATIONThe company has a trailing PE of 14.1, a 17% discount to the S&P 500. The forward PE, of 10.5 is also low. On a price to sales and price to book basis, HRB is selling at a premium to its industry median.I also look at three enterprise value based metrics. The company has an enterprise value to free cash ratio of 16.11 and an enterprise vale to sales ratio of 1.67. These are substantially above the industry median values.On the other hand, HRB has an enterprise value to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) ratio of 7.92. This ratio is below the industry median and is low on an absolute basis.By most valuation measures, HRB seems richly valued relative to its industry median. However, I believe the above high levels of profitability, both earnings based and cash based, justify higher valuations.CONCLUSIONSI think H&R Block represents a good value for a company that is as profitable as it is. The company has definite challenges and needs to stabilize its long term decline in revenues. Its expansion into India may lift expectations. Competition from companies like Intuit may abate with future changes to the tax laws making it even more difficult for the D-I-Y crowd to prepare their own taxes.I think HRB has a low valuation based on PE and EV/EBITDA. When I combine these low valuations with high levels of profitability and analyst projections of revenue growth, I see a compelling opportunity. Divesting HRB Bank may make this company a tempting acquisition target.Disclosure: I am long HRB. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

The firm earned $1.99 per share vs. the Street consensus of $2.02 per share, while revenue was in line with expectations of $2 billion, even though the company served a record 25.6 million customers.However, the firm was able to return tremendous amounts of cash to shareholders, as the firm repurchased 1.5 million shares in the fourth quarter and 14.6 million throughout the fiscal year. Further, the firm raised its dividend 33%, and shares now provide investors with an annual yield in excess of 5%.Tax preparation revenues increased 1.2% for the year, but decreases in revenue from financial services related products tumbled as a result of increases in free refunds for clients using the firm's prepaid MasterCard (NYSE:MA). Although this increased the number of MasterCard's issued by 24%, it resulted in an overall decline in refund-anticipation-check revenues.H&R Block is still working through issues related to its discontinued operations, RSM McGladrey and Sand Canyon Corporation. These mortgage operations lost $80 million for the year and currently face over $600 million in claims. The firm's liabilities have weighed on the share price, but we suspect this headwind to disappear when there is more clarity on legislation. H&R Block has nearly $2 billion in cash, so we do not think that even a settlement in excess of $600 million will substantially harm the firm's long-term financial health.At current levels, H&R Block trades at the low end of our fair value range. Shares yield over 5% annually, the firm is committed to returning cash to shareholders, and we think the company will be able to raise its dividend once liabilities related to RSM and Sand Canyon are clarified.Perhaps needless to say, history has revealed that the best-performing stocks during the previous decades have been those that shelled out ever-increasing cash to shareholders in the form of dividends, and H&R Block may fit that mold. Unfortunately for the individual investor and time-strapped financial advisor, most dividend analysis that we've seen out there is backward-looking -- meaning it rests on what the company has done in the past: how long it has raised its dividend, etc. One only has to look at the recent financial crisis to understand how rear-view mirror investing could be a recipe for disaster.That said, we think analyzing historical trends is important, but we think assessing what may happen in the future is even more important. That is why we created a forward-looking assessment of dividend safety through our innovative, predictive dividend-cut indicator, the Valuentum Dividend Cushion™. We use our future forecasts for free cash flow and expected dividends and consider the company's net cash position to make sure that each company is able to pay out such dividend obligations to you -- long into the future. H&R Block registers an impressive 2.5 on our Dividend Cushion, meaning that it can cover future dividends 2.5 times with future cash flow after considering its capital structure. That's very impressive, given the size of its dividend payout. Though we don't hold the firm in either of our actively managed portfolios, we think H&R Block could make an interesting addition to our Dividend Growth Portfolio at the right price.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

314186,24945,2011-12-15T15:08:20-05:00,,"H&R Block’s (NYSE:HRB) “black Friday” doesn’t come the day after Thanksgiving like a lot of businesses, but rather, is a result of “Tax Day” which is typically on April 15th, but due to April 15th falling on a Sunday in 2012, Tax Day is on April 17th in 2012. In its Q2 2012 earnings conference call, H&R Block reported a $0.41/share net loss from continuing operations, which is not uncommon for the company outside of tax season. The company also indicated it disposed of some non-core assets with the sale of its tax-consulting firm RSM McGladrey and the shuttering of its ExpressTax franchise business. The company is proposing the remnants of ExpressTax join H&R block. The company is also dealing with problems related to its mortgage subsidiary Sand Canyon, which experienced a spike in claims related to bad loans written by its shuttered subprime mortgage unit. The claims increased to $483 million during the quarter, but the company dismissed the issue somewhat by noting that 85% of previous claims have been found to be invalid. I’m not so sure the dismissal is warranted, as 15% of $483 million is $72.5 million, which is pretty sizable chunk of change. H&R Block assured during the conference call that the company is shielded via corporate veil from issues related to Sand Canyon. The company indicated it renewed its partnership with Wal-Mart Stores (NYSE:WMT), and will have approximately 300 offices located in Wal-Mart stores this year. In the conference call, the company indicated it is focused on growing market share and its number one priority is client growth. This also struck me as off-target, as I would think the company’s number one priority should be to serve its current customers well. H&R Block’s competitors include Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) and Jackson Hewitt Tax Service (private). Intuit offers QuickBooks financial software services and TurboTax tax preparation products and services. H&R Block’s stock price has been stuck in a trading range from $11 to $17.50 over the last year as shown below:  H&R Block announced it increased its annual dividend by 33% to $0.80. It also announced its next divided of $0.20 per share is payable on January 5, 2012 to shareholders of record as of December 22, 2011 with the ex-dividend date being December 20, 2011. With H&R Block’s upcoming dividend and the Sand Canyon black cloud overhead, an investor might consider a bearish in-the-money collar for the company's stock. The bearish in-the-money collar is a reverse of a typical collar as the position is bearish and the options are in-the-money. A bearish in-the-money collar may be entered by selling an in-the-money call option against a purchased or existing stock and purchasing an in-the-money put option. Using PowerOptions tools, a bearish in-the-money collar was found with a potential return of 8.5% and a maximum potential loss of 5%. The potential return for the stock price being unchanged on the ex-dividend date is estimated at 1.2%. The returns and losses were calculated assuming receipt of the $0.20 dividend payment. The call option to sell is the 2012 Jan 14 at $1.72 and the put option to purchase is the 2012 Jan 16 at $1.22. The prices for the options were calculated at midway between the bid/ask spread, so this position should be entered with a net debit to receive the $1.72 price for the call option and the $1.22 price for the put option. A profit/loss graph for the bearish in-the-money collar is shown below:  With H&R Block handcuffed to Sand Canyon, the company’s stock price does not appear to be positioned for appreciation in the near term and maybe for the long term, so the bearish in-the-money collar provides protection in case the stock price increases significantly, yet provides a potential profit if the company’s stock price remains unchanged or drops in price. To receive the $0.20 dividend, the stock should be held at least until the ex-dividend date of December 20, 2011.

Unfortunately for the individual investor and time-strapped financial advisor, most dividend analysis that we've seen out there is backward-looking - meaning it rests on what the company has done in the past: how long it has raised its dividend, etc. We're looking to change that view.Although analyzing historical trends is important, we think assessing what may happen in the future is even more important. That is why we created a forward-looking assessment of dividend safety through our innovative, predictive dividend-cut indicator, the Valuentum Dividend Cushion™. We use our future forecasts for free cash flow and expected dividends and consider the company's net cash position to make sure that each company is able to pay out such dividend obligations to you -- long into the future. In this article, let's evaluate the investment merits of H&R Block (NYSE:HRB), as well as its dividend.Investment ConsiderationsReturn on Invested CapitalH&R Block's DividendH&R Block's dividend yield is above average, offering just above a 4.8% annual payout at recent price levels - we prefer yields above 3%, and don't include firms with yields below 2% in our dividend portfolio.We think the safety of H&R Block's dividend is EXCELLENT (please see our definitions at the bottom of this article). We measure the safety of the dividend in a unique but very straightforward fashion. As many know, earnings can fluctuate in any given year, so using the payout ratio in any given year has some limitations. Plus, companies can often encounter unforeseen charges (read hiccups in operations), which makes earnings an even less-than-predictable measure of the safety of the dividend in any given year. We know that companies won't cut the dividend just because earnings have declined or they had a restructuring charge that put them in the red for the quarter (year). As such, we think that assessing the cash flows of a business allows us to determine whether it has the capacity to continue paying these cash outlays well into the future.That has led us to develop the forward-looking Valuentum Dividend Cushion™. The measure is a ratio that sums the existing cash a company has on hand plus its expected future free cash flows over the next five years and divides that sum by future expected dividends over the same time period. Basically, if the score is above 1, the company has the capacity to pay out its expected future dividends. As income investors, however, we'd like to see a score much larger than 1 for a couple reasons: 1) the higher the ratio, the more ""cushion"" the company has against unexpected earnings shortfalls, and 2) the higher the ratio, the greater capacity a dividend-payer has in boosting the dividend in the future.For H&R Block, this score is 3.0, revealing a nice ""cushion"" as well as the capacity to pay out its expected future dividends. The beauty of the Dividend Cushion is that it can be compared apples-to-apples across companies. For example, Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) scores a 1.4 on this measure. Also, for firms that have a score below 1 or that have a negative score, the risk of a dividend cut in the future is certainly elevated. In fact, the Valuentum Dividend Cushion caught all dividend cuts in our non-financial coverage universe, except for one (Marriot), which subsequently raised its dividend above pre-cut levels (meaning it shouldn't have cut it in the first place). The Dividend Cushion also caught the recent cuts by JC Penney (JCP) and SuperValu (NYSE:SVU). We use our dividend cushion as a key decision component in choosing companies for addition to the portfolio of our Dividend Growth Newsletter (please see our links on the left sidebar for more information).Now on to the potential growth of H&R Block's dividend. As we mentioned above, we think the larger the ""cushion"" the larger capacity it has to raise the dividend. However, such dividend growth analysis is not complete until after considering management's willingness to increase the dividend. As such, we evaluate the company's historical dividend track record. If there have been no dividend cuts in 10 years, the company has a nice growth rate, and a nice dividend cushion, its future potential dividend growth would be EXCELLENT, which is the case for H&R Block.And because capital preservation is also an important consideration, we assess the risk associated with the potential for capital loss (offering investors a complete picture). In H&R Block's case, we think the shares are fairly valued, so the risk of capital loss is MEDIUM. If we thought the shares were undervalued, the risk of capital loss would be LOW.All things considered, H&R Block stands out to us as one of the better income plays on the market.

The option may get exercised early for a gain. If not, after qualifying for the dividend, I will look to close out the covered option with a gain of about $0.01.In the last month, the stock has decreased in price -6.68 %, with a one year change of 3.64%.  Comparing to the S&P 500 price changes, the price performances are 2.48% vs. the S&P 500 from a month ago, and year to date difference is 25.26% vs. the S&P 500 price change.Remember, you must buy a stock at least three business days before the record date (at least one business day before the ex-dividend date) to qualify for a dividend.My last step (completed before making a trade on the same day) is to check company announcements, and news sources for possible events that may cause the stock price to move. This is especially important during earnings season.I research the different call options and calculate the expected probabilities based on Beta, Bid, Offer, Volume traded the current day, open interest, and time value / implied volatility. The Options offer some level of protection from down moves in the stock, and provide revenue to cover the times that the options do not fully cover down moves in the stock. Income is not needed from the option Premiums, so a break even from premiums received/stock losses ratio is a win.

300469,24866,2011-10-19T04:01:27-04:00,,"Whether it be selling its advisory unit, RSM McGladrey, or attempting to acquire 2SS Holdings, H&R Block (NYSE:HRB) is rightfully starting to focus more on its successful digital and retail businesses. Given my expectations for dramatic changes to the federal income tax code, it is my hope that this focus reinvents the company around a more sustainable model. If simplicity is the way of the future in tax policy, then H&R Block is in for some challenges unless it makes quick changes.Management plans on unveiling its capital allocation strategy sometime in December. At the first quarter earnings call, CEO William Cobb stated:While it has always been my belief that management should operate continuously and not on a meeting-by-meeting basis to release news, in this instance, management is making the right decision to wait. This is so for two reasons. First, the company will soon have its credit facility refinanced and its equity restructured. Second,  because an approval of the 2SS Holdings acquisition would result in H&R Block gaining a 25% market share against Intuit's (NASDAQ:INTU) 65%, thereby raising the relative importance of share buybacks in the capital deployment strategy.H&R Block currently offers an attractive dividend yield of 4.23%, although management has indicated that it is now seeking to find an alternative way to grow shareholder value. First quarter earnings were roughly in line with consensus, although it is important to note that nearly all revenue comes from fourth quarter results.Last tax season proved to be successful with digital return volume up 13.5%. It is likely that expenditures on marketing has increased in this area, since the strategy has worked well in the past. The tax preparer's free 1040EZ program helped traction in the retail segment, while the sale of RSM will improve margins and focus going forward.As many smaller competitors are likely to sell themselves given tax changes, H&R Block should consider expanding its portfolio through acquisitions. A more global and corporate offering would help de-risk the business while growing scale. While the $287.5M pending purchase of 2SS Holdings will be beneficial if it ever passes, integrating TaxACT into retail is far from the revolutionary change that the company needs.For around a decade, the stock has gone nowhere due to weak fundamentals and poor adaptation. With respective past and forward earnings multiples of 11.6x and 8.2x, incredible free cash flow generation, and an opportunity to exploit changes in tax policy, the stock is cheap with the market price trading below intrinsic value.Since the start of 2001, Intuit has more than doubled while H&R Block has only gone up by a third in value. Were it not so large, H&R Block would be a poster activist target yet again. SEC Chairman - turned - activist investor Richard Breeden may have proclaimed ""mission accomplished"" since stepping down from the board, but that remains very much to be seen for shareholders. The stock has been down by more than one quarter since his campaign began.Consensus estimates for EPS are that it will grow by 20% to $1.62 and then by 7.4% and 6.3% in the following two years. Analysts currently rate the stock slightly better than a ""hold"", while I rate it more towards a ""buy"".Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
244085,23967,2010-12-30T03:40:13-05:00,,"H&R Block (NYSE:HRB) was founded by two brothers shortly after the Second World War as a bookkeeping business. In a short time they came to realize that handling tax returns for individuals could be lucrative. H&R Block dominates the current tax preparation market and also owns RSM McLadrey which provides business services to mid size firms.The shareholders of H&R Block have had an unhappy year as they have watched their investment decline by about 45%, even including reinvested dividends. Such a decline is typically a cause for pause and analysis to determine if the selling has gone too far. This analysis follows, but first consider a brief overview of H&R Block and its industry.Industry and Business OverviewThe IRS provides data on tax filings each year. The latest data can be found here. Of the 144 million tax filers, 57.7% (or 83 million) chose to pay someone else to prepare the return for the 2010 tax season. H&R Block is the clear leader, with 20.1 million tax filings prepared in the United States (about 14.2 million came from retail operations and 5.9 million from digital sources). The company also owns tax preparation businesses in Canada and Australia.H&R Block is somewhat unique in having exposure to both retail and digital tax preparation. Intuit is the leader for digital tax preparation having sold about 20 million units of TurboTax last season (here is a link to the press release from Intuit detailing the performance of TurboTax last season). On October 13th H&R Block announced that it had entered into an agreement to purchase 2SS Holdings which produces TaxAct software. Should the deal close it would strengthen the company’s second place position in the digital market.The largest competitors in the retail market are Jackson-Hewitt and Liberty Tax. Liberty is privately held, but Jackson-Hewitt prepared about 2.5 million tax returns in the United States last year. Tax preparation is clearly a rather segmented market with thousands of independent accountants and firms offering service throughout the country.RSM McGladrey contributed $867 million in revenue last fiscal year and $59 million in pre-tax profits, about 22% and 7% of H&R Block’s consolidated totals respectively. Since a firm not owned by a CPA is legally prohibited from providing attestation services, a relationship exists with the partnership McGladrey & Pullen LLP so that both attest and non-attest services can be provided. The firm targets mid sized companies and also has a separate division (RSM EquiCo) that provides capital markets expertise.Reasons for Decline Three primary reasons exist for H&R Block’s sell off. I would like to both outline these and discuss them in some detail.Secular Shifts in Tax FilingsThe first is a long term shift in the way American’s file tax returns. Previously an individual could file taxes on his own or seek the help of an accountant or specialized firm such as H&R Block. Tax software has introduced a third option which allows filers to file returns in a guided manner that is sufficient for individuals without extremely complex returns. After completing the documents, filing the return electronically is simple. This presents a challenge to H&R Block’s traditional retail business, where its position is strong and revenue per transaction is much higher than for digital transactions.The retail tax business is in decline, to be sure. But H&R Block being the strongest firm is best positioned for inevitable consolidation. The company has been working to turn independent competitors into H&R Block franchises. This gives owners the opportunity to continue to take an active role in their business while benefiting from H&R Block’s scale. On the most recent earnings call, Alan Bennett, the company’s CEO, stated that this year the company will gain about 140,000 incremental filings from these purchases.It also appears that the company is seizing opportunity to improve productivity and cut expenses. For the first time, the company is categorizing accountants by their ability to retain clients and direct more business to those performing the best. Controlling expenses has been among the biggest reasons why operating losses have fallen in the most reason two quarters (losses are typical outside of tax season).One fact often overlooked is that the presence of H&R Block in both the retail and digital segments allows for opportunities that can be further exploited. For example, an individual purchasing digital software can speak to an accountant should questions arise. Digital competitors lack this infrastructure. The acquisition of 2SS has not closed yet, but at the time the acquisition was announced H&R Block said they expected to gain about 5 million unit sales. TaxAct has among the lowest selling price of all software, but combining the two operations will allow for the elimination of certain expenses (not least of which is simply researching the tax code each year). It seems likely that in the future H&R Block At Home and TaxAct will be developed in parallel as well, saving programming expenses. Management stated that if the deal closed in 2010 (it likely will not) it should be accretive to earnings in the amount of $.05 a share. That equates to about $16 million versus a purchase price of $288 million.Ironically, the most recent sell off in H&R Block’s stock came following an announcement concerning Refund Anticipation Loans (RAL). While earnings will be hurt in the current tax season, the elimination of this financial product may prove to be a long term benefit to the company.Refund Anticipation LoansH&R Block announced on December 27th that HSBC was prohibited from participating in the program in the coming tax season at the direction of the Office of the Comptroller of Currency. If you are interested in reading about RAL’s, this link directs you to the National Consumer Loan Center’s 2010 report on these loans. A company issuing a RAL fronts the anticipated refund to the customer through bank funding, allowing the customer to receive funds one to two weeks early but at a steep price. For the year 2008 the average RAL was $3,300 and cost about $88 in fees. Had H&R Block offered the service the charge would have been $29.95 plus 1.07% of the loan amount. The typical annualized rate of 72% (based upon the $88 average cost for borrowing $3,300 for two weeks) has been seen as predatory by many, not least by some in Washington. As such the decision to bar HSBC from making the loans was not an isolated one. It is part of a trend towards limiting the practice. The fees for the RAL are in addition to tax preparation fees. Unsurprisingly it is low income filers that tend to receive these loans.The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency last year denied Pacific Capital Bancorp the ability to underwrite RAL’s and Jackson Hewitt turned to Republic Bank and Trust to fill the void. JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) announced it would stop underwriting RAL’s in April of this year. It would appear that for the current tax season H&R Block is at a disadvantage, but that in the future these loans will disappear or be severely limited.For the current year, Oppenheimer analyst Scott Schneeburger estimated the impact to H&R Block’s earnings at $.13 per share.While the use of an RAL is important to H&R Block, it is far more important to Jackson-Hewitt and Liberty. The report by the 2010 National Consumer Loan Center referenced above notes the following:The commentator quoted above was actually a contributor to Seeking Alpha. You can read Shareholder Watchdog’s article in its entirety here. (It is well worth your time.)Regarding Liberty Tax Service, the same report noted the following: The federal government has unambiguously signaled that it wants to end the practice of RAL’s. This will hurt H&R Block, but it will be devastating to its chief competitors. As of right now, both Jackson Hewitt and Liberty Tax offer these loans, but one has to wonder how long this will last. H&R Block has shifted focus from RAL’s to the Emerald Advance Program. This can be used both as a prepaid debit card or a line of credit and is offered by the company’s in house bank. Most competitors lack the scale to offer a similar program. Mortgage Put Backs The final reason could prove to be the most significant. This relates to mortgage put back activity. H&R Block sold its mortgage servicing business to Wilbur Ross in 2008 and has been running off its portfolio of loans. The following summarizes H&R Block’s mortgages carried on its balance sheet over the last several years.  Jeff Brown, the CFO of H&R Block, went through the risks associated with mortgage put backs on the most recent earnings call. (The presentation can be viewed here, the transcript can be viewed here). The forthright and transparent manner in which the current risks are discussed is very refreshing and I would encourage you to read through this material, but I will also do my best to summarize the situation. H&R Block purchased mortgage loan originator Sand Canyon in 1997 and ceased originating mortgages at the end of 2007. These mortgages were mainly sold as whole loans or securitized. If certain conditions are met, the originator may be required to repurchase the loan. This is called a put back. In the case of Sand Canyon, for much of the portfolio, known deception at the time of the sale must be proven for a put back to occur. The loans that are likely to initiate put back claims are those originated in the years 2005 through 2007 for two reasons. One is the fact that the longer a loan is considered performing, the harder it is to prove fraud. The second is that loans originated in 2005-2007 are the most likely to default and thus produce a claim. For the years 2005-2007 Sand Canyon originated $83.7 billion in loans. Some of these loans have been paid in full while others are no longer warranted by the company. The initial principal balance for loans that do not fall into either of these categories is $43.7 billion and the unpaid portion of that is $33 billion. Only $500 million of the $43.7 billon total were sold to any GSE (this was Fannie Mae). This is significant because GSEs are the most aggressive and successful in filing mortgage put back claims. To date claims have totaled $707 million and $58 million has been paid out. The presentation provided for the second quarter earnings call clearly shows that claims can be volatile but show no signs of accelerating. In fact, as time passes the probability of a claim being filed declines since it has been roughly three years since any mortgages have been originated. Of filed claims, 84% have been rejected and for those accepted the loss severity has been 60%. Sand Canyon is wholly owned but run independently from H&R Block. The unit has $300 million of equity. H&R Block did not itself guarantee many of the originations. In fact, H&R Block is responsible for loans originated with a principal amount of only $1.7 billion. No claims have been received on these loans for about two years now. So while, a worst case scenario of Sand Canyon’s equity being wiped out is not pleasant, any suggestion that H&R Block itself could be at risk for bankruptcy seems extremely far fetched. Valuation Based on the factors discussed above, it seems that H&R Block is selling for a rather wide discount to fair value. While this tax season will be poor relative to the prior year, there is no reason to think that H&R Block will not grow its earnings over the coming decade. For one, H&R Block should be able to become a larger presence in the retail tax preparation market – perhaps much larger.
Even though it will continue to place second to Intuit in the digital market, should the 2SS Holdings acquisition close it should allow for reasonable synergies to be exploited. Opportunities exist to improve operational productivity and even mediocre economic growth would induce growth in aggregate tax filings and allow for RSM McGladrey to return to levels of profitability in the range of $100 million pre-tax from about $60 million last fiscal year. It does not seem egregious to me to forecast free cash flow growth of 3% over the coming decade and no growth thereafter. I used current year earnings estimates (after the RAL announcement) of $1.48 per share as a reasonable proxy for free cash flow per share, estimated a bounce back to $1.75 per share next year and 3% growth thereafter for nine more years, and terminal growth of 0%. Net debt is currently about $174 million. At a discount rate of 10% (I feel this is currently conservative in light of interest rates), these assumptions value H&R Block at about $22 per share. At the current price of $11.77, the yield is in excess of 5%. It is important to note that the validity of the valuation hinges on two key assumptions: the current year loss of RAL funding will not be a long term hindrance to H&R Block and that the company will not need to increase future reserves for subprime losses. Still, the valuation is about 15 times current year earnings estimates, which seem somewhat depressed. Not an unfair price to pay for an industry leader. Disclosure: I am long HRB."

255517,23757,2011-02-28T18:53:58-05:00,,"About H&R BlockH&R Block (NYSE:HRB) is the largest tax preparer in the United States and prepares roughly one out of every seven tax returns filed. The company was founded in 1955 and has prepared 550 million tax returns since then. The company also offers consulting and accounting services through a small subsidiary, RSM McGladrey.Over the past few years, HRB saw its share of the tax return market shrink. It moved into the mortgage and financial planning and investment products markets. Both moves turned out to be disastrous, with HRB getting caught in the subprime mess and selling its mortgage unit. The financial planning business also ended poorly with a flurry of lawsuits and the business being sold to Ameriprise. In 2007 after a proxy battle by Richard C. Breeden, a hedge fund manager and former SEC chairman, the previous CEO resigned. Former McDonald’s executive Russell P. Smyth was brought in. Last year Smyth left the company and HRB installed Alan Bennett as CEO.Problems/ThreatsHRB stock has dropped because the company is perceived to be under threat from three major items: (1) the loss of funding for Refund Anticipation Loans (RALs), (2) the growth in market share for TurboTax and other digital solutions, and (3) mortgage putbacks from its legacy mortgage origination activities.Loss of RAL FundingHRB stocked dropped precipitously when HSBC (HBC.A) announced it was backing out of an agreement to fund RALs for HRB. HRB sued, but the stock fell even further when the Office of the Comptroller of Currency stepped in and banned HSBC from providing RALs.As shown by the chart below, RAL and RAC fees (under the other category) make up 10% at most of revenues for HRB.  The biggest fear at the time seemed to be that the loss of RALs would lead customers to go to competitors who could offer RALs. The reality of the situation was different. It turns out there was just not a lot of RAL funding out there, although some competitors will have RALs that will not be nearly enough to meet the potential demand. HRB also offers numerous refund products that can take the place of RALs, including Refund Anticipation Checks (RACs) and various Emerald Card products. According to management, the RAL-to-RAC conversion will be neutral from an income standpoint.Additionally, with the FDIC informing Republic Bank & Trust in February to exit the RAL business, it seems that the government has made it clear that RALs are no longer welcome in the marketplace and we are likely moving to a future where no tax preparer is able to offer RALs.Digital and TurboTaxMany, including some sell-side analysts, have put forth the idea that H&R Block’s core business of tax preparation is in decline because of do-it-yourself, at-home or online software, specifically TurboTax. Indeed, almost any media article about H&R Block mentions the company is losing market share to TurboTax. With TurboTax (or other digital solutions) gaining market share and HRB’s market share declining, many have simply assumed the two are related. This is not the case.The chart below shows the percent of income tax returns filed using a paid preparer for that tax year. (Source: IRS data, Forbes, and H&R Block company presentation)Since the 1996 tax year, the percent of filers using a paid preparer has increased. The drops in 2003, 2007 and 2008 generally correspond to higher unemployment and/or greater job or economic uncertainty. Also keep in mind that TurboTax debuted in 1983 and was bought by Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) in 1993, so digital solutions have been in the market for the entire time period shown.Instead of hurting HRB, the data shows that TurboTax and other digital solutions have been making large gains in market share at the expense of old “pencil and paper” filers. HRB’s core market of assisted tax preparation is growing. The real reason for HRB’s loss of market is due to a combination of poor service and higher unemployment. While the customer service issue is easily corrected, the greatest long-term threat is continued high unemployment.Mortgage PutbacksThe largest short-term threat to HRB is mortgage putbacks. Mortgage putbacks occur when mortgage buyers force the mortgage originator to buy back the loan, typically due to misrepresentation or fraud. In order to attempt a putback, investors in the mortgages must gather 25% of the voting rights. HRB originated mortgages up to December 2007 via a subsidiary called Option One (now called Sand Canyon Corp or SCC). In 2008 HRB sold SCC to American Home Mortgage Servicing. However, HRB is still liable for any representations and warranties on mortgages originated by SCC while part of HRB.The chart below shows the mortgage balances outstanding for mortgages originated from 2005 to 2007, which were the problem years. HRB has received almost no putback claims for mortgages originated outside that time period. (Source: company presentation)Understanding the Putback ThreatThe threat of putbacks varies by the type of investor who bought the loans as well as the type of loan that was originated and the representations and warranties made by the originator. The mortgage investors can be broken down into four main types: GSEs, private label securitizations, whole loan investors, and monolines. HRB’s quarter-to-date mortgage putback claims are shown below, broken down by counterparty type.Click to enlarge (Source: company presentation)GSEsFor other mortgage originators GSEs have been the most active in putting back mortgages. The representations and warranties made to loans sold to GSE are the strongest, and the GSEs have slightly different standards for initiating putback claims than other investors. However, GSEs pose the smallest threat to HRB. SCC sold only approximately $500M worth of loans to FNMA. To date HRB has received claims totaling only $13M from GSEs. Putbacks by GSEs have been sporadic throughout 2009 and 2010 and show no signs of increasing.MonolinesSome securitizations were sold with insurance “wrappers” where monoline insurance companies agreed to insure portions of the security against default. Like GSEs, monoline insurers have been very active in pursuing putbacks. There are at least two differences, however, between monolines (and private label and whole loan investors) and GSEs. First, SCC is only obligated to repurchase loans for an evidenced breach of representations and warranties that has adversely affected the loan. Second, the reps and warranties for monoline-insured loans were generally more discriminating than for GSE loans1. Here again HRB has little exposure with only $2B in loans having been sold with insurance.Whole Loan InvestorsWhole loan investors make up a small portion of overall loans at only $2B. Many loans sold to whole loan investors included an early default provision whereby if a borrower defaulted on the first payment SCC was required to repurchase the loan. To date SCC has repurchased $1.3B in loans. However, the early default provisions have expired. There were some other reps and warranties provided that were not subject to a stated term. Altogether put backs from whole loan investors have steadily declined.Private Label SecuritizationsPrivate label securitization investors previously were not very active in pursuing putbacks. This was mainly due to the difficulty of securing 25% of the voting rights before the investors could ask the trustee to review the loan files to begin a putback claim. Also, the individual investors would need to bear the cost of any legal action. Finally, representations and warranties were much more discriminate than on GSE and monoline loans. Loans also tended to include extensive disclaimers and were generally not presented as investment quality. However PLS investors have now become more active in joining together to pursue putback claims. The worry is that these claims will be successful and the liabilities will begin to mount for HRB. A vast majority of the loans SCC originated, $39B, were sold as PLS with no monoline insurance. And, as in shown in the chart in the introductory section, PLS putback claims have now started appearing in 2010 and 2011 after having been absent in 2009.Why the Putback Risk Is OverblownWhile PLS putback claims are likely to rise, the risk is likely overblown. A recovering stock price seems to point to investors realizing that.No Doc (or Low Doc or Stated Income Loans) Was DisclosedSCC originated a large portion of no or low doc loans, and one misconception is that a borrower who is lying is grounds for a putback claim. This is generally not the case. For instance, say SCC originated a no doc (or low doc or stated income) loan where the borrower was not required to provide proof of income. When SCC sold the loan to a third party, if it disclosed that no proof of income was obtained and made no representations or warranties about the information provided by the borrower, then SCC is not liable to take back the loan if it is discovered that the borrower lied to obtain the loan.Time Is on Investors' SideAs the mortgage pools age, it becomes increasingly difficult for investors to make the case that loan noncompliance with underwriting standards was the cause of defaults and not economic factors. Also, as time goes by the outstanding mortgage balance continues to fall. Additionally, putback claims and payments happen over several years. HRB generates high amounts of free cash flow. Should paid claims overwhelm HRB’s mortgage loss reserves, it will have cash on hand to cover them. The situation is similar to tobacco companies that have been forced to pay out large damages claims but are paying those claims out over long periods of time rather than all at once.No Ongoing Relationships With BuyersFinally, there is one other important issue that is overlooked. Now that HRB is not in the mortgage origination business, it has no incentive to maintain good ongoing relationships by making policy adjustments to placate any mortgage buyers. Other banks still in the mortgage business have often been striking deals with investors. HRB has no incentive to relax any standards to placate buyers.Positive Trends: Improving Customer Service and Brand RecognitionAs we saw above, HRB is not losing customers to TurboTax or other digital solutions. Instead, the company has lost customers to other tax preparers through its years of mismanagement and poor customer service. Luckily, fixing these types of problems are some of the easier ones corporations face. HRB still offers a service, assisted tax prep, which customers want to use. HRB just has to figure out why the customers have left and what can be done to bring them back.Some highlights of the new customer service and advertising programs include the following:Front Desk/LobbyTax DeskCall CenterAdvertising CampaignFree Federal 1040EZ Filing designed to:Based on preliminary tax season results released by HRB the campaign and improvements seem to be working, as retail tax preparation is showing growth. It is also worth noting that HRB’s digital offerings are showing growth as well.Core Market Is GrowingThe population of the U.S. is growing (more tax filers), and the income tax guidelines are continuing to get more complicated.The chart below shows the number of words in the Internal Revenue Code and Regulations in thousands. The population of the U.S. continues to show strong growth.Oversight of Tax PreparersThe IRS has made statements that it believes paid tax preparers need greater oversight, possibly including such things as licensing and minimum competency tests. While such oversight is likely several years away, it would serve to drive out some of H&R Block’s competitors in the paid preparation field. HRB has said that it backs any such legislation that would increase oversight of the field.High Insider OwnershipHRB shareholders also benefit from having the interests of management and the company aligned. Chairman of the Board Richard Breeden, through his fund, owns 4.36% of the company.ValuationHRB is currently priced for negative growth on a discounted cash flow basis and trades at only 9 times earnings. With a growing potential market and improving customer service, there is no reason HRB cannot reverse course and see positive growth. Indeed, the company’s interim results have shown signs of growth at its retail locations.“It is better to be roughly correct than precisely wrong.” -John Maynard KeynesWhile it is possible to construct a valuation model based on several different growth rates, I prefer to take Keynes advice. If the market is wrong and HRB does begin to grow, then it is undervalued. By how much depends on just how successful HRB’s efforts are and likely won’t be known for at least another year. HRB is likely worth between $20 and $30 per share depending on how successful the turnaround is. The consensus estimate for earnings this year is $1.44. Attaching a reasonable multiple of 15 gives a price of $21.6 per share, and a higher multiple of 20 would give $28.8 per share.1 HRB conference calls, Standard & Poors: Reassessing the Cost of the Mortgage Putback Risk for the U.S. Banking Industry.Disclosure: I am long HRB."
243381,24244,2010-12-23T06:40:43-05:00,,"I found H&R Block (NYSE:HRB) in the same way that I find many companies: through my screening of Value Line. This was similar to Aeropostale (NYSE:ARO), in that the stock price was too high when I read the VL report, but it fell considerably since then. H&R Block is a business that Buffett has put money into in the past. Given the underlying fundamentals, I’m not surprised by this in the slightest; it really is a great company.H&R Block, if you’re not already intimately familiar, is a business whose core competence is providing tax return services to millions of Americans every year. This business was originally started by the Bloch brothers, Henry and Richard, when the IRS stopped offering free tax return services in 1955. The Blochs had already spent time trying to set up a business as accountants to provide tax services for small businesses. Once the IRS stopped offering their services, it was easy for the Blochs to switch gears and solely focus on preparing individual tax returns. Over the years, the company built up its dominance in the field and became the leading tax-return filer for the United States. One of the original brothers, Henry Bloch, remained at the helm of the company until 2000, when he resigned as Chairman of the Board.A few years before Henry’s resignation, in 1997, the company had finally decided to expand their business model from being only tax return advisors and moved away from their core competence to becoming the place to go for all financial services and advice. They acquired Option One Mortgage and started Block Financial Advisers to diversify their business model and allow for future growth. This was a move from only being tax return advisors to being the one-stop shop for all financial advice. If you take a look at HRB’s financials from 1997-2010, you will clearly see a boom and bust cycle that mirrors the mortgage industry. At the peak in 2007, HRB held a large amount of mortgages on their balance sheet. Many write-offs and losses followed. 2007 was the first time in the company’s entire history since 1955 that they posted a net loss. They posted a loss again in 2008. This should give you a picture of how much management had gotten outside the core competence of the business; the tax return business remained relatively consistent through the recession, and yet, the company posted large losses.Since then, H&R Block’s management finally decided to focus again on their core business of providing tax return services. Block Financial Advisors was discontinued and written off against income. They attempted to sell Option One to Cerberus Capital Management, but the deal fell through and the business was shut down entirely. With all this bad history from the last decade behind them, management has decided to once again focus on providing tax return services. When I first started reading through the annual reports, I was hoping that management had decided to completely stop with the mortgage nonsense. With that assurance, I moved forward to really dig and figure out what I could.The first thing that struck me was the VL page. At a quick glance, I could tell that the business requires very little capital to operate, had a manageable debt load, posted very consistent margins, and had very efficient assets over the last decade:This showed me it had the type of business that I am looking for. Unfortunately, all of their excess cash flow after capital expenditures is being used for dividends or share buybacks. This means that, although those 22% returns on assets are great, you as an owner cannot expect the business to find returns like that any more. The tax-return business is now mature, and has been for some time.I then began reading over the various SEC filings, trying to determine the various business segments and the how they make their money. Their business is separated into tax services, business services, and corporate operations. “Tax Services” is by far the largest segment of the business (75% of revenues) and is where the great business lies. Two thirds of this segment is made up of their retail tax return business, and one third is made up of various products and guarantees offered to their clients. If you’re really interested, I’d tell you to look further into it for yourself. Tax Services has had one issue in the past few months- the IRS has come out and said that since they process all tax returns quickly (I’m guessing it is not all electronic or they are just very efficient), they will no longer be releasing tax indicators to H&R Block on how much the client will be receiving in returns ahead of time. The IRS’s argument is that it only takes two weeks to receive your check from them and there is no reason to spend time letting H&R Block know how much the client will actually receive. This doesn’t sound like a big deal, but H&R Block has an agreement with HSBC Bank to extend either a loan (RAL) or a check (RAC) to the client on the day they file their tax return. This allows the customer to receive their tax return the day they file it if they choose, rather than wait for the IRS to send it two weeks later.H&R Block has been charging commissions on this and HSBC (HBC) has been charging loan-shark type interest for providing this service. The recent Frank-Dodd Bill will not allow interest rates as high as what they were charging, seeing as they are considered predatory. HSBC has been warned by the government, and after the IRS stopped sending in these tax indicators, HSBC would have much greater risk for determining the actual money coming back from the IRS that is used to pay back the check/loan. Therefore, HSBC dropped the service a year before the contract with HRB expired and HRB immediately filed a lawsuit. Because of this lost contract & fees, the Tax Services segment will lose about $170 MM of its earning power. Also in a similar realm with the Frank-Dodd Bill, H&R Block also offers an Emerald Advance Card that charges 35% interest on it. This will not be allowed in the same way that the HSBC agreement worked, so HRB will lose about another $80 MM from not being able to provide this service in the future. So, with an average earning power of about $850 MM last few years, if you subtract out these lost products, you’d end up with about $600 MM. This is the most consistent part of the business and can be relied on for being there into the future.Intuit’s (NASDAQ:INTU) Turbotax is the only real threat to the Tax Services segment, but Intuit’s services are targeted more toward people willing to take the time to do their own taxes. H&R Block believes that there will continue to be demand for their retail outlets and face-to-face interaction. In addition, H&R Block has attempted to make a few strategic acquisitions to counter TurboTax in the digital arena, but it will be very difficult to make any headway in this market. I’m just hoping they don’t overpay in hopes that throwing money at a problem will inevitably fix it.The other profitable part of H&R Block is their Business Services segment. This is made up of RSM McGladrey Inc and they provide tax and consulting services to small & medium sized businesses. Their earnings make up the remainder of HRB’s profitability at 25% of their business. Management has stated that they like the growth prospects for this segment, but I am not seeing this in the figures. To be conservative, I’ll treat this segment as a mature business as well. So, I am assuming that H&R Block is fully mature when making my final valuation. In terms of profitability for this segment, the business can reasonably be expected at about $80 MM. I have nothing else to say about this segment- there are no major changes the way there are with the Tax Services & HSBC/Dodd-Frank Bill.The final segment is Corporate Operations. This is made up mainly of mortgage loans held for investment and interest-bearing securities. All of these operations created speculative earnings for shareholders over the last decade as the mortgage bubble grew and H&R Block got caught up in this cycle like everyone else. This segment has posted losses the last 3 years due to large write-offs with mortgages. At the peak of the 2007 bubble, HRB held $1.6 B in mortgages, many of them toxic. Since 2007, the company has unwound many of their positions down to about $550 MM today. Of these current mortgages, about $320 MM are underperforming. Management has stated its commitment to winding down this entire mortgage portfolio and not entering into this any more in the future.The debt schedule for HRB moving forward is $600 MM due in 2013 and $400 MM due in 2014. Other major concerns would be further losses in the mortgage portfolio, so I decided to be as conservative as possible and write-off the whole $550 MM yesterday against earnings. Therefore, HRB owes $55o MM in 2011 for 100% losses in mortgage portfolio (far too conservative for reality), $600 MM in 2013, and $400 MM in 2014. The current earning power of Tax Services is at $600 MM and Business Services is about $80 MM. H&R Block can reasonably expect earnings around $680 MM moving forward. This can easily cover their debt schedule and all mortgage losses. Do not ignore this fact; all downside risk is covered within the company. There is still the risk of increased competition and it is something you must keep a close eye on, but the business is at a very low risk for imploding on itself.For valuation, this company is best valued as a mature business. Normally, I would use free cash flow, but for HRB having many mortgage losses & other write-offs, I decided to use my estimates of what the underlying business will earn in the future. Therefore, we should use the $680 MM from the two business segments and subtract out some of those mortgage losses the next few years. I figure, to be conservative considering further possible losses with mortgages, we should estimate roughly at $600 MM for the next 3 years and value the company accordingly. For mature companies, I demand a 20% initial return that I can reasonably expect to continue to be earned by my business as an owner. Therefore, to get a 20% return on $600 MM earnings each year, I’d want to pay about $3 B. If you look at how the company is allocating earnings, it is almost all going into dividends and stock buybacks. This is not a recipe for growth, only a way to distribute earnings to owners - this is why I demand 20% on my money.Also something to consider are the recent shifts in executive management. The CEO, CFO, and President of one of their divisions all recently quit/were fired. H&R Block has yet to have a consistent CEO since 2000, when Henry Bloch retired. I have trouble putting my money behind an untested and unknown management team, so I decided to pass on this investment when I first completed my research and HRB was selling at about $3.1 B. This would have lead to a 19% return, but with untested management skill recent shifts in corporate governance after receiving criticism, I decided to wait. I did not attempt to predict where the stock was headed, I just figured I would buy if I could get a better initial return on my money considering the risks behind management, TurboTax, and their mortgage portfolio. This company came close to my purchase price and I sat on my hands. Hopefully, I don’t regret it moving forward.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

The company also  remains focused on increasing its client retention rate. The recently  announced acquisition of 2SS Holdings Inc. will further boost the  company’s digital space, a business that is seeing a shift from assisted  tax preparation. However, a lackluster top-line keeps us on the  sidelines.We maintain a “Neutral” recommendation on H&R Block. The  quantitative Zacks #4 Rank (short-term Sell rating) for the company  indicates downward pressure on the shares over the near term."

262985,21863,2011-04-11T16:13:58-04:00,,"Six months ago, the bottom fell out from under the stock of H&R Block (NYSE:HRB).  Shares fell to a 10-year low, giving the stock a normalized P/E of  around 7 despite a strong balance sheet. Investors who pounced on the  opportunity have seen their shares appreciate by 70%, as the stock  closed in on $18 last week. The lessons to be learned from this value  play apply to a large number of current and future opportunities.      Many of the problems facing the company were short-term  in nature. For one thing, there was a great deal of concern over  whether H&R would be able to obtain bank financing for its RAL  product in time for this year's tax season. (The product allows  individuals expecting a refund to borrow against that anticipated  refund.)   Furthermore, there were worries about H&R Block's potential  liabilities on improper mortgages it may have issued. While the  discovery of these liabilities could result in a large hit to current  earnings, the company was capitalized such that it could afford to take a  hit of more than 10 times the company's liability estimates and still  easily survive, based on the stable, annual cash flows it receives in  its core tax-return business.  Nevertheless, the market panic was very real, scaring away many  investors. One comment I received after writing about the potential  opportunity at the time was as follows:The problem with this line of thinking is that it is very bad for  portfolio performance! Investing with the crowd is not the way to  outperform the market; it is contrarians who beat the market.  As such, when everybody else is selling something, that's when your  interest level should rise. (Conversely, when everyone else is buying,  it's probably a good time to exit.)  What may be even more interesting is that over the last six months,  these issues haven't really gone away. Mortgages can still be put back  on the company, the company was not able to secure RAL funding, and the  company continues to face headwinds with respect to its business model.  And yet the multiple at which the company trades now is much more  reasonable.  This reinforces the fact that its okay to buy companies with problems;  every company faces some challenges, but the ones that make for good  investments are cheap and have a financial position such that they can  outlast the problems. Rather than focus on the short-term headwinds,  therefore, investors should focus on the price they pay versus the long-term value they receive, irrespective of how the market is behaving.

What if one also assumed that there will continue to be a strong appetite for good-quality real estate? Well, if you put those two variables together, it’s not hard to envision an environment with lower cap rates. Lower cap rates drive Net Asset Values (NAV) higher, translating into higher total returns for REIT investors. Combine this with the near insatiable appetite for yield and income by investors and you’ll find that the prospects for REITs look very favorable. This is why we are super excited to present today’s interview with a top ranked portfolio manager, specializing in REITs. You may have seen him dispense his near encyclopedic insight on TV or maybe read his views in the newspaper but today, you’ll be able to find out his reasons for investing in REITs, how REITs perform in inflationary/deflationary environments, what metrics you should look at when evaluating REITs and a couple of his best investment ideas.Biography: Dennis has been with Sentry Investments since 2005 and has more than a decade of experience in the financial industry. As a member of the equity income portfolio management team, he manages the Sentry Infrastructure and REIT funds. Dennis has been a back-to-back winner of a Brendan Wood International TopGun Award (2009 and 2010); given by the sell-side analyst community to those with the best grasp of the industries in which they invest and the most influence in the Canadian market; one of only 50 managers selected from over 400 individuals nominated. He has an Honours BBA degree from Wilfrid Laurier University, an MBA from the Schulich School of Business at York University and is a Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA).Q: Don’t you think Canadians have enough exposure to real estate through their home?A: First off, most people don’t treat their homes as they would an investable asset. I mean if your house price was quoted every second from 9:30 until 4:00 I think that would be one thing but clearly it’s not. Most people look at their home as where they raise their family. They don’t really consider it an investable asset, until, well if at all, until later on, when they’re considering retirement, and at that point they start considering what proceeds they can realize from it and what that would do in terms of their standard of living and so forth. When we talk about real estate exposure, we’re talking about commercial real estate, which runs off the same two macro drivers, that being interest rates and GDP growth. The returns you realize from buying and selling your principle residence are going to be very different from the returns you get from a super-regional mall in Edmonton or Triple A luxury tower in downtown Toronto. So, the two points I would want to make is that most people don’t include their home as an investable asset and that the returns you’re going to realize from investment grade commercial real estate are going to be very different from what you would realize on your principle residence. So I think those are the two things that differentiate investing in REITs as opposed to owning a principle residence.Q: Given that the Bloomberg Canadian REIT Index has returned something like 25-26% year to date, what is your outlook on Canadian commercial real estate and REITS going forward?A: Well, we’re not so much concerned with what the returns have been generated year to date. We are more concerned with absolute valuations and then relative valuations. So if I look at absolute valuations Canadian REITs are usually valued on a free cash flow multiple basis so historically they’ve traded around 14 times and right now they are trading at 15 times so they’re not overly cheap as a sector. And then if you’re looking at relative valuations, generally people look at REITs in comparison to utilities or banks for the simple fact that they are generally stable cash flowing assets that offer the same type of return for the risk you are assuming. So on a relative valuation basis REITs aren’t overly cheap either. Idon’t have a spreadsheet open in front of me, I don’t know I can’t tell you off the top of my head where the relative valuations are but I know the last time I checked they weren’t cheap on a relative basis either. So what I would say to investors is that if you are looking at real estate today, you are looking for 8-12% total return, you know, 6-8% from income, and you know anywhere from 2-5% say or 2-4% on appreciation. If there’s a spot in your portfolio for those types of returns with that type of cash flow profile and lower risk parameters than by all means you should consider Canadian REITs. If you’re looking for 30 or 40% you know that window is closed. REITs are no longer you know trading at discount valuations that would imply those types of forward returns.Q: How are REITs affected in a rising interest rate environment? Can you talk about how REITs are exposed to the long end of yield curve as opposed to the overnight rate that is determined by the Bank of Canada?A: Sure, I mean you pretty much summarized it there. I mean the short end exposure for REITs really has to do with their lines of credit and most Canadian REITs do not carry large balances on their lines of credit and even if they did the amount they’d have in their mortgage portfolios would dwarf that anyways. So the real exposure there is at the long end of the yield curve for a couple of reasons. The first is obviously debt refinances, as you have mortgages coming up for renewal, are you renewing those mortgages at higher interest rates or lower? Then obviously there’s purchasing assets. All things being equal if you can finance an asset at 4.5% over 5 years as opposed to 5.5 % for 5 years, then generally it should be more accretive and should generate more cash flow growth per unit. Lastly it has to do with discount rates. If you’re going to use a multiple to value of Canadian REITs really what it is – it’s the inverse of a yield. So when we talk about AFFO multiples and I said Canadian REITs were trading at 15 times really what I’m saying is that Canadian REITs are trading at 7 and change free cash flow yield. So as interest rates come lower or go higher you would expect to get more of a cash flow yield or less of a cash flow yield out of Canadian REITs. And since interest rates have come down, yield should also have come down and that should mean multiples expand and Canadian Real Estate values should increase. So when you put all that together and you ask yourself what happens in a rising interest rate environment, well historically rates have gone up when inflation has picked up, and inflation picking up is usually a function of the economy running at very low output gap, meaning that the economy is running at almost full economic capacity, prices are going up, wages are going up. In that type of environment, the demand for commercial real estate increases, occupancies go up, rents goes up, cash flows go up, distributions go up and the real estate itself appreciates in value. REITs do poorly in deflationary environments for the complete reverse of that argument. Companies go bankrupt, they contract, they give back space on lease renewal, and that generally decreases the demand for commercial real estate. Occupancies come down, cash flows come down, and real estate depreciates in value. So historically REITs have done very well in rising interest rate environments when they do poorly is when there’s a recessionary or deflationary outlook or actual deflation or an actual recession taking place.Q: Just to follow up on that do you see a recessionary or a deflationary environment going forward? Is that something you were considering or not?A: Well I think you have to look to degrees. I mean if the economy is expanding at 20 basis points a year or you know contracting at 20 basis points a year it really doesn’t make a difference. Bottom line, the economy is very weak and there isn’t a lot of job growth. Now, if we’re talking about going back into the type of recession that we went into in 2008 where you’re talking about economic output contracting at 6%, no we don’t see that happening simply because we think that we’re into a time period here where people and companies are still deleveraging but it’s really moving at a much smoother consistent pace as opposed to 2008 where the credit markets shut almost immediately and companies like Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers all of sudden found themselves completely insolvent.I don’t think we’re headed into a period like that. So I don’t think investors have to factor that into their return forecast going forward. Now do I think we’re headed into a period of rampant inflation and unparalled growth? No and No. I think what you have to get used to is the status quo and I think you have to get used to that for another two or maybe even three years, where you’re in an environment of weak or lackluster or sub-par growth. There’s enough sort of structural growth in the economy to keep you know positive growth and to keep the economy expanding but nothing to write home about, nothing to get overly excited about. The government will probably have to pay a larger role in economic growth and expansion than they would be comfortable with and probably for longer than they would anticipate. But at the end of the day the economy will probably continue to expand. And when I say structural growth, let’s keep in mind that people are born every day. So the population of both the United States and Canada is increasing. So while we’re not buying more milk or we’re not buying more potatoes there are more people buying milk and potatoes. So you get natural growth that way. Households are still being formed, people are still graduating from university and getting jobs, people are still making pension plan contributions, RESP contributions, RRSP contributions, IRA contributions. That natural capital formation makes its way into the capital markets, not dollar for dollar but it does make its way into the capital markets and that pushes asset values. We’re seeing that right now. Don’t forget that there is also immigration. So there is natural structural economic growth that’s taking place in North America that should keep us onside.Q: Changing gears slightly, how do you find and source your investment ideas, Dennis?A: We don’t use screens. We’re pretty old school in that we just we assemble a list of companies and then we just do a lot of work on them. So when I started in this role 6 years ago I simply took the entire Canadian REITs and REOC universe and tackled them sector by sector. So I believe I started with multi-family and I took all of those companies and one by one I went through all their financials, built out models on each of them, decided whether or not this was an A B or C company, decided how much risk there was involved in investing in them and then I’d find a return hurdle to them. And I did that for – now we’re probably working on 200 companies. That’s what we do and we focus on the riskiness of each investment.I know when I’m on BNN everyone asks about target prices and what things are worth. We start by identifying how risky something is and we measure that by cash flow volatility, cash flow quality, and cash flow duration. So if you’ve got a triple A office tower 100% leased to Encana (ECA). Let’s use H&R’s Bow as an example, you’ve got a brand new triple A luxury office tower in one of the big 6 markets in Canada, a 20 year lease to Encana. You know, there’s very long duration of the cash flow, good quality is coming from Encana and Cenovus (NYSE:CVE) and low volatility in that that building is 100% leased for the next 20 years. So that’s something you ascribe a lower risk hurdle to. Now if you’ve got a limited service hotel in Fredericton and there isn’t much differentiating it from the other 8 or 9 limited service hotels, well, that’s short duration cash flow, it’s low quality and you know it’s prone to be much more volatile than even office. So that you’d ascribe a higher risk hurdle to, and when you’re looking at returns out of that type of investment, you’re going to want more return to justify the increased risk you’re assuming. So we’ve done that for about 200 companies. The good part is that most of the heavy lifting is done and you really only need to do that heavy lifting again if somebody changes materially and by that I mean they sell you know a material portion of their business or they acquire a material new business or if there’s an IPO. And so since we’ve identified the risk of most of these companies and we’ve assigned return hurdles to them, it really then just comes down to monitoring them, and buying them when they offer sufficient return for the risk you’re taking on and selling them when they don’t. So we’re pretty old school from that standpoint. I don’t take a lot of shortcuts in terms of screens or anything like that. You know we consult with the analysts on the street who who set target prices and so forth but our discussions more have to do with you know, you’re at 27 on this name and I’m at 24 – what are you using for an NOI (net operating income) margin, what are you assuming for new development, what are you assuming for same property NOI growth, those are the discussions we have as opposed to what do you like or what sector do you think is going to do better, that sort of thing. We have much more in depth and insightful, I think, discussions with analysts around names.Q: Okay, say you’ve done your research on a company and you like it. Firstly, what is a full position in your portfolio? Secondly, do you scale into your position (for example: maybe take an initial 50% and then wait for your thesis to play out and follow through with the remaining 50%) or do you take a full position right away?A: I believe in running a concentrated portfolio. I think studies show that the benefits of diversification begin to diminish at 25 names. Just from staying on top of names, really knowing them cold, I don’t think you can carry around more than 40 or 50 names in your head to that degree. So you know, I just think it makes more sense to put money into your 10 best ideas rather than to put money into your 40th or 50th best idea. So, I generally only have between 20 or 30 names in my portfolio at any one time. We have a rule of thumb where we go and see 60% of the value of real estate of anything we own so that requires us to go out and see the real estate, we meet with management, we build our own models. When you do that amount of work you’ve got a very high level of conviction and you don’t go out and buy 50 or 100 basis point weights. When the return you’re being offered justifies the risk you’re taking, we generally step in you know at the 4% level, and if something gets cheaper we’ll take the position as high as, well we’ve been as high as 9% in several names. On average any name in our fund will be somewhere between 4 and say 6%, maybe 6.5 and it really just depends on what the quality and the name is and the return being offered.Q: What are some of the numbers and metrics that you look at when trying to evaluate a REIT?A: In Canada we look at AFFO (Adjusted Funds From Operations). We model it out on an absolute basis but target prices are set based on per unit so a multiple of that. We also use Net Asset Values (NYSE:NAV) so that’s basically a private market valuation, (what you think the portfolio is worth if it were to be privatized?). In Canada we focus on AFFO generally because Canadian REITs tend to pay out all if not even more of the free cash flow they generate. I shouldn’t say that. Most Canadian REITs target somewhere between 90 and 95 but I think the average payout ratio is probably 95 or a little bit higher.In the United States we tend to focus on Net Asset Value. U.S. REITs tend to have much lower payout ratios and they tend to have much more complex business models so they’ll do more development, they will recycle their portfolio so assets will be sold once they’re 8 years old or once you’ve owned them for 8 years. That generates much more churn and turnover in their portfolios. There you use net asset value because it’s more of a value creation story I guess. But you also use free cash flow just as a sanity check.In other markets it’s really a function of what real estate provides. In Singapore and Australia it’s more of a cash flow story, in let’s say Hong Kong or China it’s more of a value creation story, so you’ll use NAV or free cash flow metrics depending on which geography.Q: Now say you’ve bought a company and you’ve done your due diligence, what are some of the red flags in the earnings or the operating results that would perhaps give you pause and make you re-evaluate your initial thesis.A: The first thing we do is evaluate every company on 4 criteria: management, assets, payout ratio and leverage. So companies that don’t score at least a three out of four we won’t invest in period. So that usually takes care of most of it. Now, for a company to drop from 3 out of 4 or 4 out of 4, something material has to happen. It’s generally not just in quarterly reporting that does that. If a company makes a conscious decision to lever up and they make a number of acquisitions at high leverage then you can notice that trend happening and then you might sit down with management and ask them what their game plan is there. If a company decides that they’re going to enter into a completely new geography or a completely new sector then again, that’s something that you want to re-evaluate. Generally you are keeping track of the trends in your key metrics like net operating income, same property NOI growth, AFFO per unit, occupancy – these are the things that drive value and so you’re staying on top of those and if they do deteriorate then it’s time for a discussion with management.Q: In an Investor’s Digest of Canada article, entitled ‘Investing in REITs – What you should look for‘ [PDF] that’s posted on the Sentry website, you articulated very clearly how you differentiate between risk and volatility. Do you want to maybe elaborate on that a little bit?A: Sure. To us stock price volatility is not real risk. If my neighbor’s selling a whole bunch of Allied Properties because he needs to pay for his kid’s education then that might drive the price of Allied down but it doesn’t change the business materially. Conversely if someone comes into millions of dollars of inheritance and decides they are going to put it all into REITs that again doesn’t change the value or quality of the businesses even though their unit prices might pick up. Risk to us is a function of free cash flow. If your free cash flow is shorter duration than another company’s then that adds more risk. If it’s poorer quality – getting 10 dollars a square foot from Walmart is generally better than getting 11 bucks a square foot from Joe’s Pizza. When you are talking about stability, occupancy has a lot to do with that and that is usually a function of location. An office tower in downtown Toronto generally is going to be more full than the same office tower in Halifax or the same office tower in Flin Flon. So we look at those things and that’s how we measure risk. Stock price volatility is just your opportunity to deploy capital, either into the market or out of the market.Q: You also mentioned in that article that the lack of volatility is also a great indication of mounting risk. Can you elaborate on that a little bit?A: Once you get into complacency, once the VIX settles down below 20, what you find when those things happen is that it’s usually an indication that everyone has come to a consensus about what’s going to happen. You’ve got to keep in mind that the VIX is a measure of anticipated volatility going forward but you can see it in the current market. So if everybody thinks that REIT unit prices are going up then the VIX actually declines despite the fact that unit prices are going up because there isn’t up and down volatility, it’s all smooth volatility in one direction. Now when people start to get concerned or people take differing opinions, then stocks can be up one day or down another day and that forward volatility starts to pick up and you see it in the direct market in the spot price as well. So when people get complacent and everybody comes to a consensus I get concerned because usually that means the market’s going straight up or at least smoothly up. And at that point, if you’re taking in lots of capital, it becomes more and more difficult to underwrite 12, 15 and 18% returns. So at that point I get concerned. Now those time periods can go on for much longer periods than you would normally anticipate. Like I mean REITs right now are trading at 15 times free cash flow and arguably they should trade at a premium to historical valuations simply because fundamentals are much better than they would normally be. You’ve got high occupancy, record low interest rates and generally a stable environment. Now if we start getting to 16 and 17 times free cash flow multiples, I start getting concerned because those are historically high valuations, especially if the VIX doesn’t pick up or volatility measures don’t pick up. Conversely on the downside, when the VIX is through the roof and unit prices have fallen off their table, as long as the fundamentals in the companies themselves are in good shape, it’s a great time and you feel very good about putting capital to work for the most part.Q: Dennis, is there anything in terms of topics that may not have been touched on but those that you find relevant to a discussion on REITs? You probably get a lot of questions asked of you in interviews but is there anything that you feel no one asks you or that you think should be put out there but isn’t?We’ve posted some videos on investing in REITs and the Sentry REIT fund. The ones that are most popular are the ones about rising interest rates which you’ve asked, valuations which you’ve asked, outlook and how we value REITs. Those are the most popular videos. So that gives us pretty good real time data as to what is top of mind for people. So I think you’ve covered the things that people are most interested in right now.Actually the only thing I would mention is multi-family. There seems to be a push on for multi-family right now and I’m not surprised. Five year mortgage money for CMHC insured properties right now is, I have one REIT telling me 2.75% and I have another company telling me yesterday 2.6%. So if you look at it and put it together, you’ve got apartments which are very stable, non-discretionary spending so the cash flow stream is pretty stable. You’ve got a bid for those assets and there’s very little supply. By bid for the assets I should say Transglobe Apartment REIT has come public, Boardwalk REIT, Northern Property REIT, Cap REIT, and Killam Properties all trade at pretty good premiums to historical valuations. You’ve had the purchase of TimberCreek’s REITs which is predominantly multi-family and you have a number of investors who are interested in the multi-family space. I should mention that ParkBridge Lifestyle Communities was also taken out by bcIMC, so that just adds to the list of people who are interested in multi-family. So that’s one trend that we’ve seen. We tend not to focus on sectors or geographies. Well run companies with good assets with low leverage and low payout ratios will trump any short-term sectoral or geographical advantage. The focus on the multi-family spaces is something current and topical that most people I guess wouldn’t have noticed or asked about.Q: Since you mentioned the multi-family space, is there a stock that you like particularly in that space that you own? If so, perhaps you can go into a bit of detail about why you like it, the valuation, some risks.A: I would say in terms of multi-family right now, Killam Properties (KMP:TSX) is probably the cheapest name available. Now the reason I say that is because we’ve recently reduced our CAP rate assumption there and increased our free cash flow multiple when we value Killam and part of that is fallout from the ParkBridge transaction. ParkBridge owns trailer parks, I guess the sector colloquialism for them is manufactured home communities.The purchase by bcIMC was at a pretty high multiple, a very low CAP rate and if you’ll extrapolate that onto Killam then Killam is probably worth 14 bucks. We don’t do that straight extrapolation but we did you know raise our multiple and lower our CAP-rate assumption such that we think Killam is worth closer to 12 bucks. So trading at 10, it offers 20% appreciation and even if you buy it today you’re still getting a 5.6 % cash yield.Q: Do you have one more pick?A: Sure. For a more larger cap commercial name we’d look at H&R REIT right now and the reason we would consider H&R is because cap rates for office buildings are declining and they do have significant option value in the BOW development. So if they were to sell half of that they would probably be selling it at a 5 and change cap rate, whereas it was developed at a 6 and change cap rate. They’ve got some upside optionality there – they will probably sell half of that asset and redeploy the proceeds. Otherwise I mean they’ve given you, I think at the start it was an 18 month schedule for increasing distributions every quarter. So you’ll get a rising cash stream from that name and they have a great portfolio of assets. That’s a name right there where we think it’s probably worth around 23 bucks and it’s still trading just below 21. So there’s some upside potential there in terms of capital appreciation plus you’re getting a rising 4.2% cash yield."

According to the stereotype, Mr. Momentum spots a blip racing upward across his screen – it could be migrating geese for all Mr. Mo cares – and buys some shares. He then hangs on until the shares start to fall, cashing out and having spent little or no time working to understand the underlying business. Adios, stranger! Ignorance is bliss.Value investors, on the other hand – delve deeply into a company’s financials, scouring the 10-K, worrying over Internet scuttlebutt, reading up on the competition, charting the fundamentals (not just the stock price). In the process, Ms. Value often has the shit scared out of her, so ugly are the doings at many publicly-traded companies. Think of cigarette makers, surely a value play. Their product literally kills people and the litigation disclosures alone are enough to make even the hardiest bottom feeder lose her lunch.But the crucial question when one tours the sausage factory of disclosure is this: does all this scary stuff make it a crummy company, or is the underlying business in fact a fabulous thing, since it continues to churn out earnings even as disturbing events occur? If it’s the latter, then strong stomachs can lead to profitable investments.All value stocks aren’t frightening, but being beaten up is often what makes for a bargain. Which brings us to H&R Block (NYSE:HRB), which is either a great momentum play — for short sellers – or a beaten-to-a-pulp mess deserving of a look by value buyers. YCharts Pro Ratings suggest it’s the latter. Let’s have a look at the stock chart.There was indeed a sickening slide over the past year, as the famous preparer of tax returns prepared fewer said returns, continued to take its lumps from a mortgage business it exited with tail between legs, and kept plenty of lawyers busy defending lawsuits over various business practices some have called unsavory. Oh, and a CEO brought in to turn the mess around in 2007 decided he’d had enough and split. Sausage, indeed.But you know what? Even with all those ills, H&R Block posted net income for the year ended April 30 of $479.2 million.That gives H&R Block a p/e ratio of about 9. And an earnings yield – a nice way of comparing a stock to a bond yield – of more than 10%.A nice bit of the earnings are paid out in dividends.So, H&R Block is cheap, if it can continue to churn out half a billion dollars a year in profit. Can it?Broadly, it would seem management has done its best over the years to break the business, and, thankfully, they failed. It ain’t growing. And it ain’t pretty. But it must be indestructible, the permanent payroll of 7,700 people reliably ballooning to 110,000 to staff more than 11,000 tax prep offices in the weeks leading up to April 15.There are risks. Of the nearly $3 billion in revenue derived from tax services in fiscal 2010, about $400 million came from the business of making loans to people in anticipation of their tax returns, or in fees for guaranteeing filers that, should the IRS ask for more in taxes, H&R Block will cover certain amounts. The loans are high-interest rate, one variety of them yielding an unseemly 35.21%. And the guarantees, marketed as “Peace of Mind,” are probably a lot better deal for H&R Block than for the filers. All told, the loan and guarantee operations have attracted a nasty bunch of lawsuits. The loan business suffers further because the IRS has become a more prompt payer; and some banks have decided they don’t like the loan business.Block also loses market share to Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) and its TurboTax software. And the Block tax client demographic isn’t so upscale: the company’s “key client segments” suffered unemployment rates during 2009’s fourth quarter of between 15% and 30%, “far in excess of national unemployment levels,” Block says.Debt is a bit high, and liquidity a tad low, as measured by a current ratio below 1.The company spends about $250 million a year on advertising, and one wonders whether it couldn’t: a.) generate more traffic from its ad budget and b.) spend more to regain lost market share. And costs seem an area to explore further. Closing 400 poorly-performing offices and axing 400 jobs, announced last May, was part of a plan to save $140 million or so by fiscal 2012. Is there more low-hanging fruit?Richard Breeden, the former Securities and Exchange Commission chairman-turned-activist investor, is Block’s chairman. He waged a proxy fight for board seats in 2007, ousted a CEO, and tried to hurry Block out of the looming disaster in mortgage lending, which it had wandered into. Breeden’s a smart guy, and his reputation is on the line at Block. The shares were at about $19 when he arrived. They’re around $13 now.So, there you have it. Durable franchise. Beaten-up stock. Scary business problems. That’s often value investing.Disclosure: none"
223872,20568,2010-09-05T05:53:41-04:00,,"H&R Block’s (NYSE:HRB) fiscal first-quarter loss from continuing operations came in at 36 cents per share, lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate for a loss of 41 cents a share as well as the year-ago loss of 39 cents per share. Net loss from continuing operations for the quarter was $114.8 million versus a loss of $130.6 million reported in first-quarter 2010.  Primarily, the realignment of field and support services announced in May along with share buyback helped the company to ameliorate loss during the quarter.  Including severance charges related to termination benefits in connection with the realignment of field and support services announced in May of $12.8 million, or 4 cents per share and loss from discontinued operations of $3.0 million or 1 cent per share, the company reported a loss of $130.7 million or 41 cents per share. The reported loss in the quarter was lower than the loss of $133.6 million or 40 cents per share a year ago.  Revenue for the reported quarter was $274.5 million, down 0.4% from $275.5 million recorded in the year-ago quarter. Lower revenues across all the segments resulted in the year-over-year decline. However, the result surpassed the Zacks Consensus estimate of $269 million.  Total operating cost declined 0.9% year over year to $485.0 million in the first quarter of 2011. Realignment of field and support services announced in May aided in the cost cut.  The company reported an operating loss of $210.6 million, down 0.5% from $214.2 million reported in the prior-year quarter.  Segment Performance  Tax Services revenue was $91.6 million in the first quarter of 2011 compared with $88 million in the year-ago period, up 4.2% year over year. Excluding $19.2 million, the charge related to severance costs and related payroll taxes associated with staff reductions, total expenses declined by $12.8 million, or 4.9% year over year, to $247.1 million in the quarter.  The segment reported a pretax loss of $174.6 million, a wider loss than $172.0 million incurred in the prior-year quarter. Business Service revenue totaled $174.7 million for the quarter, down 1.6% from $177.6 million in the year-ago quarter.  Total expenses declined $1.2 million, or 0.7%, from the prior year.  Pretax loss reported by the segment was $0.4 million compared with a pretax income of $1.3 million a year ago.  RSM McGladrey acquired the Boston-based accounting firm Caturano & Company in July. Though the acquisition is expected to add $30 million to the fiscal 2011 top line, it will have negligible impact on earnings for this fiscal year.  Corporate and Eliminations posted revenue of $8.1 million compared with $9.9 million in the prior-year quarter.  Segment pretax loss was $32.3 million, narrower than a loss of $40.2 million in the prior-year quarter. Decreased loss provisions on mortgage loans held for investment and gains on residual interest assets from the company's former mortgage business helped H&R Block to reduce the loss at the segment. Financial Position  H&R Block ended the year with cash and cash equivalents of $1.14 billion compared with $1.05 billion at the end of first-quarter 2010. Total outstanding long-term debt at first-quarter 2011 end was $1.46 billion, lower than $1.53 billion at the end of first-quarter 2010.  Net cash provided by operating activities in the quarter under review was $348.3 million versus $454.6 million in the first quarter of 2010.  Share Repurchase and Dividend  During the reported quarter, H&R Block repurchased and retired 15.5 million shares at a cost of $235.7 million.  H&R Block will also pay a quarterly cash dividend of 15 cents per share on Oct 1, 2010, to shareholders of record on Sep 10, 2010.  The company’s realignment initiatives remain on track. Also, the company remains focused on increasing its client retention rate. However, a lackadaisical top-line keeps us on the sidelines.  We maintain a Neutral recommendation on H&R Block. The quantitative Zacks #4 Rank (short-term Sell rating) for the company indicates downward pressure on the shares over the near term."

The long-term puts are sometimes used instead of shorting the stock, which exposes the trader to unlimited risk. Alternately, the put may be tied to long stock purchases, as we do see heavy volume in the stock today, especially around the same times as the options trades.(Chart courtesy of tradeMONSTER)"
192683,20568,2010-03-09T09:39:55-05:00,,"H&R Block Inc. (NYSE:HRB) reported fiscal third quarter 2010 (ended Jan 31, 2010) net income of $50.6 million or 15 cents, up from $47.4 million or 14 cents in the year-ago period. However, income from continuing operations was 16 cents, down 4 cents from the prior-year period. Results were slightly ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 14 cents, primarily driven by cost cuts. However, revenues were down 5.9% from the prior-year period to $934.9 million as the company prepared fewer tax returns. This was partially offset by a 5.9% decrease in operating expenses from the prior-year period to $840.4 million. The decrease reflects the benefits from the company’s cost cutting initiatives. Revenue from the Tax Service decreased 6.2% year-over-year to $747.7 million. The decrease stemmed from a 7.1% decrease in total retail tax returns prepared. Pre-tax income was $131.2 million compared with $133.5 million in the year-ago quarter. RSM McGladrey (RSM) reported a 3.6% year-over-year drop in revenues to $6.7 million. The decrease reflects the weak economic environment. However, the company posted a pre-tax loss of $11.2 million compared with a pre-tax income of $10.7 million a year ago, primarily due to a $15.0 million goodwill impairment related to RSM's capital markets business. RSM and McGladrey & Pullen LLP entered into new definitive agreements in February concerning their alternative practice structure. As a result, RSM incurred $3.3 million of legal and consulting expenses related to these negotiations in the reported quarter. Corporate operations reported a pre-tax loss of $22.5 million compared with a loss of $42.4 million in the prior-year quarter. The decrease in loss reflects a decrease in expenses. This stemmed from reductions in self-insured liabilities, lower interest expense on corporate borrowings and a decrease in loss provisions on mortgage loans held for investment.Interim Tax Results For the fiscal 2010 tax season through Feb 28, H&R Block’s same-office tax returns prepared in retail operations dropped 6.8% from the prior-year period while the total retail tax returns prepared decreased 9.4%. Digital returns prepared by the company were down 4.4%, though online returns grew 2.5%. Software-based returns were down 12.1% as the company decided to exit two unprofitable distribution channels. Total tax preparation revenues were down $124.1 million or 7.1% from the comparable period in 2009. While the company reported a 9.4% decrease in total retail returns prepared, it was partially offset by a 2.4% increase in net average fees per retail return. The company expects Internal Revenue Service tax return to be down 2.5% to 3.5% year-over-year by the end of the tax season. This is nearly double the company had previously projected for lower returns. The company also said that though the company had funding for refund anticipation loans (RALs), it did not experience any meaningful client growth driven by RAL availability.No Specific Earnings Guidance No specific earnings guidance was provided for the fiscal fourth quarter or the fiscal year. In fact, the company has recently announced that it would not be able to meet its previously announced fiscal 2010 guidance as it is preparing fewer tax returns than it had earlier expected. The tax filing market is experiencing a shrinkage due to the rise in unemployment. Also, there is a continued shift from assisted tax preparation to the digital space, where the company’s growth is not yet satisfactory. The increased price sensitivity of consumers and the loss of market share remain other headwinds.

190409,21435,2010-02-24T11:19:31-05:00,,"H&R Block (NYSE:HRB) announced today that its tax preparation business is hemorrhaging clients as do-it-yourself products grab an ever larger slice of the market. Last week, we wrote a blog about the recent success of Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) after it reported a better than expected start to the tax filing season (Tax Time is Intuit’s Favorite Time). Its do-it-yourself franchise of TurboTax experienced 11% growth from a year ago, and the web version of the program grew impressively by 23%. Following the strong performance of TurboTax, an analyst at Oppenheimer downgraded HRB because of concerns for the current tax season. At this point, his concerns are justified as H&R Block is enduring some attrition as filing revenues are down 6.3% from a year ago through February 15th. Total tax returns filed year to date have fallen 8.2% although fees paid per filing rose 1.9%.The early season weakness has caused management at HRB to believe their original guidance of $1.60 to $1.80 will turn out to be too aggressive. Analysts were expecting full year earnings (ending in April) to be about $1.61 per share, but those estimates will soon fall in order to more closely match the slipping guidance. Of course, this quarter is far and away the most important in H&R Block’s fiscal calendar as it accounts for the overwhelming majority of profits. For example, the latest estimates called for EPS of $2.24 in this quarter, so the slow start has investors very nervous. The stock is trading down more than 16% in Wednesday morning trading.At Ockham, we have a current rating of Fairly Valued on the stock because it is clearly not expensive, but the business seems to be in decline. Consumers are searching for ways to save and having a professional do your taxes is not a necessity as good alternatives do exist. The weak economy in addition to the rise of do-it-yourself alternatives has left H&R Block with declining sales, and they are aggressively marketing to help boost the balance of the tax season. HRB does have their own version of do-it-yourself products but it is still lagging behind the industry leader from Intuit. We are unlikely to upgrade H&R Block even with the stock selling at a more attractive nominal price because the threats to their market share are very concerning for future profitability. Once someone has done their taxes on their own, it will take a greater amount of effort for them to go back to having someone else do it for more money.Original post"

The company had reported a loss of 40 cents in the year-ago quarter. Improved results in Tax Services and lower mortgage loan loss provisions were partially offset by reduced profits from Business Services. The company has also benefited from its cost containment initiatives. As a result of the seasonality in the business, the company usually reports a loss in the second quarter. Consolidated net loss for the quarter, which includes results from discontinued operations, improved to $128.6 million or 38 cents per share compared to a loss of $135.9 million or 41 cents a share a year ago. However, revenues were down 7.2% year-over-year to $326.1 million due to a decline in revenues from Business Services. Tax Services revenues increased 4.4% year-over-year to $109.3 million, primarily driven by an increase in tax preparation revenues and increased revenues from Prepaid Emerald Mastercard products provided to tax clients by H&R Block Bank.   Increases in return volume, coupled with the company’s Southwest franchise acquisition, have aided in a $2.4 million increase in tax preparation revenues. Pretax loss was $172.2 million compared to $188.1 million a year ago. The improvement was driven by an increase in revenue and a decrease in overall expenses. The Business Services segment revenues decreased 11.3% to $206.6 million, primarily reflecting the weak economic environment. Pretax income was $0.2 million compared to $13.1 million a year ago, driven by losses in its capital markets business and increased costs associated with litigation.  The Corporate segment reported a pretax loss of $40.8 million compared to a loss of $52.4 million in the prior year, driven by a $9.7 million decrease in mortgage loan loss provisions at H&R Block Bank. The company has lowered its long-term debt to $1.0 billion from $1.7 billion reported at the prior-year quarter's end. H&R Block has reiterated its earnings guidance for the full fiscal year 2010. The company expects to report earnings of $1.60–$1.80 a share.  As a result of unemployment and other factors associated with the stressed economy, the balance sheet of tax preparers such as H&R Block and its competitor Jackson Hewitt Tax Service Inc (JTX) has been severely impacted.

Prior to cutting the dividend by 31% from 1995 to 1997, HRB had increased the dividend payment 13 years in a row.According to Value Line Investment Survey (dated 5/22/2009), HRB is selling under the average price-to-cash flow of 12 times. Using the full year cash flow of $1.84 for 2007, HRB has a mean price of $22.08. At the current price, HRB is expected to increase by 35% if it were to revert to the mean.Unless were going the way of an even ""Greater"" Depression, this stock has an exceptional amount of potential. HRB has rid itself of the toxic waste of subprime mortgages that it once owned. Unlike the major banks, which recently had to water down their stock, HRB has maintained the same number of share outstanding. This means that any earnings in the future will be dramatic compared to the last two years.According to Morningstar (dated 4/24/2009), HRB faces lawsuits related to the former mortgage unit that was involved in subprime lending. Additionally, HRB has accumulated massive amounts of long-term debt as well as sub par return-on-equity and return-on-assets in 2007 and 2008.Applying Dow Theory to HRB gives us the following upside and downside targets:By falling to $13.73 intra-day, HRB pierced a prior technical support level ($13.90). If HRB can hold at the current levels then a 24% gain to the $19 level would be easy to accomplish. HRB seems like a great company to investigate for your next investment purchase.

Some of the points made by the critics seemed pretty convincing. However, my main concern was the viability of the company and the ability of other investors to recognize the upside potential.Since the stock was recommended on my blog on May 19, 2009, we have seen the price increase by 19%. Again, my ideal is to acquire the stock as close to the low as possible and then sell the stock as investors start to realize the qualitative elements.Initially, the qualitative elements of every stock seems like a subjective matter. However, according to Geraldine Weiss, author of Dividends Don't Lie, the dividend is the one thing that cannot be manipulated.  Using the extended dividend payment history (Dividend Achievers only) results in a fair assessment of the overall quality of the stock and in turn the company as well.While I could provide a data dump showing all the ratios and regression analysis I can do on a stock, the reality is that we as investors need something that is reliable, proven and simple. Demonstrating that I'm a smarty-pants with corporate financial numbers will only serve to further confuse the uninitiated. For those that have an interest, they can run the numbers on their own.After I recommended selling HRB on Friday June 5th, the stock has gone up by 7%. This is great as far as I'm concerned. I have accomplish my goal of ""seeking fair profits.""Besides, I don't wish to hold a stock when others are willing buy at a higher price.

From a macro standpoint, Mehta states, H&R Block, whose tax services business contributed about 70% of FY08 revenue, has a built-in demand that is not going away in 2009. Additionally, UBS analyst Andrew Fones believes the tax market could get a boost from an additional economic stimulus package in the next few months; changes to the tax could could also drive additional taxpayers to seek professional help with their tax returns.

Revenues were up 1.3% year-over-year to $275.5 million. Tax Services revenues increased 7.7% year-over-year to $88.0 million. Favorable results from the company’s Australian tax operations resulted in a 14.2% increase in tax preparation fees. However, expenses were high due to the Southwest franchise acquisition, severance costs and increased expenses for information technology projects to prepare for the forthcoming tax season. As a result, the Tax Services segment reported a pretax loss of $172.0 million compared to $163.7 million a year ago. The Business Services segment revenues increased 1.7% to $177.6 million. Pretax income was $1.3 million compared to a pretax-loss of $0.3 million a year ago, driven by revenue growth and cost reduction efforts. The Corporate segment reported a pretax loss of $40.2 million compared to a loss of $49.0 million in the prior year, driven by improved performance of its mortgage loan securitization portfolio. Nevertheless, H&R Block has increased its reserves for potential loan losses to $91.7 million at July 31, 2009, compared to $84.1 million at year-end fiscal 2009. H&R Block has reiterated its earnings guidance for the full fiscal year 2010. The company expects to report EPS of $1.60–$1.80. As a result of unemployment and other factors associated with the stressed economy, the balance sheet of tax preparers such as H&R Block and its competitor Jackson Hewitt Tax Service Inc (JTX) has been severely impacted. We believe that the earnings of these companies will remain restricted in the short term as the economy will require more time to revive. We have a Neutral recommendation on the shares of H&R Block."

Analysts expected a loss of $0.35 per share on $378.3 - $381.2 million in revenue, missing both earnings estimates and revenue targets. Tax Services increased 7.7% to $75.3 million vs. $69.9 million a year ago. Shares were down about 3.5% after-hours and the previous session’s close marked the highest that HRB’s stock traded at since November 23, 2005 when it hit $26.66. Shares should see some weakness in today’s morning trading. Revenue dropped 11% mostly due to the off tax season. Loss from continuing operations was $0.40 per share or $129.4 million vs. a loss of $0.34 per share a year ago, up 15%. Loss from discontinued operations was $3.4 million vs. a loss of $192.8 million a year ago due to ending operations in the subprime market. Income was offset by $20.4 million in loss reserves and write-downs at H&R Bank. The effects of the subprime crisis can still be seen as H&R Bank reported a loss of $14.1 million vs. earnings of $4.8 million a year ago.  HRB’s improvement in the area of subprime exposure: In January 2008, H&R Bank held about $1.4 billion in loans, bought from Option One Mortgage (remember this one?). As a result, $28 million had to be set aside, leading to a Q2 2008 loss of $12 million. By the end of Q4 (the previous quarter), HRB’s mortgage balance was $966.3 million. By Q1 ’09, the balance was at $869 million and dropping. HRB expects to eliminate $200-400 million more within two years.  HRB reiterated their fiscal 2009 guidance of $1.60 - $1.70 per share. Analysts are expecting $1.66 per share for the full year. HRB should do extremely well given that the reported Q1 loss was 56% less than the previous year, operations improved, and losses from discontinued operations related to subprime decreased significantly.  HRB also announced their plan to purchase ‘Block Texas’, a group of companies operating HRB’s franchise units. The units are located in Texas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas. The acquisition, valued at $278 million cash, should add 760,000 additional clients as well as a nice revenue and earnings boost. The operators generated more than $140 million in revenue for fiscal 2008 and the deal itself will add $0.05 per share in fiscal 2009. The deal is scheduled to close by October 31.   HRB made a number of improvements and changes over the past year. Obviously the subprime business was shut down and the mortgage servicing unit was sold in May 2008 to WL Ross & Co for $1.1 billion. In August 2008, the unprofitable securities business was sold to Ameriprise Financial for $315 million. HRB has positioned itself to weather this storm by shedding unprofitable businesses that are hurting HRB’s core business as the #1 U.S. tax preparer. The new CEO is taking action, and I like it. The industry outlook is neutral, but the company’s outlook is positive. Currently, 7 analyst publish recommendations for HRB with 3 “Buy” ratings, 3 Hold” ratings, and 1 “Sell” rating. Expect new and reiterated ratings to come out in the next few days. In the past six months, insiders purchased 4.43 million shares vs. sales of 134,422. I like the sponsorship.  Technically, HRB broke out and has drifted up ever since. I expect some consolidation in this area. Support is at $24.10.  Jackson Hewitt (JTX) is reporting pre-market this morning (9/4), so watch their earnings.Disclosure: none"

This entire year HRB investors have been looking at an deal with Cerberus as a way out of the subprime mess. Yet now that this deal has collapsed, the news was almost portrayed as a mutual positive for both companies?Imagine what would have happened if the deal actually happened!The truth of the matter is that H&R Block is in trouble. And the only way out is to come clean on their full exposure to subprime and write down as much as possible right now, before they move forward and focus on their core tax services business.With the pending CEO search I expect the company to write down billions prior to a new CEO assignment. It's only common sense. If you were approached to take the top job and knew the company originated 40B in subprime loans in 2006 and 20B in 2007 and has yet to write down any of it, would you take the job and add those write downs to your executive resume?1+1 doesn't = 2 at HRB.   A) Board Member Choate resigns from HRB citing health problems, yet still services on AMGN and Valero? Hm?   B) HRB announces 181st consecutive quarterly dividend Nov 28, 2007, but then taps its credit line for 6th time for a total of $1.8B in liabilities. Borrow to insure solvency, buy time and not cut the dividend? Hm?   C) HRB CFO, Trubeck resigns Nov 5th, 2007.D) Moody's places review of HRB for downgrade Nov 13, 2007 , specifically the senior debt and short-term ratings of Block Financial Corp.E) H&R Block announced Nov 21, 2007 that Chief Executive Mark A. Ernst resigned amid bleak prospects to offload the company's money-losing subprime-mortgage unit.F) Fitch lowered Block's issuer default rating one notch to ""BBB,"" the second lowest investment grade, from ""BBB-plus."" G) Option One remains in trouble. Just because HRB declares they are closing Option One and its originating activities, doesn't mean the 40B+ in orginations in subprime vanish into thin air. At some point they will have to mark down tremendously and sell or write down tremendous amounts! Without a doubt, Option One and HRB have been a major player in the subprime origination business the past few years. They were ranked #3 in Q3 2007, #4 in Q2 2007. And if you look at their company on this list they include Countrywide, Delta Funding, Citi, EMC Mortgage, HSBC, Wells Fargo, and Wamu.H) You would think that a company who is trying to keep delinquencies to a minimum would help mortgage borrowers pay on time and offer great customer service right? Wrong! Check out some of these compaints to Consumer Affairs. Ask any mortgage office you know or sold you your mortgage about Option One. They were always the last resort, when their clients couldn't get approved by other prime lenders and even Country Wide!I) According to this author on Seeking Alpha, On Nov 12th, someone bought a a 28,000-lot transaction in the January 20 puts for HRB, which is 74% of open interest in one trade! That buyer suspects or knows something! J) Finally the downtrend of HRB is proven in this chart and the P&F target is $12. Yet the stock is up since the news of Cerberus walking away from the Option One deal. HM? Also note that Institutions own and control 95% of HRB's float with only 2% insider ownership. In summary HRB will have to really pull out 12 rabbits out of their hat on their next 10Q Monday Dec 10th. I only see limited upside and a high potential for severe selling pressure with heavy institutional ownership. Once Moody's comes around with a potential downgrade and more writedowns likely, the large funds and institutions holding HRB will surely sell. And mom and pop will not have enough capital to slow down the precipitous drop in share price I expect in a short time.HRB reports earnings after the close Monday Dec 10 and will host their conference call Tuesday 8am.

If you have been following the tone and nuance of their recent press releases, you would become suspicious. First, they announce that they will amputate their problem and sell the offending mortgage unit with the sub-prime blemish to Cerberus. The deal is to close later this year and is subject to certain closing conditions.
They later announce a dividend (see my post June 7, 2007) designed to bribe dividend-seeking investors to stay with the stock. The timing of the dividend in my mind was suspect, as it was to be off record and paid roughly during the closing time frames. They then announce poor operating results several weeks after announcing the dividend. Always a cart-in-front-of-the-horse scenario.
Now a week before the annual general meeting, where we will have credible shareholder activists attempting to secure board seats, they announce poor results yet again. This time, they let it be known that they are attempting to renegotiate the sale terms with Cerberus.
In what case would Cerberus change the deal? Only if they receive an advantage. One of the conditions H&R wants waived is the condition to have any mortgage commitments for sixty days forward to be fully funded. This signals H&R is struggling very hard. All that Cerberus needs do is wait for the deal to fall apart and then laugh.
If Home Depot had to cut the price and guarantee debt on the sale of their problem wholesale division, H&R can easily be looking at different terms. The gun pointed at H&R's head is larger caliber. Unfortunately, H&R chambered the bullets in many cases.
H&R probably saw this one coming and was starting to twist in the wind. We need new management."

39074,20099,2007-06-21T11:03:50-04:00,,"H&R Block (NYSE:HRB) lost a lot of shareholder money. Losses of approximately $85.5 million have been reported as a result of losses in the sub-prime mortgage market. The company is attempting to spin the results focusing only on continuing operations. They need you to forget about mortgage problems. A large sale of Option One is pending to Cerberus Capital Management. So the problem will be amputated away. The cost will be determined at the last moment. Therefore, we may expect more bad news when the deal is to close. Cerberus does not have a mandate to overpay, and by now everyone knows the sub-prime market is damaged goods. H&R is having reasonably good news in its areas of core expertise: preparing taxes. The problem with sub-prime is that as the market continues to fall apart, the purchase price will worsen. There will probably be post closing conditions. Remember what happened to General Motors (NYSE:GM) when it was stung with approximately one billion dollars of post closing charges because of its involvement in sub-prime. Hey, was Cerberus the purchaser of GM's finance unit? As I mentioned in my post of June 7, 2007, management knows that bad news is coming and they have set up the dividend to pay Oct 1 to record holders of Sep 10. This is approximately the same time frame as the anticipated Cerberus closing. HRB 1-yr chart:"

37683,20099,2007-06-07T10:59:31-04:00,,"H&R Block (NYSE:HRB) announced a dividend increase of 6%. Sounds good? The company wants you to know that this is the tenth consecutive year that the dividend has increased. In the same press release, they also mention that this will be the 180th consecutive quarter where a dividend was paid. Given four quarters per year, that's about 45 years. Long term approach is nice, but in this case no longer appropriate. Earnings will be released on the morning of June 21. But the board feels confident enough on what I could only believe is the advice of management to increase the dividend a full two weeks before they can actually inform the market of what the real results are. Hmmm . . . cart before the horse? Here is the real kicker. The dividend increase is payable to shareholders of record Sept. 10, 2007 and will be paid on Oct 1. The record date is 90 days following the announcement of its payment. Sounds like they want the dividend valuation to be deeply embedded in the stock price before they come out with full disclosure. So far H&R has been losing cash and has been relying on borrowings. Last quarter its current ratio was negative. Hey, isn't this the stock that Buffet kicked out presumably for being unworthy?

28138,20568,2007-02-27T14:00:08-05:00,,"H&R Block (NYSE:HRB) is a leading provider of tax preparation, financial advice, investment, mortgage, and business services. The company is the largest provider of tax preparation services in the world, serving taxpayers primarily in the U.S., Canada, and Australia through approximately 12,200 retail outlets and via its digital tax solutions. In fiscal year 2006, the company's mortgage services business also originated over $40 billion in mortgage loans. H&R Block is also leveraging its strong position and customer relationships in tax preparation to build out its investment and financial services businesses. In addition, the company provides accounting, tax, and consulting services to mid-sized businesses through RSM McGladrey Business Services and small business services through H&R Block Small Business Resources. Despite the company's best efforts to prepare for the 2006 tax season, we were disappointed by the results announced for the company's tax services segment. In addition to a slower than expected start for the industry in last year's tax filing season, H&R Block was negatively impacted by a number of technical problems early in the season. These technical problems negatively impacted the company's ability to serve clients in the early weeks of the season, when clients' primary motivation is to find a provider who can help them access their tax refund as quickly as possible. Last year, the company moved to a new software distribution strategy that, coupled with office set-up issues, left the company unprepared for the early weeks of the season. As such, the company missed out on an estimated 250,000 clients. These early season issues curtailed full-year client growth by as much as two percentage points. We remain concerned about intense competition, which will continue to negatively impact the company's tax services business. We note that the company opened over 1,000 new U.S. retail locations in fiscal 2006, consisting of approximately 550 company-owned locations and 190 franchise locations. H&R Block also launched approximately 250 new kiosks within Wal-Mart and other shared locations and the company had a presence in nearly 2,100 total alternative locations in 2006. While the increased network expanded the company s reach to new clients, Jackson-Hewitt and Liberty Tax Services also expanded aggressively over the past year. As a result, we believe the company's peers likely captured market share at the expense of H&R Block, given the technical issues faced by the company in the early part of the tax season. We note that competitors started marketing much earlier last tax season, and benefited from more aggressive refund lending products than H&R Block. As a result, we believe H&R Block was once again unable to fully leverage its retail outlets. Following a 100 basis point decline in operating margin for the tax services business in fiscal year 2005, the operating margin for the tax services business declined by an additional 400 basis points in fiscal year 2006. As such, it remains to be seen whether or not the company's infrastructure investments can ultimately improve bottom line results. The company is on track to add an additional 300 to 400 new locations for the coming tax season. In the mortgage business, we also expect intense competition and a rising rate environment to continue to pressure top-and bottom-line growth. Loan origination volume, which peaked in the first half of fiscal year 2006, declined 25% from the prior year in the first quarter of fiscal year 2007, and declined 50% year-over-year in the second quarter. Further, we expect loan origination volume to settle in at lower, more sustainable levels in fiscal year 2007. We are also concerned about the pricing environment, which remains challenging and a slow down in the U.S. housing market. Although the company will implement a further reduction in headcount, it remains to be seen whether or not the company can reduce costs in line with the lower level of sustainable volume. In addition, we think the company will continue to struggle to differentiate its product and create value for its customers in a difficult operating environment. We maintain our sell rating for H&R Block.    We note that management has continued its trend of revising its fiscal year guidance downward. We note that in the second quarter of 2006, management expected fiscal year 2006 earnings in the range of $1.90 to $2.15 per share, down from the previous guidance range of $2.12 to $2.32 per share. In the third quarter, management again revised downwards its fiscal year 2006 earnings guidance to the range of $1.65 to $1.85 per share. Actual reported earnings for 2006 were $1.67 per share. As such, we believe management's credibility with investors has been damaged. Our $20.00 price target is based on a price to earnings multiple of 13.5x our fiscal year 2008 earnings estimate. INDUSTRY OUTLOOK   Our outlook for the business services industry is neutral. Companies in this broadly characterized industry provide consulting, information and data, information technology [IT], marketing, payment processing, staffing, and other outsourcing services to businesses. The industry is generally tied to the economy, and is related to growth in business spending. We expect spending on equipment, consulting, staffing, and outsourcing services to continue to increase, as corporations look to deploy record cash balances to support top and bottom line growth. We expect strong growth in the outsourcing industry over the next three-to-five years, as it allows corporations to focus more on their core businesses. This also reduces the growing costs associated with in-house systems. Outsourcing has advanced from running software and data centers to a growing trend toward business-process outsourcing [BPO], where a company takes over the back-office functions for clients, such as human resources, payroll, travel services, and accounting. Additionally, customer contact outsourcing is also expected to support strong growth opportunities over the next few years. We believe that there are significant growth opportunities in the various outsourcing markets, yet competition is fierce and pricing remains very competitive. INDUSTRY POSITION   H&R Block is the largest provider of tax preparation services in the world, serving taxpayers primarily in the U.S., Canada, and Australia through roughly 12,200 retail outlets and via its digital tax solutions. We note that the retail tax services business is highly competitive, and the company competes against a substantial number of tax return preparation firms and accounting firms on the basis of price, service and reputation for quality. H&R Block is also leveraging its strong position and customer relationships in tax preparation to build out its investment and financial services businesses. We note that the company filed an application for a federal bank charter with the Office of Thrift Supervision in May 2005 and began operating H&R Block Bank on May 1, 2006. Management believes the bank will enable the company to extend its financial services capabilities and will be a further differentiator of the company s tax services business. The company is also a leading provider of mortgages, as the company s mortgage services business originated over $40 billion in mortgage loans in fiscal year 2006. The mortgage business is cyclical, and directly affected by national economic conditions, trends in business and finance, and by changes in interest rates. In addition, the company provides accounting, tax, and consulting services to mid-sized businesses through RSM McGladrey Business Services and small business services through H&R Block Small Business Resources. The accounting, tax, and consulting business is also highly competitive, where the principal areas of differentiation are also price, service, and reputation for quality. As the company s focus is on middle-market businesses, its principal competition is with national and regional accounting firms. RECENT NEWS  On February 22, H&R Block reported financial results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2007. Revenue from continuing operations increased 11% from the prior year to $955 million. Tax services revenue increased 15% from the prior year to $628 million. Pre-tax earnings for tax services were $59.3 million, compared to a loss of $6.3 million in the year-ago period. However, the loss in the year-ago period included a pre-tax charge of $71.7 million for litigation settlement and related legal costs. Business services revenue decreased 8% from the prior year to $216 million. Business services reported operating loss of $1.4 million, compared to a loss of $1.0 million in the prior year. Consumer financial services reported pre-tax income of $11 million, versus a pre-tax loss of $8 million in the prior-year period. As a result, the company reported net income from continuing operations of $0.08 per share, versus a loss of $0.09 per share in the year-ago period. The Option One Mortgage business is now listed as discontinued operations. For the third quarter, the company recorded a loss from discontinued operations of $0.22 per share, compared to net income of $0.13 per share in the year-ago period. The loss in Q3 includes an increase in loan loss reserves of approximately $111 million. The company expects to announce the results of its plan to divest the Option One Business in March. On November 6, H&R Block announced that the company is exploring strategic alternatives for its Option One Mortgage business. The company has retained Goldman Sachs to review potential alternatives for the unit, including a possible sale. In a presentation, the company indicated that it believes it will be in position to make a decision on the proper course of action by the end of the first calendar quarter of 2007. The mortgage business has been a drag on H&R Block's financial results of late, given the slowdown in the mortgage market. While strategic alternatives are being reviewed, Option One will close 12 of its branch office's over the next four months, consolidating by one-third, and business from the closed offices will be transferred to the remaining locations. First quarter 2007 results were significantly impacted by the recording of a provision for losses of $102.1 million reflecting an increase in the estimated recourse liability recorded by Option One Mortgage for loan repurchases and premium recapture reserves. The provision for losses equated to $61.3 million on an after-tax basis, or $0.19 per share. Essentially, when HRB's Option One division sells mortgages to institutional buyers, the buyers have the right to send loans back to HRB for repurchase in the case of early payment defaults (homeowners not making payments in the first few months of the mortgage). In July, the company witnessed increases in the early payment defaults, and as a result, management has updated their estimate of the recourse liability for all loans subject to possible repurchase. The company has implemented tighter underwriting and pricing guidelines, and is focusing on more thorough appraisals and other procedural enhancements. VALUATION  Although the company has made the decision to potentially sell its Option One Mortgage business, the segment continues to deteriorate at a substantial pace. The fact that the company may divest itself of the unit and focus its efforts on its core businesses is likely a long-term positive, but we do not believe that it resolves all of the issues currently facing the company. We have updated our estimates to reflect the third-quarter results, and will monitor the status of the unit going forward. Given near term issues, we do not expect significant near-term stock price appreciation. Over the last five years, the shares of H&R Block have traded within a range of 10x and 20x forward twelve-month earnings. While we view the pending sale of the Option One business as a long-term positive, we expect that the stock to continue to trade near the lower half of this historical multiple range. As such, our six month target price of $20.00 is based on approximately 13.5x our 2008 earnings estimate.    RISKS   INSIDER TRADING AND OWNERSHIP   Insiders own 1% of the company s common stock. Institutional investors own 87% of common shares outstanding. Institutional owners with over 5% beneficial ownership of common shares outstanding include Davis Selected Advisors (12% of common shares outstanding), Franklin Resources (9%), T.

7241,20132,2006-02-06T10:08:07-05:00,,"This is one in a series of articles examining Joel Greenblatt's Magic Formula for picking value stocks. Today's stock: H&R Block (NYSE:HRB).
H&R Block is a very familiar consumer name associated with tax preparation.  However, there is more to the company than just tax preparation.
H&R Block is a diversified company with subsidiaries delivering tax, investment, mortgage and business services and products.  The company’s key products include:
H&R Block is basically the McDonald’s of financial services. Just taking a quick glance at their offerings and associated branding, it appears that H&R Block has a moat.  Warren Buffett has even owned this stock.
Let’s take a quick look at the 5 primary factors that I use to help indicate whether a company has a wide moat.  These factors include ROIC, book value growth, earnings per share growth, sales growth, and free cash flow growth over the past five years.
According to ADVFN, H&R Block currently has a ROIC of 21.9 and a five year average of 21.7.  Looks good to me.
Book value per share has gone from from $3.20 in 2001 to $5.97 in 2005 according to the numbers on ADVFN.  That’s an average growth rate of 16.9 percent over the past five years.
Over the same time period, EPS has gone from $0.76 to $1.92.  That is about a 26 percent average annual growth rate over the past 5 years.  EPS was down slightly over this past year however.
Revenues have grown at 10.5 percent over the past five years.  For the current trailing twelve months versus the previous 12 month period, revenues have grown by 26 percent.
Free cash flow has bounced around quite a bit over the past five years.  Overall, it was about a 13 percent growth rate per year in free cash flow.  However, give how free cash flow has bounced around dramatically, I wouldn’t put too much faith in this number.
There is substantial competition in each of H&R Block’s businesses.  However, H&R Block has a significant brand name and it’s massive seasonal retail network dramatically widens its moat. 
This moat has been under siege by tax preparation software products and online tax filing.  H&R Block has addressed these issues by creating their own software product and online tax services.  The main weakness that H&R Block has is that it has become reliant on taking advantage of unsavvy financial service consumers with their high cost tax refund advances and other financial products.  Their mortgage business also exposes them to the potential risk of a housing crash. 
Even given a few of these weaknesses, I believe that H&R Block still has a sustainable competitive advantage.  This stock looks like it might be the real deal, with a wide moat. Worth further investigation."

Option One lost $69.7 million in the quarter versus a gain of $42.4 million a year ago as delinquencies surged. H&R Block is setting aside $111 million for anticipated loan losses. The company reported a loss of $44.7 million (-$0.14/share) in the three months ended Jan. 31 versus a profit of $12.1 million ($0.04/share) a year ago. Excluding Option One, income from continuing operations was $25 million ($0.08/share). Q3 revenue was up 11% from $860.3 million to $955.1 million. Analysts were expecting EPS of $0.13 on sales of $1.13 billion. In November, the company announced it was exploring ""strategic alternatives"" for Option One, but analysts are skeptical that the company will be able to sell the unit. Tax service revenues were up 14.5% in Q3 to $628 million, thanks to new loan products linked to tax refunds and the opening of 330 new outlets. Shares were up $0.12 to $22.42 in AH trading.

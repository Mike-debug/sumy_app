Also, news of increasing cases in Texas and Florida hasn't put a dent on the stock price either, currently trading near their pre-COVID-19 levels with strong momentum. At this point, we believe such a move might be an indication that the market might be expecting increasing cases of infections to be short-lived.We believe until there is a cure to the virus, it could be Deja-vu all over again, with states and global economies at the mercy of increasing or decreasing COVID-19 infections guiding their decisions. That makes any future predictions about Henry Schein's business performance incredibly hard to model.From a valuation point of view, on a forward EV/sales basis, the stock is trading at 1.35x sales, above its 10-year average of 1.06x. The company is also trading above the average consensus price target of $60.27 based on 15 analysts.The relative overvaluation of the stock plus high uncertainties puts Henry Schein in the ""too hard"" basket. We would wait for a big margin of safety before considering an investment in the stock given the current circumstances.Source: company filingsHenry Schein is a major distributor of healthcare products and services to office-based dental and medical practitioners. The company has been distributing healthcare products for more than 87 years, building a strong brand name recognition among the industry.The company reports results under two segments: (i) Healthcare Distribution and (ii) Technology and value-added services. Management divides the Healthcare Distribution segment even further, reporting two sub-segments: Dental Products and Medical Products. Dental products contribute 64% of total sales, while Medical products account for 30%. The rest (5%) of total sales comes from their software and other value-added products.As expected from distributors, Henry Schein's operating results have been consistent throughout the years. Top-line growth has been healthy, fueled by organic growth as well as through acquisitions and equity investments. The big drop in revenues comes from the adjustment following the spin-off of their Animal Health Business. The spin-off was completed at the beginning of 2019 and consisted of the separation on Henry Schein's animal health business, and subsequent merger with Direct Vet Marketing, Inc. forming a new public company called Covetrus (CVET) which trades on the NASDAQ. Their animal health business was making approximately $3B in sales at the time of the spin-off.The spin-off of their animal health business has changed the gross margin profile for Henry Schein. Before the spin-off, gross margins ranged between 27.8% to 28.8%. Following the separation of their animal health business, gross margins increased to an average of 30.9%, as COGS as a percent of sales dropped to 69.1% from an average of 72%.Below the gross profit line, we find the same trend in SG&A costs before and after the spin-off. Following the spin-off, SG&A expenses increased as a percent of sales to 23.6% from an average of 21.1%. However, since gross margins increased, it has offset the higher SG&A costs, resulting in a neutral effect on operating income margins.First-quarter results came in stronger than expected, growing 3% year-over-year, helped by strong demand for their medical products segment. That segment grew 17% to $800M compared to the prior-year period, as increasing demand for PPE fueled growth.That said, with 64% of total sales coming from the distribution of dental products, we can only imagine what a prolonged state-mandated closure of dental practices can have on the business. Revenues for the segment were in line with management expectations in January and February, however with COVID-19 impacting businesses by mid-March, North American dental sales declined by 3.9% while their International dental sales declined by 3.4% on a QoQ basis. As a result, management recorded an incremental bad debt reserve of $10M pre-tax in their global dental business. However, this $10M reserve is based on expectations about dental office re-openings and patient attendance.At their Q1 call, management acknowledged the tough road ahead, mainly from rules limiting dental practices:The company was estimating the run-rate for global dental sales to be down 70% to 80% year-over-year. Management was also estimating run-rate sales for their Medical business to be down somewhere between 20% to 30% on a year-to-year basis.While COVID-19 cases have been declining in regions like Europe and Asia, the same cannot be said about the U.S. Increasing counts of infections has made California step back in gradually opening the state to business, mandating once again to shut down non-essential businesses. Other states can follow suit if cases start to increase again. With the U.S accounting for 69% of total sales, Henry Schein is still in limbo.Source: tikr.comHenry Schein ended their first quarter with a relatively healthy balance sheet. At a debt-to-EBITDA of 1.2 times, we don't see high financial risk. The company also has $1.7B in liquidity, boosting its chances to weather the storm.Analysts are expecting revenues for 2020 to drop by 16.4% to 8.3B followed by a quick rebound of 18.1% to $9.8B. The consensus price targets are as follows:Source: tikr.comWith the stock trading at a forward sales multiple of 1.3x, above its 10-year average of 1.06x, and above the price median target of $60, we believe Henry Schein is trading at its fair value estimate or slightly above. That means there currently is no margin of safety to even consider the stock as an investment candidate. The risk/reward scenario at this point is heavily weighted towards the risk side of the equation. The unpredictability of the pandemic makes Henry Schein a stock too hard to analyze."
4337650,104812,2020-04-15T06:11:43-04:00,Leading distributor of dental and medical practice supplies and equipment is being impacted by the ongoing pandemic given the disruption to non-emergency treatments.Henry Schein has announced it is set to distribute hundreds of thousands of antibody rapid COVID-19 blood tests which may mitigate some of the challenges in other product segments.We think shares are attractive at current levels as the company is well-positioned to recover its growth trajectory as the economy restarts.,"Henry Schein, Inc. (NYSE: HSIC) is the largest global distributor of dental practice products and number two in the U.S. for office-based medical supplies. The company has consolidated its market share in recent years through a series of acquisitions supporting steady growth and strong earnings. This momentum was derailed with the emergence of the coronavirus pandemic representing unique challenges for the business as non-emergency dental services and elective medical surgeries have been shut down in many parts of the U.S. and the world. Acknowledging the near-term pressures, we think the sell-off in shares now represents a compelling buying opportunity in a company that is a market leader. We think Henry Schein within the healthcare sector is well-positioned to recover going forward.(source: finviz.com)The recent events came at an unfortunate time for the company as its shares reached an all-time high of $73.99 in February. 2019 revenue growth of 6% drove an 11.1% y/y increase in non-GAAP EPS to $3.51. The company has seen traction in sales of higher-margin product segments. This trend has been supported by an ongoing industry transition to digitalization and advanced technologies, including specialty dental and medical practice management software.(source: Company IR)Currently, approximately 65% of the company's 2019 total revenue of $10 billion came from the dental products segment. The medical group was $30% while the smaller tech and value-added-services group was 5% of the business which includes software sales.(source: Company IR)The company reported Q4 earnings back in February. At the time, coronavirus was assumed to be relatively contained within China and the Asia region. Management had issued full-year 2020 guidance targeting EPS of $3.65 to $3.75, reflecting a growth of 4% to 7%. Coronavirus was mentioned in the conference call only to say that the company was monitoring the situation and existing sales in China were only a small part of the business.Given the deterioration of the situation in what is now a global pandemic, we assume the guidance is no longer valid, although management has not made an official update in that regard.Since mid-March when stay-at-home orders and social distancing guidelines came into effect in the U.S., one repercussion has been the postponement of normal and non-emergency medical care in many parts of the country. In some cases, cancellations of elective surgeries were mandated by state governments which were the case in New York, New Jersey, and Texas as just a few examples. Separately, the American Dental Association (""ADA"") recommended all non-emergency dental treatment be suspended with some states like California making it a directive.The broader point here is that even in areas without specific rules or enforcement, consumers are likely to be avoiding unnecessary close contact situations, implying reduced demand for these types of services and Henry Schein products. The other point here is that these dynamics are worldwide with reports of similar measures in Europe to Australia.For Henry Schein, the impact on its current operating environment as a dental and medical supply distributor is similar to the challenges facing many other industries. Given the situation only escalated in earnest towards the end of March, it's likely the bulk of the decline in lower sales volume and earnings will occur during Q2.The silver lining here is that parts of the business feature recurring revenue with long-term contracts. Management highlights that in the smaller technology and value-added-segment services segment, two-thirds of revenue is recurring. It's also important to note that this is not a complete shutdown of elective surgeries and the dental industry worldwide. Some practices are still operating, suggesting there are ongoing sales and cash flow generation.A major development in recent weeks has been the company's announcement that it is preparing to distribute ""at least several hundred thousand"" point-of-care antibody rapid test to diagnose COVID-19. The product known as the ""Standard Q COVID-19 IgM/IgG Rapid Test"" is manufactured by South Korea based SD Biosensor Inc.It's expected these tests will be in high demand as they represent a crucial component of any economic restart plan. The rapid test is meant to read a blood sample with a pin-prick style strip and offer results within 15 minutes. From the press release:While the financial terms of the deal and financial impact for Henry Schein was not disclosed, the revenue and associated cash flow is a positive and should mitigate some of the other weaknesses in the business this quarter.The stock is down about 27% from its highs of the year with the market focusing on the significant near-term disruptions to the company's operation and financial pressures.What we like about Henry Schein is that the core business of serving dental and medical practices are likely some of the first markets to quickly recover once the economy restarts and the pandemic can be contained. People will always require healthcare and dental treatments, and these services are generally covered by insurance plans making them less cyclical than other businesses.We're also looking at the stock's valuation which now appears attractive at 11.4x to 2019 earnings and the lowest level in over a decade. In contrast to other companies that may face difficulties recovering, facing headwinds from high unemployment and generally weaker macro conditions, we think Henry Schein is well-positioned to reclaim its previous growth trajectory.Data by YChartsInvestors here need to look beyond 2020 and what is likely to be a poor Q1 and Q2 result. If we conservatively assume that 2021 (next year) EPS is 10% lower than the 2019 result, applying a normalized 20x multiple on a forecast EPS of $3.16 for 2021 implies a fair value for the stock at $63 per share as our price target.The possibility that the economy can normalize faster than expected supports demand for dental and medical supplies. To the downside, we consider the risk that the outlook for containment of the pandemic deteriorates in terms of a more extended time frame which would lead to a further drop in revenues and earnings.Recognizing the significant near-term challenges to the operating environment for Henry Schein, the company benefits from its market leadership position and global scale. We are bullish on HSIC and rate shares as a buy with an expectation that demand for dental and private medical supplies will rebound by the end of the year. Monitoring points here include the Q1 earnings set for late May which will provide more clarity of conditions and may offer updated guidance."

Since many practices are small operations, it makes sense to bundle as many capabilities into one system, since it simplifies training and reduces ‘finger pointing’ in case of customer support.Additionally, it provides HSIC with a meaningful addition of a Web-based system, reducing the need for antiquated on-premises software that is difficult to update.It also adds 11,000 dental practices to HSIC’s cross-sell initiatives, although there is bound to be some overlap within that number.Lighthouse 360 will continue to operate as a separate brand, for the time being at least.While we don’t know the price paid for the acquisition, assuming management didn’t overpay, it should be a positive deal for HSIC over the medium term as HSIC continues a push to diversify into software and services."

3999522,88746,2016-08-15T07:38:26-04:00,Henry Schein reported a disappointing quarter recently.Sales in their main business segment appear to be weakening for now.Valuations are not compelling at current prices.The charts are indicating a downward trend.,"BackgroundHenry Schein (NASDAQ:HSIC) is the world's largest provider of health care products and services to office-based dental, animal health and medical practitioners.Quarterly Results OverviewSales for the quarter were up 9.3% year over year. This consisted of 7.6% organic growth, 2.1% from acquisitions, and -.4% from foreign currency exchange. Adjusted EPS was $1.64, up over 10% year over year. While these are solid numbers, some business segments showed considerable softness, including their dental segment (discussed later in the article).Quarterly Results by SegmentHenry Schein has four business units: dental, animal health, medical, and technology and value added services. To give some background we will look at sales for 2015 to see the composition of the business. Dental accounts for 50% of sales, animal health at 27%, medical at 20%, and technology and value-added services at 3%. Total sales for the company for 2015 were $10.6 billion. As for profitability, they don't break it out by individual segment, rather they combine Dental, animal health, and medical into ""Health Care Distribution."" In the prior year for health care distribution, they had a gross margin of 27%, or $2.77 billion. For technology and value-added services, they had a gross margin of 67.9%, or $243.5 million.DentalDental is the biggest revenue generator for the company. Sales were $1.4 billion, up 4% from the prior year. 2.8% was organic growth, 1.3% was from acquisitions, and -.1% was from foreign currency. Most concerning was that North America sales were only up 2%, reflecting softness. In their press release, they said that ""North America dental sales reflect softness in the U.S. that began in early June. North America dental consumable merchandise internal sales growth was 1.8% and equipment sales and service internal sales growth in local currencies was 2.7%."" North America is a large market for them and should this continue to soften, it would be very concerning. They fall back on their business model which has worked well for them in the past. I would not look into this too much yet, as one month of weakness is not a trend. However, if similar results are reported next quarter, beware. To counter weak North American sales, international sales growth was in the 4% range.Animal HealthSales in the quarter were up 14% to $853.6 million. Organic growth was an impressive 11.8%, with 18.8% growth in North America and 4.9% growth internationally. Acquisition growth was 3.4% and foreign currency hit revenues by 1.2%. Henry Schein has tremendous exposure to this trend known as the ""humanization of pets."" Pets have become a mainstay in our everyday lives. We sometimes spend more money on our pets than on ourselves! It is truly astounding and given their animal health business represents 27% of sales as of 2015 (and growing), expect sales to increase for years to come.MedicalMedical sales were up 14.5%, all organically. North America was up 10.4%. Not much detail was given although this was their sixth consecutive quarter of double digit sales gains.Technology and Value Added ServicesSales were $107 million, up 19.6%. Organic growth was 8.1%, acquisitions accounted for 12.3% and foreign currency hit -.8%. Acquisitions boosted market share. Again, not too much detail was given.GuidanceIn their latest conference call, they revised guidance. They are calling for $6.55-6.60 in EPS, up 10-11% year over year. They clipped the top end by $.05. While this is not much, it still does not provide investors with a clear outlook. I believe management is being a little conservative with their forecast. However, during the Q&A, they mentioned that they saw little improvement in dental for July (largest and most profitable business).Balance SheetThe balance sheet of Henry Schein is extremely stable throughout the past few years. At the end of their last quarter, they only have $700 million of long term debt. For a $13.6 billion company, that is minimal. Inventories and accounts receivable have both increased by about 10% year over year. This may be something to keep an eye on, especially with the dental business slowing.ValuationAt the time of writing, Henry Schein is up 5% year to date. HSIC trades at 23.9x forward earnings. Assuming HSIC earns $6.60 for 2016 and $7.29 in 2017 (according to CNBC), they would have a 10.5% growth rate. In this scenario, the PEG would be 2.28, which is extremely expensive. Even though the stock is off their highs by 10%, it is hard to buy the stock even up here.ChartsLooking at the charts, you can see the stock has moved up substantially over the past two years. However, there have been corrections for each of the past two years in October. Perhaps this will be the case this year. Another way to look at this chart is by observing the moving averages. In each of the past two times, the 50 day moving average has crossed below the 200 day moving average. Then, the 50 day cross the 200 day and the stock pushes higher. As for support, it appears as though there is some at $160, $155, and $145. Resistance is at $170 and $180. I am hard pressed to think this stock will run to the upside anytime soon.Source: StockChartsConclusionThere is no doubt that Henry Schein has performed well in the past two years. The company has strong sales in their animal health, medical, and Technology & value added services. The dental business is slowing and it would be prudent to remain cautious. Reducing the top end of their guidance signals that they are not seeing as much growth as initially expected. The balance sheet remains rock solid. However, valuations have gotten out of hand with the PEG being 2.27. After reviewing the charts, I would expect Henry Schein to trade lower throughout the summer. If you could pick up shares around $150, I believe the shares would represent some nice value. They are a great company for the long term given their exposure to growing end markets, specifically dental and animal health.Thank you very much for reading and happy investing!"
3957259,21798,2016-03-10T02:28:11-05:00,Henry Schein’s products will continue to benefit from the aging Baby Boomers.The stock is undervalued on a DCF basis.I expect the stock to outperform the S&P 500 as Henry Schein continues to grow at an above average rate.,"Image Source: HSIC Investor PresentationHenry Schein (NASDAQ:HSIC) is a consistent achiever of above average earnings growth, which has led the stock to outperform the market. I expect the company to continue to achieve above average earnings and stock growth as it benefits from the aging population.Henry Schein is the largest provider of medical equipment/health care products in the world. The company's products are focused on the dental industry, animal health, and medical practitioners. Henry Schein has a diverse set of over 1 million customers throughout the world. The company's direct customers include: dental practitioners, animal health clinics, doctor's offices, government health clinics, and other health clinics.The company's above average earnings growth drives the stock price to outperform the S&P 500 over the long-term. Henry Schein has strong operating and free cash flow. Although the company doesn't pay dividends with its cash flow, investors are rewarded through business expansion and share repurchases, which helps the company grow revenue and earnings, thus driving the stock price higher.Source: BigChartsHenry Schein is poised to benefit from the aging population, industry consolidation, and from the increased amount of insured patients due to the Affordable Care Act in the U.S. The Baby Boomer generation is aging quickly with an increasing need for medical care. There are 76 million living Baby Boomers in the U.S. who will help drive the need for medical care going forward. The amount of people aged 85 years or older, who are most in need of medical care, is expected to grow from 6 million to 18 million by 2050. Healthcare spending is projected to increase from 17.7% of U.S. GDP to 19.6% of GDP [$5.4 trillion] by 2024 according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid. This will help contribute to Henry Schein's business as its products will be increasingly in demand over the long-term.The market for the industry that comprises dental, animal health, and medical markets that Henry Schein operates in is approximately $45 billion, according to the company's 10-K. There is a lot of industry consolidation taking place. The trend taking place in the industry is that many small distributors that have limited financial and marketing resources are combining with larger companies to provide better opportunities for growth. This trend will allow Henry Schein to expand through acquisition as the company uses its strong cash flow to acquire the smaller players.In addition to acquisitions, Henry Schein also has the ability for organic growth. The company made technological improvements in equipment/supplies, prosthetic solutions, software and services, and patient communications to make the company a go-to source for its customers. These tech improvements are positive for gaining new customers and for retaining current ones.The company also has opportunities to grow geographically. Henry Schein does have a global presence in 33 countries. The company sees plenty of room to continue its global growth. The company's distribution centers are strategically located to optimally serve customers (convenient ordering and fast/accurate delivery) and for operational efficiency. Henry Schein sees growth opportunities in new regions and deeper penetration into some current regions where it operates.Image Source: HSIC Investor PresentationDCF Valuation AnalysisInvestors may overlook Henry Schein as it is trading at 22.9X expected 2017 earnings. However, the company is the leader in the industry. The company's strong growth over the years led investors to give the stock a premium price in terms of earnings.Since the company has a strong cash flow, I felt that it would be appropriate to do a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the stock's intrinsic value. I used 10% as the discount rate since that is the market's historical rate of return that we aim to beat. The assumptions are that free cash flow will grow at 15% annually over the next five years, 10% annually from years 6 - 10, and 3% annually thereafter. Free cash flow increased 17% annually over the past 4 years, while earnings increased 10.6% annually. The company is expected to grow earnings at about 12% annually over the next five years, so I went a little more conservative for the FCF growth assumptions as compared to the 17% FCF growth that was achieved in recent years. The calculation gives the stock an intrinsic value of $177. This is a 6% premium over the current price of $167. Therefore, the stock is slightly undervalued on a discounted cash flow basis.The company does a good job of meeting/exceeding its estimates. The ROE has remained over 15% for the past 3 years, which will help sustain strong earnings growth.I expect Henry Schein to outperform the S&P 500 going forward. If the company averages 12% annual earnings growth over the next five years, this is likely to beat the S&P 500's expected annual earnings growth of about 5% over the same time period. Henry Schein is expected to grow earnings at about 11% in 2016. So, I think the stock can rise to about $184 within the next year, approximately in-line with earnings growth.If you like my analysis, click on FOLLOW at the top of the article near my name.

4165689,102404,2018-04-25T13:00:08-04:00,"Henry Schein is a medical distributor mostly distributing dental supplies and animal health products.The company is currently facing a FTC investigation, but also has a wide moat protecting its business.Henry Schein is not paying any dividends and doesn’t plan to declare any in the next years, but the company is returning cash to shareholders by share buyback programs.Right now, Henry Schein is fairly valued at best, but we are searching for undervalued companies with a reasonable margin of safety before investing.","A few days ago, I wrote about Patterson Companies (Nasdaq: PDCO) and asked if it is a good investment after it lost more than half of its value in a very short time. Henry Schein’s (Nasdaq: HSIC) stock price also declined as did the stock prices of many other distributors like McKesson Corporation (NYSE: MCK) or Owens & Minor (NYSE: OMI). However, it makes sense to compare especially Patterson Companies and Henry Schein as both companies are quite similar and operate in very similar sectors. Both companies operate as specialty distributors in the United States and both operate in the dental market (as the two biggest dental distributors in the United States) as well as in the animal health market.After analyzing Patterson Companies, I will now look at Henry Schein and try to answer the question if it is the better investment pick and the better company: it seems quite natural that Henry Schein should be the superior company as it didn’t get punished by investors like Patterson Companies. But maybe, the relative strength of Henry Schein is no hint for superiority of the company, instead just a sign for overvaluation of the stock.In the following article we will look at the pros (stable numbers and competitive advantage) and cons (ongoing FTC investigations) of Henry Schein. After looking at the ways to return cash to the shareholders, we will finish with an intrinsic value calculation. But first, we start with a short business description.Henry Schein and Patterson Companies generate the biggest part of revenue from distributing dental supplies as well as animal health products. But while Patterson Companies is now generating most of its revenue from animal health, Henry Schein is still generating almost half its revenue from dental (48%) and only 28% from animal health. Despite being an international company that is operating in 34 countries, 63% of total revenue is generated in the United States. Basically, Henry Schein’s business is divided in two reportable segments – health care distribution and technology/value-added services.(Source: Henry Schein Q4/2017 Investor Relations Presentation)About 96% of its annual revenue ($12.5 billion in 2017) was generated by the distribution segment – dental (48%), animal health (28%) and medical (20%). This segment distributes consumable products, small and large equipment, laboratory and surgical products as well as diagnostic tests and many other products. In North America, Henry Schein has a market share of 35-40% in the dental market as well as in the animal health market and a market share of over 20% in the European dental market and health market. Henry Schein is the number one global dental distributor and the number one global companion animal health distributor.The second segment, the technology and value-added services group provides software, technology and other value-added services to health care practitioners. It includes practice management software systems as well as financial services, network and hardware services. Although this segment only contributes about 4% of total revenue, the operating margin of this segment was almost 30% in 2017 and therefore more than twice the operating margin of the distribution segment (12%).Overall, Henry Schein is presenting itself as extremely stable company that is growing all the important metrics constantly – revenue, net income, earnings per share and free cash flow show a steady trend. Similar to Patterson Companies, Henry Schein is also no cash-intensive business as the company only needs about 10-15% of generated net income to keep its own business running. The company has to spend about $60-80 million a year as capital expenditure on property, plant and equipment.Although Henry Schein increased both long-term and short-term debt in the last years, the debt-equity ratio is still rather low (0.59 in the last quarter). We have to point out that in the last decade, the D/E ratio was never as high as it is right now, but that is rather an indication that Henry Schein’s debt-equity ratio has always been low and the company was always well managed. With $175 million in cash and cash equivalents and an operating income of $700-800 million annually, it would take only two years of operating income to pay back the outstanding debt of $1.66 billion and investors don’t have to worry the debt will affect the business in some bad way.Patterson Companies had higher margins than Henry Schein in the past and especially the net income margin was much higher, but right now Henry Schein has not just a higher net income margin – the other two important margins (gross and operating) are also higher. The margins of Henry Schein seem also much more stable, while those of Patterson Companies have been declining over the last decade and apparently still haven’t found a bottom yet. Patterson’s ROIC declined in the last few years, while Henry Schein managed to generate a return on invested capital that was always in the double digits in the last decade – mostly between 13% and 14% in the last ten years.Despite being obviously a great company, the stock price declined in the last few months - and in most cases there is a reason for the decline and the bad sentiment. On the on hand, we have the FTC investigation (for more details see article about Patterson Companies). Henry Schein also disappointed regarding earnings in the last quarters, but not as much as Patterson Companies.Many distributors have been declining in the last quarter and the sentiment around medical distribution companies (like McKesson, Owens & Minor, Cardinal Health or Patterson Companies) is rather bad right now. Under these circumstances, one can assume that Henry Schein’s stock price could be drawn down with the bad sentiment.The risk section’s counterpart is usually the part in the article where we look at the company’s moat (if a company has such a competitive advantage) as well as the strengths that ensure growth in the years (or decades) to come. First of all, we have to point out that Henry Schein is mostly selling recession-proof products and while most companies tumbled during the last recession, Henry Schein could report impressive net income growth in 2009 (as well as moderate sales growth). The aging population will also increase the demand for dental products and have a positive effect on Henry Schein’s revenue growth.A growing market is usually attracting new competitors, but Henry Schein is also in a comfortable position with 90 years of experience and a well-recognized brand name. Another important factor is also cost-effective purchasing. As Henry Schein is the biggest distributor for dental products as well as for animal health globally it is certainly in a good position to get products cheaper than competitors and being the biggest in a sector can be an advantage in this case. The distribution centers in strategically located positions are a valuable asset and incoming orders can be automatically transmitted to the nearest distribution center. As I have written about the value of a well-functioning distribution system in several articles, I will not go in to detail. For more information I suggest you read my article about four undervalued distribution companies (Henry Schein is one of the four companies mentioned in the article).If you are looking for companies that pay at least a fraction of earnings to the shareholders, Patterson Companies probably would be the better pick as it has almost a dividend yield of 5% and a payout ratio of about 55% which indicates at least a stable dividend. Henry Schein on the other hand is paying no dividend at all. In its 10-K the company states:So, investors should not expect a dividend any time soon and as long as a company can grow its business it makes more sense to reinvest generated cash in the business instead of paying out parts of the earnings as dividend. At least in the past, management had demonstrated that they knew what they were doing and that they were using the generated cash to grow the business and shareholder’s equity. However, one can ask if it was intelligent to use money to buy back stock instead of paying a dividend considering the high stock price. With a declining stock price on the other hand, share buyback programs are a very good and smart way to reward investors. In the last years, Henry Schein has not aggressively bought back shares (like some other companies), but continuously decreased the number of outstanding shares and one can only hope that management will increase share buybacks if the stock price continues to drop. The number of outstanding shares was decreased from 182 million ten years ago to 156 million right now.(Source: Henry Schein Q4/2017 Investor Relations Presentation)But when looking for a good investment, we shouldn’t primarily focus on dividends or share buybacks, but on the expected free cash flow the company can generate in the future and on the price the stock is currently trading for. These numbers are important ingredients for in the intrinsic value calculation that finally determines if a company is a good investment or not.While Patterson Companies is currently valued for a zero-growth scenario, Henry Schein would be extremely overvalued if we assume the company cannot grow its free cash flow in the years to come. Right now, the company is valued for a growth rate of 5.7% till eternity (as long as we are expecting an annual return of 10%). Considering the wide moat of Henry Schein such a growth rate seems realistic, but that would be investing without any margin of safety and we are searching for undervalued stocks.Before investing in a company, the stock has to be undervalued (according to my intrinsic value calculation) and additionally I want at least some margin of safety. A margin of safety is necessary as it would be extremely arrogant to assume one can calculate the intrinsic value on the basis of the expected free cash flow for a decade or several decades to come. We only can make rough estimates about the future years and the risk for mistakes or free cash flow fluctuations is extremely high. A margin of safety (about 20-25%) should compensate for such errors.For Henry Schein and our analysis the stock has to drop at least another 30% in order to be undervalued and reflecting at least a small margin of safety. I am very well aware that Henry Schein could increase its sales as well as its adjusted EPS 15% annually since 1995 and therefore expecting only 5.7% growth is very conservative. However, we also have to point out that growth slowed down in the last years and while net income could be doubled between 2006 and 2009 (in only three years), since then the average annual growth was less than 4% (if we exclude 2017, it was about 7%). Considering these developments, I think expecting about 6% growth for eternity (due to the wide moat) is acceptable and realistic.Considering the troubles of Patterson Companies growing its business and expanding into the low margin business of animal health, Henry Schein is obviously the better pick and should be better positioned for long-term growth. The company is also able to grow internally (about 5% annually) and not just by acquisitions.(Source: Henry Schein Q4/2017 Investor Relations Presentation)But we also have to consider that Henry Schein is fairly valued at best, while Patterson Companies is already undervalued. If you are looking for constant dividend payments, Patterson Companies would also be the better pick. However, if you are willing to wait and Henry Schein’s stock price might drop a little further an investment in Henry Schein could be more profitable. Especially as Henry Schein seems to be better positioned for long term growth and for long-term investors long-term growth is more important than current valuation (Buffett’s quote of rather investing in a wonderful company with reasonable valuation comes to mind), Henry Schein could be the better pick."
4248840,102404,2019-03-14T15:05:53-04:00,"Henry Schein is a medical distribution company and after the spin-off of its animal health business it is focused on the distribution of dental and medical equipment.The company is not only reporting extremely stable margins, but could also grow in the higher teens since the IPO (although growth slowed down in the last few years).Due to its distribution network, Henry Schein will be able to manage the current headwinds in the dental market and resist price pressures.","After we already analyzed thirteen new companies as part of my series, the fourteenth company will be one I already have written about before, but fits the criteria perfectly to be part of the series – the dental and health care distributor Henry Schein (NASDAQ:HSIC). The company is the largest global dental distributor and the second largest physician and alternate care distributor in the U.S. and is profiting from a real competitive advantage and high levels of defensibility against potential competitors.As always, the article will follow the same structure and we start by describing the business model – especially after the spin-off which is getting Henry Schein out of the animal health business. We will look at the performance metrics of the last decade and describe the company’s wide moat – once again with a special focus on acquisitions as well as the spin-off. We will end the article by trying to determine an intrinsic value for the stock and search for a possible entry point.Henry Schein believes the company is the world’s largest provider of health care products and services primarily to office-based dental and medical practitioners and has currently more than 1 million customers almost all over the world. When describing Henry Schein’s business model, we first of all have to talk about the recent spin-off that the company completed in February 2019. The completion of the spin-off of the animal health business – now trading as Covetrus (Nasdaq: CVET) – created a company that is quite different from the company Henry Schein was before.Before February 2019, Henry Schein’s business was divided in four different segments – Dental, Medical, Tech/Value Added Services and Animal Health. After the spin-off, there are three segments left, but Henry Schein is only reporting in two segments – healthcare distribution (which includes dental as well as medical) and technology and value-added services.(Source: Company Presentation)The health care distribution segment includes the dental market and the medical market. This segment distributes consumable products, small and large equipment, laboratory and surgical products as well as equipment repair services. In the dental market, Henry Schein is number one in sales in North America, Europe, Brazil, and Australia. The dental group serves office-based dental practitioners, dental laboratories, schools and other institutions. The company also assumes that about 90% of U.S. dental practices and about 80% of dental labs in North America as well as 65% of dental practices in Europe are active customers of Henry Schein. Growth will come from global expansion as well as a potential further growth of the dental specialty market, in which Henry Schein is generating about $800 million in sales annually (10% market share). That market is not only offering higher margins, but is also growing faster than the core dental market. The second component within the health care distribution segment is the medical market. The global medical group serves office-based medical practitioners, ambulatory surgery centers, other alternate-care settings and other institutions.The second reportable segment is the technology & value added services market. Henry Schein is providing practice management solutions and software systems, financial services, network and hardware services as well as education. Compared to the health care distribution segment that had an operating margin of 4.9% last year (still including the animal health business), the operating income from the Tech/Value Added Service segment was $134 million resulting in an operating margin of 26.2%.Over the past decade, revenue, earnings per share and free cash flow all show a stable upward trend. Especially revenue is growing with a very steady pace and during the last decade the number increased every single year with an annual average growth rate of 8% (of course in 2019 revenue will be lower due to the spin-off). With one exception (2017 – due to higher income taxes and other expenses), earnings per share also increased every single year during the last decade and grew about 8% annually (share buybacks supported that number a little bit). Free cash flow increased “only” 6.2% and especially since 2013 free cash flow was more or less stable. This is the only weak spot among all the metrics we are looking at; however, FCF is an important metric. A reason for the missing growth during the last years are the increased capital expenditures – from $51 million in 2012 to $91 million last year. Additionally, net income couldn’t increase much during the last few years – earnings per share grew mostly due to share buybacks and, as a consequence, free cash flow stagnated a bit.(Source: Own work based on numbers from Morningstar)When looking at Henry Schein’s margins, we see a picture of great stability. The company might not be able to report extremely high margins like some other businesses, but when looking at the gross margin and operating margin during the last decade, we almost look at a straight line (the visualization of an extremely stable business). The gross margin was declining a little in the past few years, but the operating margin (which is more important) is solid. The reported operating income last year was 5.7% and leaving out the animal health business, the operating margin will increase about 7.5% (for the full year of 2018, it would have been 7.36%; for the fourth quarter, it would have been 7.79% - both non-GAAP numbers).(Source: Own work based on numbers from Morningstar)Return on invested capital declined a little during the last two years and was only about 10% (in 2017) and 12% (in 2018), but in the years before it was very constant at about 13-14% every single year. Return on invested capital doesn’t show the same extreme stability as the two margins, but the numbers are still very impressive.At the end of December 2018, Henry Schein had about $950 million in bank credit lines and slightly above $1 billion in long-term debt. On the asset side, Henry Schein has only about $80 million in cash and cash equivalents, but as part of the spin-off, Henry Schein received about $1.1 billion which the company will use to pay down the debt. In the end, there would remain about $1 billion in debt on the balance sheet, which would lead to D/E ratio of 0.28. When comparing it to the “new” non-GAAP operating income (without animal health segment), it would take about one and a half years to repay the debt. These are both very acceptable numbers and point towards a healthy business. Even with $2.8 billion in goodwill – about 33% of total assets – and $584 million in intangible assets – about 7% of total assets – Henry Schein has a healthy balance sheet that should be no reason for concern.When we look at the results without the animal health segment, the numbers become even more impressive. Leaving out the animal health segment, Henry Schein generated $9.4 billion in revenue last year (as $3.8 billion in revenue stem from the animal health segment). The total operating income last year was $753 million; without the animal health segment, the operating income was $694 million. While Henry Schein lost about 29% of revenue due to the spin-off, it only lost about 8% of operating income. Earnings per share before the spin-off were $3.49 for 2018 and without the animal health business, diluted EPS was $3.17 which reflects a decline of 9%.(Source: Company Presentation)When looking at some metrics since the IPO, Henry Schein has reported very impressive numbers (these numbers reflect the development without the animal health segment). Net sales grew 13% annually since 1995, operating income grew 17% every single year for the last 23 years and diluted EPS increased 14% annually.When looking at the impressive growth numbers of Henry Schein (leaving out the animal health segment and its low profitability) it makes sense to focus on the other two segments. These are also the segments where Henry Schein has a rather wide moat and have made a smart move by not only focusing on size (measured by revenue or market cap) but also putting the emphasis on those segments that can achieve high margins and have a competitive advantage. By spinning off the animal health business, Henry Schein focused on its core business, which is protected by high levels of defensibility against new competitors.In addition to the spin-off, Henry Schein will probably continue to widen its moat by strategic acquisitions. In the last few years, Henry Schein made several small acquisitions to widen its moat. These acquisitions focused especially on the dental market and helped Henry Schein to expand into new markets all over the world – for example in Japan and Brazil and, very recently, also in China.(Source: Company Presentation)Among the three remaining segments, the dental segment is the most important as it is responsible for two thirds of revenue and the business segment with the strongest moat. Different reports see about 6% growth for the global dental market in the next 5 years with reasons being the growing ageing population or increasing demand for cosmetic dentistry. Despite continued growth, different analysts also see global dental sales being under pressure and continuing headwinds for the sector, which lead to price pressures. The highest growth is expected in the Asia-Pacific region, while North America and Europe are expected to grow moderately.Price pressures are nothing we can deny, but I would like to point out that Henry Schein’s margins are still extremely stable which is a strong hint that the company is managing the pressure in contrast to Patterson Companies (NASDAQ:PDCO) quite well. For Patterson Companies, price pressures seem to be much more an issue as margins are declining constantly. Henry Schein’s gross margin is showing no sign of price pressure at all and operating margin declined only a little from 7.23% in 2015 to about 6.5% right now. In the last few quarters, it was very stable at 6.5% which is inspires confidence that Henry Schein is handing the price pressure quite well.Henry Schein as distribution company is combining a very fragmented demand side with a very fragmented supply side. Henry Schein has more than 1 million customers worldwide and is offering more than 120,000 branded products (aside from company's private brand products) and more than 180,000 products that are available as special-order items. Of course, the supply side is less fragmented than the demand side as the largest supplier of Henry Schein accounts for 6% of all purchases and the top 10 suppliers account for 32%. Although Henry Schein (like other medical distributors) has rather low margins, the defensibility of the business is extremely high as it is difficult to cut out the middle man. Rebuilding the distribution network (with 30 strategically located distribution centers around the world) would also be a tough job for any competitor that is trying to enter the market and once that distribution system is in place, every additional customer Henry Schein is serving adds almost no additional expenses (as the distribution network is already in place), but increases profitability for Henry Schein.Price pressures for the dental market may certainly remain, but I see Henry Schein’s competitive advantage and defensibility as very high and a guarantor for long-lasting success.But having a great company with high defensibility is not enough if the price we are paying is too high. To determine if Henry Schein is a good investment right now, we have to look at expected free cash flows in the years to come and calculate an intrinsic value.According to its own guidance, Henry Schein expects a non-GAAP EPS growth of 8% for 2019 while the dental market will grow 5-6% in the next five years. I would assume that Henry Schein could also grow at least 5% annually despite price pressures and headwinds and due to the competitive advantage of its distribution network, 5% growth might also be a realistic growth rate till perpetuity.Last year, free cash flow was $594 million, but due to the spin-off of the animal health business, the estimated FCF for 2019 will probably be lower. As operating income and earnings per share are about 10% lower without the animal health business, I would also subtract about 10% from the cash generated by operations. Due to the restructuring and spin-off, capital expenditures might be even higher in 2019 than in the previous years so therefore, I would start with $520 million as free cash flow. Using a 5% growth rate in perpetuity, 10% as a discount rate and $520 million as the free cash flow basis leads to an intrinsic value of $68.88 for Henry Schein.In this case, I would include a bigger margin of safety (at least 25%) to reflect uncertainties about Henry Schein and the growth expectations in the dental market. But I am also a little puzzled by the huge stock drop after the spin-off. At that day, the stock dropped about 30% which is more or less reflecting the revenue Henry Schein lost due to the spin-off. But considering the low operating margin of the animal health segment and how little it contributed to the bottom line, the steep decline is irritating for me. According to its own guidance, Henry Schein expects a non-GAAP EPS between $3.38 and $3.46 for 2019 (compared to a GAAP EPS of $3.49 in 2018) and therefore suffered almost no decline as consequence of the spin-off. A few months ago, the company was trading at a P/E of almost 26 and is now down to about 18 (using the EPS of 2018 without animal health segment). In my opinion, Henry Schein will be similarly profitable in 2019 although it lost about 30% of its revenue and has become an even stronger business with a wider economic moat. The fact that the market obviously sees the company a little different could be a hint I am wrong or missing something and, as a consequence, I will add a margin of safety of 25% which leads to an entry point of $51.66.Henry Schein already seems to be a bit undervalued, but I am not sure if it is a good buy yet. Aside from free cash flow (which hasn’t really grown in the recent past), all other metrics point toward a huge competitive advantage and high levels of defensibility for Henry Schein. But the spin-off and the headwinds in the dental segment are reason enough to be a little more cautious and include a bigger margin of safety to reflect potential risks and uncertainties. It certainly will be helpful to see the first 10-Q after the spin-off to get more information about the “new” company. However, at $50 Henry Schein could be a good long-term investment and a good entry point might have been reached."
3350065,91465,2015-07-23T12:02:48-04:00,Valuation trades above industry average with little room to go up.Investors should buy its strong balance sheet and growth if there is a stock correction.Growth prospects are still strong due to an aging population and medical reform.,"Henry Schein (NASDAQ:HSIC), one of my favorite investments, offers strong investment potential for a very high price. Its unique position within its market niche offers durable profitability, while its balance sheet and growth prospects offer potential for high long-term return. However, while investors have been rewarded over the past five years by returns of over 175%, it's time to take some profits and wait for the stock to settle down.What does Henry Schein do?Henry Schein is the world's largest supplier of medical supplies and services, with clients spread across medical, dental, and veterinary office-based practitioners. In recent years, HSIC has expanded its client base to include organizations like dental labs, government agencies, hospitals, and surgery centers. Customers can purchase an array of dental and medical supplies, pharmaceuticals and vaccines, software and technology, equipment, and more. This product base is offered in both name brands and HSIC's private label. With more than 1 million customers worldwide and operations in 28 different countries, HSIC seeks to be a ""one-stop shop"" for all its client's needs. 35% of HSIC's total sales are international. HSIC consistently ranks in Forbes' ""Best Employers"", Fortune's ""World's Most Admired Company"", and Ethisphere's ""World's Most Ethical Company"" rankings.HSIC is still one of my favorite investments that I will continue to hold in my portfolio. However, its current price reflects a premium to its value rather than a bargain. Two important pieces are factored into my decision to take profits: a rich valuation and the short term jump from the King v. Burwell decision.At a P/E of 27.2, HSIC trades almost two full multiples above its industry average P/E of 25.4. Its forward P/E of 22.1 trades even more strides beyond the industry average of 17.7. HSIC certainly deserves to trade at multiples above the industry average (which I will explain), but it's hard to see valuations growing any richer than they already are (particularly given the coming rate hike by the Fed). A P/E of 27.2 is already reaching the top of the historical range, as the last time the company reached this valuation was during the bull market of 05-07. Taking some money off the table is by no means a reflection of anything wrong with the fundamentals of the company, but simply a matter of profit taking while such a high valuation exists. This valuation has only been bolstered by the recent King v. Burwell decision, which pushed stocks upward across the medical industry. Full subsidies being granted across the nation soothed care providers worried about margins, and will stabilize growth prospects for medical supply companies like HSIC.But as I stated, HSIC is still a great company with strong investment potential. Investors should consider purchasing HSIC if an 8-13% correction were to occur, and strongly consider doing so if the stock drops any more than that (given there is no change in its fundamentals). Despite the risk of competition in the healthcare industry, HSIC's quick delivery service and large scope of products will keep the company as an industry leader for years to come. HSIC has maintained profit margins over sustained periods of time and continues to hold a strong negotiating position with both consumers and vendors (no vendor makes up more than 7% of HSIC's product supply). I also see significant increases in demand for medical services over the next five years, resulting from healthcare reform and an aging population (the number of individuals over 45 is projected to double by 2030). Increased product demand, prudent acquisitions, and stock repurchases will fuel HSIC's financial growth and potential returns.Major CompetitorsHenry Schein's competitors include the McKesson Corporation, Patterson Companies, PSS World Medical, Cardinal Health, MWI Veterinary Supply, and Benco Dental Supply Company. However, each of these companies only competes with Henry Schein for a specific market niche. HSIC is the only company that sells in all these market segments. Its size, product breadth, and multi-market allow it to serve as a middleman between the many suppliers in the industry and the fragmented base of medical, dental, and veterinary practices, offering several benefits over its competitors:Growth StrategyHenry Schein has grown through a combination of acquisitions and expansion into new markets. Healthcare reform is favorable for HSIC, as it is expected to increase usage of healthcare services by bringing more individuals into the marketplace. Additionally, increases in the 65 and older demographic over the next 5-10 years will significantly increase demand from medical providers. Because HSIC is a provider of goods and services to healthcare providers and not a provider itself, it will reap the benefits of healthcare reform, but will not face the same reimbursement risks that the medical services industry will. Growth has lagged in some years coincident with poor economic conditions worldwide, but has rebounded in recent years. However, the European market continues to see weaker sales than hoped. Additionally, since the medical goods and services provider market is so fragmented, HSIC can continue to make acquisitions in coming years. Similar to the medical goods and services market, HSIC will make acquisitions in its dental and veterinary divisions to drive growth. It also projects higher income from developments in its software and technology sales.FinancialsHenry Schein continues to post strong bottom line results despite some economic weakness in past years. Both EBITDA and net income have grown at a steady rate over the past 10 years, demonstrating HSIC's commitment to sustainable growth.ROE and ROA have also expanded at steady rates over the past ten years, as have earnings and free cash flow. ROE's CAGR increased from 14% 5 years ago to 16% last year, while ROA's CAGR held steady at 8%. EBITDA has grown almost 300% over 10 years, and net income has grown more than 400% over the same period. Over that same period, free cash flows have almost tripled and earnings have jumped from roughly $1.50 a share to $5.50 a share. The company carries only $730m in debt, proving it can make acquisitions and expand without adding heavy amounts of borrowing. Low debt, combined with strong free cash flow and low interest rates, gives HSIC the potential to make acquisitions during a time of heavy consolidation in the medical industry. Financials available via their annual SEC filings here or are compiled here.ManagementManagement has proven itself to be both capable and shareholder friendly. Though Henry Schein does not offer a dividend, the Board of Directors has authorized $600m worth of share buybacks over the past three years. 1.99% of shares outstanding ($233m worth) are held by management, demonstrating corporate executive's commitment to continued success at HSIC.RisksWhile Henry Schein maintains a competitive advantage in its sales strategy, domestic competition within the medical supplies and service industry is strong. HSIC is looking to expand further into the global marketplace even though competition is stronger internationally than domestically.Though HSIC has maintained gross profit margins of 28-29%, there are multiple factors that could hurt margins:HSIC's growth prospects and business strategy make it a quality investment. However, given such a rich valuation, it's time to take some profits. A correction in share price would represent another buying opportunity for those looking for a strong investment."
3376465,91465,2015-07-30T13:36:38-04:00,Henry Schein is betting its growth on a recovering Europe.Medical supply industry has consolidated heavily.Bigger competitors and a less fragmented market threaten Henry Schein.Forex will continue to be a headwind if trends continue.Investors should cash out and look to buy again in early 2016.,"Henry Schein (NASDAQ:HSIC) reported earnings on July 29th, missing EPS by a penny and missing revenue by $63m. The stock has not demonstrated any significant correction.My earlier analysis recommended selling off some shares in HSIC but remained mildly bullish on the stock. However, following this earnings report, I would advise investors to sell their complete position in HSIC.EuropeInternational dental sales had a great quarter, hitting multiyear highs. Management on the Q2 earnings call attributed this to a strong showing at the biannual International Dental Show in Germany this quarter. Growth was also attributed to strategic acquisitions (a core piece of HSIC's growth strategy). Management mentioned two new acquisitions this quarter: Jorgen Kruuse and Maravet, both vet supply companies.These acquisitions are both centered in Europe, with Kruuse expanding HSIC's direct presence in Denmark, Sweden, and Norway, and Maravet in Romania and Eastern Europe. This demonstrates that HSIC is continuing to bet big on Europe, which can be both a strength and a weakness.I doubt HSIC will see any immediate growth from the region given Europe's current economic weakness. Greece will continue to be a headwind to Europe, particularly given its challenges going forward. . That being said, I think that HSIC will undergo a correction over the next few months, providing an opportunity to buy. Economic recovery in Europe would prove to be a boon to HSIC in 2016 as it continues to make strategic acquisitions there.Industry ConsolidationOne of Henry Schein's competitive advantages has always been its size. It has reach over a broad array of markets, while its competitors are smaller and more fragmented. This has allowed it to supply more products, for cheaper, that get delivered faster.However, CEO Stanley Bergman mentioned this in the Q2 phone call:The first threat is practitioner consolidation. HSIC is big and practices are small, which means they have more leverage when it comes to pricing power. Bigger practitioner groups will be more effective when it comes to pricing, meaning possibly lower margins for HSIC. We already see this in other parts of the medical industry, such as with Mednax (NYSE:MD), which seeks to reduce costs through consolidation of group practices (my analysis of that available here).The second threat is consolidation of distributors, and increased strength of those distributors. Bigger distributors could cut into HSIC's market share, especially if they start offering better pricing. This is a particularly big threat in the vet and dental industry, where HSIC faces relatively low competition compared to the medical supply industry.The last threat of consolidating industry is potential for acquisitions. HSIC's growth strategy has revolved around making strategic purchases of other companies, and bigger rivals mean the company may have to pay richer valuations for smaller companies.Forex: Q2's Biggest AgitatorA lot of major companies faced significant forex headwinds in Q2, and HSIC was no exception. Given the strength of the dollar, and in particular the weakness of the Euro, I was actually expecting HSIC to miss on earnings by more. The closeness of estimates and actual results were impressive, and that was reflected in flatness of the stock price.I believe these headwinds will continue through 2015, leading to depressed revenues and profit. A weak Euro will also continue to depress growth seen out of Europe, where the company has devoted significant resources to expansion.ConclusionHSIC is still a great company, but its valuation relative to the risks faced is too rich. Investors should look for a price decline in the second half of 2015 before buying into potential growth in 2016.Disagree with me? Leave a comment or shoot me a message!

We also encourage all of our readers to follow us on Twitter @sprucepointcap for regular updates. Please review our disclaimer at the bottom of this email.Spruce Point Conducted Proprietary Analysis To Investigate Vets First Choice’s Recent Performance And Believes There Is A Window Of Opportunity To Purchase Shares Of HSIC Today At A Steep Discount To Where Wall Street Analysts Will Eventually Value The Company:Henry Schein announced on April 23, 2018 that it would spin-off and merge its animal health business with privately held VFC to create a new company to be named Vets First Corp. We believe that investors are awaiting the S-1 (new security filing) and S-4 (merger filing) to obtain more information and future projections on Vets First Corp. Given the current information void, Spruce Point conducted big data analysis and a large proprietary survey of vets that reveals significant underappreciated growth at VFC.We believe analysts are overly focused on the pressures of HSIC’s dental business, and ignoring the tremendous growth at VFC. We expect that investors and analysts' focus and sentiment will shift in the coming weeks and months as the growth that we’ve uncovered becomes much more evident.Vets First Choice Is A Next Generation Technology Solution To Allow Vets To Recapture Revenue Lost To Online Pharmacies:Vets First Corporation will be run by Benjamin and David Shaw. The Shaw Family has created a tremendous amount of value in the animal health space as David Shaw was the founder of Idexx (now valued at ~$22B). The Shaw family created VFC as a result of vet practices having lost a majority of the revenue stream that they had garnered from selling prescriptions. Historically, vets were both the doctor and pharmacy for animals.However, the internet disrupted the latter for vet practices over time. Vets First Choice seeks to bring back the lost prescription revenue stream to the vet practice by bringing a front-end online pharmacy solution to all of its customers. Further, Vets First Choice helps vets manage their practice by offering insights and ways to enhance compliance (filling prescription that a vet writes) which leads to greater profits for the vets, happier pet owners, and healthier pets.Vets First Choice Will Be Able To Capitalize On Henry Schein’s Trusted Relationship With Vet Clinics And Turbocharge Vets First Choice’s Growth Profile:Henry Schein already services over 80,000 vets around the world and is the #1 animal health distributor and solutions provider in NA, Europe and Australia/NZ (>70% customer penetration). Furthermore, Henry Schein’s animal health group employs a sales staff of ~680 employees vs. ~100 employees at Vets First Choice. We believe that VFC is leveraging Henry Schein’s brand, sales force and existing install base to rapidly deploy its product offering.Spin-Offs Tend To Outperform The Market And HSIC’s Existing Shareholder Base Has A Strong Affinity For Pure Play Animal Health Stocks:Spruce Point likes to make investments with highly attractive risk/reward profiles. Academic research and recent data points suggest that spin-offs outperform the broader market. Typical spin-offs exhibit early selling pressure in the first few weeks of trading.However, we analyzed HSIC’s shareholder base, and believe a significant amount of HSIC shareholders will not only continue to own Vets First Corp., but could also be incremental buyers. We believe the success of last week’s spin and IPO of Elanco Animal Health (NYSE: ELAN) illustrates strong underlying demand for animal health stocks. We believe VFC will have a better sales and EBITDA growth story than ELAN.Based On Spruce Point’s Proprietary Data Scrape, We believe Vets First Choice Now Has +7,900 Unique Veterinary Practices (+54% YTD) On Its Prescription Management Platform. Our Analysis Suggests That It Will End The Year With Over 9,000 Vet Practices:In order to assess the current growth of VFC, we developed an algorithm to process over 40,000 zip codes through Vets First Choice’s Vet Finder. We continue to run the algorithm on a weekly basis to track vet adoption and currently find that over 7,900 unique vet practices are on the VFC platform. This compares with 5,100 vet practices that were disclosed in HSIC’s press release on April 23, 2018. We believe that VFC’s prescription management platform adoption is accelerating and that it is adding on average +80 new vets per week.At this rate of adoption, we believe that over 9,000 Vet Practices will have signed up for the platform by the end of 2018. Given recent momentum, we believe, that Vets First Choice’s “install base” will grow +75% in 2018. This rate of adoption is significantly above the level last disclosed by HSIC and will be a key valuation driver of sell-side analyst models.We Surveyed Over 100 Vet Practices That Are Currently Using Vets First Choice Prescription Management Platform And Find, On Average, That They Are Selling $37K And $55K In Their Second And Third Full Calendar Years, Respectively:Using our proprietary “Vets First Choice Database,” we conducted a survey of over 100 vet practices. The survey participants offered insights into their practice’s sales levels and cadence on the Vets First Choice Prescription Management Platform. Further, our survey was able to identify simple changes that vet practices could employ that would lead to greater traction with their existing install base. For example, our survey finds that vet practices who no longer fax prescriptions are currently seeing 45% higher sales on the VFC platform versus practices that still fax written prescriptions to their competition.Vets First Corp Will Be The Fastest Growing EBITDA Story In The Animal Health Sector:The newly created entity, Vets First Corp will be growing its EBITDA at a faster clip than any other pure play animal health company in our peer group (Elanco (ELAN), Zoetis (ZTS), IDEXX Laboratories (IDXX), Heska Corporation (HSKA), PetIQ (PETQ), PetMed Express (PETS)). We estimate that Vets First Corp will grow its EBITDA to ~$500M in 2020, more than doubling our 2017E EBITDA of $242M. Longer-term, we believe that the install base exiting 2020 could achieve between $2.2B and $4.0B of EBITDA should each Vet practice reach between $250K and $500K of sales on their Vets First Choice prescription platform.Our Sum-Of-The-Parts (SOTP) Base Case Analysis Yields An HSIC Price Target of $106/share, ~30% Upside:We think the stock approaches this level by the end of this year as more information is released to the public, the spin-off nears consummation, and an expanded analyst universe assumes coverage of VFC with strong buy recommendations. We believe that investor knowledge that Vets First Choice’s install base has grown to +7,900, as well as our conviction that Vets First Corp can reach ~$500M of EBITDA by 2020, merits an immediate repricing of HSIC shares today on modest industry multiple assumptions. Our upside case to $126/share (+50%) assumes HSIC/VFC garners a premium multipleWe believe the findings of our proprietary data scrape and market survey will be validated over the next four months as HSIC provides updated information, and the Street begins to fully appreciate the value of Vets First Corp.Our Estimated Timeline of Events:September 2018We estimate that Vets First Choice will more than double its 2017 EBITDA to ~$500M by 2020. The pro forma entity will offer investors exposure to the higher growth animal health industry. We see the new VFC potentially garnering a multiple commensurate with industry bellwether Idexx. Our base case assumes a discount to Idexx, but we believe that the size of the addressable market for the pro forma entity far surpasses that of Idexx’s market opportunity.HSIC’s Animal Health business is fueled by 680 global field sales consultants that have achieved over 70% veterinarian penetration and 20%-35% market share in key pet markets globally.Source: Henry Schein Q2 2018 PresentationVets First Choice was founded in 2010 by Ben Shaw and his father, David Shaw (Founder of IDEXX, a $21 billion market cap company in the animal space).

Henry Schein brings over 80,000 vet relationships worldwide to a technology asset that we believe every vet in the world should consider, and may eventually adopt. Henry Schein’s relationships and integrity with vets worldwide will “turbo charge” Vets First Choice’s growth profile.The Vets First Corporation transaction is a tax-free event for U.S. tax purposes and is expected to realize $100M of operating income synergies by year three.Reverse Morris Trust: Intended to be a tax-free spin-off to Henry Schein shareholders for U.S. tax purposes, followed by a merger with Vets First Choice Expected to close: end of 2018/January 2019 Expected ownership:Source: Henry Schein 8K (April 23, 2018), Vets First ChoiceHSIC shareholders are well positioned to benefit from both the tremendous growth opportunity associated with Vets First Corp and a refocused Henry Schein (RemainCo)Source: Henry Schein 8-K (April 23, 2018)Spin-offs have historically outperformed the broader market by a large margin as the transaction allows for the individual segments of a parent company to be more efficiently valued. The transaction also broadens the potential universe of investors that can now choose which parts of the historical business that they would like to own (RemainCo, SpinCo, or both). Additionally, spin-offs often free management teams from the bureaucracy of the parent company while creating a public currency that can be better used to incentivize and align management with their investor base.Elanco Animal Health (ELAN) was spun-out and IPO’ed by Eli Lilly & Co (NYSE: LLY) on September 20, 2018. Vets First Corp will have both a stronger top line and EBITDA growth story versus Elanco. We are in agreement with the Wall St. Journal recent assessment that“Animal-Health Stocks Will Continue to Shine” (2)Spruce Point likes investing situations where the data suggests a favorable risk/reward. Numerous academic studies and recent performance suggests that spin-offs outperform the market.We believe that existing HSIC shareholders will continue to own Vets First Corp. given their ownership levels of Idexx and Zoetis (the 2 biggest animal health sector pure plays). The cross-ownership analysis illustrates HSIC’s existing shareholder’s large exposure and understanding of the “Animal Health” theme.In order to get an advance read on the traction that VFC is having with vets during 2018, Spruce Point initiated a data scrape. The scrape allows us to aggregate the number of vets currently leveraging the VFC platform and monitor the growth of new users over time. We believe this data provides valuable insights into VFC’s performance ahead of transaction filings.Spruce Point inspected the HTML code behind Vets First Choice’s Vet Finder and found that it was accessing a searchable API on the AWS server. We gathered a list of over 40,000 zip codes and then wrote an algorithm that searched and recorded results for vet practices. The algorithm is run on a recurring basis to provide insights into the penetration of the VFC platformSource: Vets First Choice -- Find My Vet Searchable DatabaseOur data scrape program identified +7,900 unique practices on the Vets First Choice Platform. This pace indicates that its install base will grow to over 9,000 vets by the end of 2018.We believe that all 25,000 U.S. vet practices will have an online pharmacy solution at some point in the future. Vet practices are in the midst of a secular change where companies like Vets First Choice can streamline the ability to offer a pharmacy online. Vets First Choice will likely have grown its U.S. market share to 36% by the end of 2018 from ~20% at the end of 2017. Ultimately, we think investors will begin to ascribe value to the worldwide opportunity as HSIC currently has over 80,000 vet relationships globally.Survey ResultsSelect Quotes From Survey ParticipantsOnly 5 out of 16 analysts that publish price targets have the equivalent of a “Buy” rating on HSIC. We don’t believe the analysts have conducted extensive diligence to fully understand what the upcoming spin and merge with Vets First Choice represents to current HSIC shareholders. This presents an opportunity, and it appears astute investors are already valuing HSIC slightly above the average analyst price target.Our proprietary data scrape and survey results form the basis of our Vets First Choice standalone model.The justification for our 2020E EBITDA estimate of ~$500M is presented below.Once investors better understand the value proposition that Vets First Corp will bring to vet clinics in the U.S., investors will have a clearer understanding of the +$2.0B EBITDA U.S. long-term potential opportunity.Source: Spruce Point EstimatesAt the moment, there are not many analysts offering projections on VFC. Spruce Point estimates are materially higher than whisper numbers that we have heard Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs are using for Vets First Corp.Catalyst: Significant Analyst Coverage. We expect that many of the existing HSIC analysts and Animal Health sector analysts will be adding Vets First Corp to their coverage universe. Therefore, we expect between six to ten analysts to cover Vets First Choice soon after the transaction is completed.Source: BloombergWe take a conservative view in valuing the remaining HSIC dental business at a discount to its historical EV/Est. EBITDA close to 13xWe estimate that Vets First Choice will more than double its 2017 EBITDA to ~$500M by 2020. The pro forma entity will offer investors exposure to the high growth animal health industry. We see the new VFC potentially garnering a multiple commensurate with industry bellwether Idexx. Our base case assumes a discount to Idexx, but we believe that the size of the addressable market for the pro forma entity far surpasses that of Idexx’s market opportunity.Vets First Corp. will be the 3rd largest pure play animal health company and be the fastest EBITDA growth story in its space. As a result, we expect VFC to attract significant attention from growth-starved investors.Our bull-case scenario suggests that HSIC would be worth $126 representing +50% upside. Our bull case illustrates the upside of HSIC shares today should Vets First Corp. be awarded the highest multiple in its peer group.Recent lawsuit by Idexx vs. Vets First Choice: Idexx filed a lawsuit against two former employees of Idexx and Vets First Choice claiming violations of non-compete clauses and taking confidential information from Idexx on August 3, 2018. We believe that Idexx has a bone to pick with its former founder who we believe did not leave Idexx on good terms. Both Idexx and Vets First Choice are headquartered near each other in Maine, and are now fighting both locally and nationally for top talent. Via LinkedIn, we believe at least 35 former employees have left Idexx for Vets First Choice.Amazon Threat: We believe Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) poses a risk to almost every online distribution business. That being said, there are some models that need high touch points and a different level of service than Amazon can provide and/or intends to provide.Buying Power of Vet Practices: Akin to what has transpired with dental practices, we believe more vet practices will create or enter into group purchasing organizations (GPO) which may pressure prices in the long run.Disclosure: This research presentation expresses our research opinions.

3556366,68255,2015-10-08T10:40:03-04:00,"Henry Schein is a well run, stable, and growing company that shows little economic cycle sensitivity.Increasingly aggressive competition, end market consolidations, and other risks have the potential to cause problems for the company over the long term and should not be ignored.After the recent 15% drop and subsequent partial recovery, shares appear to be fairly priced to slightly overvalued.","Business ProfileFounded as a pharmacy in 1932 by Henry Schein, Henry Schein, Inc. (NASDAQ:HSIC) has grown to become the world's largest distributor of healthcare products and services to dental, veterinary, and medical practitioners. With a network of 65 distribution centers and operations (or affiliates) in 29 countries, HSIC serves more than 1 million customers in 190 countries via direct sales, telesales, and e-commerce. The company has demonstrated consistent growth throughout economic cycles by serving customers that require frequent orders and continuously adapting to changes in end market demand while maintaining a well-respected brand name. This has resulted in a compound annual growth rate of consolidated revenues greater than 10.3% over the past decade and an average unadjusted operating margin above 6.6%. HSIC is broken down into two segments, Health Care Distribution (96.6% of sales) and Technology (3.4% of sales). However, it is more useful to break the company down further into the following categories:Dental Products (51.9% of revenues, 8.7% 10-year CAGR) - HSIC estimates an available global market of $20 billion, of which it holds 35%+, 20%+, and 30% market share in North America, Europe, and Australia/New Zealand respectively. This segment is primarily influenced by growing and aging populations, demand of preventive and specialty dentistry, demand for infection control products, and percentage of the population covered by dental insurance. This segment has remained fairly stable as a percentage of total sales over the past decade and sells a high percentage of consumable products (40%+ of the category). Primary competition in this segment comes from Patterson Companies (NASDAQ:PDCO) and Benco Dental Supply (private).Animal Health Products (27.9% of revenues, 33% 10-year CAGR) - HSIC estimates an available global market of $10 billion, of which it holds the top spot by market share in North America, Europe, and Australia/New Zealand. This segment is primarily influenced by the number of households with companion pets, herd sizes of livestock, and growth in demand for preventative and advanced veterinary care. This segment has grown from 4.3% of company revenues to nearly 28% over the past decade, as management correctly recognized this as a potential growth segment. Primary competition in this segment include Patterson Companies and AmerisourceBergen (NYSE:ABC).Medical Products (16.8% of revenues, 2.9% 10-year CAGR) - HSIC estimates that it holds the #2 spot at 20% of this $9-$10 billion North American market. The segment includes revenues from pharmaceuticals, vitamins, vaccines, surgical products, diagnostic test, infection control products, and various types of equipment. The Medical Products segment has shrunk from one-third of revenues a decade ago, to less than 17% now. This segment is primarily influenced by increases in healthcare utilization, a growing and aging population, increased utilization of non-acute and alternate care settings, and reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and other medical treatments and services. Primary competition in this segment includes recently divested Patterson Medical.Software and Value-Added Products (3.4% of revenues, 15.7% CAGR) - This segment includes practice management software distributed to dental, veterinary, and medical health providers. In addition, this segment provides financial services such as financing for equipment, patient financing, collection services, payment processing, and consulting. Though it is largely viewed as a small segment consisting of add-on products and services, this fast growing segment provides 14% of operating income due to its high margins and provides a steady stream of recurring revenue as well as valuable points of contact with customers. In addition, the company's practice management solutions enjoys adoption by 40% and 50% of U.S. dental and animal health practices respectively.Consolidated revenue profile:Investment ThesisAs the company's geographical diversification continues, revenues should continue to grow. However, this also comes with the already discussed costs of acquisitions and the requisite risks that come with international operations. Implications for valuation: high revenue growth via high reinvestment rate.RisksValuation and PricingEven when a company has consistently high growth, strong returns, and operates in what amounts to be an oligopolistic industry structure, a company's value and stock price must still be considered when making investing decisions. After all, even if you love the company and its past returns, that does not justify overpaying for shares. In order to form a justifiable opinion, I used a perpetual growth discounted free cash flow model and two relative pricing methods to convert Henry Schein's investment thesis and risks into numbers and derive a reasonable market price for shares. Here, I will elaborate on my methods, primary assumptions, and what influenced my judgments on each.Intrinsic ValuationFor the intrinsic valuation of HSIC, I used a three-stage (growth, transition, and growing perpetuity) discounted free cash flow to the firm model. The company's operating cash flows were valued as a going concern and discounted back at an estimated cost of capital. Cash was added back, and debt, capitalized operating leases, employee options, and minority interests were subtracted out to arrive at a total value of equity. Total equity value was then divided by the current total number of shares outstanding to arrive at a value per share.Base Year Inputs and AdjustmentsAs a medical products distributor, HSIC has, expectedly, shown very little revenue or operating margin cyclicality. There has been, however, some lumpiness in the use of restructuring to right-size the company, secondary to the multitude of acquisitions over the years. Therefore, operating margins were normalized for these recurring ""one-time"" charges. In addition, I also normalized acquisitions over a 10-year period and added it to capex due to those acquisitions being a significant part of HSIC's reinvestment strategy and current business mix. Beyond that, the only other item that I adjusted was the capitalization of operating leases, as they are, after all, interest bearing contractual obligations with corresponding long-term assets.Cost of Capital (as of 10/5/15)For many practitioners, deriving the cost of capital, or discount rate, is a menial task requiring only the use of a generic, intuitive, historical, or outsourced number. However, as the discount rate can have a substantial impact on valuation, I prefer to spend a fair amount of time on this component in order to add forward-looking granularity and specificity to the process. That said, I use a modified, forward-looking CAPM, which is far from perfect and is not to be taken as an exact science or precise number. It is, after all, only one potential tool in this process.With that disclaimer in mind, I used the following process to find the market-neutral cost of capital: First, for the cost of equity, I derived a market-implied risk premium based on normalized existing cash flows (market dividends and buybacks), current risk-free rate, and current top-down projected growth of market earnings. In addition, I added a country risk spread for the revenues derived from outside of mature markets (defined as countries without a AAA rating).Next, I used a bottom-up business beta from comparable companies within the medical products industry and levered the beta to HSIC's own adjusted debt-to-equity ratio. The reason for the business beta is twofold: 1) standard regression betas contain large standard errors rendering them close to useless on a standalone basis, and 2) HSIC's business mix has continually evolved over the regression period. Multiplying the equity risk premium by the computed beta and adding it to the risk-free rate sums up to a total cost of equity.Because HSIC is not currently rated by any of the major ratings agencies, I had to estimate a synthetic rating for the cost of debt. I based the synthetic rating on the interest coverage ratio and S&P's Credit Scenario Builder. I then used this synthetic rating (NYSEARCA:AAA) to find an average option-adjusted risk spread over the risk-free rate. Although this is obviously an imperfect solution, I believe it is better to make an educated, data-based estimation than to simply make up a rating or cost of debt. Cost of equity and cost of debt are then weighted according to the market values of each, resulting in a total cost of capital of 7.11%. Shown below are the calculations.Revenue Growth and Target Operating MarginsBy definition, sustainable growth of operating income can come from one of two places (or both): efficiency gains, and income from new investments (including businesses, products, etc.). Higher margins and the ability to create more revenues from existing assets are both efficiency gains reflected in return on capital improvements. Investments in new products, services, or other assets using internal or external capital are reflected in a company's reinvestment rate. Mathematically, this means growth is a function of return on investment and reinvestment rate. Growth cannot be obtained without affecting these two variables.As mentioned, Henry Schein has been able to maintain consistent margins over a long period of time due largely to its size, scope, and ability to pass through costs. This positioning has also allowed the company to maintain efficiency in the amount of revenue produced from each additional dollar of invested capital. If the company is able to consolidate distributors and suppliers further and create cost synergies, margins could drift higher. However, this may be offset in the long term by growing competition and increased pricing power from consolidating customers. Therefore, I am maintaining normalized operating earnings (including normalized restructuring costs) and assuming an average, adjusted return on invested capital of 14.5% over the next 5 years. During that same period, I am assuming a reinvestment rate close to the normalized historical rate, albeit smoothed significantly, to a constant 46.86%.The length of the growth phase is obviously difficult to predict, but because I normalized over a 10-year period, I modeled 10 years going forward. Consequently, this growth period is also supported by the advantages HSIC currently enjoys due to the market structure. Based on return on invested capital and reinvestment rate, I am assuming five years of roughly 6.8% compound annual growth, followed by a five-year taper towards a steady state. Although this is significantly lower than analysts' estimates of EPS growth greater than 10%, three things must be kept in mind: 1) Analysts' growth guidance applies to earnings per share, not operating earnings. As the company has plans to repurchase a total of $200-$300 million worth of shares for the full year, per share numbers will increase faster than total operating earnings. 2) My projected operating earnings growth is a smoothed out growth rate which has been normalized for acquisitions and restructuring over a decade. Quarter to quarter and year to year, actual growth is likely to be more much more volatile than a normalized pattern. 3) I made a decision to count the entire amount of goodwill towards book equity, and therefore return on capital. The case could be made that part of goodwill is accounted for by future growth and high returns cannot be expected in the short term. I admit this is a potentially valid argument for a company that grows through acquisitions. Had I adjusted for this reasoning, return on capital would have been 18% and calculated growth would have been 8.5% (still well below 10%).Terminal InputsIn traditional DCF valuations, the terminal value carries much of the weight. However, if discipline is maintained, there are substantial caps that keep the terminal value from getting out of control and over-inflating (or deflating) the valuation. Mathematically, for instance, a perpetual growth rate for any individual company cannot exceed the growth rate of the overall economy. Empirically, the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond is a more accurate proxy for the long-term nominal growth rate than economists' projections. Though it's still not perfect, it's better than simply making up a number. Because spending on medical products (in particular consumable medical products) is likely to maintain pace with the overall economy, I further assume it is likely that long-term growth for Henry Schein will roughly match the overall economy. Therefore, I used a perpetual growth rate matching the projected GDP growth rate.Far more important than the perpetual growth rate are the perpetual cost of capital and return on capital assumptions. For cost of capital, I assumed partial reversion to the mean, moved the equity risk premium to the long term, adjusted the geometric average (U.S.) of 4.6%, and increased the existing country risk spread based on the assumption that the company will increase revenues from overseas. I increased the current beta of .92 to .94 as global diversification and increased size should further stabilize long-term volatility, partially offset by taking on more debt. I also assumed an increased debt ratio of 30%, based on the company's demonstrated preference for share repurchases as a means to return cash to shareholders and based on a capital structure analysis finding that the company is currently undercapitalized. For the cost of debt, I dropped the current debt rating by one notch, reflecting increased debt, and applied the current AA rated debt risk spread to the halfway point between the current 10-year treasury rate and long-term median interest rate of the U.S. 10-year government bond (3.86%). Additionally, I used a long-term marginal tax rate of 35%, as, again, the company plans to earn an increased proportion of revenues from outside of the United States. This resulted in a total, after-tax cost of capital in perpetuity of 5.89%.In perpetuity, I believe that the oligopolies that exist in the medical supply space coupled with existing, stable, long-term relationships with customers allows Henry Schein to maintain a slight excess return on capital versus its cost of capital. Therefore, I assumed some margin compression and reduced sales/capital efficiency over the long term and let the return on capital decline to 8.85%.Cleaning UpIn addition to valuing the operating assets of HSIC, I needed to clean up for employee stock options and minorities interests. Because options represent both an equity claim and future cost to the company, I subtracted their aggregate value from the operating value of the company. I used a modified Black-Scholes method, data from the company's 2014 10-K, and sourced volatility and interest rates for the calculation. In addition, I needed to subtract minority interests from the total equity value. Because I did not have access to subsidiaries' full financials, I had to use a book multiple to estimate the market value of minority interests. In this case, I used the group median of 3.21x book, leading to an estimated value of $8.4 million.My final intrinsic value for Henry Schein's equity after adding back cash and subtracting debt, capitalized lease obligations, and the value of employee options and minority interests is $10.5 billion, or $125.61/share. Alternatively, for those that feel I should have used the reduced goodwill approach, the value would have been $11.7 billion, or $140.39/share.PricingRelative pricing (aka pricing multiples) is different than valuation in the sense that pricing is based on similar assets or something else external to the company, while valuation is based on the risk-adjusted cash flows of the company itself. Both methods are useful, depending on the perspective that you take. For example, if you take the perspective of buying shares to later ""flip"" to some other buyer, pricing is more relevant. Conversely, if you take the perspective of ownership in the company, valuation is more relevant.For relative pricing, I used two methods. In the first, I used HSIC's own historical high and low P/E ranges over the past 10 years, and multiplied the median values of each range by a weighted average forward EPS estimate. The estimate is based on the current analysts' ranges in order to reduce my own bias and to introduce current market expectations into the process.The second pricing method was necessarily more rigorous than the historical P/E range. In this method, I used a multiple regression analysis designed to control for fundamental differences across comparable companies (as opposed to the opinion-based or single variable-based multiple applications you are likely to see elsewhere). In this method, I compared various price ratios (P/E, P/S, EV/EBITDA, etc.) and inputs (growth, operating margins, return on equity, etc.), and was able to identify which factors were most important to the overall market in pricing the comparable companies. For HSIC, I used a fairly narrow scope comp group composed of medical and dental suppliers. The data showed that the price/book ratio was primarily tied to trailing 12-month net margins, return on equity, debt/total capital, and relative volatility. Although I attempted to apply this technique to different multiples with different fundamentals, none had as much predictive power as the price-to-book ratio within this particular group.In the weighting of the different pricing methods, I gave the regression-based method a higher weight than the historical P/E, because the regression partially controls for current, real differences across firms. In addition, I gave the higher historical P/E more weight than the lower median P/E to contrast my valuation judgment.ImplicationsHenry Schein is a well-run company in a strong competitive position in several favorable markets. Further, the company's earnings are resilient in the face of economic downturns while also maintaining a very respectable growth rate over many years. Though the company has room for further growth, it is not entirely without risks. In addition, investors and traders seem to be pricing the stock for near perfect execution. Based on current information, market data, and my own assumptions, HSIC shares appear to be overvalued, but fairly priced in relative terms. At the right price, this is a company I would like to own. And if I currently held shares, I would not be overly concerned with slight overvaluation. That being said, based on my own risk tolerance and other available opportunities, I will wait until the market presents a better price."
3139256,25120,2015-05-06T06:07:15-04:00,"Henry Schein has seen a solid start to the year as underlying growth has been offset by a strong dollar.The diversified business model and exposure to growing and stable margin businesses make it a great company.While the company is certainly very attractive for investors, a 25 times earnings multiple seems a bit too rich.Given the potential risk for multiple compression, I would be very cautious at current levels.","Investors in Henry Schein (NASDAQ:HSIC) are pleased with the first quarter results. While the company saw its revenues and earnings increase just slightly compared to last year, the underlying organic growth performance has been very solid.This solid pace of organic growth and stable margins have made shares very desirable for investors. This means that investors perceive an investment to be of low risk, as they are willing to pay a huge multiple for the business. A low risk business is not necessarily a low risk investment. The high current valuation multiples could compress in case earnings growth is lagging, leaving shareholders vulnerable to negative returns even if underlying earnings keep increasing.Given this current situation, I remain very cautious in the short-to-medium term, not seeing much room for further valuation multiple expansion.A Very Diversified BusinessHenry Schein is very diversified business which operates in a range of very stable and slow growing industries. The company is the largest global dental distributor while it is a leading distributor of animal health products as well. The company is furthermore active in the human physician and alternate care distribution market as well.The company has over a million customers in the form of practitioners which creates great diversification. The exposure to these diversified segments and the necessity of these goods make the company very resilient to adverse economic conditions. The company has shown and is expected to show continued growth amidst the growth of the global middle class and consolidation. These long-term trends continue to create long-term tailwinds for the business.Strong Start To The YearHenry Schein reported a 1.4% increase in its first quarter revenues which came in at $2.46 billion. Like most companies with large overseas operations, the company has been hit by the impact of a strong dollar.These currency headwinds resulted in a 6.0% reduction in first quarter sales. This headwind is quite strong considering that just 34% of first quarter sales have been derived outside of North America. The company reported a massive 15.2% headwind from a strong dollar, notably against the euro.This implies that constant currency growth has been very solid at 7.4%. Acquisitions added 2.6% to revenue growth as organic growth of 4.8% has been very strong as well.All of the company's three health care divisions reported solid growth in terms of organic sales growth. The smaller medical segment reported organic growth of 11.6% in constant currency terms, posting sales of $443.5 million. The results were aided by the collaboration with Cardinal Health (NYSE:CAH).The animal health business reported a 4.5% increase in organic sales, which rose to little over $684 million. Further growth is anticipated in the near term following the acquisition of scil animal healthcare, which will add $83 million to annual sales.The largest dental segment reported a mere 2.7% increase in organic sales, although actual revenues fell to $1.25 billion following the impact of the stronger dollar.The Margin PictureHenry Schein reported gross margins of 29.0% for the first quarter, a 30 basis point improvement compared to the year before. Operating expenses came in at 22.1% of sales which marks a 10 basis point improvement compared to the year before.The modest increase in the reported sales and 40 basis point improvement in the cost structure have boosted the operating earnings of the firm. These modest improvements have been offset by a $6.9 million restructuring charge, resulting in largely flattish profit developments.Net earnings increased by 1.3% to $103.4 million. Share repurchases allowed the company to increase its reported earnings by four cents to $1.22 per share.Premium ValuationHenry Schein is posting very stable revenues and earnings, allowing the company to operate with a bit of debt. The company held $59 million in cash at the end of the quarter while the debt position totaled $832 million. This results in a net debt position of little over $770 million, less than 1 times annual EBITDA.The 85 million shares now trade at $142 per share following the earnings release. This values equity in the company at $12.1 billion.The company is maintaining its full-year outlook which calls for adjusted earnings of $5.90 to $6.00 per share. This marks an 8-10% increase compared to the year before. This non-GAAP earnings estimate excludes restructuring charges of $0.29 to $0.33 per share. Revenues could easily come in at $10.5 billion, assuming a modest increase in reported revenues.Equity in Henry Schein is now trading at 1.15 times sales while shares trade at 23-24 times non-GAAP earnings. Based on GAAP estimates, the company trades at 25-26 times earnings.A Very Desired InvestmentHenry Schein has been a very stable and solidly growing business. The company has increased its sales by a cumulative 130% over the past decade. This translates into sales growth of nearly 9% per year.This sales growth has been driven by organic revenue growth as well as $1.7 billion worth of bolt-on acquisitions in recent years. On top of this, Henry Schein made organic capital investments of half a billion, offset by a billion in depreciation and amortization charges.This means that ""net"" investments have been just $1.2 billion over the past decade. Despite these relative modest investments, the company has been able to more than double its revenues. This spending has been relatively modest in relation to the $3 billion in cumulative earnings being reported over the same time period.Given the large growth opportunities, the company continues to invest into the business and buy back shares rather than paying out regular dividends. Over the past decade, the company has bought back $1.3 billion worth of shares. Given the strong returns witnessed in recent years, this has arguably been a good use of cash.Too Much Has Been Priced InInvestors like the steady growth of the company, combined with very stable operating margins. As a result, investors have been bidding up the valuation of the company to roughly 25 times earnings. Shares have increased by a factor of 4 since the aftermath of the recession as shares have risen 30% from the October lows.Investors like the company for the combination of both growth and predictable earnings. This made shares a very nice long-term investment. Patience is required as the company is not paying out dividends as the valuation is steep at 25 times earnings. Even if the company sticks to its model to report 4-5% organic growth which is complemented by small bolt-on acquisitions, I see little expansion for valuation multiples to go higher.Shares now trade at historical high earnings multiples at around 25 times. This is far above the ten-year average range of 15-25 times earnings. This means that future price appreciation is likely to match earnings per share growth at best, assuming that multiples will not increase any further. A modest compression in the valuation multiples could easily result in negative returns or a stagnant share price development for quite a long time.As a result, I see potential for valuation multiple compression, potentially being driven by a hike in interest rates. While it is very likely that multiples can remain constant, I simply do not see much room for multiple expansion. This makes me quite cautious at current levels as the risk-reward is not appealing in my eyes with few catalysts anticipated in the coming period."
3771036,94696,2015-12-22T09:38:46-05:00,Recession Resilient Business.Generates a lot of excess cash.Dominant in its niches.,"Here are 7 great reasons to own this wonderful business1. Earnings over timeWhile the earnings growth rate has slowed from its historical 15%, Henry Schein (NASDAQ:HSIC) has a tremendous resiliency through the cycle. There is certainly something to be said for a company that 1) avoids losing money in a recession and 2) grows earnings through it.The company introduced 2016 EPS guidance of $6.55 - $6.65 the midpoint of which would represent 11% growth over 2015 EPS guidance of $5.90 - $5.96. The company has been fighting against the current as the U.S. Dollar continues to appreciate, namely versus the Euro. Foreign revenues represent 36% of total.2. Low Capital IntensityOperating in highly recurring markets, Henry Schein's business requires only a modest amount of capital expenditures (<15%) of operating cash flow to sustain and grow sales and achieve modest organic earnings growth. With only 75% utilization of distribution centers, the company should be able to continue avoiding any outsized investments.3. Lots of Money for ShareholdersSince 2010, the company has returned more than a billion of that cash flow to shareholders in the form of share repurchases. The company's clean balance sheet (less than 1x debt/ EBITDA) continues to allow them to offset the ongoing currency headwind with share repurchases. Most recently, they announced a new $400 million buyback.*After exercising stock options4. Lots of Money for AcquisitionsManagement has balanced cash returns to shareholders with tuck-in acquisitions. As HSIC is the often the only bidder for acquisitions, it avoids over-paying or competitive bids.The domestic market for Veterinary and Dental supply is, for the most part, pretty much consolidated (and difficult from a regulatory standpoint for HSIC to get much higher than its current 35% share) leaving the Medical segment and International expansion as the primary candidates for shareholder capital. This year they acquired an 85% interest in Jorgen Kruise, a leading distributor of veterinary supplies in Denmark, Norway and Sweden with sales of $90 million.In 2014, they bought a dental practice management software company in France and distributors of central products in France, Netherlands and Belgium from Arseus. In total, this added $97 million of annual sales. They also bought 80% of a distributor of animal products in Poland with $80 million in sales and a 60% interest in a U.S. equine supplement and horse supply companyIn the medical segment, the addition of Cardinal Health's (NYSE:CAH) physician office business is a near-term boost to results and should add $300 million of sales. With only 20% share and McKesson (NYSE:MCK) as their primary competitor for acquisitions, the company should continue to be active acquiring here.5. Barriers to EntryIt's network on distribution centers and broad customer network in the animal health, dental and medical is nearly impossible to replicate. It would take years for any potential competitor to build the supplier and customer relationships let alone prove to suppliers they can successfully grow share and product sales as well as Henry Schein. Or meet Henry Steins ability to deliver 99% of their products on the same day they were ordered.Hence why AmerisourceBergen (NYSE:ABC) bought MWI Veterinary supply instead of building their own business organically leaving Patterson as their only independent competitor for their two primary end markets, Dental and Veterinary.6. Fragmented Customer BaseThe end-markets for Henry Schein are very fragmented. With over a million customers, many of which are small businesses, no one customer represents a significant risk to sales.The last trait is somewhat unique amongst healthcare distributors. Consider the issues McKesson is facing or that at last fiscal year end, WBA was 30% of AmerisourceBergen's sales and CVS (NYSE:CVS) was 27% of Cardinal Health's sales. While these pharmacies are strategic partners for their respective distributor (either through JV or equity interest), it's a substantial amount of sales tied to one customer.7. Acquisition TargetA couple factors suggest that Henry Schein could one day be acquired:The one big hurdle at the moment is the huge PE multiple difference between the larger distributors and HSIC - a gap that has reached roughly 8 points.SummaryI've written previously about my preference for stable businesses with low debt on the balance sheet. It provides a lot of options for shareholders, especially if a company hit's a rough patch. HSIC is another great business that falls in this category. I'll continue my hunt for more like these and if you have any suggestions, I'd love to hear in the comments below!"
1536192,23502,2013-07-05T17:52:03-04:00,,"By Michael WaterhouseWe have upgraded Henry Schein (NASDAQ:HSIC) and Patterson Companies (NASDAQ:PDCO) to wide-moat companies thanks to their strong competitive advantages in the dental and veterinary distribution markets. As critical intermediaries between a highly fragmented base of customers and suppliers that depend on their scale and customer services, Schein and Patterson possess competitive advantages that support a long time frame of attractive returns on capital, in our view. We also think the high out-of-pocket dental and vet markets will sustain consistent midsingle-digit growth over the long term. Both stocks are trading close to our fair value estimates of $99 and $39 for Schein and Patterson, respectively, and while valuations don't currently suggest attractive entry points for either firm, we think investors should keep these names on their watch lists.Schein and Patterson are both major players in the dental, animal health, and medical distribution markets. For the most part, Schein and Patterson are extremely similar, particularly in their dental and animal health distribution segments. As distributors, these companies are key middlemen between customers and suppliers, guaranteeing timely delivery of consumable products, equipment, and services. Typical products handled by these firms include lab products, pharmaceuticals, vaccines, surgical tools, diagnostic tests, infection control items, vitamins, dentist chairs, and X-ray machines. Customer services include software products, IT networking and support, training and education courses, consulting and brokerage services, and equipment installation, maintenance, and repair. Each company also possesses smaller medical distribution segments. Schein's medical business distributes vaccines, pharmaceuticals, surgical products, and other consumables and equipment to physicians' offices and ambulatory surgery centers. Patterson's medical distribution segment specializes in equipment and suppliers for rehabilitation clinics. Dental, animal health, and medical revenue make up approximately 55%, 27%, and 17% for Schein, and 65%, 21%, and 15% for Patterson, respectively.A few differences do exist between the two companies, including equipment offerings, geographic footprints, and capital allocation strategies. Each company also participates in different medical distribution markets. For example, Schein has international operations, a greater exposure to large group customers like corporations and universities, and a more aggressive acquisition strategy. Patterson operates only in the U.S., focuses only on small independent customers, and makes less frequent acquisitions.Dental and animal health markets support stable growth opportunities. Unlike most other segments of the health-care industry, the dental and animal health markets possess higher out-of-pocket payments. Out-of-pocket spending makes up approximately 50% of U.S. dental market expenditure and essentially all U.S. pet spending. While these markets are therefore more exposed to discretionary spending and economic cycles, we think both segments can sustain relatively stable midsingle-digit growth over the long term. An aging population, the growing importance of cosmetic dentistry, rising discretionary spending on pet care, and the greater adoption of technology among practitioners maintain growth opportunities for the distributors. Growth has slowed since the recession, but we expect it will recover as the economy gains steam, unemployment improves, and consumer spending rises.We derive Schein's and Patterson's wide moats from four key characteristics. The following table summarizes our moat framework for Schein and Patterson along four key and interrelated factors -- customer and supplier fragmentation, distributor market share concentration, distribution network scale, and switching costs from value-add services. Following the table is a brief discussion of each item's contribution to Schein and Patterson's competitive advantages that should sustain economic profits over the long term.Source: Morningstar.Customer and supplier fragmentation: Schein and Patterson are critical intermediaries between a highly fragmented base of customers and suppliers, which we think contributes to greater pricing power for the distributors. The U.S. dental and vet markets include a customer base of nearly 186,000 dentists and 63,000 veterinarians, the majority of which are sole practitioners. Schein and Patterson face more consolidated customers in their smaller medical segments, but both companies attempt to focus on more fragmented areas of the market. Schein focuses on clinics and physician groups with limited exposure to hospitals or pharmacies. Patterson's medical segment is solely focused on rehabilitation clinics.Schein and Patterson also face an industry of fragmented suppliers. While their supplier base is not nearly as fragmented as the dental and vet customers, we nonetheless think the distributors hold a reasonable amount of leverage over dental consumable and equipment manufacturers. No supplier contributes to more than 8% of either company's total revenue, by our estimate. Manufacturers in dental equipment appear more consolidated, but fragmented competition exists in dental consumables, which makes up nearly 80% of the total dental market. We estimate that the top eight dental consumable suppliers, both in the general practitioner and specialty segments of the dental market, contribute to just over 50% of the market.Much of the animal health supplier segment is also fragmented. Market share in the animal health pharmaceuticals market is fairly well dispersed among Big Pharma companies and numerous smaller players. We estimate that the remainder of the animal health market, such as nutrition, equipment and surgical supplies, and diagnostics, is even more fragmented. For example, reference labs Idexx Laboratories (NASDAQ:IDXX) and VCA Antech (NASDAQ:WOOF) each holds approximately 8% and 7% market share, respectively, in the pet diagnostics market, by our estimate. In each distributor's medical segments, we estimate supplier concentration is also relatively fragmented.Large distributor market share: We think concentrated distributor market share combined with fragmented customer and supplier market share helps ensure additional pricing power for Schein and Patterson. These companies are the only two national distributors in the dental distribution market with over 70% domestic market share followed by about 15 regional and numerous local players. In the companion animal health segment, Schein and Patterson also contend with MWI Veterinary supply, all three companies accounting for approximately 90% of the domestic market, by our estimate. The following table shows our market share estimates by company and geography.Source: Company filings, Morningstar.Network scale: The scale and efficiency of Schein and Patterson's distribution network support lower operating costs and greater salesforce efficiency than smaller peers, in our view, therefore making the scale and scope of their operations difficult for competitors to imitate. Patterson estimates that dentists source approximately 40% of their purchases through their top distributor, while veterinarians purchase approximately 80% of supplies through two distributors. Schein and Patterson ship a large portion of their products to a loyal practitioner base, but based on the market share numbers, we think these two companies interact with nearly every dentist or veterinarian in some capacity. Some regional competitors might hold concentrated market share in specific markets, but Schein and Patterson's national breadth are unmatched. Since most of Schein and Patterson's competition consists of private companies, accurate numbers are difficult to ascertain, but we doubt smaller competitors possess Schein and Patterson's salesforce productivity. Thanks to the scale of these companies' operations, we imagine Schein and Patterson post higher sales and operating profit per sales representative than smaller peers, which are therefore at a relative disadvantage of extracting value from their customer base. Consolidated warehousing and distribution operations also help maintain low overhead costs. Patterson distributes most of its segment products through shared warehouses, while Schein's vet distribution warehouses are mostly separate.Switching costs: We believe Schein and Patterson's services, which include practice management software, network integration, and equipment installation, maintenance, and repair, retain high levels of customer loyalty. These services provide integral support for independent dental and veterinary business owners who lack the resources to handle more complex tasks, such as integrating various technology platforms or installing and servicing equipment. Schein and Patterson aim to become indispensable partners with their customers by providing critical back-office support. Combined with customer loyalty programs, few regional competitors or industry suppliers can match the level of Schein and Patterson's entrenched customer service relationships, in our opinion.Moat trends are relatively stable in the vet and dental distribution markets.We give both Schein and Patterson stable moat trends. Below we discuss the major influences on the competitive advantages for these firms.Risk of customer concentration: Large group practices probably account for about 10% of the dental market, with limited potential for additional consolidation in the dental and vet markets, in our opinion. Unlike more complex and capital intensive hospitals, for example, we believe there are greater economic incentives for dentists and veterinarians to remain small business owners. The dental and vet markets are characterized by less complex procedures and simpler out-of-pocket payments, which reduces the advantage of consolidation. Unlike Patterson, Schein does carry a higher proportion of customers among large group practices and schools, which may pressure pricing somewhat. In comparison with the overall business, these more concentrated buyers still represent a significant minority to Schein's overall business, and the incremental margin on these higher-volume accounts likely remains attractive.Risk of supplier concentration: We expect limited supplier concentration. While innovation in the dental and animal health markets is driven by a handful of industry leaders like Dentsply (NASDAQ:XRAY), Danaher (NYSE:DHR), and 3M (NYSE:MMM), we imagine that barriers to entry in older and more commoditized products are low enough to allow a multitude of new entrants. While the dental industry shift to more complex digital equipment could potentially consolidate a greater portion of suppliers, such as Patterson's exclusive licensing agreement with Sirona, we still believe Schein and Patterson's large domestic sales and distribution networks give them the upper hand with suppliers. Furthermore, growing equipment complexity in these fields would probably place greater demand on distributor services, which could increase overall switching costs.Sales channel disruptions: The growing shift of pet flea and tick health-care products through traditional retail channels is our primary concern for the vet distribution segment. Seasonal flea and tick parasiticides make up a limited portion of these company's operations, approximately 10% of vet segment sales, by our estimate. Most of the animal health market, such as vaccines and diagnostics, will not follow parasiticides into over-the-counter store shelves, and we also believe that a significant portion of flea and tick sales will remain in the vet sales channel. Schein and Patterson hope to significantly increase the importance of diagnostics, digital technology, equipment, and services in the veterinary market to expand segment profitability and help circumvent headwinds in the flea and tick market.Competitor market share gains: From our perspective, we think Schein and Patterson are likely taking market share from their smaller competitors, and we don't see any significant threats to their market dominance. Acquisitions also remain a central focus of each company's growth strategy, which should continue to accrue market share. Schein ships approximately 120,000 packages per day, and these small but frequent consumable sales to fragmented customers help dissuade suppliers from circumventing the distributors with direct shipments. In equipment, supporting IT integration and repair services is a significant hurdle for suppliers as well. While other large-scale retailers, such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), could enter certain commoditized dental consumables, we think Schein and Patterson's services, especially with marketing new products and handling equipment, are irreplaceable by online-only mass retailers. Thanks to thin operating margins in these distribution markets, price discounting for new entrants to gain market share seems like a relatively limited tactic, in our opinion.Capital allocation in medical distribution segments: Schein and Patterson have carved out less of a moat in their medical segments, in our view. While returns in these segments seem healthy for now, greater customer concentration, lower distributor market share, and indirect exposure to reimbursement pressure could depress profitability. While we don't necessarily expect management to divest these less attractive operations, we're more skeptical of capital deployment in these segments.Wide moats steer our free cash flow and return on capital projections.Our fair value estimates for Schein and Patterson are $99 and $39, respectively, which imply forward price/earnings and enterprise values/EBITDA multiples of approximately 20 times and 11 times, respectively. Thanks to improving economic conditions, we forecast mid-single-digit internal growth in the U.S. bolstered slightly by additional market share gains and additional revenue from acquisitions. Faster growth in the lower-margin veterinary segment will remain a slight drag on margin expansion, but we predict Schein and Patterson can continue to gradually improve profitability, largely driven by greater operating leverage as top-line growth improves. We also imagine profitability in each company's vet segments will improve as diagnostics, equipment, and services become greater contributors to this segment's operations. For both companies, we believe mid-teen returns on capital are sustainable over the long term."
4127812,52932,2017-11-27T10:12:24-05:00,Henry Schein commands huge market share in its two largest business segments.The company's revenue is highly diversified.A recent drop in the stock has shares looking attractively valued.,"The healthcare industry is one of the most expansive in the world as it houses various types of companies. It's an industry that is naturally very closely tied to government regulation and interference which can result in volatile price swings as new legislative measures are proposed and sometimes implemented. Health insurers and drug manufacturers are two kinds of healthcare companies that come to mind as being particularly impacted by Washington. An often overlooked sub-sector within healthcare that is a little less volatile is the medical supplies industry. The logic there is that regardless of what lawmakers have to say, doctors will still need certain items to provide care. Of course, regulatory change will have an impact, but the effect it would have would certainly be mitigated. This brings me to Henry Schein (NASDAQ:HSIC), a globally diversified medical supply company with a focus on dentists and animal care facilities as well as general medical practices. The company has been growing its top line at a high single-digits rate for the last few years which has caused some swings in the stock but overall Henry Schein has been very stable considering not only its growth rate but also the industry it operates in. The 5-year chart of HSIC shows a clear uptrend as well as limited volatility:HSIC data by YChartsAnother eye-catching aspect of this chart is the recent sharp downturn that sent the stock from around $90/share to approximately $70/share, where it currently trades. There was a slight earnings miss in Q3, but other than that there weren't any massive negative events that have occurred to justify the more than 20% fall in shares. Henry Schein remains a strong company and an interesting prospect for investors. HSIC has targeted somewhat niche markets in healthcare in the form of dental and animal care and has commanding market share in both (images retrieved from the company's 3Q 2017 Earnings Presentation:Henry Schein's position in the dental market is an extremely valuable lever that the company can continue to pull in its attempt to continue its revenue trajectory. In 2016, dental sales totaled $5.6 billion (48% of total revenue) in a market that has a total value of $20 billion, according to estimates by HSIC. So far in 2017 Henry Schein's dental segment has generated revenue of $4.37 billion, an increase of 9.2% year-over-year. Extrapolating that growth rate forward for the whole of 2017 would result in $6.1 billion in revenue. This growth rate is in line with the high-single digit growth that the overall company has been enjoying in the recent past. In order to fuel this future growth, the company's strategy is comprised of six pillars:HSIC finds itself in a unique position with regard to these growth objectives due to its huge market share. The stronghold that Henry Schein has on the dental supply market can allow it to try various new initiatives within these six categories without risking high client attrition due to its very high supplier power. With the overall market being valued at $20 billion by the company, I expect dental revenue to continue its ascension.The animal health segment at Henry Schein is smaller than its dental segment by approximately 41%; sales in 2016 totaled $3.3 billion. The same year-to-date analysis I did for dental revenues shows that animal health revenues have grown 7.1% over the first nine months of 2017. Full year 2017 animal health revenues will be $3.5 billion if the growth rate were to remain the same. The company projects the total animal health market to be $10 billion and many of the advantages Henry Schein enjoys in its dental segment stemming from market share are also applicable in the animal health segment. Company estimates put the combined total value of these markets at $30 billion, leaving $20.4 billion in sales that HSIC can target. Granted, it is unlikely the company will ever be responsible for every dollar of revenue in the global dental and animal health markets but the opportunity is massive for the company to significantly grow its top line.Another appealing aspect of Henry Schein's business model is its revenue diversification. HSIC has diversification both in product and geography, which for any company is paramount. This of course protects the company in a wide variety of circumstances and gives it a platform to continue its revenue growth on a consolidated basis, even if there is an unexpected headwind that hurts sales growth in a particular region or product market. The image below details the company's 2016 revenue breakdown both by product and geography:The company's international operations certainly have some ground to make up in order to reduce the risk of a downturn in North America. Fortunately these numbers will begin to converge as sales outside of North America will be growing at a faster rate.One positive resulting from the recent drop in the stock is that it has created a much more appealing valuation. The table below shows EPS estimates and the corresponding price/earnings ratio for the next three years. Estimates are from the Wall Street Journal and $70/share was used for P/E calculations.A multiple of 17.9x next years earnings is quite reasonable for a company that dominates the markets its in, has a diversified business, and is growing revenue in the high-single digits. When these figures are put in the context of how HSIC has traded historically, shares look even more inexpensive.HSIC PE Ratio (Forward) data by YChartsHenry Schein provides investors an interesting combination of tremendous market power as well as growth. Its dental and animal health segments will continue to drive overall sales growth as the company uses its market share and scale to create value. I suggest investors take advantage of the temporary drop in shares. There are few signs revenue growth will slow down anytime soon and if the company's 2018 guidance (presumably to be released after the Fourth Quarter Earnings Release) reflects continued sales growth I expect the stock to be trading around where it was in early 2017."

Joe Terranova, in his book ""Buy High Sell Higher,"" posits the strategy that buying high means buying confidence. The strategy is based on the supposition that stocks hitting their highs are not only showing the sentiment of the market but are also showing conviction from investors. One of the first steps in analyzing such a stock is to take a hard look at the fundamentals of the company. Is the stock just hot or does the company have quality assets with solid performance data?Two stocks that have hit 52-week highs in the past 10 days are Henry Schein, Inc. (NASDAQ:HSIC) and Trimble Navigation Limited (NASDAQ:TRMB). Both companies are multinationals and leaders in their respective industry - Henry Schein in the healthcare sector and Trimble in the scientific and technical instruments sector.Henry Schein is the largest provider of healthcare products and services to medical, dental, and veterinary practitioners in 25 countries. It offers an extensive selection of dental supplies, medical supplies, pharmaceuticals, equipment, and even software technology. Henry Schein strives to be a one-stop shop for its customers boasting 90,000+ SKUs in stock with an additional 19,000 SKUs in the veterinary sector. Not resting on providing quantity, quality is also a target measure. Its efficiency in delivery is reflected in its 99.9% order accuracy achievement. Henry Schein's vision is to transition from a pure distribution company to its customer's partner with the common goal of improving the quality of care.Trimble Navigation provides positioning technologies and information to allow its customers to collect, manage, and analyze position and location data for field and mobile workers to improve productivity and ensure safety. Trimble has offices in 30+ countries and sells products to over 141 countries. Positioning is more than a dot on a map; positioning allows worker identification and monitoring as well as the monitoring of asset utilization, fuel consumption, carbon emission and safety compliance. Trimble assists its customers in exploiting the value of bundling software, hardware and services.Henry Schein and Trimble are both increasing revenue year over year. Both are growing net income and earnings per share year over year. Since 2007, Henry Schein's compound annual growth rates (OTC:CAGR) for sales, net income and earnings per share (EPS) are double-digits - 11% for sales and 15% for net income and EPS. Trimble's CAGR for sales over the past five years is 12%. However, neither pay a dividend returning profit to shareholders.So, where's the cash? In the trailing twelve months, Henry Schein earned over $100 in revenue per share. But in the most recent quarter, it has only $1.01 in cash per share. Similarly, Trimble has only $1.12 in cash per share. Seriously, where IS the cash?First of all, both companies rely heavily on acquisitions for growth. Henry Schein has integrated over 50 acquisitions in the eight years since 2005, seven of those in 2012. Trimble has acquired 53 companies since 2005, 10 in 2012, as well as signed agreements for five joint ventures.In the healthcare industry, consolidation is common. Henry Schein's approach to such consolidation is to look for candidates that provide expanding products and services. Its trend has resulted in a continued focus on its core business where expansion complements existing operations and synergies develop with the acquired businesses. Growth since 2007 has been more a result of acquisition than internal growth. Henry Schein intends to continue to take advantage of the consolidation trend and to ensure it is capitalized to execute.Trimble's positioning products and technologies are used in heavy construction, engineering and construction including building information modeling (BIM), mapping and surveying, transportation logistics and agriculture industries. Trimble uses acquisitions to establish a presence in new markets, eliminate gaps in product lines, and add new technologies. Trimble has migrated from its initial business model of providing GPS ""box products"" to the present mentality of providing a portfolio of products and solutions with the goal of enhancing its customer's productivity. Trimble intends to drive growth through this type of acquisition strategy combined with a continued investment in R&D.Through the third quarter of 2012, Henry Schein had spent just over $206 million of its $1,844 million gross profit or 11% on acquisitions. Trimble had spent just over $355 million of its $790 million gross profit or 45%. Even with the abundance of acquisitions, further explanation is warranted to the question ""Where is the cash?"" for both companies.In Henry Schein's case, it has an active stock repurchase program. It originated in 2004 and has had additional authorizations five times since. As of the September 2012 quarterly reporting, Henry Schein has repurchased nearly 13 million shares for $716 million under the program, spending nearly $216 million of the $716 million in the first three quarters of 2012. The total number of shares is a net effect of the repurchases offset by unvested stock and the exercise of options. For example, in the first three quarters of 2012, 2.88 million shares were repurchased but the net decrease was only 1.66 million shares.In Trimble's case, it believes to maintain its competitive advantage, it must invest in research and development. Trimble holds over 1800 patents and focuses on not only developing new products but also enhancing existing products and promoting products for market acceptance. Products are developed or enhanced to improve performance, add features, decrease size or weight, or lower cost. Trimble's average spend on R&D compared with revenue is 12%. Through the third quarter of 2012, R&D spend is 23.5% of gross profit.While 2013 still has a level of uncertainty in regard to world economics and construction hesitancy, Trimble is positioning for growth. Trimble Navigation is forecasting five-year revenue growth at 15%-17% per year by further international expansion and market penetration. It is also expecting to grow operating margins from the current 11+% to 20+% by continuing to transition from just sensors to hardware, software and service solutions.Henry Schein points to the aging population as a major driver of healthcare spending. The industry tends to be recession resistant as well. Besides acquiring new customers, Henry Schein plans to migrate from strictly distribution to providing value-added products and services. It is also utilizing customer loyalty programs to retain and reward valuable customers.Neither Henry Schein and Trimble Navigation have much cash per share. But, both know where its cash IS going. And, both have a track record of growing revenue and a handle on how to continue. As annual reports are published in February, proponents of ""buy high, sell higher"" should consider adding Henry Schein and Trimble Navigation to their reading lists.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1450121,49411,2013-05-21T12:07:46-04:00,,"Henry Schein (NASDAQ:HSIC) is a leading global distributor with business operations in 3 segments: 1) Dental supplies 2) Medical supplies 3) Veterinary supplies. Although the dental supplies business is currently its largest segment, its veterinary supplies business is expanding rapidly as well. The company primarily conducts its business in the US but has been aggressively expanding its international footprint and has been garnering impressive results. Henceforth, this article aims to discuss if the company is worthy of the attention of a long-term investor.Industry studyDental:The aging population around the world is a trend that is known to many. As the number of seniors grows, there will be increasing cases of dental problems which will lead to an increased need for dental services.Besides the aging population, more and more people are coming to the realization of the importance of having a healthy and good looking set of teeth. This has therefore led to increased demand for dental correction services.Lastly, there has been an increasing uptake of dental insurance. With all expenses covered by insurance companies, people became much more motivated to head to the dentists.Healthcare:Similar to the dental trends, health care usage has increased due to the aging population and the implementation of Medicare and Medicaid services.Veterinary:There has been a great increase in pet ownership in the US over the past decade and this trend is expected to continue into the long future. According to APPA, total pet industry expenditures in 2012 amounted to $53.33 Billion, up from $32.4 Billion 10 years ago. With more pet owners now being more concerned with their pet's health, visits to the vet has increased and more supplies are needed.Company StudyFor the distributor business, the wider the selection of products, the more competitive the company becomes. A wide selection of products attracts a large customer base which confers 3 benefits to the company:First, it attracts prominent vendors with better brands and products into its supply chain. With a better selection of products and brands in its portfolio, the company will in turn attract more customers, creating a very virtuous cycle for the company.Secondly, it gives them bargaining power against vendors to lower purchase costs. Such, will help in maintaining margins for the company.Lastly, and the best of all, is the economics of having a larger customer base. As the chances of cross selling are higher in the distributor business, a large customer base becomes a large multiplier for revenues going forward.Hence, for Henry Schein, the company excels in product scope and customer base. As of 2012, the company offers more than 100000 products and has a customer base of nearly 775000 customers. Besides being the largest distributors in dental supply, they are also the largest distributor of healthcare products and services to office-based healthcare practitioners in the combined North American and European markets. Finally, with the addition of Provet Holdings in 2010, Henry Schein is now the animal health distribution market leader on three continents.The best thing about Henry Schein is that it would be very hard to duplicate the competitive advantage of having a large product offering consisting of good brands and good quality products. Most distributors would require vendors with good brands to sign exclusive agreements. As such, most vendors would rather sign on with the distributor with a larger customer base and distribution network instead of a smaller one.Moving on to some financial metrics, the table below compares Henry Schein's important financial ratios between 2 periods.Even though earnings growth and asset turnover may have fallen over the 2 periods compared, it was largely due to the now larger earnings and asset base. However, they are still high compared to many other companies.Besides that, most of the financial metrics can be seen improving.Competitive studyIn the dental and medical supplies segment, Henry Schein faces competition from Patterson Co. (NASDAQ:PDCO) and many other smaller regional distributors. While in the veterinary supplies segment, Henry Schein competes against MWI Veterinary Supply (NASDAQ:MWIV), Patterson Co. and many other smaller regional distributors.HSIC Vs. PDCO Vs. MWIV:Although all companies are similar operationally, Henry Schein is a stronger competitor due to its aggressive global diversification while Patterson and MWI Veterinary are much more focused on the US. Such diversification allows them to find vendors which supply cheaper products with good quality all over the world.Also, with such large coverage gives them a very large customer base. (The benefits of a large customer base are described above). Based on 2012's annual reports, Patterson Co. reportedly only served about 150000 customers as compared to Henry Schein's 775000A comparison of their financial metrics is shown in the table below.As can be seen from the table above, Henry Schein provides better returns and has a better debt position as compared to its competitors. Although it may have a lower earnings growth and asset turnover as compared to MWIV, it would be important to point out that MWIV has a very low starting point (smaller earnings and asset base) as compared to Henry Schein.HSIC Vs. Smaller regional competitors:Besides the larger product scope, Henry Schein also has a wider distribution network. The dental, healthcare and veterinary industries are consolidating and practices with national networks are emerging. To function smoothly, these networks often prefer to do business with distributors with large networks.Furthermore, in recent years, the healthcare industry has been focusing on cost containment. Many small practices have grouped together to form large purchasing groups to negotiate better pricing with distributors. Therefore, a combination of large national practices and purchase groups have put a strain on the finances of many small and regional competitors. As such, many are now seeking to sell their businesses to larger networks. This, in my opinion, is a good trend for the larger distributors like Henry Schein as they get to increase the size of their customer base.ConclusionTo sum things up, Henry Schein would be a very good long-term investment considering the industry trends and its competitive strengths. However, the current price of $94.40 or PE of 21.83 at the closing on 11th May is a little too high.My estimated value for the company is $87.19 or a PE of 20.18. Investors would do well if they were to purchase shares of this company at a price level below this.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

346891,25032,2012-02-07T13:03:00-05:00,,"This article examines Henry Schein, Inc. (NASDAQ:HSIC) from a value investor's perspective. Use this basic information as a starting point to conduct your own due diligence before making any investment decisions about the stock.Fortune 500 member, Henry Schein Inc., is the largest provider of health care products and services to health professional offices, including dental and veterinarian. Its technology segment provides software systems for dental, medical and animal health clinics.The stock is currently trading close to its five-year high. As the chart below shows, the company's stock recovered nicely from the late 2008/early 2009 lows experienced across the market. Although the stock also was affected by late summer and fall volatility, it also retraced back most of its July high share price of $74.98. The stock was trading at around $71 at the end of January 2012, approximately 21 percent higher than its 52-week low and above its 200-day moving average of 64.90. Mean analyst recommendation is a lukewarm neutral 2.3 on a 5-scale.The company has a healthy balance sheet showing $4.79 billion in assets and $1.84 billion in liabilities. The most recent cash flow statement issued September 24th, 2011 shows a negative cash flow of $322 with stock purchases and net borrowings accounting for the negative number.The company bought 1.6 million shares of its common stock during the third quarter at an average price of $62.40 per share. The stock repurchase had no real impact on diluted EPS for the third quarter. At the end of Q3, the company authorized $167.5 million for more stock purchases going forward. The stock has no dividend policy.Despite the healthy balance sheet, Henry Schein Inc. does show some weaknesses. Return on assets stands at 7.46 percent and return on equity at 13.73 percent. Profit margin is 4.33 percent and operating margin at 6.83 percent, which seem pretty slim.During the most recent earnings announcement on November 1st, 2011, the company reported net sales up 11.5 percent from Q3 2010, and net income of $92 million was up by 11 percent. Earnings per diluted share were .99 cents, an increase of 5.3 percent over Q3 2010.""We are pleased to be reporting sales growth in local currencies in each of our five business groups during the third quarter. Third quarter results were impacted by lower sales and profits from seasonal influenza vaccine. More importantly, double-digit growth in net income excluding seasonal flu vaccine sales reflects continued strength in our core businesses,"" said Stanley M. Bergman, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Henry Schein.During the same announcement, Bergman also stated: ""We are introducing 2012 guidance for diluted EPS to be from $4.25 to $4.34, which represents growth of 8% to 10% compared to the midpoint of our 2011 EPS guidance."" The Company noted that the 2012 fiscal year includes one less week than 2011.2011 diluted EPS are expected to range between $3.92 - $3.98. The company's 2012 Guidance expects diluted EPS to rise to $4.25 - $4.34, about 8-10 percent increase over 2011 EPS.On January 5th, 2012, the company announced that it acquired all of Oak Hill Capital Partners' remaining interest in Butler Schein Animal Health for $155 million in cash. The company now owns 71.5% of Butler Schein Animal Health and the transaction should be accretive to 2012 diluted EPS by $0.02 to $0.03Overall, Henry Schein Inc. continues to deliver on earnings. With a low beta of 0.56, the stock is less volatile than the market on average. Comparisons with other industry organizations benchmarks show a PE of 18.02 slightly above the industry average of 16.35, and PEG ratio of 1.69 against 1.54.However, for value investors, the fact that the stock is trading close to its five-year high and offers no dividend protection against the downside, makes it unattractive at these levels. The slim margins and stock repurchase program also raise red flags. The stock appears to be fairly or somewhat over-valued at these levels with no obvious catalyst on the horizon to drive it higher.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
2759415,72165,2014-12-17T11:35:19-05:00,"Henry Schein is a distributor of healthcare products and services in three different segments: dental, animal health and medical.It operates in a fragmented market and in last 5 years it acquired other businesses in order to increase its market share.Despite the acquisitions, margins have been stable and ROE increased.Fair value calculated utilizing a FCFE model signals that, at current price, the stock is probably overvalued.","Henry Schein (NASDAQ:HSIC) is a distributor of healthcare products and services in three different segments: dental, animal health and medical. Dental makes up 52% of revenue and in 2013 the segment reported sales for $5 billion. In the first three quarters of 2014, revenue increased 8.5-9% on a year-over-year basis. Less than half of the growth was organic, while the balance was due to acquisitions of BioHorizons and Arseus. The 60% stake in BioHorizons, announced on November 2013, is the continuation, after the acquisition of CAMLOG Biotechnologies AG, of the expansion program in the dental implant manufacturer market. An increasing presence in dental specialty market (implants, orthodontics, and endodontic) is one of the goals of the company. This would provide differentiation from its main competitor, Patterson Companies (NASDAQ:PDCO), which operates in the same three market segments (dental, animal health and medical) but with lower footprint in dental specialty. Henry Schein acquired in February 2014 from Arseus four distributors serving dentists and dental laboratories in France, the Netherlands and Belgium and a French dental practice management software company, strengthening its presence in Europe. 60% of dental sales are placed in the U.S. while the balance is spread among 25 countries internationally, mainly Europe. During last 5 years, dental revenue increased 20%. Organic sales in North America grew 2-3% c.a. and acquisitions have been minimal. Growth through acquisitions has been stronger on international markets, where it accounted for 5% of revenue growth in 2013 and 1.8% in 2012, while organic growth has been 1% each year.The North American dental market, from estimates provided by Patterson in its investor day presentation, is currently worth $7 billion. This makes Henry Schein the national leader with approximately 46% market share, followed by Patterson Companies with 33% while regional and local suppliers retain the remaining share. Although there is the opportunity of expanding the business in North America given market fragmentation, I think that it would be difficult for Henry Schein to increase its market share, which is already high. This view is supported by the low level of investments in the region made by the company last years. Therefore, I estimate that the dental segment will probably growth at the same speed of the market, a rate in-line with national GDP. International growth could be higher but this would require new acquisitions since the company presence is concentrated in Europe, whose expected growth is in-line or lower than the United States. Organic growth has been lackluster in recent years due to the European crisis but there are recovery signs since, in first three quarters of 2014, the company reported 3% organic growth.The Animal health business distributes wellness, compliance and practice management solutions for veterinary professionals. It experienced strong increase in revenue in recent years due to double digit organic growth in North America and acquisitions on international markets. In last 5 years, the entire segment grew 31% compounded annually to $2.6 billion in fiscal year 2013. Revenue was evenly split between U.S. and international, with sales in U.K. making up the majority of the latter. Growth continued in 2014 despite a slowdown in Q1 because of the bad weather conditions in North America (sales increased 2.4% in North America and 4.2% internationally), in Q2 and Q3 organic revenue increased 7% and 8% respectively. Revenue is $2.8 billion on a trailing 12-months basis. The main competitors are Midwest International Veterinary (NASDAQ:MWIV), with $2.7 billion in trailing revenue, and the animal health segment of Patterson Companies, with $1.46 billion in sales ($0.8 billion in North America).Accordingly to an estimate provided by Midwest International Veterinary, the U.S. market for animal health product was worth $9 billion in 2013. Midwest International is therefore the largest player in the country with slightly less than 30% market share, followed by Henry Schein with 15% and Patterson with 9%. There is discordance among numbers reported by MWIV and those provided by Henry Schein and Patterson, which claim that the entire market served by them, foreign countries included, is worth $10 billion. I personally opt for the Midwest International Veterinary estimate since, otherwise, its market share in U.S. would be 60%, a number that seems too high. Given industry segmentation, the growth rate of the entire market (5.8% c.a. since 2000) and the possibility of improving its market share also in the North American market, the animal health segment has good growth prospects. Acquisitions to increase market share were persecuted also in this segment: in April, the company announced the acquisition of an 80% ownership position in Medivet, a leading distributor of animal health products and services in Poland. In May, Henry Schein acquired a 60% stake in SmartPak, the leading provider of equine supplements and horse supplies across the United States.In the medical segment, Henry Schein is a leading U.S. distributor to primary care physicians and specialists, group practices, physician-owned labs and ambulatory surgery centers, but it retains also operations in certain European markets. Medical grew 5.8% c.a. during last 5 years, a rate slightly higher than the dental division. Organic growth accounted for 20% while the balance is result of acquisitions. 95% of revenue comes from U.S. while the remaining from Europe. At the end of the last fiscal year, revenue for the segment was $1.64 billion. On a year-over-year basis, quarterly sales increased 2%, 4% and 8% in the first three quarters of 2014. Major competitors in this segment are Cardinal Health (NYSE:CAH) and McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK). Recently, Henry Schein and Cardinal Health entered into a long-term strategic agreement to serve physician offices.From company report:Estimating the market share of each of the mentioned companies is difficult because it depends from offered products. Henry Schein estimates that the addressable market for its medical business is worth $10 billion and it retains 16% market share. Its competitors had similar revenue growth rate last 5 years, between 4-6%. Given the relative maturity of the market, it's plausible to expect a growth rate similar to the American GDP, maybe slightly higher initially.The technology and value-added services group provides practice management software systems for dental and medical practitioners and animal health clinics, financial services, e-services, practice technology, network and hardware services, and education services for practitioners. Notwithstanding its financials are reported separately, it's horizontally integrated with other segments. This business represents slightly more than 3% of company revenue, but grew 100% in last 5 years to $0.346 billion on a trailing basis.ProfitabilityDuring last 5 years, gross margin has been stable around 28-29% of sales, EBIT margin increased 1% to 7% while EBT margin increased slightly more due to decrease in interest expense. Net margin has been stable around 4.5%. Henry Schein has higher margins than the average of Healthcare Services companies in U.S (the average net margin for the sector is 2.42% while operating margin is 5%), although it's worth noting that companies in this sector are heterogeneous. The company doesn't provide separate data for each segment, so it's necessary estimate profitability of single business units through comparison with other companies in the same field. For dental, I estimate that operating margin should be in the 9%-11% range, in-line with Patterson Companies dental segment. Other segments margin should be in the 3%-4% range given margins reported by Cardinal Health (4%, medical business), Patterson Veterinary (5%) and Midwest International Veterinary (4%).Following is reported the ROE DuPont decomposition for last 5 years:Values have been stable in the period, with little variation in all the principal metrics in which it is decomposed. Compared to Patterson Companies, which in the last 5 years has seen its ROE decreasing from 9% to 7% mainly because of reduction in profit margins, Henry Schein has comparable margins and leverage but higher asset turnover. I think that is an indication of good acquisitions made by management, which has been able to growth the top line without dragging on margins and meanwhile only slightly increasing the debt level.ValuationI built a FCFE model to estimate the equity fair value. In North America, I assumed that the dental segment growth rate will decline from 5% to 2.3% in 5 years and then it will stay constant. I choose 2.3% as long-term rate since it is the current yield on 10 years Treasury bonds, a good proxy for GDP growth rate. The rate is also consistent with the organic growth experienced in recent years, the maturity of the market and a low level of acquisitions to increase the market share which is already high. For the animal segment, which is growing at a higher rate, I assumed that growth rate will be 10% for 5 years and than it will slightly decline to 2.3% 15 years from now. This way, the company will have around 23% of the North American market share. For medical, the expected growth rate is 4.5% for 5 years that declines to 2.3% in the following 5 years. On international markets, estimates are more difficult given the wide set of possibility that management has. Given current information, I assumed a growth rate for dental from 9% to 2.3% in 10 years, which is slightly lower than recent growth rate. For animal, I choose a growth rate starting from 13% and declining to 2.3% in 10 years while for medical I set it constant to 2.3% (which could be also generous given that recently organic growth has been negative and there haven't been investments). This way, revenue growth rate will steady decline from current 7.8% to 2.3%. For technology and value-added-services, I assumed that the growth rate will steady decline from 13% to 5% in 10 years and then the revenue of the segment will be 5% of company's revenue, given the link of this segment with performance in other businesses. I calculated an equity risk premium of 5.73% given actual revenue composition. Cost of equity is therefore 8%, slightly higher than the industry average (6.7%) and beta is 1, obtained by adjusting for leverage the industry unleveraged beta. Given the outlined hypothesis, equity fair value would be $9.1 billion, which is 20% lower than actual market capitalization, indication that at current price the stock is probably overvalued. The company would be fairly valued if the average cost of equity of the industry would be applied, this would result with a beta of 0.78 (which is also lower than the beta obtained by regressing stock returns vs. market) or an equity risk premium of 4.5%, lower than the actual implied risk premium for the average American stock (5.2%). Thus I don't consider changes in the cost of equity determinants to alter the conclusion that the stock is probably overvalued. Considering growth rate, the actual valuation is consistent with a revenue growth of 7%, which declines to 4.3% in 15 years and remains constant thereafter, numbers that are too high in my opinion. With the hypothesized growth path (4.6% c.a. on average for 15 years and 2.3% thereafter), market valuation is consistent with a 8.3% EBIT margin, a value that would be attainable only if technology and value-added-services segment would growth to about 15% of company's revenue. This division will therefore be very important going on for margins expansion to balance the increasing share on total revenue of the animal health business, which is experiencing growth rates higher than other segments but has low margins.ConclusionThe company operates in a competitive fragmented market and is making acquisitions to increase its market share and consolidating its position. During last 5 years, management reinvested on average 67% of net income in the business and top line growth positively benefited. Another positive aspect is that, for the moment, growth didn't drag on margins, although in the future they will probably be reduced by an increasing importance of the animal health segment. Going on, it will be important how the competitive environment will evolve and if management will stay disciplined on acquisitions. An increasing role would probably be played by the technology segment, since value-added-services have a crucial role in competitive markets. This segment will also be important for its high margins and synergies with other business lines. The negative note is that the current price of the stock is not attractive, with an overvaluation of around 20% as estimated by the FCFE model discussed above so that, for the moment, I would stay on the sideline observing how this period of heavy investments will play out."
1410811,47851,2013-05-07T16:32:14-04:00,,"By Robert BrealeyMcKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK) and Henry Schein (NASDAQ:HSIC) are two growth stocks that you can buy and hold without having to worry them about every day. We think of them as neither purely value or growth stocks, but rather stocks that will give you a reasonable return over an extended period of time.MCK is a $120b pharmaceutical distributor and healthcare information technology provider. HSIC is a $9b dental, medical and animal health supplies distributor and software, e-service and educational service provider.Over the past 10 years, with the exception of the stock market decline in 2008-2009, both stocks have delivered in excess of 12% annualized, compared to a 4% overall market performance. Since January 2011, both stocks have returned in excess of 19% annualized compared to the overall market of 10%.Over the period January 2, 2004 to May 3, 2013, though HSIC delivered higher earnings growth of 12.8% annualized compared to 11.5% of MCK, MCK delivered returns of 15.3% annualized compared to 12.5% of HSIC. This is due to a large extent that MCK had a lower P/E ratio of 16.2x in 2004 compared to 21.2x for HSIC, and whereas the P/E of MCK improved to 18.1x, P/E ratio of HSIC declined slightly to 20.5x.Both companies have had very consistent ROE performance and revenue growth in the past 10 years, a sign of predictability and sustainability in the business. In terms of ROE, both companies have delivered very consistent 15% ROE over the past 10 years, with the exception of a hit in 2005 for MCK. Both ROEs have an uptrend, with MCK's more marked than HSIC's. The earnings decomposition chart below shows that MCK was able to grow its earnings without requiring the same growth rate in book equity by improving its ROE.Note, however, that MCK has a higher leverage than HSIC, its Debt/EV is 16.6% compared to 6.4% for HSIC, meaning MCK actually has a lower return on assets. In fact, the uplift in ROE for MCK has been partly a result of an increase in Assets/Equity ratio from 3.1x to 4.5x, whereas for HSIC, it has stayed between 1.8x and 2.0x over time. MCK has been offsetting its declining Revenue/Assets ratio by this increase in leverage. Whereas HSIC enjoys a net margin of 4-5%, MCK's net margin is only about 1%, albeit increasing and offsetting its declining Revenue/Assets ratio. Though debt ratios of both companies remain in the safe region (EBITDA/Interest Expense for MCK is 11x and for HSIC 25x), overall, MCK is exposed to higher risk than HSIC for its higher leverage and laser-thin margins.In terms of revenue growth, both companies have delivered double digit growth for the most part in the past 10 years, with a slowdown in growth rates, steeper for MCK than for HSIC. It appears that MCK, being a larger company, started slowing down in 2006 and only recovered somewhat in 2012, whereas HSIC only hit speed bumps in 2009-2010 and 2013, with quick recoveries. Whereas the average revenue growth rate of MCK between 2000 and 2004 was 17.4% compared to 14.3% of HSIC, it has slowed down to 4.8% between 2008 and 2012, compared to 8.7% for HSIC.Close to 95% of MCK's business is Pharmaceutical distribution. HSIC is more diversified, with over 50% dental, 25% animal health, 17% pharmaceutical and 3% technology. Animal Health is an interesting segment for HSIC and continues to become more important because it has been growing at double digit rates.Analysts are more bullish about growth prospects for HSIC than for MCK. Analysts are expecting a 5.4% revenue growth for HSIC, compared to 3.6% for MCKHowever, incorporating current valuations, analysts are more bullish on HSIC than for MCK. For MCK, 12 analysts rate it a buy, 4 hold and none sell, whereas for HSIC, 4 rate a buy, 11 hold and 1 sell.I see both as stocks that you can buy and hold for the long term. Actually, I prefer HSIC slightly over MCK given its more bullish growth outlook. Valuations matter less for stocks that you want to buy and hold over the long run, so long as they are not too ridiculous. The room for improvement in P/E ratios is limited, unlike what MCK enjoyed for the past 10 years compared to HSIC.My model for HSIC assumes a 10% earnings growth for the next 5 years, 13% RONE, a future P/E of 18x and a beta of 0.8. Using these assumptions, I expect HSIC's value to be around $100, about 12% above its current price, and if you buy and hold today, you can expect returns greater than 9% annualized. Current and near-term earnings account for over 96% of current share price, which means this is a very safe investment. The upside is if HSIC can maintain a higher P/E ratio closer to 20x, which it has done so historically, in which case fair value is closer to $110 and future returns 11%.For MCK, my model assumes a 7% earnings growth for the next 5 years, 13% RONE, a future P/E of 16.5x and a beta of 0.9. I have chosen a lower earnings growth rate for MCK because it is wholly dependent on pharmaceutical segment, whereas HSIC is supported by a faster growing animal health segment. I have also chosen a higher beta, given its higher leverage. With these assumptions, I expect MCK's value to be around $120, about 11% higher than its current price, and if you buy and hold today, you can expect 9% returns. Current and near-term earnings account for over 96% of current share price, which means this is also a safe investment.Buy MCK and HSIC if you don't want to buy and sell at exactly the right timing, nor worry about occasional dips in stock prices. We believe this is what many non-professional investors want, because they don't have time or want to look at financial news on a daily basis. We believe this is a significant departure from mainstream investment thinking, which often cares more about capturing temporal mispricings in the market rather than picking investments that actually create shareholder value. Yes, money can be made by being cleverer or faster than the market, but there is a also a way for those who just want to buy and hold.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

They serve more than 550,000 customers in the Untied States, Canada and  Europe offering over 90,000 SKUs through both  direct sales and via catalogues.Schein's results have been stellar over the past decade with revenues  tripling and EPS growing from $0.72 in 1998 to an estimated $2.95 for the year  ending this month. Long-term debt was just 12% of capital as of September 27,  2008.Here are the per share results since 2000 (as reported by Value Line):Year ….... Rev .…... C/F …... EPS …..... B/V ….. Avg. P/E2000 ….. 28.43 …. 1.24 ….. 0.84 ….… 6.91 …... 11.1x2001 ….. 29.97 …. 1.44 ….. 1.01 ….… 7.97 …... 17.6x2002 ….. 32.07 …. 1.66 ….. 1.31 ……. 9.78 …... 17.8x2003 ….. 38.32 …. 2.02 ….. 1.55 ……11.47 ……16.9x2004 ….. 46.86 …. 2.17 ….. 1.53 ……12.76 ...….21.9x2005 ….. 53.23 …. 2.56 ….. 1.82 ……14.12 ……22.0x2006 ….. 58.23 …. 2.80 ….. 2.04 …....16.62 ……23.5x2007 ….. 66.07 …. 3.45 ….. 2.58 ……19.87 ……21.6x2008* … 74.80 …. 3.95 ….. 2.95 ……22.60 ……16.3x2008 figures include current consensus estimates    for Q4.At the present quote of $33.68, these shares trade for around 11.4x this  year's and 10.2x next year's consensus estimate of $3.30/share. Buyers of Schein  in 2000 (the last time it traded with a valuation as low as today) saw their  shares surge from a (split-adjusted) $6.00 to $28.90 over the next 30 months.In fact, Value Line notes that HSIC ranks in the top 1% of all issues in its 1700 stock universe over the past decade in ""Price Growth Persistence"" and  in the top 5% in both ""Stock Price Stability"" and Earnings Predictability"".The 10-year median P/E has been 20x looking backward and Value Line is  assuming a 19 multiple for its three – five year projections. I'm using a more  conservative 16x next year's projection to arrive at a 12 – 15 month target  price of $52.80/share. That would bring a 56% rise on these high-quality shares.Is that reasonable? HSIC peaked at $54.10 in 2006 on EPS of $2.04 and hit  $63.40 and $63.60 in 2007 and 2008 respectively. With sales, cash flow, earnings  and book value all higher than ever before I see no reason that my goal price  will not be achieved.Disclosure: Author owns shares of HSIC and is short HSIC 2010 $40  puts."

Cestrian Capital Research, Inc. values both its independence and transparency and does not believe that this presents a material potential conflict of interest or impacts the content of its research or publications.HubSpot (HUBS) is a marketing software company. So what, you may very well ask. Well, the company was an early adopter of the now-standard 'inbound marketing' process. This is marketing to suit the zeitgeist. Rather than deluge potential customers with emails, banners, pop-ups etc as was the case in the early days of the Internet, the inbound marketing method uses free content to attract the eye of potential clients, the goal being to sign that potential client up as a blog user, a follower on Twitter or other social media, then a trialist to a subscription service and then, ultimately, a paying client. It may therefore not surprise you to hear that we use HubSpot products here at Cestrian Capital Research. In addition to managing your content production and distribution per the above method, HUBS integrates basic CRM functions too. It's not a Salesforce alternative but it makes a lot of sense in the new world - where marketing is sales and sales is, er, something that happened in the 1990s.Inbound marketing has become a norm because in addition to customers preferring it - less spam, less being hassled on the phone by a sales executive staring a quarterly miss in the eye - it's cheaper. First, you don't have to pay sales executives' base pay. Second, computers don't require commission checks or expense accounts. And thirdly, computers don't have erratic notions of what counts as client entertainment, so they are an inherently less risky form of corporate servant than your average software sales executive. We point to a friend of ours who, when once hiring a top-rated software sales exec was heard to say, ""if we hire him, the revenue will go up. But we will have to manage the trail of collateral damage that will build up behind him as he goes"".In the world that HUBS helped to create, marketing-qualified leads can be as valuable as sales-qualified leads. And they are a whole lot cheaper to generate meaning, if you use HUBS software correctly, your gross margins should go up. In addition, there's nothing more Covid-compliant than a way of selling stuff that doesn't require leaving the office, still less a Zoom (ZM) call. So - a software company for the moment.The fundamentals are good, although not stellar.Let's take a look at how the numbers stack up.Source: Company SEC Filings, YCharts.com, Cestrian AnalysisSo - that's a good business if not quite a great business. (Among cloud stocks, CrowdStrike (OTC:CRWD) is a great business - check their story out here). Q3 earnings is approaching and due to that relatively low degree of deferred revenue, we think this can in theory be a risky name to hold head into earnings. However, historically the company is a case study in how to set and just-about-beat expectations on earnings day.Source: YCharts.comSmooth as it comes on the revenue line. Let's assume that, contrary to the lack of prepaid revenue, that quiet beat pattern continues.Let's now see what the stock chart tells us about opening a position ahead of earnings.As you'll see us say a lot around these parts, there are far better technical analysts in this world than us. We make no claim to genius or insight when faced with a stock chart. We mainly just like to draw lines and squiggles and then make like that supported our investment thesis or the lack thereof.As far as HUBS goes, our untrained eye tells us that there has been a fat-pitch upward trading channel for some years, and that the stock has currently broken to the upside above that channel.Source: TradingView, Cestrian AnalysisIt could be that HUBS and its cloud brethren can continue the march upwards now that the stock has broken out of that channel - but we think likely the stock comes back down within it at some point. This trading channel approach has worked well for us in cloud names within our Seeking Alpha subscription service and we think it could play well with HUBS in the future too. For now we consider the stock extended and too pricey to open a new position ahead of Q3. Neutral for the time being.Cestrian Capital Research, Inc - 16 October 2020."

This new marketing philosophy is why HubSpot has brought in thousands of new customers and grew its top line at an impressive rate. 5-year performance as of June 27th, 2020 But what makes inbound marketing so special? The strategy drastically improves customer experience and, at the same time, is a much more effective way of building trust by offering customers information they really value. In simpler terms, inbound marketing is a more sustainable marketing strategy than outbound marketing (which refers to pushing a product to a customer through various marketing channels).Since 2012, HubSpot has been extremely successful in capitalizing on this opportunity, growing its top-line at an impressive 40%+ CAGR over the last 5 years.Source: HubSpotThe company climbed 18.6% in May thanks to better that expected first quarter results on May 6, with revenue increasing 31% YoY to reach $199m (vs $190.9m estimates). Most of the revenue is coming from its subscription-based model: subscription revenue reached $191.2m, representing a 33% YoY increase, while total customers were up 30% to hit 78,776.The company also issued guidance for second quarter and full year 2020.Second Quarter 2020 key numbers:Full Year 2020 key numbers:Finally, total average subscription revenue per customer was $10,018 for Q1-20, up 2% YoY. said co-founder and CEO Brian Halligan.The key to understanding HubSpot's competitive advantage is to dive a bit deeper into its underlying marketing philosophy: the flywheel model.The conversion funnel diagram describes the process through which an individual who knows nothing about a product/service becomes the customer of that company. Traditionally, it consists of 3 steps:In 2018, HubSpot introduced the concept of the marketing flywheel (which was first introduced in 1993 by Martha Rogers and Don Peppers, the creators of the 1-to-1 marketing) to the inbound marketing community.But why the need for a change? The biggest problem with the traditional marketing funnel is that it sees the customer as an end point, not as a driving force: in today's World, word of mouth and referrals have become key elements of the buying process and the funnel fails to capture them.The flywheel is simply a more efficient way of utilizing ""energy"". In a funnel, all the energy (marketing costs etc...) spent to acquire a customer is wasted, as the customer is the end point of the model. On the other hand, the flywheel works on the assumption that existing customers will help the company drive additional sales through reviews, referrals and word of mouth. In other words, existing customers keep the flywheel spinning.Source: HubSpotHubSpot's aim is simply making this flywheel model work through its growth platform. The new conversion model operates through the following phases:Clearly, the model only works if a company can provide valuable content to its customers.The flywheel model preserves the energy spent on acquiring customers better than the traditional funnel. But how much better depends on a series of factors:The company's marketing platform is thus based on these 3 key concepts: attracting, engaging and delighting customers. Source: HubSpot The company offers a unique platform for managing customers, organizing social media campaigns, conducting SEO and more. HubSpot started out as a marketing automation platform and successfully evolved by introducing a new sales platform, followed by Service Hub in 2018. Recently, the company launched its new CMS Hub with the aim of helping clients manage and improve their websites.But the real value of this platform stands in it scalability, which allowed HubSpot to introduce and cross-sell new products to existing clients. Thanks to this light and scalable business model, the company is improving its operating margins while keeping high top-line growth and adding thousands of customers every year. All of this is made possible by one underlying strategy: organic growth. The fact that the HubSpot wasn't build by acquiring different companies and ""gluing"" them together helps the business to preserve its identity and to offer a unique ""all-in-one"" platform. The HubSpot growth platform now includes 4 different products:The company's plethora of services has drastically evolved from its IPO:Source: HubSpotThe foundation of this growth platform is HubSpot CRM, a 100% free service which offers basic reporting, analytics and much more:Source: HubSpotThe company offers three separate pricing levels and offers an additional 25% discount when purchasing Marketing, Sales and Service Hubs as a bundle:Source: HubSpotInterestingly, another key player in the marketing automation space, Pardot, was acquired by ExactTarget, which was in turn acquired by salesforce.com (CRM). And this approach is clearly quite different from HubSpot's organic platform growth.The company has traditionally targeted mid-market companies (with 2 to 2,000 employees), but it's now leveraging the power of its platform to win even larger customers.But customers are not the only ones to be satisfied with HubSpot. In 2020, the company was named #1 Best Place to Work on Glassdoor. The ranking is based on employees who share feedback on the company culture and workplace.said co-founder and CTO Dharmesh Shah. Starting from 2019, HubSpot further solidified a few key points in its Culture Code:Points 2 and 4 are particularly interesting. As we can read in the Culture Code, one of HubSpot's key principles is ""Solve for the Customer"", and the company has worked intensively towards improving customer experience through simpler processes, new resources and first-in-class software. The focus on remote working has put HubSpot in an optimal position to navigate the post-Covid 19 era. In 2019, the company hired its first Remote Work and Inclusion Program Manager and strengthened its collaboration with Zoom (ZM) and Slack (WORK). To build better remote communities, the company also launched a few initiatives such as Remote Work Study and its Remote Work careers page.This unique mix of organic growth, focus on customers and corporate culture can be easily mispriced by the markets and represents the secret to business sustainability and, as a result, to long-term success. And this mix has definitely paid off during Covid-19:YTD performance as of June 27th, 2020Operationally savvy management with solid backgrounds in marketing and computer science. Key people include:The company has kept an impressive 40%+ Revenue CAGR over the past 5 years, while adding new customers and managing to improve margins in the process. When expanding its business, HubSpot must carefully balance the need of keeping the platform simple and clean with the need of adding more functionalities. The company has based its success on an organic platform growth strategy; most of its biggest competitors have acquired their way into marketing automation:The global digital marketing industry was valued at $43.8bn in 2019 and is expected to grow at a 17.4% CAGR from 2020 to 20207, giving HubSpot plenty of room to growth. By assuming a reduced CAGR of 15% due to current market conditions, this still gives a projected $134.0bn global digital marketing industry size by 2027. If HubSpot keeps its current market share of around 1.5%, this would translate in a theoretical $2.1bn revenue target by 2027:Source: proprietary research. Linear growth assumed from Dec-19 to Dec-27At the same time, the company continues to increase its international presence, with 45% of customers (generating 40% of revenue) outside the US. Most international sales are coming from Europe, leaving HubSpot with the great opportunity of tapping into the Asian market.Expansion is made possible by the flexibility of its business model, which allowed HubSpot to grow from a simple marketing app to an all-in-one platform:Source: HubSpotThe company has consistently increased its gross margins, while posting slightly negative EBITDA due to increasing SG&A expenses:Source: S&P Capital IQIts ""modular"" business model, where the company can easily add new functionalities to expand its existing platform, coupled with economies of scale, will likely help keeping SG&A in check and, ultimately, make the company profitable. Even if HubSpot is still losing money on a GAAP basis, it has been producing positive free cash flows for a few years now, a sign that the underlying business model does work:Source: S&P Capital IQThe company almost has a billion in Cash & Equivalents ($968.6m), more than enough to cover its $610.5m in Total Debt (TTM Current Ratio of 3.4x).The company currently trades (as of June 27th, 2020) at 13.1x EV/Revenue, representing a more than a fair price for a premium business model expected to grow top line at 20%+ CAGR over the next 3 years. Valuation seems reasonable when compared to some key players in the industry:Moreover, analysts are expecting the company to turn EBITDA positive at the end of 2020:* EBITDA CAGR refers to the 2020-2022 periodHubSpot is already Free Cash Flow positive, with TTM FCF of $41.6m (5.8% FCF/Revenue) and a Full Year 2019 FCF of $65.1m, or 9.6% FCF/Revenue ratio. However, a quick analysis of direct competitors shows room for expansion as the company scales up: for instance, a fast-growing company like salesforce.com has a 18.8% TTM FCF/Revenue ratio, while a more established business like Microsoft reaches 31.3%.By combining analysts estimates with top-line growth linearly fading to a 2.0% long-term target in Year 10, we arrive at the following revenue estimates (presented in the graph below up to Dec-27, in comparison with revenue estimates derived from total addressable market shown in the previous paragraph):Source: proprietary researchBelow is the summary of a DCF valuation based on the above projections:Source: proprietary research. 2020-2022 Revenue and EBITDA from analyst estimates.Low and High cases are produced by changing 4 key variables: target revenue long-term growth, target FCF/Revenue, Exit EV/Revenue and Discount Rate.From a DCF point of view, it makes sense paying 13.1x revenue for a growing company with a unique business model and large addressable market.Thanks to the mix of a flexible business model and a corporate culture focused on remote working, HubSpot is well positioned to navigate the coronavirus crisis. Moreover, as companies are cutting their SG&A spending in the short term, inbound marketing could benefit from the influx of businesses looking to optimizing marketing expenses by moving away from traditional channels.In the meantime, HubSpot continues to consolidate its international presence, with the Asian market representing a significant opportunity. This, coupled with an increasing focus on larger customers, could fuel top-line growth in the years to come. As Brian Halligan recently said:Finally, HubSpot has two main ways of growing its business: increase customers or make more sales per customer. With the launch of lower priced services, the company has traditionally focused on the former. As the business evolves, they will likely have the chance of focusing more on the latter.A key metric for all SaaS companies is the total retention rate. In 2019, HubSpot's retention rate was 99.9% versus 100.7% in 2018 and 100.5% in 2017 (and versus 82.9% pre-IPO). While 99.9% is not a disappointing number, other SaaS companies do experience higher retention rates. This is partly due to the heavy focus on small and medium enterprises, which are more likely to fail or cancel the subscription, and to the elevate competition. HubSpot is currently offering the best mid-market CRM platform, but:Currently, HubSpot has the advantage on other mid-market players like InfusionSoft, Salesfusion and ActiveCampaign thanks to a more unified and complete vision, but investors should keep a close eye on the industry dynamics."
4351602,105400,2020-06-02T18:07:50-04:00,Hubspot has grown its customer and employee count when some companies have layoffs.The company has also introduced a new CMS hub that should strengthen its land-and-expand model.The stock has risen sharply in the past month but is not trading at its historically highest multiple yet.,"Hubspot Inc (NYSE:HUBS) is a good long-term investment choice due to its strong revenue growth from the company's land-and-expand model. Successful product launches have helped grow the company's number of customers and their spending levels over the years. Hubspot is entering the downturn in a position of strength due to its strong balance sheet and positive free cash flow generation. At an 11.8 price-to-sales multiple, the stock is not cheap but it is not trading above historical highs. Hubspot delivered a strong quarter where the company's revenue increased to $199M, representing a 13% year-on-year growth. Subscription revenue makes up $191M, which is 96% of Hubspot's total revenue for the quarter. This high level of predictability means that the company can expect consistent cash flows compared to software companies that take in a one-time large license fee. The company has also been successful with its land-and-expand model. Hubspot grew total customers to 78,776 as at March 2020, up 30% year-on-year. Existing customers have also been spending more each year, with total average subscription revenue per customer 2% higher year-on-year.Hubspot's revenue has also been powered by its international growth, which now makes up 42% of Q1 2020 revenue compared to 22% in Q3 2014. This is an important metric as it shows the scalability of Hubspot's platform on a global level. From this growth, it is likely that Hubspot's value proposition is attractive all over the world. (Source: Investor Presentation)Our view is that the smaller companies are being underserved by enterprise software providers, as the smaller deal sizes make it difficult to serve them efficiently. As such, Hubspot's focus has been serving this niche in a meaningful manner. We think the company has a long runway for growth as it gains new customers while increasing their usage of Hubspot services gradually through multiple hubs that the company provides. As some companies had to layoff employees, Hubspot has actually hired more people. Its employee count is at 3,578, which is 30% higher year-over-year. The company also adapted quickly due to their remote presence before the pandemic: Hubspot has also been helping its customers and prospects by giving its team a lot of flexibility in offering discounts and flexible payment terms. The company also lifted e-mail and calling limits and added a collection of features, including meetings, bots and 1:1 video into their free CRM. They have also reduced the price of their starter growth suite by over 50% late in the quarter. This helps to reduce the financial strain on companies that are facing difficulties during this period. For those companies that are transitioning online with cash flow difficulties, the concessions make it easy to start using Hubspot as well.Hubspot has also introduced its CMS hub, which helps make managing websites at scale easier. It provides features like dynamic content, adaptive testing and 24/7 security monitoring, which adds value for growing companies. The creation of more hubs helps Hubspot continue its land-and-expand model and we should expect higher average revenue per customer increasing in the future. These moves might result in some short term volatility in Hubspot's financials, but it creates a long-term tailwind for the company as customers continue to stick with Hubspot after they transition online. Hubspot also has the financial capability to support these concessions as it has $968M of cash and cash equivalents and only $346M of long term debt. The company also generated $60M of free cash flow in the latest fiscal year, which reduces the need for Hubspot to raise more capital to support these initiatives. We expect a 20-25% compound annual growth rate over the next five years, driven largely by subscription growth. Given Hubspot's recent growth rates of over 30% and the launch of more hubs, we believe this growth is achievable. Hubspot also expects its operating margin in the long term to be roughly 20-25%. We expect HubSpot’s non-GAAP operating margin to rise from its current 10.3% to around 20% in the next 5 years. This is mostly driven by operating leverage in expense items such as research and development, and sales and marketing. With the recent spike in stock price, Hubspot is now up 22% year-to-date. This is reflected in a higher price-to-sales ratio at 11.82 currently. This is trading near the top in the past 6 months. Hubspot is not the steal that it was in the middle of March 2020 but its strong fundamentals might make this a buy in the long run. The highest price-to-sales ratio over the past 5 years for Hubspot was in the high 13s. Hence, there is a case that the stock is fairly priced for investors willing to hold through the volatility. (Source: Seeking Alpha)While Hubspot has customers of all sizes, the bulk of them falls in the smaller or mid-market segment. These customers typically have a higher churn rate due their failure rate and lower cash flows. During the downturn, it is likely that the company would face a higher churn rate compared to previous years as companies go out of business. For Hubspot to continue its strong performance, it has to continue innovating and serving its customers well. This will improve the odds that customers will stay on its platform for the long term. Up till now, Hubspot appears to be executing well on all fronts."
4354784,104952,2020-06-20T05:30:27-04:00,"CMS Hub launch is a low-risk way to drive subscriber ARPU. We expect strong attach rates going forward.Relaunched Enterprise Marketing Hub should also increase multi-product adoption while driving higher ACV deals.HubSpot has always outperformed its profitable growth expectation. Given the catalysts, it is well-positioned to continue doing so comfortably.","HubSpot's (HUBS) share price has appreciated by +48% since our first coverage on the stock last November, where we highlighted HubSpot’s transformation into an end-to-end CRM player. HubSpot has since made a further strategic decision that increases our conviction in its mission, including the launch of a CMS (Content Management System) Hub and continuing R&D investments in its Marketing Hub offering to strengthen its enterprise positioning. We continue to recommend HubSpot and maintain an overweight rating on the stock accordingly.Launch of new CMS Hub is a low-risk approach to drive higher subscription ARPU (Average Revenue per User). In Q1, HubSpot saw a solid 33% revenue growth despite the pandemic. ARPU also increased by 2% YoY from $9,811 to $10,018 in Q1, as a result of new customers purchasing higher-priced plans and client-base expansion.(source: company’s earnings call slide)In our view, CMS Hub, which is priced at $300 at a professional plan and three times as much at the enterprise tier, appears to be a strategic way to increase the ARPU by incurring lower risk. As CEO Brian Halligan mentioned in Q1, CMS Hub pro is formerly just an add-on for the Marketing Hub. With that in mind, HubSpot was already in a better position to launch the CMS Hub as an offering than when it launched both Sales and Service Hubs. We believe that HubSpot even had the best piece of information it needed to make the launch and pricing decision, such as the activity level and use cases for its CMS add-on.Upgrade of the Marketing Hub will provide stronger positioning in the enterprise market and help drive HubSpot's profitable growth goal. Even without the relaunch of enterprise Marketing Hub in Q1, HubSpot had always been exceeding its profitable growth expectation highlighted in its framework.(source: company’s earnings call slide)Operating margin, for instance, increased by over 600 bps (6%) in the last two years, averaging ~3% each year. At the same time, revenue growth had been much better than the expected 30%. In between 2017 to 2019, HubSpot saw TTM revenue growth between 32% and 38%.(source: stockrow)Consequently, we expect the enterprise Marketing Hub to continue sustaining the strong profitable growth. It can do so through increasing subscription ARPU and multi-product adoption, which has trended positively. Out of 78,000 customers in Q1, 32,000 reportedly were multi-product customers. Furthermore, HubSpot has also been strategic in incentivizing multi-product adoption. It offers a sizable 25% bundling discount for a purchase of an entire Sales, Service, and Marketing Suite. Furthermore, the new Enterprise Marketing Hub also comes with an advanced chat targeting feature that typically complements the Sales Hub offering.Despite the strong revenue growth, we expect billings to fluctuate as HubSpot will face delayed payments and downgrades due to the pandemic impact on its SMB customers. At ~30% YoY, billings growth already lagged behind the 33% revenue growth in Q1. On the other hand, the relaunch of Enterprise Marketing Hub seems to demonstrate a continuing commitment to gain more market shares upmarket, where we expect HubSpot to face more intense competitions from enterprise players like Adobe (ADBE) and Salesforce (CRM).HubSpot is one of the core components of our tech and growth portfolio. It is a global brand with a great culture and an attractive profitable growth story. As Salesforce and Zendesk (ZEN) own the Sales and Service CRM spaces, the market leader for the Marketing CRM space belongs to HubSpot.(source: stockrow)With a +30% growth prospect and continuously improving operating margin, we believe that the ~12x P/S is a fair price to pay. HubSpot also has a unique sales model, in which it requires its enterprise customers to enroll in a paid onboarding course that always comes bundled with any of its offerings. As a result, only ~95% of HubSpot revenue comes from the subscription. In the absence of such Professional Services, HubSpot would have been a 100% pure subscription play. Given the catalysts, we foresee the stock to trade at a ~13.4x P/S last seen in May last year. We maintain our overweight rating on the stock."

However, the grim outlook of the economy is doing little for its outlook. It lowered its revenue and earnings expectations for the rest of the year from earlier forecast and missed analysts' forecast.HubSpot's first quarter revenues grew 31% to $199 million, ahead of the Street's forecast of $190 million. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.35 beat the market's expectations by 52% and grew 3% over the year.By segment, subscription revenues grew 33% to $191.2 million, and Professional services and other revenues grew 2% to $7.7 million.Among other operating metrics, its customer base grew 30% to over 78,776.

Deferred revenues grew 25% to $242 million, and calculated billings, defined as revenues plus the change in deferred revenues, grew 30% to $207 million.Unlike other technology players, HubSpot did not shy away from an outlook. It forecast revenues of $195-196 million for the quarter with an EPS of $0.23-0.25. The market was looking for revenues of $195.8 million with an EPS of $0.21. Due to the current pandemic, HubSpot lowered its outlook for the year to revenues of $800-810 million with an EPS of $0.88-0.92.

The market was looking for revenues of $806.7 million for the year with an EPS of $0.99.HubSpot continues to target growth through product upgrades. Earlier this year, it announced the relaunch of the enterprise tier for Marketing Hub. The relaunched application makes the Enterprise offering a lot simpler to use. It also is more powerful as it has better attribution reporting, account-based marketing, and an advanced chat targeting module.HubSpot is also helping its customers migrate to the virtual model through its products. It is working to accelerate the go-to-market strategies online through several initiatives. For instance, it lifted e-mail and calling limits on its subscriptions and added features such as meetings, bots, and 1:1 video into its free CRM. It reduced the price of its starter growth suite by over 50% by the end of the quarter. It hopes to use these strategies to help their customers manage their financials better. While the move did impact its average revenue per user, it also drove a fivefold increase in the run rate of the offering at the end of the quarter.Last month, it introduced a new product line called content management system (CMS) Hub. Similar to Marketing Hub Enterprise, the CMS Hub is designed to help growing businesses manage websites at scale. CMS Hub offers features like dynamic content, adaptive testing, and 24/7 security monitoring to the organization. CMS Hub will be available in two tiers - professional and enterprise. The professional version will allow users to manage their websites as they grow and increase traffic to deliver better results. It will be integrated with its other tools such as Marketing Hub, Sales Hub, and Service Hub to allow users to maintain a centralized view of the customer and deliver a seamless experience.The enterprise version of the offering will allow for higher governance and control and provide organizations with the ability to build personalized web app experiences that are easy to manage. It will enable enterprises to create microsites for specific campaigns and manage and report on multiple websites within the same CMS portal.HubSpot remains focused on its PaaS strategy. As I mentioned earlier, it realizes the need for SaaS companies to follow an active PaaS strategy. Its platform allows developers to build apps and sell them through the App Marketplace. HubSpot claims to have delivered over 1 million app installs. It reported that 94% of its paying subscribers use apps to grow their business and that each of these users installs an average of five apps from its platform. As of last quarter, HubSpot had reported 700,000 app installs, and 93% of its 73,400 users were installing apps. HubSpot still does not disclose details on the revenues earned by its developer partners.Its stock is trading at $183.54 with a market capitalization of $7.8 billion.

It goes without saying that Covid-19 has shut down most of Europe and parts of Asia. It is likely that growth will be very subdued for the next quarter or two.Despite the short-term headwinds, HubSpot is a strong company, and I believe the depressed stock price presents a good opportunity for a long-term investment. For this reason, I am giving HubSpot a bullish rating.One industry metric that is often used for software companies is the Rule of 40. It is an industry rule of thumb that attempts to help software companies ascertain how to balance growth and profitability. For a further description of the rule and calculation, please refer to one of my previous articles.(Source: Portfolio123/MS Paint)In HubSpot's case:Revenue Growth + FCF margin = 32% + 12% = 46%HubSpot scores above the 40% needed to fulfill the Rule of 40. Exceeding the Rule of 40 signifies that HubSpot has a healthy balance between growth and profitability.The following scatter plot of enterprise value/forward sales versus estimated forward Y-o-Y sales growth illustrates HubSpot's stock valuation relative to the 152 stocks in my digital transformation stock universe.(Source: Portfolio123/private software)A best-fit line is drawn in red on the scatter plot and represents a typical valuation based on next year's sales growth. As can be seen from the scatter plot, HubSpot is situated well below the best-fit line, implying that the company is quite undervalued based on forward sales multiple.As mentioned earlier, international markets represent more than 40% of revenue and are growing much faster than the domestic market. A prolonged shutdown of these markets or prolonged global recession could result in little or no growth for 2020. This would likely have a further impact on the stock price.HubSpot targets small and mid-sized businesses that tend to have a much higher churn rate than enterprises, and this will be exacerbated by a prolonged recession.HubSpot is a CRM-based multi-hub platform that is growing revenue at a rate of more than 31% annually. The company has made major improvements to the platform with its biggest product expansion in the company's history. I expect that the product improvements will keep the growth story alive for several more years.That being said, HubSpot's stock has been beaten down over the last several weeks, trading at just over 50% of its recent peak. This is due to the pandemic that will likely affect the company's performance short term.I believe that the stock price is now very undervalued, and this presents an opportunity to acquire shares in this high-growth story at a very reasonable. price. This will be a rough investment in the short term, but a great long-term holding. For this reason, I am giving HubSpot a bullish rating."

Because they have had a winning record of price gains in this stock repeatedly over the past 5 years. The right ones define the best times to buy by their actions.Part of those actions is the effect displayed by the Market-Makers who know who their most credible customers are, those most-often right ones. When those clients are buying, or want to buy, the MMs adjust their own thinking about where prices may go.Description by Yahoo FinanceHubSpot is now a 15-year old business in a 20-year-old 21st century's new way of doing business. Its business is getting a kick of forced encouragement under social constraints imposed by a health pandemic. Some see the development as a positive opportunity, depending on the managerial talents of business developers at many levels.From an investment point of view, technological opportunities are already well advanced in providing information-handling tools. Considerable commercial opportunities are viewed as still available in the organization and management of matching the needs of consumers with the means of satisfying those needs efficiently. This is what HUBS and many other aspirants are pursuing.Trying to appraise the many aspects of that pursuit in detail requires resources well beyond the insights of most individual investors. Our approach is to utilize the extensive human assets of major investment organizations that have objectives often quite parallel to those of individual investors. They hire and apply the time and skills of well-educated and well-informed specialists to make the same kinds of judgmental forecasts that individual investors treasure: Where are the securities' prices headed?The institutional specialists' forecasts are vetted within each organization by other-analyst forecasts and get transmitted to trading desks to be activated into changed ownership of securities. At this point, the individual investor gets a break.The institution's billion-dollar portfolio requires the making of changes of holdings in large enough size to make a difference. But the public's continually-viewed auction markets are overwhelmed by activities needed at that institutional level. So instead, volume ""block-trade"" transactions are negotiated between institutional holders by Market-Makers [MMs], with the effects on prices immediately posted publicly at the auction markets.The individual investor's break comes in the MMs' actions when filling their necessary role. They rarely are able to round up enough ""other side of the trade"" ordered by a client institution to ""fill"" an order in the brief negotiation-period allowed before market intelligence networks start to move prices, reducing the attraction of the order's terms. The most common tactic is to (on buy orders) short the stock by borrowing it from stock lenders (for a fee), or on buy orders, to commit MM-firm capital to temporarily own the stock during the time that at-risk holding may be unwound.In neither case will the MM firm's market-price change risk exposure be undertaken unless a hedging deal may be constructed at a cost that will be accepted by the order-placing institution as a ""cost of market liquidity"" to get the trade done. The benefit to individual investors is that those costs reveal the expectations of the hedge deal parties as to how far the underlying subject stock's price is likely to travel during the lifetime of the derivative securities contracts used to build the hedge deal.Figure 2 spells out such current price range expectations much more specifically than most conventional fundamental analysts are comfortable doing. The subject stocks in Figure 2 are ones Yahoo Finance identifies as other stocks investors also examined when looking up HUBS.

The quarter's performance outpaced market expectations.HubSpot's revenues grew 29% over the year to $186.2 million, ahead of the Street's forecast of $180.9 million. The growth in the revenue was attributed to continuing adoption of subscription services and an increasing market penetration. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.45 grew 22% and outpaced the market's outlook of $0.42 per share.By segment, subscription revenues grew 31% to $179.1 million and Professional services and other revenues fell 2% to $7.1 million.Among other operating metrics, its customer base grew 30% to over 73,480 at the end of the quarter. Total average subscription revenue per customer grew a modest 0.3% to $10,047. Deferred revenues grew 26% to $234.1 million and calculated billings, defined as revenues plus the change in deferred revenues grew 30% to $217 million.HubSpot ended the year with revenues growing 32% to $674.9 million and an adjusted EPS of $1.66.For the current quarter, HubSpot expects revenues of $192.5-$193.5 million with an EPS of $0.22-$0.24. The market was looking for revenues of $189.1 million with an EPS of $0.35. HubSpot expects to end the year with revenues of $840.5-$844.5 million with an EPS of $1.24-$1.32. The market was looking for revenues of $826.73 million for the year with an EPS of $1.58.HubSpot has recently relaunched a powered-up Marketing Hub Enterprise that will include account-based marketing, multi-touch revenue attribution, targeted chat, partitioning, higher usage limits, and other advanced features to drive usability of its services. It will continue to enhance the offering by adding more sophisticated product announcements across the platform during the year to help its customers scale.It had earlier relaunched its Agency Partner Program into a new Solutions Partner Program that will help attract a more diverse set of partners to enable its customers to grow beyond marketing into sales and service. The program is for agencies and service providers who are looking to expand their offerings and build expertise in HubSpot.Besides growing its product and partner offering, HubSpot remains focused on an enhanced PaaS strategy as well. It has a dedicated app partner program that is geared toward developers and companies that want to grow their business by building apps on HubSpot's open platform. The program helps companies to grow their business by distributing their apps to HubSpot's growing customer base. Developers can create apps and then list them on its App Marketplace to access HubSpot's customer base.HubSpot realizes that the development of apps helps build a lucrative ecosystem for its offerings besides offering a sustainable source of revenue for the developers. Through the App Marketplace, developers can get their apps in front of HubSpot's more than 73,400 users, each of whom averages five third-party app installs. HubSpot currently has more than 700,000 app installs that support over 200 integrations. Over 93% of its customers use apps to grow their businesses. While some of its apps are available for free, there are several apps that operate on a monthly subscription fee. HubSpot does not disclose details on the revenues earned by its developer partners. It should start disclosing such metrics to help analysts gauge the efficacy of its PaaS strategy.But HubSpot's app developer partner program strengthens my belief in the need for SaaS companies to follow an active PaaS strategy. Not only does this model help companies like HubSpot grow, but also helps create an ecosystem of developer entrepreneurs who can create numerous profitable, sustainable, long tail businesses.Its stock is trading at $196.97 with a market capitalization of $8.5 billion. It touched a 52-week high of $207.98 in August last year and a 52-week low of $137.30 in November last year.Original postEditor's Note: The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors."
4311569,21815,2019-12-10T04:46:53-05:00,"The shares have been a victim of a larger SaaS selloff and some temporary headwinds. We see the latter gradually lifting.While the shares are not cheap and, therefore, have limited valuation multiple expansion room, they still have lots of upside.This will have to come from operational leverage through S&M and increased cash flow producing buybacks.","HubSpot (HUBS) is another SaaS business software platform company that has run into some headwinds on the market as concerns about valuation and slowing corporate spending have taken a toll on the share price:There are also some temporary issues which have taken their toll, like FX headwinds, an outage in March which has slowed introducing new products, and slow hiring. We think the shares still offer attractive long-term value though.The company has grown from a fairly humble origin offering non-invasive marketing services to a veritable SaaS platform with multiple hubs. From the earnings deck:This is illustrating what we have argued a number of times is the attractiveness of business SaaS platforms:HubSpot is displaying all these favorable features. It has become a SaaS platform (from the earnings deck):And this has produced strong growth (from the earnings deck):The revenue growth is trending down, but this isn't really worrying. It's simply the effect of the law of large numbers, and 30%+ revenue growth is still very considerable.Data by YChartsThe proliferation of hubs and products creates ample opportunities for cross-selling and up-selling, and the net dollar retention rate was above 100%, reflecting this.However, this is not (at least not anymore) reflected in the average subscription revenue per customer, which was $9,992 in Q3, up only fractionally, both sequentially and y/y.There is also an expanding ecosystem of partners with applications that integrate with the company's platform. HubSpot has acquired synchronization engine PieSync in order to allow the data of third-party apps to seamlessly integrate with the platform data.A typical mid-market company (the segment where HubSpot is especially strong) will use 40 different SaaS applications, so synchronizing the data from these greatly improves the stickiness of the platform.While PieSync will initially continue to be available in its marketplace, it will be integrated into core products and may even underpin a new hub in the future.The company has a big funnel in the partner program, where 40% of clients are originated. Management intends to institutionalize this next year, although it didn't specify what that means. From the Q3CC:The form of its freemium model where some 60% of its paying clients come from (from the earnings deck):The company is especially strong in the mid-market segment where competition is the weakest (from the Q3CC):The company is also making inroads in the enterprise segment. Stabilizing the platform through its Mainsail project (improving security, reliability, speed and ease of use) after the outage in March is really essential here. The PieSync acquisition adds to the attractiveness, as well as further product improvements, which are coming (from the Q3CC):The company already derives 40% of sales from abroad (from the earnings deck):The most noteworthy metrics:Even while growth and net income exceeded expectations, management indicated there were a number of issues holding it back a bit:An outage in March required efforts to stabilize and secure the platform (called project ""Mainsail""), which depressed growth a bit, as it slowed innovation, the introduction of new products and hubs.The company also fell behind with hiring in Q1 and Q2, which is likely to have slowed growth a bit as well. It has increased hiring in Q3 to +24% (y/y), up from +20% in Q2, but it takes some time for these new employees to become fully productive.FX developments also took their toll, with constant currency revenue growing 33%, implying a 1.7-point FX headwind. Overseas revenue grew 41% y/y but 46% on a constant currency basisFX headwinds were more substantial on billings, which was up 27% y/y to $179 million but suffered a 3-point hit. Product mix and shifting of demand to products with lower upfront and/or shorter payment terms were other headwinds for billings. There were also difficult comps with Q4 last year, when the company introduced many new products.From the earnings PR:The Q4 net income guidance is a little softer than what the market expected, with non-GAAP EPS at $0.40-0.42 (rather than the consensus $0.44). From the Q3 CC:So, this can in part be blamed on the acquisition of PieSynch, which is adding more cost than revenue in Q4. Another reason is the accelerated hiring which is proceeding in Q4 at a rate in excess of the 24% of Q3, as it takes some time for the new people to become fully productive.There is a good deal of leverage in the model (from the earnings deck):There was a slight dip in operating margin in Q3 for the reasons mentioned above, and the additional hiring in Q4 will add to this. The company isn't close to its long-term target with operating margin (from the earnings deck):All the improvement will have to come from holding down S&M at a lower growth compared to revenues. This is already happening:Data by YChartsWhile the above graph is in GAAP and includes G&A, the latter is a much smaller part, so it exaggerates the downward trend in S&M a bit, but not all that much. We don't see why this trend can't continue, even if it's likely that revenue growth slows a bit further.Revenue growth plus expanding margins means big cash flow improvements (from the earnings deck):The company sits on $948.5 million of cash and short-term investments but also has $335 million in long-term debt.Data by YChartsAnalyst expect a (non-GAAP) EPS of $1.46 this year, rising to $1.62 next year.The company is facing some short-term headwinds, and a more general selloff in high-growth SaaS names have knocked the shares down quite a bit from their 12-month high.While we think the company is well-placed and the short-term headwinds aren't material, we also think the shares are not cheap and do not see a whole lot of room for multiple expansion.We do see upside though, but most of it has to come from revenue growth producing leverage in S&M. This can be aided by the implied improvement in cash flow (already fairly substantial) used for share buybacks."

Find out how you can get the best content on Seeking Alpha here.HubSpot (HUBS), the inbound marketing CRM platform, just released its first-quarter earnings results, containing a welcome upside surprise to Wall Street's expectations. To some extent, it was difficult to picture this bullishness on HubSpot. Its flagship product is a CRM, which we expected to be a vulnerable product category in the software sector (with little sales activity going on since the lockdowns began, many companies are cutting headcount in the sales and marketing departments that use CRM tools). In addition, HubSpot - with its free basic CRM and tools oriented around smaller businesses - was expected to be impacted by higher churn given the macroeconomic fallout for small, insufficiently-capitalized businesses.But while HubSpot cited some challenges stemming from the pandemic, the overall tome of HubSpot's results and its outlook were overwhelmingly bullish. Shares rose ~7% following the earnings release:Data by YChartsEven as HubSpot looks to reclaim the all-time highs that the stock set in February, I believe the bullish case in this stock remains very much intact. The key pieces of this bullish thesis include:Stay long here - this is a software stock to hold on to for the long term.Given HubSpot's SMB orientation and at-risk CRM product, investors were nervous heading into HubSpot's first quarter, but the pessimism was unwarranted. Take a look at the results below:Figure 1. HubSpot 1Q20 resultsSource: HubSpot 1Q20 earnings releaseRevenues grew 31% y/y to $199.0 million, surpassing HubSpot's own guidance of $192-$193.5 million that the company set before anybody knew the coronavirus would derail businesses in March. Wall Street had understandably shaved a few points off HubSpot's original forecast, with its consensus Q1 target at $190.9 million (+26% y/y), which HubSpot surpassed by a solid five-point margin.Equally important to the numbers is HubSpot's commentary around how it executed during this challenging quarter. HubSpot's management reacted quickly to the coronavirus, lifting certain limitations on the free tier of its CRM product to broaden its appeal, particularly to smaller businesses. The company also gave its sales execs wide latitude to offer discounts and flexible payment terms in the hopes of retaining as many customers as possible. And though HubSpot notes that churn picked up in early March, the company has seen stabilization in the existing customer base plus a more-or-less return to normal new business activity.It's critical to note that HubSpot's product is well-oriented to the current pandemic. Outbound sales activity (or put in plainer terms, the old-fashioned process of making sales calls to your prospects) has ground to a halt in the face of global travel restrictions, but there's never been a more important time to have a polished digital marketing and inbound sales strategy. To this end, HubSpot's utility as a CRM product was better preserved than other products focusing on outbound sales.In response to an analyst question during the Q&A portion of HubSpot's Q1 earnings call, here's how CEO Brian Halligan described that product fit and sales trends (key points highlighted)Several other points are worth mentioning on the growth front. While HubSpot's domestic revenue growth was only 25% y/y in Q1, international revenues grew at a blistering 42% y/y pace, despite the fact that the coronavirus hit earlier and harder overseas. This illustrates how much greenfield market opportunity HubSpot has to grow in international markets.HubSpot's guidance update is also worth mentioning. For Q2, HubSpot has put forth a revenue range of $195-$196 million, representing 19-20% y/y growth, while its full-year forecast is now set at $800-$810 million (+19% y/y at the midpoint), about $40 million lower versus a prior outlook of $840.5-$844.5 million (+25% y/y).Figure 2. HubSpot guidance update Source: HubSpot 1Q20 earnings releaseThis outlook doesn't make much sense to us, however. HubSpot's commentary on the impacts of the coronavirus seem to suggest that the company was hit hard in March/Q1, and that past the first few weeks of April, HubSpot actually saw a tailwind in sales. If this is the case, we wouldn't expect there to be eleven points of sequential growth deceleration between Q1's 31% y/y growth rate and Q2. HubSpot is likely being overly cautious on the broader macroeconomy and resorting to its usual playbook of setting a low bar to beat, as it did in Q1 (even when the coronavirus hit unexpectedly that quarter). This gives investors a good opportunity to benefit from a beat-and-raise cadence this year.The only disappointing spot this quarter was the fact that HubSpot's pro forma operating margins fell slightly to 7.3%, 130bps lower than 8.6% in 1Q19. Unlike many other mid-cap technology companies, HubSpot has not announced any mass layoffs or cost-containment measures. Sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues rose 180bps versus the prior year, partially offset by a decline in the percentage of revenues allocated to general and administrative spend. We do think this is an outlier, however, due to the difficult sales conditions in March plus the flexible discounts that HubSpot offered to its struggling clients. Overall, the fact that HubSpot was able to generate high single-digit operating margins plus retain >30% year-over-year revenue growth still puts it in the small bucket of tech stocks that meet (or in HubSpot's case, comes within two points of meeting) the so-called ""Rule of 40"" test.Figure 3. HubSpot operating margin trendsSource: HubSpot 1Q20 earnings releaseHubSpot revealed itself to be in much better shape than investors originally thought heading into Q1. We were surprised to hear that HubSpot's sales trends seem to have course-corrected as early as mid-April, which also suggests that HubSpot's guidance revisions for the remainder of 2020 are overly conservative. If anything, the pandemic has only highlighted how critical digital marketing and inbound sales strategies are - positioning HubSpot well for long-term growth. Stay long here."

HubSpot (HUBS) is the top player in inbound marketing software, a better and more effective approach to sustainable growth.The company is expanding its ecosystems of services and solutions, while also attracting new customers and consolidating its competitive position over time. Financial performance is consistently strong, and HubSpot has abundant potential for growth in the years ahead.HubSpot is a founder-led business. The company's co-founders Brian Halligan and Dharmesh Shah are currently the company's CEO and CTO, respectively. Like many of the most successful businesses of our time, HubSpot was created when its founders realized that there was a better way to do things and to provide a superior solution to online marketing.While being at graduate school at MIT, Brian Halligan and Dharmesh Shah realized that online marketing was often too intrusive and an unwelcome disruption to potential buyers. Unsolicited messages and calls or pop-up internet ads are clear examples of this uncomfortable approach to marketing.Potential customers don't like these kinds of intrusions, and they tend to avoid them as much as possible. Even when the marketing message reaches the right destination, bothering your potential customers with information that they did not want to receive at that specific point in time is far from ideal.Inbound marketing, on the other hand, means that the customer should seek the product or the service. By creating high-quality content, you start by giving your potential customer something that the customer wants to get and actually appreciates. This opens the door to a more productive and comfortable relationship with those customers, and it provides a more effective path to sustained growth.HubSpot provides a suite of software solutions that helps companies generate better growth venues via marketing, sales, service, and the recently added content management system.The company has a freemium business model that attracts a wide variety of customers and moves those customers to paid solutions overtime. The paid version of the software has a three-tiered payment pricing system: Starter, Professional, and Enterprise. Source: HubSpotHubSpot is focused on the mid-market, which has been traditionally underserved. Customer churn is higher in this segment, but having exposure to relatively small and mid-sized businesses allows HubSpot to benefit from the customers that are growing in size over time. The company is essentially a growth enabler for relatively small businesses with plenty of potential for long-term growth.As customers grow in size, they generate more revenue for HubSpot, and they also tend to have higher switching costs, which consolidates HubSpot's competitive position in the sector.Source: HubSpotWord of mouth is a key source of new customers for HubSpot, and this shows that the company is consistently adding value to its customers. Needless to say, growing through word of mouth is a notoriously effective and profitable driver.Source: HubSpotThe company has a rock-solid track record of consistent revenue growth over the long term. The recession has affected the business recently, but the numbers are still healthy. Total revenue was $203.6 million last quarter, up 25% versus the same quarter in the prior year. Subscription revenue was $196.4 million, up 26% year over year.Source: HubSpotHubSpot grew total customers to 86,672 on June 30, 2020, this is an increase of 34% compared to June 30, 2019. The total average subscription revenue per customer was $9,466 during the second quarter of 2020, down 5%. This decline in revenue per customer was due to aggressive pricing discounts to accelerate customer growth during the period.Management highlighted in the conference call that the worse seems to be already in the past regarding the impact of the recession, and the company could be even benefitting from new business paradigms emerging from the pandemic.In the words of CEO Brian Halligan:International growth has been very healthy over the past several years and also in the most recent quarter, with constant currency revenue growing by 36% year over year. HubSpot is already making 42% of total revenue from international markets, and a higher share of total sales coming from global markets should have a positive impact on total revenue growth in the years ahead.Source: HubSpotProfit margins are moving in the right direction over time, and management aims to generate operating margins in the neighborhood of 20-25% over the long term.Source: HubSpotThe stock is trading a forward price to sales ratio of 15 times expected revenue for 2020 and 13 times sales estimates for 2021. The stock is not cheap, but valuation is not excessive for a company with such an attractive potential for sustained expansion in both sales and earnings over the years ahead. From current prices, and even assuming that the price to sales ratio could contract over time, vigorous revenue growth could drive attractive returns for investors in HubSpot in the long term.Source: Seeking AlphaIt is also worth noting that HubSpot has exceeded both revenue and earnings estimates in each and every quarter since the third quarter of 2016. If past history is any valid guide, it wouldn't be much of a surprise to see HubSpot doing better than expected in the years ahead too, which would ultimately mean that the stock is actually cheaper than it seems to be based on current estimates.Source: Seeking AlphaSource: Seeking AlphaSince HubSpot is focused on relatively smaller businesses than other high-growth software companies, this generally means lower dollar retention rates and higher customer churn for HubSpot in comparison. This has both pros and cons because the company also gets to benefit from the success of its customers over the years, but during a recession, smaller companies are generally much more affected than big corporations.As many of its customers grow in size and also due to the fact that HubSpot is building more sophisticated solutions, the company will be facing growing competition from big players such as Salesforce (CRM). The market tends to be too myopic when assessing the competitive landscape in a sector, the opportunity is large enough for both HubSpot and Salesforce to do well int the long term, and HubSpot doesn't need to dethrone Salesforce in order to reward shareholders with solid gains. Nevertheless, this is still a relevant risk factor to keep an eye on, and it could have an impact on market perceptions regarding HubSpot.Those risk factors being acknowledged, HubSpot provides a superior solution to online marketing to an underserved niche, the company has a smart business model, a proven management team, and solid financial performance. In the years ahead, the company has ample room for growth by gaining more customers in the U.S. and abroad, and also by increasingly monetizing those customers with more and better solutions. The stock is priced for growth, but it still should offer attractive returns for investors over the long term."
4305379,104952,2019-11-11T09:54:09-05:00,"HubSpot's strong positioning within the mid-market segment and its overall low-touch user acquisition strategy will continue to drive long-term growth and margin expansion.Despite the downside Q4 outlook, Q3 revenue growth of ~32% YoY and guidance beat have overall been convincing.HubSpot is at the early stage of its transformation into a full CRM suite. Much of the upsides are yet to be realized.","In the SaaS CRM sector, HubSpot (HUBS) has stood out as one of the few competitors with a solid freemium user acquisition strategy. HubSpot is the pioneer of inbound marketing concept, which relies primarily on quality content marketing to drive conversions into paying users. Since it started, HubSpot has been leveraging its own technique to market its CRM product to the mid-market segments globally.We hold a bullish view on HubSpot. Looking at its recent performance as of Q3, we are confident in HubSpot's user acquisition strategy, which we think fits its product roadmap and target market segment perfectly. HubSpot's $167.1 million subscription revenue beat its Q3 guidance, though its professional services revenue of $6.5 million fell below the estimates. Overall, HubSpot grew its customer base by 31% YoY to 68,803.(source: stockrow. Zendesk vs. HubSpot gross margin)With fewer resources required to support its users' onboarding due to its low-touch freemium strategy, HubSpot can incur a lower cost of revenue. Ultimately, the strategy resulted in ~8 - 10 PPS higher gross margin when compared to other SaaS CRM players like Zendesk (ZEN). In the last few years, HubSpot has also become more efficient in its approach as it expanded its gross margin to widen the gap with Zendesk.In the near to medium term, we feel that HubSpot's capacity to fill in the mid-market CRM demand between the SME and enterprise spaces will drive much of the growth. Most of the target clients in this space require a simple, yet complete CRM suite to facilitate sales, support, and marketing activities. HubSpot's transformation into a full CRM suite from its past marketing app positioning was a strategic move to fit these unique demands and to differentiate itself from the SME- and enterprise-focused competitors like Constant Contact (NASDAQ:CTCT) and Adobe (ADBE) respectively. Brian Halligan, the CEO, reiterated HubSpot's unique positioning during the company's Q3 earnings call in its response to one of the analysts' question about the competition landscape:Despite our overall bullish stance, HubSpot's mixed guidance for the Q4 raised some questions about its growth given its recent setback in hiring. Indeed, as HubSpot moves upmarket and expands its offering, it is expected that it will face challenges in filling up the key roles further. For Q4, HubSpot expects revenue of between $180.3 million - 181.3 million, which indicates a potential miss on consensus figure of $180.83 million. On the hiring side, it appears that HubSpot has recovered from its hiring shortfall in Q2 by having significantly increased its hiring activities in Q3. In that sense, we expect the sales people ramp-up time to primarily drive where HubSpot's actual figure will fall within its guidance for Q4.(source: HubSpot's Q3 earnings call slide)In the last two years, we believe that HubSpot's progresses in product development have put pressure on its hiring. HubSpot's expertise in selling a marketing CRM for the unique mid-market segment using its inbound marketing technique will remain as its competitive advantage. However, the company's future growth plans in building sales and service-hub CRMs for the enterprise segments mean that it will adopt a mixture of both inbound and outbound approaches to stimulate early adoptions.Ultimately, another risk inherent in HubSpot's transformation into a CRM suite is that of its accumulated expertise in inbound marketing, which probably is not as relevant to the context of acquiring potential non-marketing CRM clients.HubSpot's recent Q4 guidance of $180.3 million - 181.3 million puts the company's FY 2019 revenue outlook at $669.64 million and P/forward sales multiple of 9.28. The recent -6% drop in the share price also sets HubSpot to trade at 9.42 TTM P/S, which is a discount to Zendesk's 10.13 TTM P/S. Given HubSpot's slightly lower revenue growth and increasingly stronger gross margins than Zendesk, its discounted TTM P/S provides a good buying entry point.Overall, we see HubSpot's hiring challenges in Q2 and Q3 as temporary headwinds. In the long term, HubSpot's fundamentals and growth strategy remain very solid and interesting. At the current stage of its transformation into a CRM suite, HubSpot is yet to realize much of the upsides from its dominant position in a unique space of its own within the mid-market CRM market."
4305409,103480,2019-11-11T11:12:49-05:00,"HubSpot has fallen ~10% since sporting third-quarter earnings, despite beating top and bottom line expectations in Q3.Investors balked at the company's in-line guidance in Q4, which ay have been caused by slower-than-expected hiring in Q3.Still, HubSpot has done plenty of work in expanding its TAM beyond its core marketing app. The company is focusing on becoming a platform for its customers' go-to-market operations.The company is trading at a modest ~6.4x forward revenues.","The article was also shared with PRO+ Tech subscribers - find out more about PRO+ here.As markets continue inching higher and growth stocks continue to regain traction after a poor October, it's becoming harder and harder to find bargains, especially in the tech sector. Thankfully, not all opportunities are lost. In particular, I see a strong buying opportunity in HubSpot (HUBS), a CRM application that focuses on inbound sales (as in, marketing to customers that have already taken action on your brand, versus direct outside sales). HubSpot recently released strong third-quarter results, but failed to see any appreciation in its stock price. Instead, investors focused on the company's fourth-quarter guidance, where an in-line revenue forecast pointed to mild deceleration. Rather than focus on HubSpot's guidance (which has historically trended on the conservative side), however, I'm enthused by HubSpot's cratering valuation at the same time as the company is building a wider TAM.Data by YChartsYear to date, HubSpot has virtually wiped out all of its gains. While the S&P 500 is up more than 20% so far, HubSpot is up only half that. We have to wonder if investors are evaluating this business in the right way: despite growing scale, HubSpot has managed to hold on to its >30% y/y growth rates (thus still classifying it as a ""high growth"" stock) while also continuously growing its operating margins and free cash flow. Its balanced financial profile is especially critical at a time when investors are more careful around loss-leading startups. Perhaps the most encouraging signal about HubSpot at the moment is its ambition to broaden itself into a platform. Yes, perhaps the word ""platform"" has been a bit of a buzzword lately, but essentially what HubSpot means is this. Originally, HubSpot started out as a single-application company (as most tech startups do), focusing on marketing solutions for inbound customers. This worked well as HubSpot gained differentiation over other popular CRM tools, such as Salesforce.com's (CRM) Sales Cloud. More recently, however, HubSpot has extended its product capabilities into a sales application as well as a customer service module, allowing it to become a broader ""suite"" of tools. See the company's offering set (taken from a snapshot of HubSpot's website) below:Figure 1. HubSpot offeringsSource: HubSpot.comIn addition to having three fully-fleshed cloud apps now, HubSpot has also built up an ecosystem of third-party applications (similar to how most large SaaS companies like Salesforce and Workday (WDAY) have strengthened their own ecosystems) to enrich its own product experience. The company' vision is to become a complete ""platform"" for its customers' go-to-market operations.Here's some useful commentary from CEO Brian Halligan's prepared remarks on the Q3 earnings call that details HubSpot's product roadmap and development:The chart below also helps to illustrate HubSpot's plans:Figure 2. HubSpot product transitionSource: HubSpot Q3 earnings deckWhat's clear is that HubSpot's continued innovation and diversification of its product offering has built up its TAM. As a result, I view it as somewhat short-sighted to all over a single quarter's disappointing guidance.Figure 3. HubSpot guidance updateSource: HubSpot Q3 earnings release As seen in the snapshot above, HubSpot is guiding to $180.3-$181.3 million in revenues next quarter representing 26% y/y growth (five points of deceleration from this quarter's growth rate), and on par at the midpoint against Wall Street's expectations of $180.8 million. How believable is this guidance, though? For Q3, HubSpot had originally guided to 27% y/y revenue growth, only to come in five points stronger. The deceleration that both HubSpot and Wall Street have expected just haven't materialized. With a company like HubSpot that routinely sets its own bar low, I'd take the guidance with a grain of salt.Let's now dig deeper into HubSpot's third-quarter results:Figure 4. HubSpot Q3 earnings resultsSource: HubSpot Q3 earnings release As previously noted, revenues grew 32% y/y to $173.6 million, only decelerating one point versus last quarter's 33% y/y growth rate and coming in significantly higher than the company's own growth forecast of 27% y/y and Wall Street's expectations of $168.8 million (+28% y/y). Note also that FX movements were a headwind to HubSpot; in constant currency, its revenue growth would have been one point stronger at 33% y/y.Kathryn Bueker, HubSpot's CFO, also noted that Billings growth kept pace with revenue growth, up 30% y/y in constant currency. With the company billing at a >30% y/y rate, it's difficult to see FX-neutral revenue growth sinking far below 30% - which is what both HubSpot's guidance and consensus estimates would suggest. HubSpot also achieved tremendous growth overseas, with international revenues growing 46% y/y on a constant currency basis and making up 40% of total revenues, up three points relative to 3Q18.HubSpot also achieved signficant profitability gains as well. We especially note the shrinkage of HubSpot's professional services revenue (3.7% of HubSpot's revenue mix this quarter versus 4.8% in the year-ago quarter) as a positive signal, as HubSpot performs professional services below cost. This has helped to boost HubSpot's GAAP gross margin to a sky-high 80.8%, up 30bps from the year-ago quarter.Muted increases in sales and marketing spend (helped partially by slower hiring) also boosted the company's operating margins. This quarter, pro forma operating margins (primarily excluding stock comp) rose 170bps to 6.1%, up from 4.4% in the year-ago quarter.Figure 5. HubSpot operating margin trendsSource: HubSpot Q3 earnings release The company's pro forma EPS of $0.32 also blasted past Wall Street's estimates of $0.24 with 33% upside, while free cash flow more than doubled to $6.7 million. Year to date, free cash flow has grown 55% y/y and notched a respectable 8.3% FCF margin. Most comparable SaaS companies that are still growing north of 30%, by comparison, are still burning cash.Figure 6. HubSpot FCFSource: HubSpot Q3 earnings release At present share prices around $141, HubSpot carries a market cap of $6.05 billion. After netting out a cash-rich balance sheet that has $1.01 billion in cash and $335 million in debt, we arrive at an enterprise value of $5.38 billion.Let's say that HubSpot can generate 25% y/y growth in the next fiscal year, versus expected FY19 revenues of $669.5 million (based on the midpoint of HubSpot's fourth-quarter guidance). This is a fairly conservative growth forecast given that constant currency Billings came in at 30% y/y - nevertheless, this gets us to an FY20 revenue outlook of $836.9 million (about 1% higher than Wall Street consensus at $829.2 million, per Yahoo Finance). This puts HubSpot's current valuation at an incredibly modest 6.4x EV/FY20 revenues. For a company that is still currently growing revenue and billings at a >30% y/y clip, has ambitions to become a fully-fledged platform solution for sales and marketing teams, and is consistently growing margins and cash flow, I'd say the risk-reward profile favors HubSpot's bulls at the moment. Stay long here and buy the dip."

Find out how you can get the best content on Seeking Alpha here.One of the growth software stocks that I've continued to be bullish on even as the market ascends to new all-time highs in HubSpot (HUBS). Most enterprise SaaS companies are trading at astronomical double-digit revenue valuations, leading many pundits to proclaim a second dot-com bubble. The trick amid rising markets is to deploy careful stock selection into reasonably valued names that still have plenty of fundamental tailwinds.HubSpot, which just closed out its fiscal 2019 with a strong fourth quarter and a bullish outlook for FY20, checks off all the boxes in this regard. The market response to HubSpot's most recent quarterly results was incredibly positive, with HubSpot shares rising more than 7% on the news, and taking its year-to-date gains above 20%:Data by YChartsLast quarter, I called out HubSpot as a heavily undervalued stock at ~6x forward revenues despite strong growth/profitability metrics. Since then, shares have gained a rapid 40%, beating a ~10% rise in the S&P 500 over the same time period. The question for investors now: does the rally still have steam?In my view, HubSpot still has plenty of head room to rise higher. We'll get into HubSpot's fundamental supports shortly, but we'll first illustrate this rally potential from a valuation perspective. At current share prices just under $200, HubSpot has a market cap of $8.45 billion. After netting off the $1.02 billion of cash and $340.6 million of debt on HubSpot's balance sheet, we're left with an enterprise value of $7.71 billion.For the coming fiscal year, HubSpot has guided to total revenues of $840.5-$844.5 million, representing 25% y/y growth. Considering HubSpot exited Q4 at a 29% y/y growth rate, and the fact that the company has barely seen any deceleration over the past several quarters, there's likely a few points of upside opportunity on top of this guidance forecast.Figure 1. HubSpot FY20 guidance updateSource: HubSpot Q4 earnings releaseRegardless, if we use the midpoint of this revenue range, we arrive at a current valuation of 9.2x EV/FY20 revenues. While that's several turns higher than last quarter, it's also still several turns cheaper than competitor SaaS companies in the ~30% growth range:Data by YChartsIn my view, there's plenty of room for HubSpot to stretch a few turns higher. My year-end price target on the stock is $234, representing a valuation multiple of 11x EV/FY20 revenues and 18% upside from current levels. Stay long here.One of the key reasons to stay invested in HubSpot is due to the fact that the company has recently shifted its product positioning from a single flagship product (its inbound marketing-focused CRM tool, which in itself already distinguished it from much of the competition like Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM), which is primarily focused on outbound sales) to a more holistic platform.This change only started in 2019, and is generating plenty of cross-sell opportunities for HubSpot. One of the reasons that HubSpot has become far more compelling is because its product is widely applicable across industry verticals, company sizes, as well as end-use cases through its platform of sales, marketing, and customer service solutions. Brian Halligan, HubSpot's CEO, described the company's key achievement in 2019 as putting itself ""the center of our customers' flywheel.""Figure 2. HubSpot product stackSource: HubSpot Q4 earnings deckThink fo HubSpot more or less as a less-mature Salesforce, and one that has carved out a niche for itself by positioning itself as an industry leader in inbound marketing (or the art of following up on leads that have already interacted with your brand, as opposed to outside cold calls). Without a doubt, customer relationship management (or CRM) is one of the largest categories of enterprise software. Third-party reports peg CRM's TAM at north of $40 billion in 2023, with the largest market share currently held by Salesforce. To a well-regarded up-and-comer like HubSpot, the room for growth is still broad. What's additionally appealing about HubSpot is its ability to balance steady growth with continued improvements in profitability - a trait that will become incredibly important as investors shy away from risk at new all-time market highs.Take a look at HubSpot's latest results in the table below:Figure 3. HubSpot 4Q19 resultsSource: HubSpot Q4 earnings releaseRevenues grew 29% y/y to $186.2 million, blasting past Wall Street's expectations of $181.0 million (+26% y/y). One of the key areas of growth to note here is on the international front. While domestic growth clocked in at just 23% y/y, International revenues grew at a stunning 43% y/y on a constant currency basis. HubSpot's revenue contribution from overseas markets has become a huge driver of its overall business, comprising a 41% mix of overall revenues (almost twice than at the time of its IPO). Additionally driving HubSpot's go-to-market focus is a new Chief Customer Officer, with experience transforming Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) and Dropbox (DBX) into global companies.We note as well that HubSpot notched 30% y/y growth in billings, which is one point faster than revenues. The fact that billings growth is keeping pace ahead of revenue growth gives us confidence that HubSpot isn't headed for major deceleration in 2020.Engagement and retention were also highlights of the fourth quarter. Per CEO Halligan's prepared remarks on the Q4 earnings call:Unlike many SaaS companies, however, HubSpot isn't exclusively a growth story. The chart below helps to illustrate how HubSpot has leveraged its strong growth (even as it continued to develop new products to aid its transition into becoming a platform company) in driving margin gains. Pro forma operating margins hit 8.1% in FY19, up 180bps relative to 6.3% in FY18. That gain has been consistent over time, as shown in the chart below:Figure 4. HubSpot margin trendsSource: HubSpot Q4 earnings deckThe company has also been a reliable cash flow generator. FY19 FCF clocked in at $65.1 million; the company expects FCF to grow to at least $75 million (+15% y/y) in FY20:Figure 5. HubSpot FCFSource: HubSpot Q4 earnings deckWith a solid growth profile and wide-open TAM driven by its new comprehensive three-pronged platform, as well as a trend of consistently raising profitability margins at a time when investors are dedicating more focus to tech companies' bottom lines, there's plenty of fuel left in the HubSpot rally. This is especially true with HubSpot's valuation currently sitting in the single-digits, though many similar-sized peers have notched revenue multiples in the low teens.Keep riding HubSpot higher."

As the chart from Google Trends above portrays, HubSpot has grown in popularity over the past five years.Source: Author (using data from Seeking Alpha)HubSpot provides marketing and sales automation tools. These are tools that make it more efficient for companies to attract and convert leads. This is the future of marketing and sales, and I'm bullish on this trend. Though from my industry experience in marketing, HubSpot isn't the only provider of marketing automation tools, and the entry barrier for new entrants is low. HubSpot's recent momentum has been driven by its thought leadership in inbound marketing and the fact that most organizations are yet to adopt marketing and sales automation solutions to drive business efficiency. Therefore, I expect HubSpot to maintain its growth momentum in the near term.Digging into its financials, the first thing we notice on the income statement is that SG&A has eroded profit margins. It stood at 65% of revenue last quarter, which is a 2% improvement y/y. R&D is the second largest cost bucket at 24% of revenue, and it improved at approx. 100 basis points y/y. This is a trend amongst SaaS companies. Though HubSpot's gross and operating margin have improved when you compare to the numbers from five years ago, its cash flow from operations is still a function of stock-based compensation. As a result, investors should demand a decent risk premium when valuing the company. Lastly, its CAPEX growth has been moderate.HubSpot is not debt-free, though it has a net positive cash position. It has a current ratio of 4 and a quick ratio of 4, which signifies it can meet its current financial obligations.Overall, HubSpot doesn't have financial challenges as long as margins keep improving, the valuation will continue to benefit from earnings and revenue growth.Source: Seeking AlphaHubSpot has an average quant rating of ""Very Bullish,"" and an average sell-side rating of ""Outperform."" This can be chalked up to its strong growth. It has an average analysts' price target of $204 and a revenue growth forecast of 24% in 2020. At that rate, HubSpot's valuation is only justified if management can meet its long term target. This assumes a near-perfect execution, which is highly unlikely. Given the revenue growth deceleration to 24%, the leeway to significantly boost free cash flow has been capped. If we assume the bullish scenario that free cash flow will accelerate from 12% of revenue to 29% of revenue in the next five years driven by improved operating margins, improved income margin, even in that scenario, we have to be demanding a sub 12% risk premium at a growth till perpetuity of 2% to arrive at a number close to $204/share. This is assuming revenue growth will decelerate gradually to 10% y/y by 2024. While gross and operating margin have improved over the years, I think the forward operating margin guidance is extremely bullish.Source: Author (using data from Seeking Alpha)At an EV/Sale of 10.88, HubSpot is not cheap. Due to its lack of profitability and small niche positioning, investors should demand a huge risk premium when discounting their cash flow projections. I adopted a WACC of 12% to cover downside volatility in my DCF model. Though, for a growth SaaS play like HubSpot, A multiples or peer valuation is more appropriate. I consider a forward P/S of <7 to be suitable for unprofitable SaaS companies. At a 24% rev growth forecast in 2020, HubSpot is still slightly overvalued at 10.4X forward P/S.Source: GartnerHubSpot is ranked in the broad Gartner magic quadrant for CRM lead management. However, it trails bigger players like Oracle (ORCL), Salesforce (CRM), and IBM (IBM) in its completeness of vision and ability to execute.Interestingly, HubSpot didn't list any brand as a competitor in its IPO prospectus. This gives the feeling that it has no direct competition in its approach to marketing automation. In the prospectus:Going forward, I expect competitors to try to come up with solutions that will mimic HubSpot's approach to marketing and sales automation. However, in the near term, HubSpot will continue to enjoy competitive advantages driven by its thought leadership in inbound marketing.HubSpot has a lot of positive catalysts that will continue to swing in its favor in the near term. International expansion is a big factor that shouldn't be discounted.

Management is actually predicting that Q2 will actually be worse for churn as they work to keep customers by:These actions, while reducing the net retention rate, have actually stimulated new customer growth, albeit at the cost of lower revenue growth. Once the pandemic retreats and things get back to normal, these initiatives should translate into higher revenue.In addition to the pandemic-specific actions that have been taken, HubSpot has also been busy with relaunching the enterprise tier for the marketing hub and introducing the CMS hub. The CMS capability should stimulate revenue generation from new online businesses. The relaunch of the marketing hub will help HubSpot set its sights higher, i.e., on the enterprise market.Regardless of how HubSpot is performing in the current market conditions, Mr. Market is bullish on this stock which is breaking out to all-time highs.(Source: Yahoo Finance/MS Paint)I usually take note of breakouts as they often signify more bullish action to come. In the case of HubSpot, it seems that Mr. Market is optimistic regarding our economic recovery and the belief that HubSpot is in a good position to benefit.In any case, HubSpot has strong growth potential, with 31% annual growth prior to the pandemic, positive free cash flow, and a strong balance sheet with $960 million in cash and cash equivalents. In short, HubSpot won't have any problem weathering the pandemic and subsequent recession. The stock breakout is gravy, making my bullish rating an easy call.One industry metric that is often used for software companies is the Rule of 40. The rule provides a single metric for evaluating both high-growth companies that aren't profitable and mature companies that have lower growth but are profitable. Revenue growth and profitability (expressed as a margin) must add up to at least 40% in order to fulfill the rule. Analysts use various figures for profitability. I use the free cash flow margin.The rationale for the Rule of 40 is as follows. If a company grows by more than 40% annually, then you can tolerate some level of negative free cash flow. But if a company grows by less than 40%, then it should have a positive free cash flow to make up for the less-than-ideal growth. This rule accommodates both young, high-growth companies as well as mature, moderate-growth companies. The 40% threshold is somewhat arbitrary but typically divides the digital transformation stock universe in half, separating the best stocks from the so-so ones.For a further description of the rule and calculation, please refer to a previous article I have written.The two factors required for calculating the Rule of 40 are revenue growth and free cash flow margin. HubSpot's annual revenue growth for the last year was 31%, while its free cash flow margin was 8%.(Source: Portfolio123/MS Paint)Therefore, the Rule of 40 calculation for HubSpot is as follows:Revenue Growth + FCF margin = 31% + 8% = 39%Well, who wants to split hairs! HubSpot's performance suffered pretty dramatically in the last three weeks of 2020 Q1 and I am inclined to give the company a pass on the Rule of 40 in spite of only reaching 39%. HubSpot essentially fulfills the Rule of 40, suggesting that HubSpot has a healthy balance between growth and profitability.The plot below illustrates how HubSpot stacks up against the other stocks on a relative basis based on forward sales multiple versus forward revenue growth. Note: please refer to a recent article for more information on the scatter plot relative valuation technique.(Source: Portfolio123/private software)According to the scatter plot, HubSpot is slightly undervalued relative to its peers. I have also highlighted Salesforce.com (CRM) on the scatter plot for reference purposes.I expect that HubSpot's business performance will be subdued for the rest of 2020 due to the small-to-medium business market niche. But Mr. Market is looking past 2020 in the stock valuation. The risk for this investment is the quite real possibility that there will be an extended recession with depression-like unemployment. In such a case, I would expect there will be a longer-term bear market that occurs, and HubSpot shares will suffer along with the rest of the market.The current stock market action is somewhat reminiscent of the dot-com era, when technology stocks had unrealistically high valuations. While HubSpot's valuation is reasonable, a new software bear market set off by the deflation of overvalued stocks would likely cause HubSpot to get swept away along with its software peers.Once the economy recovers, there is no guarantee that the new customer growth resulting from the recent initiatives will stick.HubSpot provides a platform including CRM along with marketing, sales, service, and CMS hubs. These tools target small- and medium-sized businesses, although the company is taking steps to improve its posture in the enterprise market by relaunching its marketing hub. Small- and medium-sized businesses have been hit hard during the pandemic and this has translated into significant customer churn for HubSpot.The company has done well to keep its customers by restructuring payments for those customers in need and also to expand its customer base by slashing the price of the starter suite and offering features temporarily in the freemium subscription.I anticipate that HubSpot will likely have a so-so year given the current economic conditions, but once the adverse economic conditions subside, HubSpot should be in a good position to resume a high level of revenue growth and improving positive free cash flow. I don't believe that 2020 will be a catastrophic year, and the SaaS business model will likely keep the company's revenue growth in pretty good shape.The company has nearly $1 billion in cash and cash equivalents. This should be enough to carry a company with positive free cash flow through the pandemic and recession. HubSpot is fairly valued, a factor that is important in this super-heated software bull market that could deflate at any time. Therefore, I am giving HubSpot a bullish rating."

Revenue has grown from $28.6M in 2011 to $590M in 2019, compounding at 46% year-on-year. Within the same period, gross margins have also expanded from 57% to 80%.Hubspot started with a marketing suite to help companies grow better. Since then, it has expanded into sales and service hubs. This larger platform allows Hubspot to act as a ""hub"" for companies' critical workflows. Besides expanding its total addressable market, this larger suite allows Hubspot to cross-sell its solutions to its existing customer base. There might also be future hub-expansion opportunities as mentioned by CEO Brian Halligan in its latest Q2 2019 transcript:(Source: Analyst Day)Hubspot's focus on customers has allowed it to grow its brand that brings customers onto its platform. According to its customer research, 33% of people first learn about Hubspot through word-of-mouth. This strong branding helps reduce customer acquisition costs and help Hubspot cross-sell its solutions to its loyal customers.(Source: Investor Presentation)Hubspot is also growing its switching costs by increasing the number of integrations each customer has on its platform. During its latest analyst day, it claims that it has over 700,000 cumulative integrations and 5 integrations per customer on average. Once customers integrate their applications and data onto the Hubspot platform, it becomes even more difficult for them to switch. Even if other solutions appear cheaper or slightly better, they are unlikely to risk lost productively to try new software.Hubspot's key markets include small-to-medium businesses. In an economic downturn, these businesses are more prone to business slowdown or failure, which could lead to stronger churn rates for Hubspot. Although Hubspot has been targeting enterprises, only 15% of its 64,500 customers are enterprises.Hubspot also faces intense competition in its space that may lead to slower customer adoption on its platform. Some of these competitors include Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) and Adobe's (NASDAQ:ADBE) Marketo software. Hubspot has to ensure that its platform continues to delight customers to keep them from switching over to bigger competitors.To value Hubspot, I used a DCF model with the following assumptions:1) Revenue growth at 25% for the next five years, then dropping to 2% in perpetuity starting from the year 2025. The high growth rates in the first five years reflect Hubspot's track record of high sales growth and its ability to expand its total addressable market. However, intense competition might put a lid on high sales growth as Hubspot expands its offerings to compete with leaders like Salesforce.2) Operating margin of 30% from 2024 onwards. Enterprise software players generally have high operating margins due to their high initial fixed costs and low incremental costs. Hubspot's gross margins have expanded from 57% in 2011 to 80% in the past twelve months. Once Hubspot scales further and profitability becomes a priority, the company should experience a high level of operating margin expansion through operating leverage. However, if Hubspot has to incur higher customer acquisition costs due to strong competition, there could be some downward pressure on its margins in the near term.3) A sales-to-capital ratio of 2 is in line with its software peers. Developing software is not capital-intensive, so I estimate Hubspot will be able to generate $2 of sales with every $1 in incremental capital.4) Hubspot has an initial weighted cost of capital of 9.07%, which drops to 8% in the terminal year. The higher cost of capital reflects the higher risk of Hubspot having negative cash flows and losing money. However, once the company achieves profitability and higher free cash flows, the risk should be reduced as reflected in the lower cost of capital.(Source: Author creation using Hubspot financials)The value I derived for Hubspot is roughly $7.4B for the entire company. This represents a 17.2% upside from its current price. As with all DCFs for high-growth companies, my point estimate valuation of $184 is likely to have a large spread of possible outcomes. To overcome this shortcoming, I compare its pricing multiples against similar software companies.(Source: Author creation using data from Seeking Alpha)Compared to other high-growth peers, Hubspot looks fairly cheap in terms of price/sales and EV/sales ratios. Hubspot is priced similarly to Zendesk which has roughly the same growth profile but worse operating margins. Hubspot is also priced much cheaper than other SaaS companies like Atlassian and Coupa.(Source: Author creation using Hubspot financials)However, Hubspot would be considered overvalued if sales growth falls below 20% for the next 5 years based on the table above. Potential investors have to decide if they believe Hubspot will be able to execute according to my base-case assumptions in the long run. If competition turns out to be stronger than expected and pushes down future sales growth, the recent pullback might not make Hubspot a screaming buy."
4293466,103480,2019-09-25T11:46:34-04:00,"Shares of HubSpot have fallen nearly 30% from their August peaks, despite a lack of negative news.
        HubSpot has managed to maintain a remarkable >30% y/y growth rate, despite hitting a ~$700 million annualized revenue run rate.
        Margins continue to improve, and HubSpot is generating positive free cash flow as well.
        Despite playing in a crowded CRM market, HubSpot's focus on inbound marketing differentiates it from the pack.
        Shares look reasonably valued at ~7x forward revenues.","Since hitting a peak in August, many high-growth stocks have hit technical correction points, including HubSpot (HUBS) - the CRM software company that's best known for evangelizing the benefits of inbound marketing. Throughout 2019, HubSpot has produced incredibly strong financial results, its revenue growth decelerating far less than expected. The dip, in my view, gives investors a well-timed opportunity to assess the bullish case for this stock:HubSpot's bullish story rests on its balanced financial profile. Unlike many of its SaaS peers, HubSpot is a >30% y/y grower, while also managing to improve its margins. HubSpot has also long been a positive free cash flow company, and FCF has grown tremendously in the year to date. Especially amid a more uncertain market environment that keeps reacting in a whiplash fashion to the latest U.S.-China trade news, we've already seen the market rotate more toward value-oriented names that are producing reasonable bottom-line results alongside growth. HubSpot fits this bill perfectly.Of course, HubSpot wins no points for niche industry. With CRM as its flagship product, HubSpot is already playing in one of the most competitive (though largest) subsectors of the enterprise software industry, up against some of the largest titans in software such as Salesforce.com (CRM) as well as smaller startups like SageCRM. Its positioning within CRM, however, is a bit more niche - its tools revolve around the concept of ""inbound marketing,"" which focuses on targeting customers who have already taken an action to engage with a brand (by visiting a website and filling out contact details, for example). While larger applications like Salesforce can provide similar functionality, only HubSpot dedicates its product to inbound marketing - making it a thought leader in its space.HubSpot also continues to push beyond its core capabilities. As shown in the slide below, taken from the company's most recent investor deck, HubSpot has added new modules that greatly extend its TAM:Figure 1. HubSpot TAM extensionSource: HubSpot 2Q19 investor deckHubSpot's strong results validate its approach. Alongside its second-quarter results, HubSpot also raised its full-year 2019 revenue guidance to $663-$665 million, representing 29% y/y growth at the midpoint (one point higher than its previous estimate of $655.5-$658.5 million, or +28% y/y). Given HubSpot's reliable cadence of ""beat-and-raise"" quarters, there's still likely several points of opportunity on top of this raised outlook:Figure 2. HubSpot guidance updateSource: HubSpot 2Q19 earnings release With shares down sharply for no good reason, investors would be wise to scope out an entry point in HubSpot.A quick check on where HubSpot is currently trading: at current share prices around $150, HubSpot has a market cap of $6.34 billion. After netting out the $993.9 million of cash on HubSpot's balance sheet against $329.5 million of debt, we arrive at an enterprise value of $5.68 billion.Over the trailing twelve months, HubSpot has generated $590.9 million of revenue. Let's assume the company holds a 30% y/y growth rate over the next twelve months. This gives us a forward revenue estimate of $768.2 million, indicating that HubSpot is currently trading at a valuation of 7.4x EV/forward estimated revenues.While this doesn't necessarily make HubSpot a bargain stock, HubSpot is still trading significantly cheaper than its typical historical trends around 8-9x forward revenues. HubSpot is also priced several turns below other SaaS companies in the ~30% growth range, such as Zendesk (ZEN), Workday (WDAY), and Docusign (DOCU) - despite many of these companies getting hit with corrections of their own:In my view, HubSpot is worth at least 9x EV/forward revenues, implying a $180 price target and 20% upside from current levels.Let's now look at HubSpot's results over the first half of FY19:Figure 3. HubSpot 1H19 resultsSource: HubSpot 2Q19 earnings release There's a lot to like about HubSpot's financials. Revenues have grown at a 33% y/y clip in the first half of FY19 to $315.1 million, barely decelerating over the growth rates that HubSpot produced in 2018 - validating that HubSpot's TAM is wide enough to sustain its growth rates. In fact, HubSpot's revenue growth rate in Q2 accelerated 70bps over Q1's growth rate (33.2% y/y growth in Q2, vs. 32.5% y/y in Q1). We note as well that HubSpot's billings growth rate of 34% y/y was one point faster than revenue growth, reducing the risk of revenue deceleration in future quarters.Brian Halligan, HubSpot's CEO, noted on the Q2 earnings call that the company plans to accelerate sales hiring throughout the rest of 2019. Once these reps fully ramp and bear quotas, they can boost HubSpot's growth in 2020 and beyond. Per Halligan's prepared remarks on the call:Aside from new product modules and sales hiring, another big driver of HubSpot's top-line strength is international growth. HubSpot has achieved a 40% y/y mix of international revenues in Q2, and its growth CAGR of 62% y/y in international revenues since HubSpot's IPO is far faster than its overall revenue growth CAGR of 42% y/y:Figure 4. HubSpot international revenue growthSource: HubSpot 2Q19 earningsreleaseIn addition to growth, HubSpot is also a profitability story. The chart below shows how HubSpot's pro forma operating margins have gradually eased upward since its IPO, hitting a high go 8.3% (+300bps vs. 5.3% in 2Q18) in the second quarter (though inflated sales hiring will likely compress operating margin gains next quarter and beyond, before the new sales reps ramp and become net contributors to the bottom line):Figure 5. HubSpot profitability gainsSource: HubSpot 2Q19 earningsreleaseFree cash flow has also made tremendous strides. HubSpot's FCF has grown 47% y/y to $34.0 million in the year-to-date, representing a respectable 10.8% FCF margin (a 110bps improvement versus 9.7% in the year-ago period):Figure 6. HubSpot FCFSource: HubSpot 2Q19 earnings releaseBetter valuation for better results - what's not to like? I'm reversing a previously bearish call on HubSpot made late last year and going long on this fantastic CRM company. I'm hugely encouraged by the company's free cash flow gains alongside strong growth, and a ramp in sales hiring should help HubSpot to maintain >30% y/y revenue growth in the near future. Stay long here and buy the dip."

The market is pleased with its strong performance and its stock has soared to a new high.HubSpot's second quarter revenue grew 33% over the year to $163.3 million, ahead of the Street's forecast of $157.3 million and higher than the company outlook of $156.5-$157.5 million. GAAP net loss was $17.4 million, or $0.41 per share.

Total average subscription revenue per customer fell 1% over the year to $9,913. International revenues increased 41% over the year and accounted for 40% of the quarter's revenues.For the third quarter, HubSpot expects revenues of $168-$169 million with non-GAAP EPS of $0.22-$0.24. The market was looking for revenues of $167.3 million with an EPS of $0.22.Based on its strong performance, HubSpot raised its full-year guidance. For the full year, it now expects revenues of $663-$665 million with non-GAAP EPS of $1.39-$1.41. Its earlier forecast was for revenues of $655.5-$658.5 million with an EPS of $1.26-$1.30. The market was looking for revenues of $664.6 million for the year with an EPS of $1.4.HubSpot had been investing on expanding its products and making its platform even more sticky. Its strategy is to shift from an applications company to much more of a platform company. HubSpot currently offers more than 300 integrations that have been built using its integration partners. These integrations are in addition to the 10 natively built integrations.Cross-platform adoption has seen significant traction. Its multi-product customers have increased 80% from 14,000 a year ago to about 25,000. Its youngest product - the Service Hub - has surpassed 5,000 paying customers. HubSpot now plans to increase its headcount over the next couple of quarters.HubSpot also is expanding internationally. Over the past few years, it has opened offices in Ireland, Australia, Japan, Singapore, and Colombia and does business in more than 100 countries. It recently opened its ninth international office in Paris.In December last year, HubSpot also launched its own venture capital firm, HubSpot Ventures. The $30 million fund will focus on providing early stage funding for upcoming SaaS companies. Prior to setting up the VC, HubSpot had directly invested in nearly 10 start-ups. The Venture fund will now invest in startups that are aligned with its mission to help organizations grow better and add value to the ecosystem of companies benefiting from the HubSpot platform.Its stock is trading at $192.93 with a market capitalization of $8.2 billion. It had touched a 52-week high of $196.79 earlier this month. It had fallen to a 52-week low of $108.39 in December last year."
4290893,105354,2019-09-11T07:03:27-04:00,"HubSpot management is firmly focused on expanding its target market and cross-sell opportunities for the company across its three hubs.R&D focus remains strong, and the company should benefit from operating leverage as it scales.With shares trading below peers, I am optimistic on HubSpot shares at this stage.","HubSpot is a Software as a service (NASDAQ:SAAS) company focused on marketing, sales and services offerings to clients across different sizes in terms of revenue. Starting as a marketing app, the company has successfully pivoted to a full-fledged CRM platform with ~65,000 paying subscribers as of Q2 2019.The company has thus far, been focused on large enterprises but has now started to focus on small and medium scale businesses through its freemium strategy. The strategy has worked well - HubSpot has delivered solid top-line growth along with rapidly improving margins.I am bullish on HubSpot's strategic shift and expect the company to penetrate its target customer segment further and also expand its market through existing and new offerings. Shares are trading at a lower-than-industry revenue multiple and seem like a good buy at this stage.HubSpot recently highlighted its key financial and operational pillars at its Inbound 2019 event, as well as its latest strategic shift, moving from an app to a full-fledged platform catering to marketing, sales, and services needs of individuals and enterprises.Source: Pg 25 of Inbound 2019 PresentationFY2018 was a pivotal year in terms of investing in the building of this suite. Now, the suite/platform is well-equipped to cater to the needs of companies of all sizes. For now, the focus of the company will remain to increase its small and medium scale businesses (SMBs) rather than enterprise customers.I think this makes a lot of sense from a margin perspective - the cost to acquire a Starter customer is 1/10th that of a Pro/Enterprise customer.Source: Pg 45 of Inbound 2019 PresentationThe volume play seems to have worked well - the onboarding of individual and SMB users has grown rapidly in the past few quarters.Source: 10Q filingThis data points to the fact that the freemium strategy is working well. A reduction in average subscriber revenue means that the company has been able to attract a lot of first-time subscribers who are using basic lower-priced services and are expected to upgrade to the higher priced plans later. The annual recurring revenue (ARR) of customers who were once using the free features and have now moved to the paid ones is at a healthy 60%+ level.Source: Pg 17 of Inbound 2019 PresentationThe company seems to have hit a goldmine by packaging different related services to all types of customers as “layers” which interact seamlessly with each other. A customer who is already using one of the layers is likely to go for HubSpot’s other layers because of the ease of integration and awareness of the company’s UI. Moreover, even if some of the services are not available, the company has launched an app store where users can integrate apps of other companies if need be. This strategy is already showing results with a steady increase in multi-product revenue as a percentage of total revenue.Source: Pg 26 of Inbound 2019 PresentationIn addition to increasing revenue, the traction in its non-core sales and services products will help solidify the platform investment flywheel. Higher customer satisfaction and word of mouth marketing will not only increase margins due to lowered customer acquisition costs (NASDAQ:CAC), HubSpot can also reinvest the savings into building a better platform.The company has also increased its total addressable market (NYSE:TAM) by including non-marketing related hubs in its list of product offerings. I expect the addressable market opportunity to expand further as the company continues adding service layers and targets more customer segments.The company has been able to improve its profitability over the years by scaling up and gaining the benefit of operating leverage. Though the company has expanded and matured somewhat, it has maintained a focus on R&D, which has maintained at 23% of revenue. Source: 10Q filingThere will be some dips ahead - management expects FY2020 margins to be flat as compared to FY2019. One of the key contributors is the slower-than-expected pace of hiring in H1-2019, which will need to be pushed into H2-2019 and FY2020, impacting margins in future quarters.Moreover, the company is guiding toward an increase in prices across the board, which may be beneficial to the gross margin %, but it remains to be seen how elastic the company’s subscribers are vis-a-vis the price hikes. Another key segment to monitor will be the professional services business, which remains loss-making. Though the loss has reduced YoY, the company needs to focus on pricing and employee cost levers in order to increase its profitability further.Source: 10Q filingFor a company like HubSpot, which is not profitable at EBITDA or Net Margin level, EV/Sales is the default metric of comparison. Since most of the company's investments are front-loaded to develop technology and platforms, margins tend to be lower in the initial years. Comparing HubSpot’s EV/Sales multiple to its peers, it appears the company is slightly undervalued. With most of the developments highlighted in the Analyst Day being positive, I believe the company has plenty of untapped growth potential ahead. Furthermore, Hubspot's discount to peers on an EV/Sales basis is appealing despite appearing lofty at ~13x.Source: www.gurufocus.comOverall, HubSpot's freemium strategy to focus on individuals and SMBs seems to be paying off - the company has grown 35% YoY in subscribers. Further expansion into adjacent business functions through expanded offerings could pay off over the medium to long run with multi-product revenue contribution rising over the past few quarters.The continued focus on R&D is also a key positive, with HubSpot still early on its growth trajectory. If the company can continue on its current path, I believe it should be able to meet its growth and margin objectives in future. Though the EV/sales multiple is lofty at 13.0x, the relative undervaluation vs peers as well as the growth potential ahead keeps me bullish on HubSpot shares."
4292264,35181,2019-09-18T12:44:43-04:00,"HubSpot has been beaten down this September, with the stock losing almost 25%.Fundamentals are good, free cash flow is positive and rising, YoY revenue growth is 34%.Stock price is fairly valued relative to its peers. Now is a good time to invest!","The recent bearish SaaS market has produced several other opportunities in SaaS-land. I have already written an article on the stock that I consider to be the best investment around, bar none. Now I am writing about another huge opportunity, and that company is HubSpot, Inc. (HUBS). HubSpot is not far behind Alteryx (AYX) on my radar screen, having hyper-growth and expanding margins.(Source: HubSpot)This article comes at an opportune time, as the stock price has been hammered this September. HubSpot reached a high of $208 in late August but is now trading just above long-term support of $160.(Source Portfolio123/MS Paint)While it is certainly possible that HubSpot could fall below $160, I believe that it is unlikely to do so. This support level has been tested seven times already and held each time. In my opinion, the stock price resilience, combined with superb company fundamentals, makes HubSpot a great investment opportunity. I can’t find a fundamental reason why this stock has been beaten down, so my suggestion is to get in while the window of opportunity is still open.A month ago, I wrote an article on HubSpot that can be found here. In that article, I described HubSpot’s biggest product expansion in history. At that time, I felt that the company stock was overvalued and gave it a neutral rating. The recent price drop makes the stock fairly valued and a more interesting investment.In the previous article, I also concluded that the subscription dollar retention rate of 100.7% was “substandard.” As I learn more about SaaS companies, I have come to realize that one must be careful with the retention rate metric as companies that sell to small and medium-sized businesses have more customer churn than companies that sell to large organizations.(Source: HubSpot)HubSpot has a good customer onboarding strategy starting with free CRM, a starter level, then professional and enterprise subscriptions. This business model attracts small and medium-sized companies, so I am revising my stance on this issue. It is not a great concern for me anymore.I determine stock valuation on a relative basis by comparing EV/forward gross profit (GP) multiples and sales growth to the company's peers. I believe that high-growth companies should be more highly valued than slow-growth companies. After all, growth is a prime factor in valuation models such as DCF. Higher future growth results in higher valuation and, therefore, higher EV/forward GP multiple.To illustrate this point, I created a scatter plot of enterprise value/forward GP versus estimated YoY sales growth for the 93 stocks in my digital transformation stock universe.(Source: Portfolio123/MS Excel)The GP in the vertical direction is calculated using the ""next year's sales estimate"" mean value based on all analysts from the Portfolio123 database multiplied by the TTM gross margin. The estimated YoY sales growth is calculated using ""current year's sales estimate"" and ""next year's sales estimate,"" also provided by Portfolio123.As can be seen from this scatter plot, HubSpot is sitting slightly underneath the trend line, suggesting that its forward GP multiple is similar to its peers, given its estimated future revenue growth rate. My interpretation is that HubSpot is fairly valued relative to the average stock in my digital transformation universe.High-growth companies generally sacrifice profits for growth, and traditional value factors such as P/E ratio are not meaningful. Therefore, I focus on other metrics such as the ""Rule of 40%,"" free cash flow margin, and cash burn to evaluate software companies.The Rule of 40% is a metric used by software companies to help them achieve a balance between growth and profitability. The Rule of 40% is interpreted as follows: If a company's growth rate plus profit adds up to 40% or more, then the company has balanced growth and profit and is financially healthy.There are several different ways of calculating the Rule of 40%:Growth - The standard growth metric is to use the Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) growth rate. For my Rule of 40% calculation, I use percentage sales growth TTM. There are three reasons for this: (1) ARR is not always available, (2) most SaaS companies grow not only organically but also by acquisition, and (3) many companies are in the middle of a transformation to SaaS and have a significant amount of product sales.Profit - I have seen many variants for the profit metric. Some analysts use EBITDA margin, others use operational cash flow margin or free cash flow margin. I use the free cash flow margin, as I believe that is the most meaningful factor from an investor's perspective.TTM revenue growth is 33.9%, down from 57% in early 2016.HubSpot's free cash flow margin TTM is 12.4% for the most recent 12-month period and has been steadily increasing since 2015.(Source: Portfolio123)HubSpot's YoY organic revenue growth was 33.9%, while free cash flow margin for the trailing 12 months was 12.4%. Therefore:Revenue Growth + FCF margin = 33.9% + 12.4% = 46.3%Since the Rule of 40% calculation comes out higher than 40%, I conclude that the company is financially healthy.The market has been bearish with regards to SaaS stocks recently and HubSpot specifically. The attack on the share price may not be finished yet.Even a slight miss on guidance or drop in billings can result in a drastic share price revaluation.There are many digital transformation stocks with extreme valuations, and it is possible that we could have further SaaS market revaluation in the future. In this case, I would expect to see HubSpot's stock price fall along with the rest of the market.The trade dispute between President Trump and China is ongoing and has the potential to cause market turbulence or even drive the United States into a recession.Approximately 40% of HubSpot's business comes from outside the US and international growth is 62% CAGR.(Source: HubSpot)It is possible that Brexit and/or economic conditions in Europe could cause a deceleration in HubSpot’s international sales growth, but this has not happened so far. The international markets still remain an area of risk.HubSpot is one of many SaaS companies that have been caught up in rotation out of high-growth stocks by some large unknown funds. From late August to mid-September, HubSpot has lost almost 25% of its stock price. While it is possible that this stock could continue to fall, I believe that it is unlikely due to the support level of $160 which has held up seven times in the past, and the company's fundamentals, which are quite good. HubSpot easily fulfills the Rule of 40%, and I believe that the stock price is fairly valued relative to its peers. I am giving HubSpot a very bullish rating."

Billion-Dollar Unicorn HubSpot (NYSE:HUBS) continues to see rapid adoption of its services as well.HubSpot recently announced its fourth quarter results that saw revenues grow 35% over the year to $144 million, ahead of the Street's forecast of $138 million. Revenue growth was primarily driven by the 36% growth in customer base to 56,628. It ended the quarter with non-GAAP earnings of $0.37 per share, which was ahead of the market's estimate of $0.30 and recorded an impressive 208.3% growth over the year.By segment, revenues from subscription services grew 35% to $136.8 million. Professional and other services revenues also grew 49% to $7.2 million for the quarter.Among key metrics, average subscription revenue per customer fell 2.4% over the year to $10,012. Deferred revenues grew 33% to $185.5 million. Calculated billings, defined as revenues plus the change in deferred revenues grew 33% to $166.9 million. Research and development spending grew 44% over the year to $32 million in the quarter.For the year, revenues grew 37% to $513 million, and non-GAAP earnings soared 256% to $0.89.For the current quarter, HubSpot expects revenues of $146.5-$147.5 million with an EPS of $0.23-$0.25. The market was looking for revenues of $146.5 million with an EPS of $0.25. HubSpot expects to end the year with revenues of $648-$652 million with an EPS of $1.08-$1.16 compared to analyst estimates of $637.1 million with an EPS of $1.12.Over the past year, HubSpot has worked to transition from an app company to a suite company. It has continuously upgraded its platform to add other services for its customers. In the current year, HubSpot wants to continue to focus on its platform strategy. It's driving from an all-in-one suite to much more of an all-on-one platform. It realizes that while it would want companies to rely only on HubSpot's applications, modern business will ultimately rely on lots of other applications as well. Instead of pushing them all over to HubSpot, it's working to get its customers to use all of their applications with HubSpot. Today, HubSpot manages its own applications' data, workflow, and reports. In the future, it wants to manage all of its customers' front office applications' data, workflow, and report on that entire experience.As part of this focus, it recently entered into a strategic partnership with AWS (Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)). The three-year agreement will allow HubSpot to leverage AWS services to expand its platform to members of the Connect and HubSpot for Startups programs. Additionally, AWS will support HubSpot's Connect program by co-investing to build an ecosystem for HubSpot partners including content tailored to developers.Recently, HubSpot also announced the integration of LinkedIn Ads with its platform. LinkedIn ads will now be available in the Professional and Enterprise tiers of Marketing Hub as part of the HubSpot Ads tool. HubSpot Ads already included integrations with Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), enabling customers to manage all their advertising efforts within the HubSpot platform.HubSpot also has grown its products through acquisitions. While it did not make any acquisitions last year, it has acquired nine organizations to date. Some of the more recent acquisitions include AI start-ups like Motion AI and Kemvi that were added in 2017. Founded in 2015, Motion AI was a software company that developed and trained chatbots. It had raised $700,000 prior to the acquisition and was trending at annual revenues of $2 million. HubSpot integrated Motion AI's technology into the HubSpot platform to create tools that have helped users automate important tasks, scale conversations, and proactively engage with potential new customers. Terms of the acquisition were not disclosed.Kemvi was another AI-based startup acquisition. Founded in 2014, San Francisco-based Kemvi had raised $1 million to develop an AI-powered growth automation engine for B2B sales and marketing teams. It was operating at revenues of $3 million and was known for its proprietary algorithm DeepGraph, which sifts through data about buyers and prospects and delivers it to sales reps to generate sales leads. HubSpot integrated that technology into HubSpot CRM to give salespeople additional ammunition to reach out to their contacts. Terms of the acquisition were not disclosed.HubSpot has been adding smaller capital-efficient players to its portfolio to help build additional capabilities to its platform. The market is clearly impressed with the company's performance. What other companies do you think HubSpot should acquire to continue on this growth path?HubSpot was venture-funded till 2014. It had raised $100.5 million in funding from investors including CRV, Altimeter Capital, Cross Creek Advisors, Dharmesh Shah, General Catalyst Partners, Brian Shin, Mike Volpe, Matrix Partners, Scale Venture Partners, Sequoia Capital, Google Ventures, and Salesforce.com. In October 2014, it went public and raised $125 million at a valuation of $759 million.Its stock is currently trading at $169.5 with a market capitalization of $6.98 billion. It had touched a record high of $180 earlier this month soon after result announcement. It has been climbing from the 52-week low of $101.45 that it was trading at in March last year. HubSpot announced plans to offer additional common shares this year to raise $300 million."
4247701,104608,2019-03-11T07:23:39-04:00,"HubSpot has performed exceptionally well year to date even after a strong 2018 performance.Q4 revenue grew 35% and 2018 revenue growth ended up at 37%, very impressive for a company that just surpassed the $500 million revenue figure.Current valuation appears to price in a very strong 2019 performance and likely includes revenue coming in ahead of management's guidance.","HubSpot (HUBS) has been a volatile stock over the past few months, at one point down nearly 30% from their high and now up over 40% since. The stock was a big success in 2018 and is off to another hot start in 2019. The company is coming off a solid Q4 earnings report and 2019 guidance that pleased the investing community.Despite revenue growth decelerating slightly in Q3, the company reported Q4 revenue growth of 35%, the same growth rate as Q3. The nice performance in revenue growth led to a full year revenue growth of 37%, quite impressive for a company that had $513 million in revenue.Data by YChartsDespite being up over 40% year to date, investors continue to love this name and continue to push the price up higher. Although the stock is ~5% below all-time highs, the name continues to have positive momentum heading into 2019, backed by management's continued positivity around 2019 guidance.Investors quickly became very comfortable with HUBS during the most recent stock market correction. The risk/reward benefit was very positive as valuation contracted and revenue growth was still 35%+.The stock has been a winner year to date, up ~30%. This continues to remain impressive as some of the other tech names have reported okay earnings but guidance falling below consensus expectations. HUBS valuation continues to trade at a premium, although this appears to be warranted given the solid performance in 2018 and the outlook for 2019.During Q4, revenue grew 35% y/y to $144.0 million, which beat consensus estimates. I believe consensus estimates were rather weak to begin with, as HUBS posted a 38% growth rate in Q2 and 35% growth in Q3. They were likely expecting another sequential deceleration in revenue, however, HUBS posted a very solid quarter. For the full year, the company reported revenue of $513 million, which grew 35% compared to 2017.Source: Company PresentationDuring the quarter, subscription revenue grew at an impressive 35% rate and now represents 95% of total revenue. Although professional services and other revenue continues to grow at a much faster pace, at 49% during Q4, their contribution to revenue remains very minimal and does not impact the overall growth rate of the company.Source: Company PresentationDespite the company performing very well, margins have remained flattish, albeit at a very high margin. For the year, subscription margins were 86.3%, which expanded slightly from 85.8% last year. Because of their software-centric operating model and subscription-based sales, the company will continue to perform at high margin levels. This ultimately flows through to the bottom line as over time, as the company matures and gains a greater customer base, operating expenses will naturally slow down. This will lead to greater profitability and cash flow.Also during the year, the company was able to grow their customer base by 36%, ending the year at 56,628 customers. In addition, the total average subscription revenue per customer eclipsed the $10k rate, which was down 2% from the year-ago period. Part of this is because of the company's rapid customer expansion. New customers tend to have lower contract value which naturally increases over time.Source: Company PresentationPart of the company's strong revenue growth trajectory comes from their ability to expand internationally. Since Q3 2014, HUBS has been able to grow international revenues at a 65% CAGR. At the time, international revenue represented only 22% of total revenue. As of Q4, international revenue represented 38% of total revenue. As the company continues to increase internationally and further penetrating their customer's wallet, we could see revenue growth above 25% for a few more years.Source: Company PresentationManagement also provided guidance for Q1 and the full year. For Q1, management expects total revenue to be $146.5-147.5 million with operating income of $9.5-10.5 million, representing ~7% margin at the midpoint. In addition, management is expecting EPS of $0.23-0.25.For the full year, management expects revenue of $648-652 million, which represents growth of ~27% at the midpoint. The 27% revenue growth implies a somewhat significant deceleration from 37% in 2018. However, as the company's revenue has expanded to a meaningful base, deceleration is naturally going to occur. Operating income is expected to be $46-50 million, representing a 7.3% margin at the midpoint. Management is also expecting EPS of $1.08-1.16 for the full year.Source: Company PresentationManagement also provided insight into their long-term guidance. Management sees gross margins remaining in the 81-83% range, which implies a slight expansion from 2018 gross margins of 80.4%. With subscription revenue representing ~95% of total revenue and coming with higher margins, this long-term target is definitely achievable.As the company slows down their top line growth, it is natural to see operating margins expand. Management is expecting operating margins to expand to 20-25% over the long term, driven by significantly lower R&D and S&M expenses. Although these expenses will vary on a quarterly basis, over the long term, I believe the company can achieve these goals.Although valuation has contracted a bit over the past few weeks, HUBS still holds a rather high premium valuation. With management's guidance implying revenue growth of 27% for 2019, decelerating from 35% in 2018, one would expect valuation to not be so high.Data by YChartsNot too long ago, forward revenue valuation was approaching 12x, at which the stock was trading near all-time highs. However, the big stock market correction near the end of 2018 eventually caused HUBS valuation to fall below 7x. Shares were very attractive at that time as investors saw the long-term revenue growth potential and long-term path to profitability.However, with the stock back up to near all-time highs and valuation at 9.5x forward revenue, it seems as if investors are expecting a solid 2019 performance and I am not too sure if there is much upside remaining.For now, I remain on the sidelines and will wait for a better buying opportunity. For investors who currently own shares, it is worth it to hold onto them. However, with valuation rising 2-3 turns over the past few months, I would be skeptical to believe there is much room left for continued multiple expansion."
4267990,104398,2019-06-03T12:39:29-04:00,"Hubspot is the fifth secular grower in a series I introduced in March.The company uses its cloud-based platform to fuel sales and marketing capabilities for small and mid-sized businesses.The multi-year trend that started in 2014 has turned HubSpot into a true secular grower, as a first mover in what they call inbound marketing.HubSpot is highly praised by its employees and has someone at the helm recognized as one of the top founder-CEOs in America: Brian Hallighan.The company comes at a premium today, but its $7.3 billion valuation is likely to look relatively small in retrospect a few years from now.","With more than 60,000 customers and 8 office locations around the world, HubSpot (HUBS) has been an unstoppable force over the last five years, growing its top line at a CAGR of 43% since 2014.Rather than traditional outbound marketing, where companies have to fight for their potential customer's attention, HubSpot helps SMBs create valuable experiences that attract and engage prospects and customers through relevant and helpful content. They call it inbound marketing.Thanks to a freemium model offering customer relations and marketing tools, they were able to lure in new clients primarily though word-of-mouth. Today, they are able to raise their price and target larger enterprises, showing how strong their business is becoming.With all KPIs improving nicely every year since becoming public in 2014, HubSpot seems to be on an inexorable path resembling the one undertaken by Workday (WDAY), ServiceNow (NOW) or Saleforce (CRM) years ago.As the company expands its total addressable market with new services, morphing from an app to a suite to a platform over time, the upside seems outstanding for this first mover in marketing technology that still has a market cap under $8 billion. The premise of HubSpot as a compelling investment is not based on its valuation and fundamentals today, but what they may be five or ten years from now.HubSpot is already a multibagger in the App Economy Portfolio. But all recent developments, combined with its outstanding culture suggest that the company is following a true secular trend and remains a strong buy today just as much as it was back in 2014.Let's review why.This article covers the fifth company discussed in the Secular Growers Series.This series started in March with articles about Huya (HUYA) and the rise of e-sports, Baozun (BZUN) and the rise of e-commerce in China, and finally Match Group (MTCH) and Momo (MOMO) and the rise of online dating across the world.I will continue providing details on what I consider the best framework to identify, research and invest in the best secular trends the world has to offer.Going back to the definition of secular straight from Investopedia:Secular growth involves usually a constant growth of revenue and earnings above 10% over several years. The implication is usually that the trend is likely to stay the course over years to come because of the fundamental societal disruption it embodies over the long term.Here are a few examples of secular trends of the 21st century:When possible, we want to capture a secular trend that also offers a potential exponential growth, the kind of growth associated with S curves.You would typically see an exponential growth when technology is entering a sector and driving down costs, which then stimulates unit growth.SourceOf course, finding a business that is embracing a secular trend isn't sufficient. For example, the rise of online food delivery is a secular trend, but that doesn't make any food delivery service a good investment (I'm looking at you, Blue Apron (APRN)).Many secular trends are not worth exploiting to begin with, particularly the ones that don't have strong unit economics or a clear path to profitability. Martech is the blending of marketing and technology, the term for software and tech tools marketers leverage to plan, execute and measure marketing campaigns.According to Scott Brinker, author of Chief Marketing Technologist Blog and VP of Platform Ecosystem at HubSpot:Here are the three trends he's referring to: Source: ChiefMartec.comMartech would enter its second golden age in the coming five years with the ascent of platform ecosystems and blended models of software and services.Source: ChiefMartec.comHubSpot is a pioneer in inbound marketing, and the way they are evolving their successful formula to be prepared for the next wave of martech looks promising. As a first mover in the field, the company is already equipped to be a winner on the drivers of the next phase of the S curve. Let's look closer.The path described by Scott Brinker for the martech industry is the one being embraced by HubSpot.The company has shared an info-graphic of its own journey since 2006.Source: Seeking AlphaAt first, HubSpot was narrowly focused on marketing solutions (video, social media, content tools, email marketing or marketing automation). In 2014, after offering premium marketing solutions for many years, the company embraced a freemium model for its CRM suite (meetings, lead flows, conversations, lead analytics, content management).Alongside its freemium move, the company started offering sales tools (calling, email sequences, sales automation, meeting scheduling) to complement its marketing hub.Finally, it started a service hub in 2017 (ticketing, helpdesk, knowledge base, customer feedback).Adopting a freemium model has created a fantastic boost to HubSpot's customer acquisition strategy, enabling the company to reach more than 60,000 customers in Q1 FY19 (from 11,624 in Q2 FY14).Average annual subscription revenue per customer reached $9,811 in Q1 FY19 (from $8,823 end of Q2 FY14) illustrating the successful monetization strategy of its suite of services.But the ambition of the company doesn't stop here. The next phase of growth will be to transform its suite into a true platform ecosystem.Source: Seeking AlphaThis move was announced late 2018. Becoming an ecosystem involves a focus on customer experience, with full integration of apps and other third party services on a platform built in partnership with Amazon Web Services.This makes HubSpot potentially more similar to other multi-platform based ecosystems like Salesforce (CRM) or Slack (WORK). Source: Martechtoday.comManagement and culture are primordial pieces in a company's bullish case. And HubSpot simply excels on that end.Not only is Brian Halligan - of the of the two co-founders of the company and current CEO - recognized as one of the top CEOs in America by Glassdoor, HubSpot is also celebrated among the top 20 ""best places to work"" in 2019 based on employees' choice according to the most recent Glassdoor rankings.This is no small feat, as other companies ranked similarly by their own employees include absolute best-in-class companies in the US such as Bain & Company, Boston Consulting Group, McKinsey & Company, LinkedIn, Facebook (FB) , Google (GOOG) (GOOGL), Salesforce or Intuitive Surgical (ISRG).SourceBrian Halligan is highly praised by his own employees. If you want to get a feel for his personality and how it likely impacts HubSpot's culture, you can watch this recent interview he gave on Y Combinator.My favorite quote comes at the 20 minute mark:There is so much to love about HubSpot financials that I'm going to start with what I would be consider the main potential source of concern: revenue growth is decelerating.This reality needs to be understood and put in context with some of the biggest cloud services winners of the past decade. Once you pit HubSpot quarterly revenue growth trend over the years alongside those of Salesforce, Workday (WDAY) or ServiceNow (NOW), it's easy to see how revenue growth deceleration is a natural trend as revenue becomes bigger. That deceleration appears to flatten out over time and ultimately depends on future execution (new features, new partnerships, customer growth, average subscription revenue per customer, and so on).Here is the quarterly revenue growth evolution of these companies since 2014:Data by YChartsHubSpot has delivered a top line growth of 43% CAGR since becoming public in 2014. Putting this performance in context over years rather than quarters helps us see how impressive this achievement really is. Source: Martechtoday.comFuture revenue growth will be fueled by international markets, representing 39% of the company's revenue in Q1 FY19 compared to 22% back when the company IPO'd. Source: Martechtoday.comBut HubSpot is far from being simply a revenue growth story. The premium it deserves is fueled by an improvement of all KPIs over the years. SourceManagement's long term targets are an excellent way to identify the future improvements that can turn HubSpot into a much larger, much more profitable SaaS business over the years.The trends don't lie. To be able to reach an operating margin in the 20%-25% range, HubSpot is already on the right path.From 2016 to Q1 2019, you can see:Data by YChartsFor fast-growing SaaS companies with most of their business powered by recurring subscription revenue, very high gross margins and often reinvesting heavily in R&D, the long-term upside potential is astonishing.That's why they often end up looking grossly overvalued if you are using traditional valuation metrics such PE or PEG ratios.I've recently published an article about how to invest in the right SaaS using graphs. After reviewing the efficiency score (sales growth + operating margin) of a wide range of SaaS companies, my focus has been on comparing them on an EV to Sales basis. Source: Data from most recent quarter available on YCharts. Graph by App Economy Insights. Bubble size based on market capitalization as of 5/31/2019. Chart Note: some adjustments were made to the chart since my last post on 5/27/2019 - companies like Veeva Systems (VEEV), Yext (YEXT) and Zuora (ZUO) reported earnings, and MongoDB (MDB) operating margin provided by Ycharts was adjusted from (9%) to (28%) following feedback from a reader.I was able to identify a correlation between efficiency score and valuation. Performance, after all, must come at a premium.As a result, I was able to automatically generate a trend line, indicating the mid-range of SaaS valuations for any given efficiency score. As a result, HubSpot appears most similar to companies like New Relic (NEWR), Five9 (FIVN), Salesforce, Workday or ServiceNow on an efficiency basis. These five companies have EV to Sales multiples ranging from 9 to 17.HubSpot is right in the middle, with an EV of 12 times trailing sales.Data by YChartsIt's fascinating to realize that over the last five years, most of these companies have maintained an EV over 8 times sales, even during the broad market sell-off in late 2019.Does it make HubSpot cheap? Certainly not. But it makes it somewhat appropriately priced if you believe in the SaaS model eventually generating some of the biggest winners of the 21st century in our digital economy.Back in 2011, Fred Wilson was suggesting that a SaaS revenue multiple should roughly be 5x this year's revenue and 4x next year's revenue. Eight years later, the median SaaS revenue multiples are hovering around 10x this year's revenue, about twice as much - and HubSpot is no exception. Of course, not all SaaS are equal and HubSpot could be considered a best-in-class business and naturally be valued at a premium. With a top line growing at 43% CAGR over the last five years (and 33% in the most recent quarter), any valuation based on revenue multiple today could really turn out to be relatively small a few years from now.Again, the bull case around HubSpot is not based on its valuation today, but what it could be a few years from now.Since its 2014 IPO, HubSpot shares rarely fell very far from their recent high, with the exception of early 2016 and late 2018, in sync with market sell-offs.As of this writing, the shares are 10% from their all-time-high.Data by YChartsFirst, HubSpot's generous valuation could prove to be problematic if its top-line growth slows down more than anticipated by the market in the coming quarters. It could also face a much larger draw-down than the indexes should a broad market sell-off occur and you should expect volatility.Second, the company is investing in its future aggressively. For example, HubSpot has issued $350 million in convertible debt in 2017 that are due on 2022. This could generate future dilution should the company's cash flow generation slow down.Third, while HubSpot has an edge with its freemium platform and has been able to generate a fantastic word-of-mouth, other large CRM companies like Saleforce (as illustrated by its acquisition and integration of Pardot) as well as smaller low-price offerings could challenge HubSpot leadership over time.SourceHubSpot is far from being a sure bet. But its trajectory is the one of a true secular grower that embarked almost five years ago on a journey that created tremendous value for its customers, employees and shareholders alike.Even at its current stretched valuation, matching the historical revenue multiple of the best-of-breed SaaS, I believe buying shares today will be handsomely rewarded for those who have years to let the story play out."
4227625,22227,2018-12-11T09:33:04-05:00,"HubSpot is predicted to surpass revenue of $500 million in 2018 after posting revenue of $375 million last year.
        HubSpot was able to deliver a stellar EPS beat last quarter posting 17 cents when the consensus was a minuscule 5 cents, beating the forecast by more than three times.
        HubSpot grew its customer base 40% YOY to over 52,500.","If you are on the prowl for a cloud-based software company with super-charged growth that is still in the early stages, then I have the one for you.HubSpot (HUBS) sells online marketing software.They are the one-stop for CRM (client relationship management), email and sales automation, pretty landing pages, social media marketing, keyword research, website analytics, and lead generation tools all on one platform.In general, HubSpot targets the SMEs (small and medium enterprises) and offers an intuitively designed product adding value to over 50,000 firms.They even have a freemium package allowing newbies to sample the power the software tools possess.This service starts its pricing at $50 per month for the basic package and it may not seem like much.But then there are the add-ons that guarantee lead to a wave of additional upselling - a boon to quarterly revenue.The initial price base is usually followed with price increases into the thousands because business needs more contacts to slot into its data silos and features to harness elaborate marketing campaigns.This is all the cost of doing business and signals that HubSpot has the ability to carve out even more revenue than the starter packages they offer.If companies are moaning about the boost in costs, I would lash back and say the added costs are warranted because of the enticing surge in productivity that scaling and better tools offer marketers leading to higher performance.Plus, HubSpot isn’t the only cloud-based software company offering add-on tools to massage the customer’s demands.These demands are multiplying by the day as marketing software becomes more complicated and sellers require hybrid-solutions to seal the deal with the end-buyer.Sequentially, HubSpot’s revenue is expanding ferociously up 35% from last quarter.On a 3-year basis, HubSpot has demonstrated it can uphold a furious pace of growth averaging a 42% growth rate during this time.The company is still smallish with a market capitalization of $5 billion, but that won’t last for long as revenue expansion will reward shareholders with a higher share price.Some of the positives from this marketing software are that its quality is highly competitive with other industry players such as Infusionsoft.There will be certain companies that fit different software as marketing software is incredibly diverse.The way that developers approach certain tools will naturally result in a different product altogether.Specifically, I favor the centralization of HubSpot’s tools.The holistic nature of HubSpot’s software makes the sum of the parts more valuable.Online marketing is not just a one-day fly-by-night operation. Industry professionals would admit it’s an arduous grind. They must commit to one platform because HubSpot has made it hard to hop around.Specifically, I like that HubSpot locks up companies with 1-year contracts instead of a rolling month-to-month contract that encourages companies to jump ship whenever there is an incremental upgrade elsewhere.This has the effect of smoothing over revenue with the recurring billing helping the CFO plan the future allocation of the company and, most importantly, retaining its core customer base.HubSpot also charges for technical support topping up its revenue by deciding to avoid giving this service for free. Professional guidance shouldn’t be free and, in digital marketing, you pay for what you get, period.Catering towards its lower-end customers, HubSpot offers a comprehensive training and extensive support material making the platform easy to maneuver around from the get-go.HubSpot is also integrated into Salesforce showing that it doesn’t have to be the star of the show all the time but can play the role of supporting actor just as well.Revenue is revenue.But I would personally go even further and claim that HubSpot’s functionality not only blows Infusionsoft’s, an online marketing competitor, out of the water, but it pushes omnipotent Salesforce (CRM) to its limits.All of this means that HubSpot is predicted to surpass revenue of $500 million in 2018 after posting revenue of $375 million last year.HubSpot doubled sales revenue in just two years.Even though they are expanding from a small base and is blown out of the water by Salesforce on this metric, they are doing exactly what companies this size should be doing in the tech industry.Stalling growth like over at Venice Beach at Snapchat’s (SNAP) headquarter is a bona fide red flag.Accelerating revenue is the most pivotal deal-clincher for investors and separates the men between the boys.Technology is one of the few industries in the economy that have a panoply of companies able to accomplish this feat.Like it or not, online marketing is one section of tech that is not going away.Have you realized the heavy stream of emails alerting you to different services and products?There is a high chance those emails originated from HubSpot and this trend is not going away.Marketing email volume will only climb until the cost of emails rises substantially which I highly doubt.Technology is getting cheaper and so is the cost of running a business because of this technology.Being able to offer poignant tools to its customer base has led to a heavy dose of R&D spending increasing 63% YOY. Even with these higher expenses, HubSpot was able to deliver a stellar EPS beat last quarter posting 17 cents when the consensus was a minuscule 5 cents, beating the forecast by more than three times.The future looks rosy for this company because we are just in the early innings of the digital revolution for smaller companies.They will have to migrate or die out.Even the IT staff at the Mad Hedge Fund Trader has integrated HubSpot into our bevy of software tools and there are no complaints.The bottom line is that HubSpot grew its customer base 40% YOY to over 52,500.That is hard to beat.On the downside, lower average revenue per customer is a concern. The 4% drop is not in tune to what growth companies should demonstrate but I believe the reacceleration of investment into its marketing tools will bear fruit and elevate this dragging number.That being said, the $9,959 per customer is not a shabby figure at all, and a certain reversion to the mean was due to take place at some point. I would be worried if this drop happened at a much lower average number.When you delve deeper into the numbers, it appears as if the culprit was HubSpot offering too many teaser starter packages to lure in new business.Therefore, a slight pricing hiccup for this online marketing company is a one-off and can easily be rectified by upselling its pricing packages from a more advantageous starting point.HubSpot doesn’t need to dig deeper into the lower end of the bush league and pull out all the nasties.Moving forward, the roadmap looks fruitful as HubSpot plans to migrate from the smaller companies to higher end and more lucrative business boding well for margin expansion and future average revenue per customer.This will feedback growing capital into its R&D to develop even more shiny tools for these more advanced marketers.Shares of HubSpot are a little frothy at this point, and if shares pull back to $120, it would serve as a premium entry point.Online marketing works well and new business will be up for grabs as a whole slew of companies pivot towards online marketing giving HubSpot a chance to slice off another massive chunk of business powering up annual revenue.If you have a small business and are considering traversing into the world of online marketing, then visit HubSpot’s website at HubSpot | Inbound Marketing, Sales, and Service Software"
4228738,104952,2018-12-17T11:57:23-05:00,"As the ticker has indicated, Salesforce (CRM) has become synonymous to the CRM market. Most investors buy Salesforce stocks to gain exposure into the CRM market.
        Salesforce went public in 2004 at $4.08/share. With today's price of $138/share and YoY growth of 28.5%, it's become one of the most valuable companies in the technology sector.
        Its competitors, Zendesk (ZEN) and Hubspot (HUBS), develop leading enterprise products for different CRM market segments and provide very compelling alternative investing opportunities to Salesforce (CRM).
        Our relative valuation approach (P/forward ARR + rule of 40%) has indicated that ZEN and HUBS are undervalued and overlooked opportunities today.","Founded in 1999, Salesforce (CRM) was one of the pioneers of SaaS (Software as a Service) or cloud delivery model for business software application. It is so revolutionary due to three key reasons:As the ticker may have pointed out, Salesforce is the epitome of CRM (Customer Relationship Management) market. Further, it has quickly transformed itself into a full enterprise cloud computing platform through acquisitions of then fast-growing startups in its adjacent markets such as Desk.com, RelateIQ, ExactTarget, and Radian6.(Source: Gurufocus. CRM YoY price/share growth)Salesforce went public in 2004 at $4.08/share. It trades today at around $138/share, which is a 28.5% YoY growth. A $10,000 investment at the time of its IPO would be worth close to $350,000 today. We have been a long-term investor in the technology sector and getting the exposure to CRM through our ETF position in VGT (NYSEARCA: VGT). We believe that cloud software is one of the most beautiful business models in the world today. It leverages a low-cost cloud delivery model to achieve a strong and predictable cash flow generation. There are huge upside opportunities as the global enterprise cloud adoption increases in the next decades. In particular, we feel that Zendesk (ZEN) and HubSpot (HUBS) serve as compelling alternative investment opportunities to Salesforce (CRM). We believe that these companies are undervalued and overlooked today despite their amazing potentials.Every enterprise cloud CRM software company leverages three primary methods to grow their sales:There are three main segments in the cloud CRM market: Sales, Service/Support, and Marketing cloud. Salesforce has secured the largest market-share for the sales cloud. Likewise, Zendesk and Hubspot have led the segments for enterprise customer service and marketing cloud respectively.(Source: Salesforce homepage)Except for Salesforce and Hubspot, which reports two separate revenue streams from both “subscription” of their core cloud software products and “professional services and other”, Zendesk’s professional services revenue isn’t significant enough to be reported as a separate segment. On average, professional services make up about 7.3% and 6.5% of Salesforce and Hubspot total revenues respectively.(Source: Author. Salesforce 2018 10-K Filing)(Source: Author. Zendesk 2017 10-K Filing)(Source: Author. Hubspot 2018 10-K Filing)Such trends indicate that Zendesk and Hubspot still have upside potentials to expand into other enterprise segments to grab some of Salesforce’s marketshare in the next few years. Indeed, we’re seeing a major trend where all competitors are moving towards building a more complete cloud CRM offering. In other words, convenience appears to have strongly driven the decision for businesses when choosing the cloud CRM vendor.(Source: Zendesk homepage)For Zendesk, that would be the pivotal moment where they would start generating more significant professional services revenue to increase adoptions of their upcoming products through cross- and up-selling. Zendesk recently acquired Salesforce’s fierce competitor Base CRM in September to start their march into Salesforce’s territory. Hubspot made a similar move by launching their own cloud customer service helpdesk and sales CRM software targeting small businesses.(Source: Hubspot homepage)This indicates Hubspot’s serious intention to acquire some shares in their competitors’ market while expanding downmarket to serve small business segments. Looking at Hubspot’s “professional services and other” revenue segment, it has also become clearer that Hubspot is taking this direction; while the segment has increased in absolute terms, its shares of the total revenue has declined by almost 300 basis points in the last two years.Hubspot and Zendesk went public in the same year in 2014. Zendesk’s price/share was $14.34 and Hubspot’s was $29.08. The realized CAGRs for both are about 66% and 62% respectively.(Source: GuruFocus. All-time price/share of CRM, ZEN, and HUBS)Venture capital firms primarily look at the subscription booking called ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue) or MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue) when evaluating a potential cloud software deal. In the revenue portion of the income statement, this goes under the “subscription” revenue. This is why we love the cloud software model. A typical cloud software company generates cash in advance that recurs either monthly or annually through subscription contract. At the same time, it is able to maintain strong unit economies of scale leveraging 3rd party low-cost cloud infrastructure such as Amazon (AMZN) AWS to serve its software applications.For us, metrics such as net income or EBITDA is less relevant when we look at this type of companies.Traditional investors usually place a high valuation on these companies’ ability to generate future cash flows. As we can see, as smaller cap competitors, Hubspot’s and Zendesk’s P/FCF trade at 2 to 2.5 times higher against Salesforce’s P/FCF.However, as an experienced cloud software investors, we typically look at other indicators as well: The rule of 40% and ARR run rate (proxy to forward ARR). The rule of 40% was introduced by Brad Feld, who is an early investor at Zynga, Fitbit, and tech incubator TechStars. Rule of 40% serves as a benchmark when measuring the health of a cloud software company. It simply means that a healthy cloud software company should have at least a recurring revenue growth rate + margin that equals to 40%. So, how do these companies compare based on these metrics?(Source: Author. Rule of 40% using Gross and FCF margin%)This confirms our hypothesis that Zendesk and Hubspot are both overlooked by traditional investors. All companies have passed the 40% rule. Yet, we see that Zendesk and Hubspot fare better than Salesforce when we applied 40% rules using both gross margin and FCF margin. In addition to having a similar size, Hubspot and Zendesk also seem to be in a similar state of growth.Both have been able to grow their ARRs significantly through reinvestment into new growth opportunities which would take their FCF margin converging to Salesforce's level in the long term.In particular, we like the fact that both companies have launched initiatives to get into the emerging markets. The New Zendesk's WhatsApp integration, for instance, would be a game changer in regions such as Asia Pacific and Latin America where many small and medium businesses serve their customer requests through WhatsApp chats. As many customers in the emerging markets are much more price-sensitive, Hubspot, on the other hand, has taken the bottom-up approach since 2016 by launching the freemium version of their softwares. This would enable them to acquire small and medium businesses that could convert into premium users as they grow. These are the upside cases of our thesis.We further look how these companies compare in terms of valuation using forward ARR. We calculate forward ARR by growing the end of FY 2017’s subscription-only revenue segment by the average subscription-only revenue growth rate over the last two years preceding 2017.(Source: Author. Comparison of valuation multiples using P/forward ARR and P/FCF)By using P/forward ARR multiples instead of P/FCF, we’d see that the market valuations for all three companies are not that far apart. Zendesk and Hubspot are valued close to Salesforce’s P/forward ARR level despite their current growth rate. This, again, confirms our hypothesis that Zendesk and Hubspot are undervalued today.Cloud enterprise CRM software market has always been and will be a very interesting market for us. With $107.2 billion market cap, many people would believe that Salesforce will have a hard time to grow faster than its 28.5% historical growth rate in the future. While we don’t fully believe that’s the case, we do believe that Hubspot and Zendesk are both very interesting long opportunities that. We have confirmed our hypothesis that both are overlooked and undervalued based on our assessments today. Further, both provide Salesforce-like growth potential as the market is trending towards convergence of full stack cloud sales, marketing, and service enterprise software offerings in the next few years."
4226892,104608,2018-12-06T20:40:37-05:00,"HubSpot remains one of the best stock for the year, up 40% year to date, despite being down 20% from the recent highs.
        Q3 revenue grew 35% y/y to $131.8 million, which beat consensus estimates for $126.7 million, or 30% y/y growth.
        Valuation appears to be a bit excessive, trading at nearly 10x forward revenue despite the peer group trading closer to 5-6x forward revenue; we could see a downward re-rating soon.","HubSpot (HUBS) has remained a volatile stock for most of the year, up nearly 40% year to date, however, down nearly 20% from their all-time highs. The stock was a huge success for most of the year, up nearly 70% at the high point, however, the stock has been in a downward trend since mid-September and a reversal seems challenging at this point.HUBS reported a relatively strong Q3 earnings report in September, beating consensus estimates for both revenue and EPS. However, the company did admit their growth rate is slowing down, albeit from a revenue growth rate of ~35%. At this point, it appears investors have baked in a slowdown in growth, which should ultimately be appropriate for a company growing at this fast of a rate.After contracting ~20% over the past few weeks along with the broader tech market sell-off, HUBS is warming up to be a solid investment. Although valuation remains elevated compared to their peer group, HUBS revenue and billings growth of 30-35% remains impressive. Investors may be more comfortable with this name after the recent correction, although the stock may still have more downside risk than upside reward due to their premium valuation.The stock remains a year to date winner, still up 40%. This remains impressive given after the large tech sell-off, many of the leading technology names went flat to negative for the year. A lot of the outperformance by HUBS is due to their premium valuation. Their valuation has expanded to nearly 10x forward revenue, which ultimately may not hold up for the long-term, especially as revenue growth begins to slowdown and the stock goes through a re-rating process.During Q3, revenue grew 35% y/y to $131.8 million, which beat consensus estimates for $126.7 million, or 30% y/y growth. I believe consensus estimates were rather weak to begin with, as HUBS posted a 38% growth rate in Q2. This essentially means consensus was baking in an 800bps deceleration in growth. The large difference between consensus estimates of 30% y/y growth and HUBS Q2 revenue growth of 38% y/y led to what appeared to be a large Q3 beat. To date, revenue growth has slowed from 39% in Q1 to 35% in Q3, a troubling sign for a company who has consistently traded at a 9-10x forward revenue multiple.Source: Company PresentationBillings for the quarter remained flat, growing 32% y/y to $140.7 million. The company noted currency had a 2% headwind for billings, meaning billings would have grown 34% if there was no currency impact. For the second quarter in a row, billings grew at a lower rate than revenue and remained at 32% y/y growth. Essentially, if billings continues to grow at a lower rate than revenue, we should begin to see the revenue growth rate decelerate closer to billings.On the earnings call, HUBS CFO noted that currency would continue to be a negative impact for the foreseeable future including 1-2% impact to revenue in Q4. She also noted that currency was a 4% benefit in Q1 and Q2 and was roughly neutral in Q3.Billings are essentially the growth driver of revenue and represent the pipeline for revenue growth over the next 12 months. When billings start to decelerate, it is only a matter of time before revenue follows suit. Typically, higher growth tech names are valued on revenue growth and when investors begin to feel billings slow down, valuation tends to take a hit.Source: Company PresentationDuring Q3, HUBS remained on track with the operating margins and cash flow targets. Operating margin improved nearly 400bps to 4.4%, compared to 0.5% in the year ago period. Although they saw revenue grow decelerate ~300bps, they saw a greater expansion in the operating margin, a strong positive exiting the quarter. In addition, cash flow from operations grew 48% y/y, significantly faster than the 35% revenue growth. Strong operating cash flow of $11.5 million ultimately led to free cash flow of $3.2 million.The combination of slower revenue growth but much larger profitability margins led to HUBS reporting Q3 EPS of $0.17, significantly beating consensus estimates of $0.05.Source: Company PresentationManagement also provided updated guidance, including Q4 revenue of $137 million at the midpoint (29% y/y growth) and EPS of $0.30. Both of these metrics were slightly ahead of consensus, however, I believe revenue growth of 29% y/y at the midpoint remains conservative. At this growth rate, revenue would decelerate another 600bps compared to 300bps deceleration in Q3. If revenue growth were to slow down this much, I believe investors would look to re-rate valuation a few multiple points lower.For the full year, management now expects revenue of $505.5-506.5 million (up from $496.8-498.8, or ~$8 million at the midpoint) and EPS of $0.80-0.82 (up from $0.63-0.67). Free cash flow guidance also improved to $39-40 million, up from $34-35 million from the previous guidance range.Although valuation has contracted a bit over the past few weeks, HUBS still holds a rather high premium valuation. With growth decelerating from 39% in Q1 to 35% in Q3 and management guiding further deceleration in Q4, the stock may begin to re-rate downward closer to their peer group. In the past, HUBS posted 40%+ y/y revenue growth and was deserving of a 10x+ revenue multiple, however, it appears the days of rapid growth are nearly over and investors need to take a closer look at valuation.For their peer group, I looked at other tech companies growing revenue in the mid-30’s and relatively neutral profitability, including Talend (TLND), Apptio (APTI), and Instructure (INST).HUBS' valuation has been relatively volatile over the past few months, however it remains well above the selected peer group. I believe as revenue growth ultimately slows down over the next few quarters, we could see valuation contract a few multiple points and end up closer to 6-7x forward revenue rather than the current 9-10x valuation.Despite valuation coming down over the past few weeks, so has the rest of the tech market. HUBS continues to trade at a rather high premium valuation and with revenue guidance demonstrating further slowdown, investors should be cautious building a position at this level. I believe the company will have a lot of long-term success, however, the current stock price is reflective of strong mid-30% revenue growth and improved profitability.With the upcoming Q4 earnings report, management will guide to the 2019 fiscal year, which will be significant in terms of where they believe their revenue growth can go. If management is able to guide revenue growth near 35%, I believe the stock will continue to trade at a premium. However, if management believes revenue growth may continue to decelerate into 2019, the stock appears to have greater downside risk than upside reward."
4286307,35181,2019-08-16T14:20:35-04:00,"HubSpot is a digital transformation company offering a platform for CRM, marketing, sales and service tools.They completed a significant product expansion but it hasn't shown up in terms of revenue growth.Total subscription dollar retention rate is substandard.Stock price is overvalued and this is a high beta stock. It is a bad time to buy.","HubSpot, Inc. (HUBS) is a high-growth multi-purpose SaaS company dedicated to business transformation. Targeting companies with 2 to 2,000 employees, HubSpot has more than 60,000 customers in 100+ countries that use their platform, which includes a marketing hub, sales hub, service hub, and free CRM.(Source: HubSpot)While HubSpot has historically been a very successful investment story, I have some concerns going forward. First of all, the company completed a major product development initiative in the last year. But the result has been a deceleration of revenue growth. Second, despite multiple products and hundreds of third-party apps, HubSpot has a total subscription dollar retention rate of less than 101%. In my research of SaaS companies, I have discovered many companies with greater than 120% total subscription dollar retention rate. I consider 101% to be substandard. Either HubSpot doesn’t have sticky products or there isn’t much cross-selling going on, or a combination of both.My third issue is that, by management’s own admission, they haven’t been staffing up as fast as they wanted to, but they are taking corrective action. It has been my observation from analyzing other SaaS firms that it takes up to a year for a ramp-up in sales and marketing to have an effect. Therefore, I believe that understaffing has likely impacted sales and will continue to impact sales for the next few quarters.In addition to the concerns mentioned above, I find that HubSpot's stock price is overvalued relative to its SaaS peers. Given that this is a high-beta stock and that market conditions are quite volatile at present, I have given HubSpot a neutral rating.I determine stock valuation on a relative basis by comparing sales multiples and sales growth to the company's peers. I believe that high-growth companies should be more highly valued than slow-growth companies. After all, growth is a prime factor in valuation models such as DCF. Higher future growth results in higher valuation and, therefore, higher EV/sales multiple.To illustrate this point, I created a scatter plot of enterprise value/forward sales versus estimated YoY sales growth for the 82 stocks in my digital transformation stock universe.(Source: Portfolio123/MS Excel)The sales multiple in the vertical direction is calculated using the EV, ""next year's sales estimate"" mean value based on all analysts from the Portfolio123 database. The estimated YoY sales growth is calculated using ""current year's sales estimate"" and ""next year's sales estimate"" also provided by Portfolio123.As can be seen from this scatter plot, HubSpot is sitting above the trend line, suggesting that its forward sales multiple is higher than its peers, given its estimated future revenue growth rate. My interpretation is that HubSpot is overvalued relative to the average stock in my digital transformation universe.High-growth companies generally sacrifice profits for growth, and traditional value factors such as P/E ratio are not meaningful. Therefore, I focus on other metrics such as the ""Rule of 40,"" free cash flow margin, and cash burn to evaluate software companies.The Rule of 40 is a metric used by software companies to help them achieve a balance between growth and profitability. The Rule of 40 is interpreted as follows: If a company's growth rate plus profit adds up to 40% or more, then the company has balanced growth and profit and is financially healthy.There are several different ways of calculating the Rule of 40:Growth - The standard growth metric is to use the Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) growth rate. For my Rule of 40 calculation, I use percentage sales growth TTM. There are three reasons for this: (1) ARR is not always available, (2) most SaaS companies grow not only organically but also by acquisition, and (3) many companies are in the middle of a transformation to SaaS and have a significant amount of product sales.Profit - I have seen many variants for the profit metric. Some analysts use EBITDA margin, others use operational cash flow margin or free cash flow margin. I use the free cash flow margin, as I believe that is the most meaningful factor from an investor perspective.HubSpot's revenue grew by 33.9% for the most recent twelve months, falling from a high of 57% revenue growth in 2016. I will discuss the significance of the decelerating revenue growth later in this article.(Source: Portfolio123)HubSpot had a free cash flow margin of 13.7% for the most recent twelve-month period. The free cash flow margin has been steadily rising since at least 2015.(Source: Portfolio123)HubSpot's YoY revenue growth was 33.9%, while free cash flow margin for the trailing twelve months was 13.7%. Therefore:Revenue Growth + FCF margin = 33.9% + 13.7% = 47.6%Since the Rule of 40 calculation comes out higher than 40%, I conclude that the company is financially healthy.Normally, when a company fulfills the Rule of 40, I don't analyze cash burn. But I am providing the SG&A expense here for reference. HubSpot is burning cash. One can tell by examining the SG&A expense relative to sales.Note that SG&A includes Sales & Marketing, General & Administrative, and R&D.(Source: Portfolio123)In the case of HubSpot, the SG&A expense is 89% of the total revenues. This means that HubSpot is almost spending as much on SG&A as its revenue intake. Another way to look at this is to create a scatter plot that shows the operating margin/EV versus forward sales growth for SaaS stocks. The operating margin for my purposes is calculated as follows:Operating Margin = Gross Margin TTM - SG&A Expense Margin TTM(Source: Portfolio123/MS Excel)The operating margin is slightly above the trend line, suggesting that cash burn is in line with its peers.In the words of the CEO during the most recent earnings call:(Source: HubSpot)But the aftermath of this major effort has resulted in sales growth deceleration. Don’t get me wrong. 33.9% revenue growth is pretty good, but nowhere near the 57% growth from three years ago. Slowing revenue growth hasn't been due to the company getting large. HubSpot sales are less than $600 million per year. Compare this to competitor salesforce.com (CRM) which has 26% revenue growth and $14 billion in sales.From the HubSpot annual report:(Source: HubSpot annual report)The total subscription dollar retention rate is 100.7%. It is calculated based on monthly dollar retention then annualized. This figure implies that HubSpot is losing a fair number of customers and barely compensating via cross-selling to its remaining customers. In short, growth is occurring by bringing in new customers, not by retaining and cross-selling existing customers.In the competitive environment that HubSpot operates in, the inability to grow revenue from existing customers could become a significant problem.I am introducing a new scatter plot that examines a stock's 1-year beta versus forward revenue growth. It turns out that beta is more-or-less linearly correlated to revenue growth as shown below.HubSpot scatterplot of beta versus forward sales growth(Source: Portfolio123/MS Excel)HubSpot has a beta of 1.96, meaning that the stock's volatility is much higher than the S&P 500 index. In the current market environment, with the ongoing China trade issues and seasonality, August-October, a period that tends to be the worst period of time for stock markets, I don't feel that it is wise to invest in HubSpot as losses could be substantial if there is a significant market correction. It is better to wait until the November time frame and re-evaluate the situation.HubSpot is a high growth SaaS company that I should like, but I don't like due to some issues that I have with the company. They have completed a major product expansion but the result has been decelerating revenue growth. The SaaS metric total subscription dollar retention rate is a paltry 100.7%, meaning they are barely holding onto customers. The revenue growth is a result of bringing in new customers and this could be a problem considering the considerable competition in the markets that HubSpot operates in. In addition, HubSpot has not been ramping up staff as per their plan to grow the employee base at the same pace as sales. This will likely impact growth for the next few quarters.While the company easily fulfills the SaaS Rule of 40, I consider HubSpot to be somewhat overvalued. The stock has a high beta of almost 2 and could suffer if there is a significant market correction. This is quite a possibility, given the current volatile stock market conditions. I have to give HubSpot a neutral rating for the above reasons."

Cambridge, Mass.-based HubSpot (NYSE:HUBS) is a leading player in the inbound marketing campaigns segment and recently reported a strong quarter.For the recently announced first quarter results, HubSpot's revenues grew 33% over the year to $151.8 million, ahead of the Street's forecast of $148 million and higher than the management's outlook of $146.5-$147.5 million. Growth was primarily driven by the 36% growth in customer base to 56,628. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.37, up an impressive 208.3% and ahead of the market's estimate of $0.30.By segment, subscription revenues grew 33% to $144.2 million and Professional services and other revenues grew 27% over the year to $7.6 million.Among other operating metrics, total average subscription revenue per customer fell 2% over the year to $9,811.

Recently it announced that it had achieved Amazon Web Services' (NASDAQ:AMZN) Digital Customer Experience Competency status for Marketing Automation. The designation makes HubSpot a member of the Amazon Partner Network, thus certifying that it possesses deep AWS expertise and can deliver solutions seamlessly on AWS.Recently, HubSpot also announced that it had integrated its service with LinkedIn so that LinkedIn ads are now available in the Professional and Enterprise tiers of Marketing Hub as part of the HubSpot Ads tool. HubSpot's customers will now be able to target ads at their ideal customer across the buyer's entire journey. Customers will be able to automatically sync, de-dupe, and nurture any new leads from LinkedIn's Lead Gen ads to the HubSpot CRM, analyze LinkedIn ad spend with true ROI reporting, and align LinkedIn ads with the rest of the company's marketing efforts within HubSpot. HubSpot Ads had earlier included integrations with Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL).HubSpot is driving growth by focusing on its API strategy. To help its customers leverage the explosion of SaaS applications, it's working toward building a platform that can plug all these applications and orchestrate all of them to create a seamless experience. HubSpot currently offers more than 300 integrations that have been built using its integration partners. These integrations are in addition to the 10 natively built integrations.HubSpot's analysis reveals that an average HubSpot customer integrates five different applications into HubSpot.

4224869,103480,2018-11-27T14:36:30-05:00,"Shares of HubSpot have traded sharply lower after reporting third-quarter results.Despite beating Wall Street's estimates on both the top and bottom line, revenue growth slowed down yet again to 35% y/y this quarter.In addition, weak billings growth of 32% y/y persisted, causing concern that HubSpot's deceleration pattern will continue.On the plus side, HubSpot was able to modestly improve profit margins and free cash flow.","HubSpot's (HUBS) best days, in my opinion, are behind it. After a sharp rally earlier in the year that at one point gave investors a 2x gain on HubSpot, the stock is now trading in a downtrend that puts it 30% below highs. Unfortunately, a return to peak values is unlikely for HubSpot in the near term.Many of HubSpot's SaaS peers saw sharp corrections in the months of October and November. For a SaaS stock to be down 30% or 40% from peak is not unusual - but in HubSpot's case, there is fundamental backing for the poor stock performance, whereas many of its peers are down due to mere pessimism. HubSpot just released third-quarter results, and while HubSpot was able to beat Wall Street's expectations on both revenue and EPS, the company essentially confirmed that its growth is slowing down. Shares fell 5% after that earnings report, and are now down nearly 20% since:HUBS data by YChartsIn my view, HubSpot is undergoing what is commonly known as a multiples re-rating. After recognizing that HubSpot's growth is no longer in the mid-40% range as it was last year, the market can no longer value HubSpot's revenue stream as richly as it once did. This stock - which once traded at double-digit revenue multiples - has now seen that multiple compress to 8.6x forward revenues, as seen in the chart above.That's not cheap yet, either. Plenty of SaaS companies share HubSpot's financial profile - mid-30s growth rate, plus positive cash flow or getting near breakeven. Here's a look at where several of these peers are trading:TLND EV to Revenues (Forward) data by YChartsIn the face of substantial deceleration, HubSpot's correction still has a long way to go. Even after falling precipitously since its earnings release, HubSpot is still up 33% year-to-date, while many tech stocks are now down for the year. Valuations have become extremely important as the markets return to volatility and investors flee richly-valued stocks.This being said, HubSpot still remains a fantastic company. It has distinguished itself among CRM players as the only company to focus on inbound marketing - and, judging by its continually growing customer counts, HubSpot's niche is resonating well with its target market. This is no doubt a company that will continue growing for many years - just not as quickly as in the past.The best move for investors now is to trade in HubSpot for another, cheaper growth SaaS stock - Talend (TLND), Avalara (AVLR), and Cloudera (CLDR) are names I'm partial to at the moment. These companies' relatively low valuations will give them head room for a rebound, whereas HubSpot is capped by the dual dangers of a high valuation and deceleration growth.Here's a glance at HubSpot's most recent quarterly results:Figure 1. HubSpot 3Q18 resultsSource: HubSpot earnings releaseRevenues grew 35% y/y to $131.8 million, beating Wall Street's expectations of $126.7 million (+30% y/y) by a healthy five-point margin. The problem, however, is that revenue growth decelerated three points from 38% y/y growth in Q2 - which, in turn, had also decelerated one point from Q1. HubSpot's high valuation has always been predicated somewhat on the company's ability to maintain its growth rate - but now, that confidence in HubSpot has begun to diminish.There's another new problem in the quarter to surface: though HubSpot continued to grow its customer base (ending the quarter with just over 52k customers, up 40% y/y), its average subscription revenues per customer weakened by -4% y/y to $9,959. HubSpot reports this metric every quarter, and it is rarely ever negative. The company's CFO attributes the loss to a stronger-than-expected growth in new customers to the Marketing Hub Starter product (who typically subscribe in lower dollar values than long-entrenched customers), but HubSpot was always able to overcome this in the past.Making matters worse, HubSpot's billings picture didn't show any signs of curing. Recall that last quarter, investors sent shares of HubSpot down more than 10% (this occurred before the October pullback, so a 10% decline for a growth stock like HubSpot was rather jarring) due to a perception of weak billings. Recall that for a SaaS software company, billings essentially represents the revenue pipeline for the next twelve months within the existing installed base, and is the single best indicator of future revenue growth.In Q2, investors had punished HubSpot for 32% y/y billings growth. This quarter, too, HubSpot achieved 32% y/y growth in billings to $140.7 million. The company continued to blame FX headwinds for the billings slowdown (without which billings growth would have been 34% y/y). The fact that HubSpot has persistently produced 32% y/y billings growth for the past two quarters, however, essentially dictates that revenue growth will taper off to that level relatively quickly.It's worth noting as well that HubSpot's CFO, Kate Bueker, warned analysts on the Q3 earnings call that currency movements would continue to act as a headwind going into the fourth quarter and beyond:On the bright side, HubSpot made some improvements on the bottom line. Alongside its third-quarter earnings release, HubSpot has also issued an investor deck that stipulates its operating model of balancing growth and profits. Under a mid-30s growth scenario, the company is targeting to improve operating margins by 1-2% year-over-year and to grow operating cash flows at the same rate as revenue growth:Figure 2. HubSpot long-term operating modelSource: HubSpot Q3 earnings deckHubSpot managed to hit both its operating margin and cash flow targets this quarter. On the pro forma operating margin side, the company saw 390bps of lift to 4.4%, as shown in the chart below:Figure 3. HubSpot operating marginsSource: HubSpot earnings releaseOperating cash flows, meanwhile, grew 48% y/y (far outpacing 35% y/y revenue growth) to $11.5 million, while free cash flow nearly doubled to $3.2 million.Figure 4. HubSpot cash flowsSource: HubSpot earnings releaseThe company's pro forma EPS of $0.17 also smashed Wall Street's estimates of $0.05. At the very least, if HubSpot is slowing down on the growth front, it's able to improve its margins and cash flow.Unfortunately, HubSpot's third-quarter results failed to give investors any relief on billings growth - which is the major driver in holding HubSpot's share price down. Improvements on profits and cash flow help to offset some of the disappointment on the billings front, but HubSpot's deceleration to mid/low 30s revenue growth means it is unlikely to see a double-digit revenue valuation again.In my view, shares of HubSpot are likely to see sideways trading in the near term. Investors are best off staying on the sidelines here."

Its Sales Hub Enterprise will include Sales Playbooks to help users build a library of best resources and practices for sales teams besides adding calling transcription, quota management tools, and eSignature.Additionally, it's also integrating its enterprise offerings with Slack (SLACK), providing features such as advanced team management, machine learning, and AI-powered features including predictive lead scoring. It also launched HubSpot Video, a new service available on the HubSpot platform that will allow video hosting, in-video calls-to-action, and a video creation tool to help marketers engage through video content.The market is pleased with HubSpot's performance. Its subscription base already is growing strong and is expected to maintain that pace given the significant product upgrades lined up for the year. Earlier this year, it expanded its AI capabilities through the acquisition of Motion AI. HubSpot plans to integrate Motion AI's Chatbot building capabilities into the HubSpot platform to build tools to automate important tasks, scale conversations, and proactively engage and acquire new customers.I would like to know from its users how they expect HubSpot's upgrades to improve their experience. What additional features do they expect HubSpot to deliver?HubSpot was venture funded until four years ago. It had raised $100.5 million in funding from investors including CRV, Altimeter Capital, Cross Creek Advisors, Dharmesh Shah, General Catalyst Partners, Brian Shin, Mike Volpe, Matrix Partners, Scale Venture Partners, Sequoia Capital, Google Ventures, and Salesforce.com. In October 2014, it raised another $125 million through its listing. It was valued at $759 million at the time of listing. Its stock is currently trading at $145.60 with a market capitalization of $5.6 billion. It had touched a 52-week high of $146.10 earlier this week. It has been climbing from the 52-week low of $71.00 that it was trading at almost a year ago."
4173288,103480,2018-05-12T15:55:50-04:00,"HubSpot just reported Q1 earnings, and per usual, the company has beat analysts' expectations.The company also raised its FY18 guidance range to $489-$492 million (+31% y/y), up from a prior guidance midpoint of $483 million and ahead of consensus expectations.Average subscription revenue per customer, however, dipped in the quarter, showcasing the company's increasing tilt toward SMBs.Though a fantastic growth stock, HubSpot looks dearly valued at 8.4x forward revenues.","Among all the technology companies that have become known for the consistency of their performance, HubSpot (HUBS) is perhaps chief among them. Since going public nearly four years ago, the inbound marketing CRM vendor has quite literally never missed an earnings quarter, underlining either a great ability to achieve against targets or a focus on managing expectations, or both.The first quarter of this year was no exception. HubSpot, as usual, continued its hyper-growth mode, with revenues growing 39% y/y and showing no deceleration from the top-line growth seen last quarter. In true beat-and-raise fashion, the company also meaningfully raised its targets for the current fiscal year (it will continue to chase an ever-higher number as HubSpot engineers several more beats this year and continues to raise its guidance). This time, however, investors aren't buying it. Shares of HubSpot are off about 3% after the strong results:HUBS data by YChartsIn fact, as you can see from the chart above, shares of HubSpot have stalled since the company's Q4 earnings release in February. After reaching all-time highs in March, HubSpot has been unable to sustain a rally.There's a lot of reasons for this happening. First of all, high growth stories like HubSpot are no longer in short supply. This year's crop of IPOs brought us plenty of companies with a 30-40% growth rate, such as Dropbox (DBX) and DocuSign (DOCU). HubSpot competes for investors' attention against these names, and investors tend to prefer shiny new stocks.Second, HubSpot's valuation may be catching up to it. HubSpot has traded at perennially high multiples, but in a period of stock market volatility that is causing a gradual rotation from growth into value, it's stocks like HubSpot that may suffer most.At HubSpot's current share price of ~$115, the company has a market cap of $4.3 billion. After netting out $563 million of cash and $303 million of convertible debt on its balance sheet, HubSpot's enterprise value is $4.0 billion.Against HubSpot's freshly updated FY18 guidance range of $489-$492 million (+31% y/y, and ahead of consensus expectations of $384 million or +29% y/y), this represents an EV/FY18 revenue multiple of 8.4x. That's far above the peer average for SaaS companies. One of the best intuitive comparisons for HubSpot is against the premier CRM vendor, Salesforce.com (CRM). Though HubSpot's growth premium merits it a slight valuation premium to Salesforce, the fact that HubSpot trades at a 1-turn gap to Salesforce (which has widened from the historical spread, as seen in the chart below) should make HubSpot investors nervous.HUBS EV to Revenues (Forward) data by YChartsAt its current valuation, HubSpot is at best a hold. I have my eye on a price target of $98, implying a 14% downside from current levels and representing 7x EV/FY18 revenues, a much more normalized valuation for the company.Here's a look at HubSpot's Q1 results:Figure 1. HubSpot Q1 earningsSource: HubSpot investor relationsRevenues in the quarter grew 39% y/y to $114.6 million, showing no deceleration from the 39% growth rate at which HubSpot exited Q4. Analysts in the quarter had expected $109.9 million, or +34% y/y. HubSpot has been consistently outperforming analyst expectations by about a 5 to 6 point spread each quarter, so perhaps it's analysts that should be raising their targets higher.HubSpot also achieved 43% y/y growth in deferred revenues to $150.8 million, putting calculated billings at $126.2 million (+38% y/y). As long as HubSpot can keep up its billings growth and maintain its revenue pipeline, the company's growth rate in the high 30s should be able to sustain. This is true of most companies, but HubSpot's CFO explicitly mentioned on the earnings call that, ""We continue to expect billings growth and revenue growth to generally track each other over the long run"".Total customers in the quarter grew 44% y/y to 44.9 million. The company was also helped by the launch of Service Hub in the quarter, a customer-service software solution that will deepen HubSpot's competition against Salesforce, which offers a similar tool in Service Cloud.One potential red flag, however, is the fact that average subscription revenue per paying customer slipped -3% y/y to $10,018. Of course, HubSpot's large growth in customer counts is more than making up for the decline in average revenues, but the contraction of this figure highlights how dependent HubSpot is on small business customers. SMBs are notoriously more fickle than enterprise customers, and HubSpot may not be able to get the retention or expansion capabilities from SMBs that are the largest driver for growth in other SaaS companies.On the profit side, HubSpot exceeded expectations, though overall loss margins made little improvement. Gross margin in the quarter expanded 130 bps to 80.5%, up from 79.2% in 1Q17. Subscription-only gross margins were even higher at 86.3%, one of the highest gross margins in the industry, and up about one point year over year. Operating losses widened slightly to -$11.3 million, but that represented a near-breakeven GAAP operating margin of -9.9%, about flat from -9.7% in the prior year's quarter. A 2x jump in R&D expenses, likely associated with the rollout of Service Hub, ate into the company's margins.Net losses, on the other hand, widened greatly to -$15.5 million, representing a -13.5% net margin, worse than -9.8% in the year-ago quarter. The company was bogged down by -$5.2 million of interest expense this quarter on its newly issued convertible debt. Still, however, HubSpot's pro forma EPS of $0.15 beat analyst expectations of $0.11. Free cash flow in the quarter also grew 53% y/y to $17.9 million, distinguishing HubSpot as one of the few companies of its scale to achieve robust free cash flow.Figure 2. HubSpot FCFSource: HubSpot investor relationsThere's no doubt that HubSpot's valuation premium is derived from the consistency of its results, but at such nosebleed levels, it's difficult to believe that HubSpot has much upside from here. A 30-40% growth rate is no longer a rare commodity in the SaaS sector (though at HubSpot's ~$500 million run rate, it's certainly impressive), and while HubSpot is approaching breakeven on the bottom line, neither its earnings nor its <10% FCF margin are sufficient to support its valuation just yet.The company's foray into customer service software is certainly an exciting development that will give it an entirely new avenue for growth - though CRM is Salesforce's flagship, Service Cloud has easily grown to become its second-largest cloud, foreshadowing similar success for Service Hub if it takes off. At current levels, however, I'd wait for a pullback before evaluating a long position."
4163605,20521,2018-04-17T20:01:29-04:00,HubSpot appears to be taking the right measures to drive growth.The company also is not shying away from making small-scale acquisitions.I would like to know if it is looking at companies in regions such as India to add to its portfolio.,"A Technavio report published earlier last year estimates the global cloud-based marketing platform market to grow 9% annually over the period 2017 to 2021. The market is dominated by big players like Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), Salesforce (NYSE:CRM), and IBM (NYSE:IBM). But there are a few other vendors like Billion-Dollar Unicorn HubSpot (NYSE:HUBS) that are doing very well in the industry.Cambridge, Massachusetts-based HubSpot was founded in 2006 by MIT graduate students Brian Halligan and Dharmesh Shah to provide an all-in-one inbound marketing software platform for small- and medium-sized businesses. The company focused on inbound marketing and developed a platform that could centralize marketing automation and search engine optimization tools.HubSpot operates on a freemium model. Its CRM service is available to the organizations for free forever. The basic Marketing service also is available for free while premium options range from $50 per month to $2,400 per month. The additional features offered in these plans include services like customized form fields, blog, SEO and content creation tools, event-based segmentation, and detailed analytics, to name a few. It also offers a sales platform that's priced between $50 a month for a single user and $400 a month for a professional edition for minimum five users. The premium sales platform offers services such as sales automation capabilities, predictive lead scoring, smart send times, and salesforce integration.HubSpot has seen strong revenue growth for its services. For the recently reported fourth quarter, revenues increased 39% over the year to $106.5 million, compared with the market estimates of $101 million. Adjusted EPS came in at $0.12, which also was better than the market's forecast EPS of $0.07 for the quarter.By segment, Subscription revenues grew 40% to $101.7 million and professional services and other revenues increased 20% to $4.8 million.Among operating metrics, total customers grew 48% to 41,593 at the end of the fiscal year. Total average subscription revenue per customer for the company was $10,255 for the quarter.HubSpot ended the year with revenues growing 39% to $375.6 million. Non-GAAP net income came in at $9.8 million or $0.27 per share compared with a loss of $12.8 million or $0.36 per share a year ago.For the current quarter, HubSpot expects revenues of $109.2-110.2 million with an EPS of $0.10-0.12. The market was estimating revenues of $107 million with an EPS of $0.08 for the quarter. It expects to end the year with revenues of $481 million-485 million with an EPS of $0.51-0.59. The Street had forecast revenues of $472.9 million for the year with an EPS of $0.44.HubSpot is looking to grow its international footprint, especially in the European markets. As part of the move, it opened a new office in Berlin last year. It also expanded its partnership with Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and announced expansion of its partnership with Google by adopting Google Cloud to grow its international cloud infrastructure. HubSpot will leverage the Google Cloud Platform Frankfurt region to support local customer data, and provide outage and data protection as needed. Its use of Google Cloud Platform in Europe will drive better speed, reliability, and security to its international customers. Additionally, HubSpot expects to reduce costs through the adoption of Google Cloud and will look to invest in improving Google Cloud product integrations.HubSpot realizes the importance of AI and machine learning within the marketing world. Last year, it announced the acquisition of Motion AI, a leading visual Chatbot builder. Naperville, Illinois-based Motion AI was founded in 2015 by David Nelson to offer an editor for building chatbots that work on websites, Facebook Messenger, SMS, and Slack. Prior to the acquisition, HubSpot already was working with Motion AI by integrating its chatbot into its Free CRM offering. Motion AI had raised funding of $700,000 from investors including Crush Ventures, Charge Ventures, and Hyde Park Angels. Its valuation prior to the acquisition or at the time of the acquisition is not known. Post the acquisition, HubSpot plans to integrate Motion AI's product into the HubSpot platform to build tools to automate important tasks, scale conversations, and proactively engage and acquire new customers.Earlier in the year, HubSpot announced the acquisition of sales AI startup Kemvi for an undisclosed valuation. San Francisco-based Kemvi was founded in 2014 by Marco Lagi and Vedant Misra. Kemvi applies AI and machine learning tools to help sales teams. It was known for its DeepGraph product that analyzes public data to help salespeople identify the best time to reach out to potential customers. Prior to the acquisition, Kemvi had raised $1 million from unidentified investors at an undisclosed valuation. HubSpot is leveraging Kemvi's capabilities in HubSpot CRM to give salespeople more tools to carry out more contextual, empathetic outreach to their contacts.HubSpot appears to be taking the right measures to drive growth. It's evident in its improving financials and rising valuation. HubSpot also is not shying away from making small-scale acquisitions. I would like to know if it is looking at companies in regions such as India to add to its portfolio. There are a lot of CRM/MarTech tools in the Indian market, including some in our portfolio, that may be worth considering, as the unprecedented level of startup activity in MarTech continues unabated.Until October 2014, HubSpot was venture-funded. It had raised $100.5 million in funding from investors including CRV, Altimeter Capital, Cross Creek Advisors, Dharmesh Shah, General Catalyst Partners, Brian Shin, Mike Volpe, Matrix Partners, Scale Venture Partners, Sequoia Capital, Google Ventures, and Salesforce.com. HubSpot raised $125 million through the listing at a valuation of $759 million.Its stock is currently trading at $111.15 with a market capitalization of $4.2 billion. It had touched a 52-week high of $124.45 in March last year. It has been climbing from the 52-week low of $60.90 that it was trading at in April last year."

Its net losses were $39.7m in 2017, versus $45.6m in 2016.One of the first things that caught my eye about HubSpot was its CEO's language. As Brian Halligan states in a recent earnings call (emphasis added): Elon Musk, is that you? With language being the critical medium through which companies communicate, this might be one of the first time I've heard customers referred to as humans by something other than a pet food company. Regardless, the humans that buy its products do seem to love those products. As one homo sapien states in her review:Source: g2crowd.comDespite its high accolades, I believe that HubSpot represents still too much downside risk for investors. Reducing downside, in my opinion, is more important than maximizing upside due to the simple math of it all: if you lose 50% of your investment, you have to make 100% back - not just 50% - just to break even. The table below outlines the brutal reality of losing capital:Source: InvestopediaGains that take years - 20 years! - to generate can be wiped out in a single trading day. As such, one of the best ways to preserve capital is, in my opinion, to reduce our exposure to companies with too much downside risk. I believe that HubSpot is one such company. Below, I explain why.The most salient reason to avoid HubSpot is, I think, its history of dilution. No matter how optimistic industry trends are, and no matter how many tailwinds are behind the company, if that company dilutes your ownership stake, your return will be muted.Dilution is just one of the many risks that investors may face. Other risks include business risk, market risk, opportunity risk, inflationary risk, legislative risk, some of which we can control more than others. We can limit our exposure to dilution risk by limiting our exposure to historically dilutive companies. There should be few exceptions to this rule, as even acquisitions funded with equity tend to fare worse than those funded with cash.As we can see in the chart below, HUBS has diluted its shareholder base by about 683% since 2013.HUBS Average Diluted Shares Outstanding (Annual) data by YCharts683% would have signficant effects on a shareholder's ownership stake. Let's say you buy 1,000 shares of HUBS today at ~$111.25, when HUBS has 67.85m million shares outstanding.Source: Author's work.Let's say, over the next five years, HUBS performs amazingly well--doubling its revenue. And, let's say that because investors love to reward revenue and not much else, the stock price reflects that. Your risk has paid off!But during that time, if HUBS continued to dilute its shareholder base at the same rate, there would be 296.36m shares outstanding.Source: Author's work.Holding all else constant: instead of your shares being worth over $222 per share, because of the dilution they're now worth only $28.42 per share. Even though the company doubled its revenue, it increased its share count; thus, rev per share has decreased from $9.92 to $2.35, instead of doubling to $19.85.That means that, ceteris paribus, instead of your share of ownership being worth over $222k, even though you made the correct directional call, now, simply because of management's decision to dilute those shares, they're only worth $18.4k.We're rewarded on a per share basis. Becaue of dilution, your return may be muted. If HUBS continues its dilutive offerings, it may hurt your returns going forward. That is, in my opinion, a signficiant reason to avoid this name.Research suggests that convertible debt offerings result in poor returns for investors. This is particularly due to changes in post-issue operating performance, which continually take overly-optimistic analysts by surprise. As an article in the Journal of Corporate Finance explains (emphasis added):In sum (emphasis added),Another article in the Journal of Corporate Finance has similar findings regarding convertible notes that bode poorly for investors (emphasis added):This is, in my opinion, a reason for HubSpot investors to be wary. From its recent 10-K, we can see its recent issuance of convertible notes:Source: Company Filings on Seeking AlphaMoreover, problematically, most of its cash comes from financing.HUBS Cash from Operations (TTM) data by YChartsWith negative earnings and total expenses that outstrip its revenue, HUBS may struggle without continual influxes of capital. This puts shareholders at risk.HubSpot has a history of dilution, and may still experience lower stock runs due to its recent convertible note offering. Additionally, with negative earnings, negative ROE, negative ROA, and an earnings yield (-0.97%) approximately 355 basis points below the risk-free rate, in my opinion, HUBS poses too much risk to investors."
4193519,103480,2018-08-02T02:42:52-04:00,"HubSpot shares tanked nearly 10% after reporting generally good results and guidance.The company beat Wall Street consensus on both the top and bottom line by a fairly respectable margin, and forward-looking guidance was strong as well.However, investors were wary of the company's deceleration in billings growth.Even though HubSpot's CFO attributed the billings slowdown to a currency headwind, the slip to billings growth in the low 30s puts a question mark on HubSpot being able to maintain its high 30s revenue growth.For a company that is highly likely to enter into a decelerating phase, HubSpot's >9x forward revenue multiple looks rich.","For me, valuation is always the number-one consideration when picking among a crowded field of technology stocks, particularly in the SaaS sector. While being focused on valuation has often caused me to miss out on high-flying opportunities like DocuSign (DOCU), keeping an eye on valuation has also prevented me from volatility when these favored stocks begin to stumble.High-valued stocks like HubSpot (HUBS) often play victim to their own popularity: expectations for these companies are extremely high, as they should be to compensate for these companies' rich valuations. Yet even though HubSpot posted strong beats to Wall Street expectations in Q2, investors were looking for more. Looking at the company's results, there was little outside of a billings slowdown that could be treated as a major red flag for HubSpot. But it seems that for a company valued this highly, merely good results just aren't good enough. HubSpot is down nearly 8% in aftermarket trading after posting Q2 results, despite rising more than 3% in the session leading up to its earnings release:Before we make too much of this steep decline, we note first of all that an 8% drop, while a big drop for any typical quarter, is far softer than the ~20% declines we saw at Facebook (FB), Twitter (TWTR), and Netflix (NFLX) this quarter. Note also that this drop to $119 also puts HubSpot back only to where the stock traded in late May. Year to date, shares are still up more than 35%, and over the past twelve months, HubSpot has still gained more than 65%.Needless to say, HubSpot has been a fan favorite for a long time. But with the lackluster momentum coming out of this quarter, it's fairly evident that investors' enthusiasm for this name is waning. I reached a conclusion of hold last quarter when HubSpot beat Q1 expectations and rose to ~$115, and I maintain that view now.HubSpot is a terrific company. Among CRM companies - an extremely crowded space - HubSpot manages to stand out with its focus on ""inbound"" marketing, focusing on targeting customers that have already qualified themselves as leads. This makes HubSpot's value proposition slightly different to customers who are also facing a choice between, say, Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) Sales Cloud or Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) Sales Cloud. At the end of the day, however, HubSpot is still an application that is more geared toward SMB clients. While the company does count some large blue chips in its customer base, it's unlikely that HubSpot will ever reach the scale of its larger CRM competitors. By that notion, HubSpot's growth trajectory is facing almost certain deceleration. HubSpot has long enjoyed a premium valuation multiple for years, but as the company slides to a growth rate in the low 30s, as its billings rate would suggest (management itself noted on last quarter's earnings call that billings growth and revenue growth would track closely together in the near term, and billings deceleration is one of the key topics from this quarter's earnings that we'll discuss shortly), it may no longer deserve such a steep valuation multiple.Within a peer group of mid-cap SaaS companies growing in the 30-40% range, HubSpot isn't the most expensive name in the group, but it's also not the cheapest. With such a noticeable premium to better-valued names like Instructure (INST), which recently got pummeled nearly 20% after reporting decelerating revenue growth of its own, I'm more inclined to stick toward cheaper names.The bottom line on HubSpot - this company remains a solid differentiated CRM vendor, but its growth trajectory is limited and there are very few bullish catalysts that can continue to fuel HubSpot's massive rally over the past few quarters. I'm inclined to stay on the sidelines and wait for a better entry point.Here's a look at HubSpot's second-quarter earnings results:Figure 1. HubSpot Q2 resultsSource: HubSpot investor relationsIt's exceedingly rare for HubSpot to stumble in an earnings release. And in fact, HubSpot didn't actually miss analyst expectations - to the contrary, the company showed quite a sizable beat to consensus estimates, particularly on the top line. Revenues grew 38% y/y to $122.6 million, surpassing analyst expectations of $117.7 million (+32% y/y) by a fairly comfortable margin. The growth rate also largely mirrored last quarter's growth rate, showing only one point of deceleration versus Q1's 39% y/y growth rate.But the major concern for investors is this: given the low billings number, is the deceleration curve about to begin? Deferred revenues in the quarter grew 38% y/y to $153.8 million - as a reminder, SaaS companies' deferred revenues are essentially the ""backlog"" of deals that have been booked and paid for, but have not yet been recognized as revenues on an accrual accounting basis. Total billings in the quarter (revenues plus the jump in deferred revenues) clocked in at $125.6 million, representing just 32% y/y growth. That's a six-point deceleration to billings growth of 38% y/y in the prior quarter.Now, HubSpot has an excuse for this result - FX movements. FX movements and the strengthening dollar have been a salient topic on this quarter's round of earnings calls, taking a particularly hard hit on multinational software companies like HubSpot. While FX movements in the quarter benefited revenue growth (+34% y/y on a constant currency basis, but 38% y/y in nominal terms), it acted as a headwind to billings growth. On a constant currency basis, HubSpot management noted that billings growth would have been 34% y/y - matching revenue growth and management's expectation that the two growth rates would converge over time. Here's what Kate Bueker, HubSpot's new CFO, had to say on the subject: Still, however, the nominal deceleration in billings is alarming - especially as it points to the fact that HubSpot's revenue growth could begin to sink to the low 30s. Already, even HubSpot's raised FY18 guidance midpoint of $497.8 million represents just 32% y/y growth over FY17 revenues of $375.6 million - and if this trend continues, growth could slip further to the mid or high 20s by FY19. Investors are particularly sensitive on the topic of deceleration especially after Facebook's (FB) commentary on its earnings call that the back half of the year could see high single-digit deceleration in each quarter. That announcement set off a dour tone for tech sector earnings in Q2 - and HubSpot is victim to the same fears.On the bottom line side, HubSpot isn't making much progress either, with operating losses of -$14.1 million widening from 2Q17's operating loss of -$10.6 million. Q2's operating margin of -11.5% (on a GAAP basis) showed just 40bps of improvement over the year-ago quarter's margin of -11.9%, as the company continues to drive high sales and marketing investments to spur growth. Pro forma EPS of $0.18 only narrowly beat Wall Street expectations of $0.16, while EPS guidance of $0.03-$0.05 for Q3 heavily missed analyst consensus of $0.09. Investors are expecting that if HubSpot's growth is entering into a slowdown phase, it should at least be able to compensate with higher margins and a better bottom line - but thus far, HubSpot is still driving decent losses. The case against HubSpot is purely valuation-based. For a company trading as richly as it is at >9x forward revenues, there are certainly many bearish catalysts ahead of it. In particular, the company's weak billings results this quarter - no matter the fact that ~2 points of headwind were attributed to FX movements - is a telling sign that HubSpot's growth phase has reached its peak, and the stock is probably not worth as high a valuation as before. While HubSpot remains a solid stock to maintain on the watch list, there are plenty of better and cheaper SaaS names to invest in at the moment."
4148044,103480,2018-02-19T05:00:00-05:00,"HubSpot hit all-time highs after Q4 earnings beat analyst expectations.The company showed slight revenue acceleration to 39% y/y growth while still outperforming on earnings.Despite the strong fundamental performance, HubSpot's forward revenue multiple near 8x trades at an almost two-turn premium to Salesforce.With HubSpot reaching the higher echelon of software valuations, the stock is at risk if the market continues its volatile risk-off pattern.","Here we go again: another home run earnings quarter for HubSpot (NYSE:HUBS), another rally that takes it to new all-time highs. The pattern is a familiar one for investors now. There's no doubt that HubSpot is one of the fastest organically growing companies at its scale. With a ~$500 million run rate and still growing at ~40%, with improving margins and strong FCF results to boot, what's not to like about HubSpot?There's no question as to HubSpot's quality as a company. Customers love it, investors love it, Wall Street loves it - the bullish views are well supported by fundamentals. But something that all three of these parties may ignore from time to time is valuation. It's fine if HubSpot's stock price rises in tandem with its growth (roughly meaning its EV/forward revenues multiple remains constant as both revenues and market cap/enterprise value expand in tandem), but HubSpot has seen a continuous ""multiples expansion"" over the past year that leaves it in a precarious position. At 7.8x EV/FY18 revenues, based on the company's new guidance range for the current year, HubSpot is an unattractive stock for the very same reason that Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) is: great company, bad price.There is one company that is just as high-quality as HubSpot, is in the same primary business (CRM, or customer relationship management software), and has achieved significantly greater scale and free cash flow generation capacity as - and that company is Salesforce (NYSE:CRM), a name that everyone in enterprise software will recognize. Salesforce is now a ~$10 billion run-rate company, and despite growing in the ~20% range (HubSpot, if and when it ever reaches that run rate, will surely decelerate to a lower growth rate as well), is a very diversified software play with offerings across Service Cloud, Community, PaaS, and other non-CRM applications. Salesforce is often considered the bellwether of valuations in the SaaS software sphere - if a company is trading materially above Salesforce's valuation, there must be a good reason for it. In recent months, HubSpot has raced ahead from a ~7x forward revenues valuation (more or less in line with Salesforce) to nearly 8x, where it now sits more than two turns above Salesforce's multiple. See the valuation comparison below:HUBS EV to Revenues (Forward) data by YChartsHubSpot's valuation is a cause for concern here, especially if volatility continues and investors flee to safety. They'll still want to maintain their exposure to growth technology stocks, but they'll likely gravitate toward the ""blue chips"" of the software sector - Salesforce, Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and the like. HubSpot's ~8x valuation can't hold in a downturn.There's also the fact that, as much success as HubSpot has had in recent years of differentiating its offering as ""inbound marketing,"" at the end of the day, CRM is still CRM. A company might indeed choose to deploy both HubSpot and Sales Cloud, but the CRM market has always been a crowded field within software. HubSpot may be running into the saturation wall sooner than investors are expecting. The carefully planned succession of ""beat-and-raise"" quarters that HubSpot has trained investors to expect may be at risk if the company's growth tapers down more than expected. Even fan favorites have fallen in Q4 earnings this way - Arista Networks (NYSE:ANET), the much beloved and fast-growing maker of cloud-first networking hardware, fell 20% this week after its growth, despite exceeding Wall Street's expectations, was judged by investors to have decelerated too harshly. There's no safeguard against HubSpot from falling into the same trap, as its high valuation makes it a target.This is all not to say, however, that HubSpot isn't still growing like a machine. Fundamentals look (for now) to be completely intact, with the company's revenue growth showing acceleration this quarter. In HubSpot's three-year history as a public company, it has never failed to beat earnings expectations (which also suggests its CFO is good at managing Wall Street's models), and Q4 was no exception.Figure 1. HubSpot Q4 revenuesSource: HubSpot investor relationsRevenues grew 39% y/y to $106.5 million, beating analyst expectations of $101.8 million (+33% y/y) by six points. Though HubSpot has beat every single quarter of the past year, Q4 is the company's largest beat of the year. See below HubSpot's earnings history from Seeking Alpha:Figure 2. HubSpot FY17 earnings historySource: Seeking AlphaThe company also grew its total customer base to 41,593 customers (+48% y/y), and its average subscription revenue per customer was $10,255. This actually illustrates a potential weakness in the company: HubSpot relies primarily on the SMB (small and midsized business) segment to drive its growth. While the company thus far has been great at driving the total number of paying businesses to >40k, its average revenue per customer - barely over five figures - is extremely low compared to other vendors in enterprise software. Big names like Salesforce and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) - while potentially cost-prohibitive for SMB clients - regularly land 7-figure or 8-figure deals (aka, $1-10 million in annual revenues).With no track record for landing ""big fish,"" HubSpot's growth runs into even greater deceleration risk. Also bear in mind that the nature of serving the SMB space puts HubSpot at greater risk for high churn rates. Though the company has managed this effectively to date, it will always be a major risk in its growth trajectory. It will have less smooth ""growth glidepath"" than other software companies that land fewer but larger and more stable enterprise deals.Profit-wise, though, HubSpot clearly doesn't fail to disappoint. As an inbound-focused CRM company, HubSpot continually improves its sales leverage in keeping with its philosophy that a ""push"" method is a less effective form of selling. Sales and marketing expenses fell as a percentage of revenues to 54%, down from 62% in 4Q16.This, along with HubSpot's top-line growth and a 160bps expansion in the company's gross margin, allowed the company to shrink its GAAP operating loss to just -$9.4 million (or a -9% operating margin), within striking distance of breakeven and a huge improvement from an operating loss of -$13.8 million (-18% margin) in 4Q16. There's no denying that the interplay between HubSpot's growth rate and operating loss margin - referred to by some analysts as the ""growth plus margin"" measure - is very favorable compared to other software companies, with 39% growth against -9% operating margin appearing to be an example of balanced and efficient growth. Accordingly, HubSpot's pro forma EPS of $0.12 beat analyst consensus of $0.07 - as wide a margin beat as the revenue beat.Free cash flow was another bright spot for the company, with FCF of $7.0 million in the fourth quarter clawing its way out of a loss of -$1.7 million in 4Q16. HubSpot also managed $22.2 million in free cash flow for the full year, but with its current enterprise value at ~$3.7 billion, it's still a ways away from having free cash flow support for its valuation.Figure 3. HubSpot FCFSource: HubSpot investor relationsFor FY18, HubSpot is looking for $481-485 million in revenues, the midpoint of which ($483 million) represents 29% y/y growth over FY17's revenue of $375.6 million.By now, most observers probably know that the 10-point deceleration HubSpot is forecasting to is not to be believed. As usual, management lowballs its guidance targets to engineer earnings beats, which is, of course, a widely used practice among growth software stocks. HubSpot's true growth in FY18 will likely land in the mid-30s range, and the stock's valuation already prices in this strong execution.There's nothing to prevent investors, however - who almost always have different expectations from Wall Street - to decide that HubSpot isn't growing fast enough and dump shares the way they did with Arista Networks. With the valuation gap between HubSpot and Salesforce widening, the investment case for the latter becomes increasingly appealing. HubSpot's earnings beats can't really be treated as positive catalysts anymore, because they are more or less expected. Without a true surprise factor to lift HubSpot's stock this year, the stock is likely to disappoint relative to its outsized growth last year."
4133867,103480,2017-12-26T06:34:55-05:00,"HubSpot, the inbound lead-focused CRM application, has nearly doubled this year and is trading near all-time highs.While growth was strong in the high 30s in FY17, an oversaturated CRM environment and the tightening grip of large-cap leaders will likely put a damper on growth in FY18.HubSpot has a limited developer ecosystem, unlike Salesforce/Microsoft/Oracle, whose CRM suites are backed by virtually limitless extensions.HubSpot is richly valued at ~8x EV/FY18 revenues, capping the stock's ability to run substantially higher.","With the software sector striking toward record highs in 2017 and pushing average valuation multiples into peak territory, the end of the year is a good time to review positions and decide which to trim down. Yes - it's true that it's corporate earnings that has powered the explosive rise in U.S. stocks this year, and not blind euphoria. The same is true of software stocks, where high growers are not only maintaining massive top-line growth rates, but pushing closer to breakeven profitability as well. But eventually valuation does have its limits, and the sector is unlikely to materially outperform the broader market in FY18 on valuation concerns - it's fairly evident in Q3/Q4 earnings that even good earnings releases are being met with mild selloffs, indicating investors' tolerance for these valuation levels is hitting a near-term ceiling. With such broad-based caution in the technology realm at year-end, stock selection becomes infinitely more critical.HubSpot (NASDAQ: HUBS) is one of those 2017 high-flyers to cull in your portfolio as we move into the next year. The mid-cap company's stock has grown like a weed in 2017, nearly doubling and far outpacing the S&P software index (NYSE: XSW). Looking ahead, however, growth opportunities look limited and the stock's mild pullback since mid-December mildly foreshadows a more serious correction in 2018:XSW data by YChartsThere's no doubt that CRM software - HubSpot's primary line of business - is a huge market. Gartner Research, the software sector's premier independent analyst, pegs the annual revenue of the CRM industry between $30-$35 billion. After all, sales people tend to be the largest population of office workers, so it stands to reason that sales and CRM software have the largest end-markets and revenue potential.But the incumbents in the space are huge and getting huger. Salesforce.com's (NYSE: CRM) Sales Cloud, the decade-long leader in CRM, holds about 20% of the market, and tailing closely behind it are SAP's (NYSE: SAP) CRM and Oracle's (NASDAQ: ORCL) Sales Cloud, combined with Oracle's legacy on-premise CRM solution called Siebel. In addition, Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) new Dynamics brand for front-end applications has been extremely well-received by the IT community, including the Dynamics CRM application.The chart below, taken from Salesforce's most recent investor presentation, shows estimates of CRM market share (note that these figures are based on third-party analysts, not Salesforce's own estimates):Figure 1. CRM market shareSource: Salesforce investor relationsThat's not to say that upstart competitors like HubSpot don't have a niche in this market - in fact, of the different CRM vendors, HubSpot does a great job at distinguishing its offering as a focused play on ""inbound"" leads - we'll get to this shortly. But companies like Salesforce, Microsoft, and Oracle have massive developer ecosystems - offering interconnectivity to third-party applications and extensions that is now a vital component of a top-shelf CRM application. HubSpot's infinitely smaller stature gives it limited access to developers building extensions specifically for HubSpot - and moving forward to 2018, many industry followers are expecting IT leaders and software procurement professionals to attempt to bundle more products and bring more technologies under a single umbrella. Offerings such as Oracle's Cloud Credits program - which basically give customers a currency to use any Oracle Cloud offering - have been an immense hit with customers, and are driving increased adoption across the Oracle Cloud, including CRM. Ditto for other software vendors who are peddling a complete suite of products to complement CRM.HubSpot, of course, caters to a slightly different market than its large-cap competitors - even the hardiest of bears will acknowledge this. Tailored for the small business crowd, HubSpot isn't after the corporate clients who are looking to pay top dollar for top applications. HubSpot acknowledges that ""while our platform can scale to the enterprise"" (verbiage from its 10-K), its core target market are businesses that have between 10 and 2,000 employees.But certainly, having only SMBs as its core clientele and facing heavy pressure in the enterprise market from the Sales Clouds of the world, HubSpot's growth narrative comes into question. History shows us that software companies focusing on small clients tend to stay small companies themselves. HubSpot will likely never become a multi-billion revenue market leader like Salesforce, putting a crimp in its long-term potential. HubSpot, in its most recent quarter, grew to 37,450 customers, and its trailing twelve-month revenue is $298.1 million - implying that, in the past year, it generated just under $8K in annual subscription revenue per customer. Sure, like all software companies, HubSpot has the potential for ""land-and-expand"" to upsell its installed base, but coming from such a small number, even significant upsell wins won't contribute that much to growth.HubSpot has been growing nicely in the low 40s/high 30s this year, but FY18 looks to be the year that its deceleration begins to kick in full force. I'd be cautious on the stock, in recognition of its premium valuation and the severe competition it faces.To be fair, HubSpot isn't exactly your typical bread-and-butter CRM application. The company is also a marketing platform with lead management as one of its principal features, similar to Marketo (taken private by Vista Equity Partners for nearly $2 billion in mid-2016). Although we do have to note - Salesforce also has its Marketing Cloud to complement Sales Cloud, with similar feature sets.The keyword with HubSpot is ""inbound."" Everything with HubSpot revolves around the concept of ""inbound marketing"" - or how to manage ""incoming"" leads that knock on your door. This contrasts to the typical ""push"" marketing in the sales process, where an outbound salesperson makes unsolicited calls to prospective clients.HubSpot's CRM features are actually free (in fact, the product's name is often styled as HubSpot CRM FREE). Tailored more toward the SMB (small and mid-sized business) crowd, HubSpot CRM is more of a bare-bones CRM application that allows companies to record, manage, and track sales leads. Here's a look at HubSpot CRM FREE's marketing page on its website:Figure 2. HubSpot CRMSource: HubSpot websiteDespite being free, however, CRM is still the core root of HubSpot's DNA and the centerpiece around which its software suite revolves. In the company's 10-K, HubSpot says the following of its CRM: ""At the core of our platform is a single inbound database for each business that captures its customer activity throughout the customer lifecycle."" It would be a mistake to ignore HubSpot's competitors in enterprise CRM as threats simply because HubSpot also duals as a marketing software company (in fact, as previously mentioned of Salesforce's Marketing Cloud, all of its large-cap competitors also have marketing modules in their product suites).The meat-and-bones of HubSpot's revenue is its HubSpot Marketing application, which is designed to work hand-in-hand with HubSpot CRM. From this application, customers can create and execute email marketing campaigns, design their websites and other content, and optimize social media pages and configure SEOs to maximize traffic. Though HubSpot Marketing works best with its native CRM, it also offers extensions to third-party CRMs such as Salesforce.On the marketing automation front, HubSpot most directly competes with Marketo, which, prior to its private equity buyout, was at a $250 million run rate growing at ~30% in mid-2016. That probably puts it at a similar scale to HubSpot today, though its financials are no longer public.Marketo's dominance in the space can't be understated, however - it's ranked as a Leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for CRM Lead Management, much higher than HubSpot's own ranking. Marketo was recognized by Gartner as the vendor with the most complete offering in the space. Gartner has also named the company as one of four leaders in its 2017 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Digital Marketing Hubs (the other leaders are the familiar suspects: Salesforce and Oracle, along with Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE)) - an area in which HubSpot isn't ranked.So, on the one hand, HubSpot faces competition and technology leadership from Marketing on the marketing software (""mar-tech"") side, and on the CRM side, even its free offerings are routinely decimated by large-cap players such as Salesforce and Oracle which also have their own mar-tech offerings. While HubSpot does have a unique value proposition for its SMB clientele, it's too much of a niche to really propel the company toward a billion-dollar revenue scale. More than likely, HubSpot's growth will reach a ceiling at the $500-$600 million revenue range.I'll acknowledge that HubSpot has seen searing growth year-to-date. The focus of this thesis isn't to claim that HubSpot is not a growth company; rather, it's that the company's future growth prospects will likely be a lot more restrained than in the past, and that results in 2018 will likely be disappointing in the face of such strong performance in 2017.The below table shows HubSpot's top-line growth in the nine months year-to-date through September 2017. Year to date, the company has generated $269.1 million in revenue, up 38% y/y.Figure 3. HubSpot revenue resultsSource: HubSpot investor relationsHubSpot has led a carefully manicured succession of beat-and-raise earnings releases, with each quarter marginally exceeding investor expectations by a few million on the top line. Investors have more or less come to expect beat-and-raise quarters from HubSpot, elevating the risk of disappointment as analysts continue to adjust their models upward:Figure 4. HubSpot FY17 earnings historySource: Seeking AlphaHubSpot has made commendable improvements on the margin front as well, as seen in the chart below:Figure 5. HubSpot margin improvementsSource: author-created chart, data from public filingsMost notable among these is a 3% improvement in gross margins, which drove a 5% improvement in operating margins overall. The company is quickly approaching on GAAP breakeven status. Pro forma earnings (adjusting for HubSpot's stock comp and other non-cash items) have been positive since Q1 of this year.HubSpot has also generated $35.6 million in positive operating cash flow (nearly 2x the prior year period) in the nine months through September 2017, as well as $21.5 million of free cash flow.At face value, HubSpot's financials look fantastic - just the kind of profile we'd want to invest in for 2018, with growth in the high 30s, positive cash flow, and thinning loss margins.But HubSpot's current sky-high valuation arguably already prices in its premium profile, and looks especially risky considering the competitive headwinds against its growth in 2018. The below chart shows that HubSpot's revenue multiple is more than a turn greater than Salesforce's, and several turns above Oracle and SAP. HubSpot is already one of the highest-valued companies in the CRM space:HUBS EV to Revenues (Forward) data by YChartsYes, it's true that HubSpot is (currently) growing much faster than Oracle and SAP, whose top lines are growing in the mid-single digits. HubSpot is also growing much faster than Salesforce, whose growth is in the 20% range. This merits a premium valuation for HubSpot - but is 8x too much?With this kind of valuation, HubSpot is approaching the valuation of other software favorites such as MuleSoft (NASDAQ: MULE), Alteryx (NASDAQ: AYX), and Coupa (NASDAQ: COUP) - yet, these companies have the distinction of operating in far less competitive markets and have more unrestrained growth trajectories. With HubSpot playing in what is arguably software's most heated battleground, 8x revenues is a tenuous valuation to support.Risks abound for HubSpot in 2018. Though the stock was a big winner in a big way in 2017, the narrative will likely see challenges in 2018. HubSpot's SMB-focused business model doesn't exactly make its growth a safe play, as small businesses tend to churn their software subscriptions at a much faster rate than their enterprise counterparts. HubSpot may claim that its software is enterprise-ready, but in the large-cap space, the free nature of its CRM may be an Achilles' heel rather than a selling point, and HubSpot is up against formidable competition from much larger software developers with much wider ecosystems - a critical aspect in selling enterprise software.At 8x revenues, HubSpot isn't a value play, and with competition-driven deceleration a huge risk factor looming over next year, it's not an appealing growth play either. I believe the first weeks of January will see a lot of selling in the name, as short-term holders lock in their gains and defer taxes by one year. Stay wary."
4186850,104556,2018-07-12T08:38:25-04:00,HubSpot is a pioneer in Inbound Marketing.The company is a leader in the crowded marketing software space.HubSpot is transforming into a mini Salesforce before our eyes.,"HubSpot (NYSE:HUBS) looks to be a winning investment for three reasons. It has a flywheel-like business model, strong management and quality financials.HubSpot pioneered something called “Inbound Marketing.” Instead of cold calling, spam and intrusive ads, Brian Halligan and Dharmesh Shah, MIT students at the time, envisioned a better way of interacting with potential customers. Rather than the size of your wallet, they believed it was the size of your brain that mattered. Their methods were the opposite of outbound tactics like cold calling, instead they focused on drawing customers in (get it… inbound) through blogging, SEO (search engine optimization) and social media. Now, they build software so other small-to-medium sized (10-2,000 employees) businesses can implement inbound marketing seamlessly.I like to look at businesses with flywheels because they breed business momentum. HubSpot is trying to build out an ecosystem of marketing automation tools to do just that. Recently the company announced its third leg in this flywheel. Up until now, HubSpot only offered its free CRM and freemium versions of its marketing and sales platforms. But now clients can also implement a customer service feature.Source: HubSpot Investor PresentationThis service option seems similar to the new platform Wix (NASDAQ:WIX) built called Wix Answers that has had great traction with customers. Apparently, it is quite difficult to create a system that deals with customer complaints in a timely fashion. Who would’ve thought? I’m sure none of us have dealt with any customer service issues before (that is my version of sarcasm). Just read what Mr. Halligan, HubSpot’s CEO, had to say about this issue on the last earnings call,Sounds tough. But frankly, one feature is not going to give a marketing software a competitive advantage since the space is quite crowded. However, HubSpot is the leader, by a sizable margin, in this space. Ease of use, a simple interface, and reasonable pricing are all stated as reasons to favor HubSpot, and coupled with full product features, the company’s flywheel is alive and well.The company is not settling in either. The CEO noted that,Sure, that could just be lip service, but the company has delivered time and time again. The two founders who are still at the company, Mr. Halligan and Mr. Shah, invented the concept of inbound for goodness sakes. These guys are thought leaders in the marketing world as evidenced by the 21,000 people that show up to their yearly conference.The two founders are also tirelessly focused on creating a great company work-culture. Mr. Shah went so far as the create a Netflix-esque slide deck, detailing his vision of the culture in-depth. I believe company culture is a vastly underrated source of competitive advantage. And analyzing a company culture is too qualitative for “serious” investors. Therefore, it can give us a slight edge by dissecting whether or not this culture is one that will lead to success in the long run.HubSpot’s Chief People Officer (HR person in non-tech speak) even goes to the lengths of replying to every Glassdoor review left by employees. Its Glassdoor ratings are off the charts I might add.We can try to dissect and analyze the flywheel and management until the cows come home, but it also does need to be backed up by quality financials. And HubSpot has them.In the last quarter, revenue grew 39% to almost $115 million and non-GAAP operating margins continued their positive trend to 5% of sales. Free cash flow also jumped 55% year-over-year, to $18 million or 16% of revenue. The company has shown solid operating leverage over the years, even when taking into account the usual 3% decrease in margins in Q3 when the big INBOUND conference takes place.Source: HubSpot Investor PresentationOverall gross margins have ticked up to 81% and in the last quarter, subscription gross margins came in above 86%. To add, subscriptions make up 95% of overall sales so the company truly offers a SaaS-based model. I wouldn’t be surprised to see even more gross margin expansion considering the company’s focus on moving to be more of a self-service provider, rather than investing more into sales and marketing. The move to a freemium model within the past couple years has surely enabled this shift as well. Though, it has brought down the average revenue per user 3% to $10,016. Seeing as the company has almost 45,000 customers though, upsell opportunities within the flywheel remain abundant.The latest market cap for the company was $4.9 billion and it has about $555 million in cash on the balance sheet. So the enterprise value is about $4.35 billion. Full year guidance almost tips the scales at $500 million, so that brings us an 8.7x forward sales multiple, which is on the high end of HubSpot historical range. The question becomes, is the business operating at the high end of its historical range? I am inclined to say yes. In my opinion, the flywheel is spinning at full capacity.As stated, marketing software tools are not scarce. There is always the threat of Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) coming downstream quickly, but this was actually confronted recently by the CEO when asked by an analyst:HubSpot has created a nice niche in small-to-medium sized businesses. Salesforce was created for the enterprise. But you can’t rule out the possibility.Another risk is if Halligan or Shah ever leave. It seems unlikely since this business is their baby, but I think both of them are absolutely necessary. The company has had some PR issues in the past when Dan Lyons, a Newsweek journalist tried his hand working at the company. He would later write a less-than-flattering article and even a book about his experiences. But the company was really good about addressing the allegations and since then, there have been few PR problems to speak of.HubSpot is transforming into a mini-Salesforce before our eyes. A flywheel business model, visionary management and strong financials are all evidence that this is the case.While the valuation may be indigestible for some, HubSpot’s brand identity, customer focus and company culture set it apart from the multitudes of marketing automation tools.Author’s Note: Just hit the big, orange ""Follow"" button to get these articles before they hit the paywall.

4075041,98236,2017-05-21T10:50:00-04:00,"Earlier in May, HubSpot released the results of its fiscal Q1.Investors cheered the initial release with the shares rising 8% but since that time the shares have given up all of that advance.While the company raised guidance, the raised guidance was far less than some reasonable tempo for sequential improvement and seasonality would suggest.The company's new Freemium offerings are seeing traction and are enhancing the overall competitive position of the company.The company, while still spending at increasing rates, has limited those increases to less than revenue growth.","HubSpot-Doing many things rightHubSpot (NYSE:HUBS), 11 months after a wrote my first article on the name, is almost certainly the real McCoy when it comes to its business model. Not particularly because the shares have seen major appreciation, although it has appreciated by a bit over 50% this last year. But it has seen its business grow as fast as any of its peers in the marketing automation space and has made some notable progress on its path toward profitability.HubSpot has been able to achieve strong results in a very crowded niche. Just a few of its competitors include Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) which owns Eloqua, Pardot, Marketo, Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE), Salesforce (NYSE:CRM), Infor, IBM (NYSE:IBM) which offers Silverpop, and Callidus (NASDAQ:CALD). And the space itself, while of decent size, is certainly not one of the giant opportunities of the software world. The latest surveys, a couple of which are linked here suggest the market size is about $6 billion-plus and that the CAGR is no more than 10%.For the most part, it is easier writing about companies that are growing strongly in red hot spaces. When I write about Shopify (NYSE:SHOP), it is pretty straightforward in that they dominate a market segment that clearly is on a high growth trajectory and which is just in its infancy.Marketing automation has been around for several years and many of the solutions seem to mimic each other. HUBS itself is more than a decade old at this point. While I doubt that saturation has arrived, the concept of marketing automation is used to refer to solutions that are in use at most large enterprises and a significant proportion of medium sized business in this country. There are, to be sure, factors that differentiate competitors and competition, especially in the SMB sector where the ultimate decision usually comes down to some specific piece of functionality as much as price. But I think it is fair to say that these days, it is far more difficult, as an analyst, to forecast that one or the other companies in the space will stand out and achieve hyper-growth for some years to come. The fact that HubSpot is doing just that deserves some more in-depth analysis and evaluation.Another great quarter - but what's to come?HubSpot reported the results of its fiscal Q1 earlier this month. The results were considered an upside surprise and the shares appreciated 8% at the time. They have since retraced the entire move and are now below the price they were before the earnings were reported and guidance was raised.The company's results as will be outlined below were ahead of expectations pretty much across the board. The company had forecast $79 million in quarterly revenue and beat that expectation by 4%. The company showed a fair amount of operating leverage and essentially all of the revenue beat dropped to the bottom line. The company forecast revenues and EPS marginally ahead of the prior consensus for Q2. The company has beat expectations significantly over the past year and there is little reason to believe that guidance for this quarter will not be exceeded. The guidance for the year is probably more conservative than realistic. The company's new full-year revenue guidance shows no upside beyond the Q1 beat and the modestly improved Q2 forecast. Revenue growth is supposed to fall from 40% in Q1 to 32% this quarter producing just a 3.5% sequential quarter revenue increase. Percentage growth year on year is supposed to fall further in both fiscal Q3 and Q4.The company raised its earnings expectations, but again primarily as a function of the company's Q1 beat and Q2 raise. It has basically not seen fit to increase expectations beyond mid-year despite what appears to be solid sales momentum and some visible expense discipline.Subsequent to the earnings release, the company announced that it was selling $350 million of a convertible security. The conversion price of the new offering was $94 and the interest rate is 0.25%. In commenting about financial numbers, I will ignore the convertible offering. The dilution is not relevant given the significant conversion premium and the interest rate is so low that interest payments will not move the company's income…unless of course, the company is able to make an acquisition, presumably the rationale for selling the debt.In any event, the company reported 40% revenue growth in Q1, almost all of it within its subscription revenues. The company posted a 700-basis point improvement in the GAAP operating loss ratio which fell by 20% in dollars and reached 9.6% of revenue compared to 16.7% in the year earlier period.Looking at some of the details: Subscription gross margins improved by 150 bps year on year. The company made some progress in terms of operating expense but surely has much further to go. Research and development spend increased by almost 37% year on year but the spend ratio for that expense fell by about 47 bps. General and administrative costs increased by 33% year on year and general and the administrative expense ratio fell by 45 bps. While research and development costs might be considered to be at relatively normal levels at 16% of revenues, the cost of general and administrative expense which is also 16% is far higher than might be expected for a subscription IT company.The most significant opportunity however relates to sales and marketing expenses. As mentioned. marketing automation is a very crowded space occupied by all kinds of vendors, some of them much larger in size than HubSpot. The company spends a lot on sales and marketing because it needs to spend lots on sales and marketing just to get its message across to potential buyers in a very crowded environment with lots of countervailing and unprovable claims.Last quarter, sales and marketing spend grew by 33% year on year, substantially less than revenue growth. As a result, the sales and marketing GAAP spend ratio declined from almost 60% to 57%.The company reported a very modest non-GAAP operating margin of 1.6% due to the dollar increase in stock based comp expense. As a ratio, however, stock based comp expense was essentially consistent with the prior year level at 11% of total revenues.The company showed far greater cash flow generation than it has had in the recent past. About two-thirds of the improvement was based on balance sheet items. The balance was a product of a smaller GAAP loss coupled with greater stock-based comp.The investment merits - and demerits - for a company like thisHubs shares, while hardly outliers in terms of valuation, are certainly not in the value category either. The company will need to beat consensus estimates in order to see rising share price targets and rising share values. At the moment, that seems likely given the guidance that the company has provided and its acceptance by analysts in forming the consensus.The company has 36.2 million shares currently outstanding and a current share price of $66.70. That produces a current market cap of $2.4 billion. Its current balance sheet shows a net cash balance of about $160 million thus yielding an enterprise value of $2.25 billion. With current year sales forecast at $358 million, the EV/S metric comes to 6.2X.The business issues for this company are pretty straightforward. For how long can the company sustain a differentiated and strong revenue growth rate and how rapidly can the company's business model evolve? The company despite headlines to the contrary really did little in terms of guidance to suggest answers to those questions as part of its Q1 release and that is perhaps why the shares have retraced their initial advance. Company guidance, mirrored in the published First Call consensus forecast, modestly raised expectations in terms of revenues and earnings for this current quarter, but left expectations for the balance of the year consistent with prior consensus expectations.The sequential growth the company is forecasting is quite minimal and the growth in earnings from Q1 to Q2 and beyond is actually negative.The first question during the course of the conference call related to the sustainability of growth in the context of a marketing automation market that has been expanding far more slowly than Hubspot's revenues. The answer was not terribly explicit.One of the growth concerns for this company involves the success it might have selling a standalone CRM solution. The tool itself is free. Revenue generation comes based on the user purchases of users typically sign up to use HubSpot's SalesPro which costs $50/month and users also tend to purchase additional products on their HubSpot Growth Stack marketing platform. There have been early signs of success, but nothing that is terribly quantifiable at the moment. One reason why I believe that the growth compression expectations embodied in the consensus are unlikely has to do with the CRM opportunity and the opportunity the company has with some of its other product initiatives, particularly what it calls One HubSpot, which is a platform approach to the company's product portfolio. Again, there is nothing to which I can point in the numbers that have been released or discussion on the conference call - it is more about emanations and penumbras so to speak. One HubSpot is a relatively recent initiative and has yet to be tested in terms of its wide-scale deployment but early results seem to be encouraging.One number of significance for a company such as this focused on the SMB space is churn. The company defines churn based on revenue retention rather than customer retention and that metric climbed to above 100%. The company is moving toward re-defining the churn metric although given the product line extension, it is likely to be a distinction without a difference.The company focused on sales productivity during the call and how it could evolve its sales effort to better mimic what it describes as the ""light touch"" model that is used by companies such as Shopify. This lighter touch paradigm is the strategy the company has for reducing the huge burden it carries in terms of sales and marketing spend. Part of the lighter touch strategy includes the use of a freemium model coupled with an emphasis on both cross-selling and on focus on what the company calls its marketing starter kit.I don't want to suggest that I have anything close to second sight. But I think that the combination of product launches, selling strategy and just a good time in which to be selling marketing automation solutions to the SMB space has been under-estimated in forward guidance and the consensus forecast. And if, indeed, the sales strategy works, then it is almost inevitable to believe that the company will drop a substantial portion of its incremental revenues to the bottom line as was the case in Q1. Most of these are expectations at the margin. Add a few million to revenue expectations this quarter and build on that foundation. Expect a significant proportion of the sales overage to drop to the bottom line as was the case in Q1. These are not very outlandish expectations. But it is those kinds of high odds expectations that I think will propel the shares significantly.Why is this happening?I think if you invest in shares at this point, you are basically investing in the company's concept of in-bound marketing compared to the traditional outbound paradigm. I wrote about the features of that paradigm when I first published an article on this site back a year ago. It hasn't changed although the addition of a CRM solution enhances both the business model of the company and the attraction it has for customers, overall. I have linked to a description of what is involved in creating an inbound marketing solution. Vying for attention is hard. This is a strategy that apparently works and which is not the same as that offered by all of the other companies in the space.The approach is quite a bit different than using cold calls, regardless of how well the target market has been refined by targeting tools. All of this material is obviously a bit of hype and I do not want to pretend that I have road tested it at this point. I most likely will, but I am happier to look at testimonials, the buying behavior of the installed base and the company's growth record as validation points that suggest that this is a strategy that has seen success. Without trying to be a commercial for what this company does, its solution is clearly more relevant and less interruptive than typical marketing strategies, even those based on digital engagementMost recently, the company has begun to offer a free CRM tool. Most of these freemium adventures have their glitches but it is an interesting way to distinguish HUBS from its competitors. The free product is quite basic but it serves the needs of the HUBS base adequately and significantly enhances ""stickiness"" and adds to overall average revenue per user. It is part of the process in building product differentiation to protect the company's inbound marketing franchise.While the overall marketing automation space isn't huge as these things are measured, it represents a huge opportunity for a company that is doing less than $400 million of annual revenues. The CRM space, as linked here, is quite a bit larger than what is called marketing automation and produces a very substantial TAM for this company. I don't think that looked at holistically, this company has any lack of available market space in which to grow and it appears to have a successful strategy for pursuing the opportunity.ValuationLike many companies that are experiencing rapid growth, valuing HubSpot is not a science and I think the use of price targets in this case cannot be readily defended. I think that this company has built a considerable moat and offers a differentiated solution in its space. I think that the company ought to be able to continue to achieve growth at above the rates in its category for several years. As mentioned, I think that the reversion to the mean that has been forecast is at a pace far greater than is likely to happen. The company is still on the upside of the curve for several of its most recent product initiatives. The environment for selling marketing automation software remains very positive. The company has a very reasonable set of sales strategies that should improve the efficiency of its ability to generate new name accounts.The consensus is looking for 32% growth this year and 25% next year. It is based on a particularly peculiar rate of sequential quarterly revenue growth that seems unlikely. I am inclined to think that the set-up provides a strong opportunity for the company to beat all of the next three quarters that it has forecast and to achieve full year growth of 35% and to achieve growth in 2018 that reaches above 30% again. It seems likely to me that the recent convertible offering will be used to fund some acquisitions further boosting growth. I would be surprised if the company did not reach at least $500 million in revenues by the end of 2018 as a run rate which means that its EV/S at this time for that period is really just a bit over 4X, a reasonable metric for a company with a definable and defensible competitive moat.Investors do not buy this company based on current earnings estimates but on the path to profitability that the company has laid out. Management has spoken to the point that its product gross margins have most likely reached an asymptote and based on the experience of many other companies in the space that seems likely. Improving services margins also seems likely and this is not going to have a major impact on profitability.The big numbers are going to come from reducing the costs of sales and marketing and general and administrative cost meaningfully. At scale, and by that I mean above a $500 million revenue run rate with management planning for top line growth of between 20%-25%, there ought to be at least 2000 basis points of available margin enhancement at a reasonable level of execution. That would take pre-tax profits to $100 million-plus and presumably would yield more than $70 million in net earnings. I think expecting that the company can generate $2.00/share in GAAP income by 2019 is indeed what the valuation of this company is based on.I think the transition the company is making to a part freemium sales model is one in which the company is essentially replacing direct sales and marketing spend with what are arguably product demos. It has the potential for the company to disrupt the CRM space in the SMB world and to generate customer acquisition for paid products above rates than HUBS has sustained in the past.The company will probably continue to spend 16%-19% of its revenues on research and development. It gets meaningful leverage by investing in products and with its lighter touch sales model it makes even more sense to accelerate product development.While the company generated a noticeable level of cash flow in Q1, that is unlikely to be representative for the year as a whole. Much of the cash generation related to seasonal balance sheet impacts that are very unlikely to be repeated going forward. The company will be consistently able to over-achieve cash flow because of its business model. It bills its core product one year in advance and assuming the number of users rise and the annual revenue per paying user also increases, deferred revenue will increase consistently. I assume that over the next two years-plus the company will reach free cash generation of more than $150 million/year. That is another element in suggesting that despite what looks to be an extended valuation HUBS shares have significant upside.At the moment, HUBS shares are reasonably well loved by analysts. The average rating published on First Call is 1.8, which is between buy and strong buy. There are only four hold ratings out of 21 published estimates - the balance are buys and strong buys.As mentioned earlier, the Q2 set-up seems quite reasonable for investors with sequential revenues forecast to increase just 3.5% in a seasonally strong quarter and with earnings forecast to be less than Q1. That simply doesn't appear to be a reasonably likely scenario based on previous seasonality and I think the quarter will ultimately be another quarter of beat and raise.There are many entrants vying for attention in the marketing automation space. I think HUBS has one of the better chances of becoming a substantial presence due to its differentiated solution that seems to have been widely accepted by a significant cohort of users. The shares have done well over the last year and I believe it can continue to show positive alpha going forward."

(NYSE:HUBS) is an application software provider that offers marketing and sales software platforms that enable businesses to attract, engage, and retain customers through the ""inbound"" experience offered by the platforms. The software offers all-in-one applications that entice businesses to create value for themselves in attracting customers to it, with an end goal of promotion of the business by the customer.These applications include, but are not limited to: social media, search engine optimization, and marketing automation, to name a few. Founded by two MIT graduate students in 2005, the company is headquartered in Cambridge, MA and is focused on changing the marketing and sales process.Source: BloombergIndustry Outlook: Marketing automation software makes a complex marketing campaign incredibly simple and successful. Software helps a marketing department market efficiently, over a number of online channels, and the automation facet of the software takes care of the repetition. Demand for digital marketing is increasing, and more B2B companies are adopting the technological capability. Today, there are nearly 11 times more companies with marketing automation than there were in 2011.The main benefits of the automation capabilities are considered to be time-saving, increased customer engagement, and increased up-selling opportunity. HubSpot's platform aim to fill those beneficial criteria, and the company considers up-selling a primary pillar in their growth strategy. The automation industry as a whole is projected to increase at a CAGR of 9.26% between 2016 and 2022. Furthermore, the industry is anticipated to generate up to $6.58 billion in revenue by 2022.HubSpot already has established themselves as a frontrunner in the industry, attaining roughly 28% of the market share, as displayed in the graph. A dominant market share for the company is a large competitive advantage for them, and the projected growth of the industry itself as a whole, coupled with current plans in place for expansion, will surely expand HubSpot's market share and create more value for shareholders.Products and Services: HubSpot has two segments, namely subscription-based revenue, and professional services. HubSpot offers three forms of software, being HubSpot Marketing, Sales, and CRM, respectively. HubSpot Marketing software is an all-in-one marketing tool set that has features such as advanced segmentation, personalization, and search engine optimization to name a few.This software enables businesses to simplify marketing initiatives, and aims to provide an ""inbound"" marketing experience, which essentially is to attract, engage, and delight customers, straying from the traditional marketing and sales tactics that tend to be interruptive and of little interest.HubSpot Sales enhances the productivity and effectiveness of sales representatives, and delivers a personalized experience to the customer. Personalization is emphasized in HubSpot's platform in order to be able to appeal to a larger number of customers. Some features under HubSpot sales includes sequencing, CRM tracking, and contact insights. HubSpot CRM is geared to aid the business in tracking interactions with contacts and other companies, and also aids in managing and reporting sales activities.Global spending on CRM applications is projected to reach $31.7 billion by 2018, as demand is on the rise. HubSpot's three types of subscription-based software, as stated before, made up 94% of the company's total revenue for FY 2016, with the other 6% being attributed to professional services.These include on-boarding and training services designed to help customers with their ability to attract and engage customers using the HubSpot platform. HubSpot also offers a ""growth stack,"" which is an all-in-one marketing and sales platform. Essentially, this is a combination of all three types of software, which are aimed to give businesses what they need to create their own value by attracting newer customers.The pricing model for the company varies, as there are multiple levels of functionality within the software. The greater premium paid by the customer is what enables the different levels of functionality, offered at basic, pro, or enterprise. However, this variability is only for marketing software. Sales software is available in pro, or for free, and CRM is free for users entirely.Revenue Generation: HubSpot is a company that generates revenue predominantly through subscription-based revenues. Businesses pay a premium to utilize HubSpot's platform to create value for themselves, in attracting customers and engaging them in the ""inbound"" marketing experience. HubSpot saw incredible revenue growth in Q4 of 2016, totaling $76.4 million, which is up 44% from Q4 of 2015. This 44% increase can be attributed to a strong increase in both segments reported, a 46% increase in subscription revenue, and a 15% services revenue growth.Full year revenue was up 49% from 2015, totaling $271 million, and this in itself is a reduction from the prior year's revenue growth of 57% from 2014. In 2016, subscriptions accounted for approximately 94% of company revenue, with the other 6% being attributed to services. Historically, the company has maintained a high level of revenue growth YoY, with a 5-year CAGR of 56.8%. As revenue has spiked, the company has also seen growth in EBITDA and operating income as a result.Source: BloombergExhibit 1Source: BloombergWith the majority of revenue being subscription-based, the company needs to ensure that a high level of customer retention is maintained. This is one of the pillars in the company's growth strategy, in that the expansion of customer use of the ""all-in-one"" platform needs to be a key focus. Already keeping high levels of retention is a competitive advantage for the company, because, being multi-national, it enables HubSpot to retain a large portion of market share.The company also emphasized that to drive revenue growth, more focus needs to be given to selling to other parts of organizations (straying away from sales and marketing), cross-selling marketing and sales products, and upselling additional features and offerings. One of the primary goals for the company is to unify the sales and marketing businesses, aligned under one uniform HubSpot brand. In doing so, this allows for a greater likelihood of cross-selling.Additionally, the company generates revenue from ""add-ons"" that were developed and launched in Q4 of 2015. These add-ons expand the features of a platform that a given user is subscribed to, and can be purchased directly. HubSpot is able to generate revenue in a multitude of ways as a result of their product, and is sure to continue that trend as a result of their commitment to heavy investment back into the company to expand. Exhibit 1 above displays the steep annual increases in revenue, and forecasts run consistent with the company's strategy to continue to drive growth.International Expansion: Executive management believes that one of the primary drivers for continued company growth is international expansion. Currently, the United States is the primary source of revenue for the company, but there is some influence in Europe and Asia. 31% of marketing customers are located outside of the United States, and as displayed in the visual to the right, those international customers are responsible for approximately 19.1% of revenue generated for the year.International revenue performance was strong, increasing 67% YoY and totaling 29% of Q4 revenue. Already, the company has offices in Dublin, Sydney, Singapore, and Tokyo, and are currently pursuing plans to open a fifth international office in Berlin later this year.Source: Capital IQManagement hopes to stimulate international exposure and growth through continued investments in local sales, marketing, and professional capabilities. As of year-end 2016, HubSpot is reported to have 23,226 customers in their base spread out over 90 countries worldwide.Also, the company reports relations with 3,500 agency partners worldwide, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and LinkedIn to name a few. Global exposure, partnerships with globally recognized brands, and the continued heavy investments into store developments will likely increase the company's brand awareness, which in turn could attract a greater number of customers to their expanding client base, driving more revenue growth.Financial Standing: As talked about in the above section, revenue growth for the company has been outstanding. However, there are a number of other factors that are important to consider. HubSpot reported incredible gross margins for 2016, at 77.2% for the full year. Historically, HubSpot has maintained a gross margin of over 60% for the last five years, and that trend has been on the rise since 2013.Marginal growth, despite negative values, has been positive over the last few years, as indicated in Exhibit 2. Understandably so, negative margins may be a red flag for someone looking to invest, but in the case of HubSpot, it is a part of their business strategy long term. Historically, gross margins have been kept at a high level. The company does not pay dividends and highly re-invests back into itself as part of their rapid-growth strategy that was referred to in the above sections.The reasons for negative margins are in part due to the continual investments made to expand HubSpot's customer base. In doing so, revenues are expected to grow more rapidly than an increase in sales and marketing, R&D, and G&A expenses. The company is aware that they will incur a growth in cost over time, which is expected due to company growth. However, in doing so, expenses are slated to decrease as a percentage of revenue over time.The company is also taking initiatives to reduce any costs possible whilst maintaining revenue growth. In Q4, CAPEX was totaled at $4 million, down from $7.4 million the previous year. The company expects CAPEX to increase as a result of expansion plans (store build-ups, Berlin opening), but this is only expected to hold for the first half of 2017. The company maintains a small level of debt; D/E for year-end 2016 totaled 0.9. HubSpot did have a $35 million line of credit at their disposal last year, and as of year-end, there was no outstanding balance.The debt incurred by the company were letters of credit totaling $4.4 million indebted to landlords for office space. HubSpot maintains a healthy cash position, with $59.7 million in cash at year-end 2016. Moving forward in 2017, the company anticipates losses in operating income and net income per share, but again, this is due to their heavy investment strategy to grow the company. Marginally, headwinds are expected as a result of new hires, payroll resets, and compensation adjustments, but the company still expects marginal expansion for FY 2017.Exhibit 2Source: BloombergIn comparison with others in the industry, HubSpot stands out as best-in-class for 1-year gross margin percentage, and is in the upper echelon for sales growth as well. The negative margins are expected to become positive down the line, so those negative values in comparison to others should not be alarming to investors. Free Cash Flow for FY 2016 totaled $3.6 million, and that number is forecasted to rise. Negative FCF will occur in Q2 and Q3 as a result of vendor payments and the company's INBOUND marketing event, but a positive FCF in Q4 is slated due to reductions in CAPEX.The initiatives set in place are set to continually spike revenue growth at a higher rate than expenses are projected, which will create value to the company as it expands. The small amount of debt, strong gross margins, and healthy cash position allow for the company to continue funding any expenditures or acquisitions they seek moving forward.Conclusion:In summation, HubSpot can be viewed as an investment with considerable upside. Their high retention rates, global partnerships, leading market share, and development of newer products and platforms are key in realizing the company's competitive position. The marketing automation industry is becoming more and more prevalent between businesses, and HubSpot has the technological capability, global presence, and financial allowance to continually pursue the rapid-growth strategy they have been following.Increases in revenue and long-term positive margins will allow for the company to create value within itself and generate higher return for their shareholders. A 1-year target price of $68.56 is surely attainable with the commitment to the initiatives that the company has set in place."
4046327,102646,2017-02-15T13:51:12-05:00,HubSpot had a great quarter and increased its Q1 guidance.The company might not turn a profit any time soon.Margins might continue to shrink because of acquisition and marketing costs.,"Photo credit. GlassdoorMy team in the office uses HubSpot (NASDAQ: HUBS) for customer relations. I fell in love with the product more than three years ago and never looked back. As a small firm, we have been tempted to start using new and cheaper competing products. However, HUBS won our hearts for its quality and its excellent customer service. I don't think we will look back any time soon. HUBS reported a strong quarter and gave promising guidance. However, as much as I love the company, I don't like its current valuation.For starters, HubSpot is a software company that provides cloud-based marketing and software to companies around the world. The company targets small and medium-sized companies with between 100 and 2000 employees. The company's CRM and marketing products allow clients to reach more customers through content management, marketing automation, search engine optimization, and blogging.As you can tell, HubSpot operates in a very competitive industry with companies such as Salesforce (NYSE: CRM), SAP (NYSE: SAP), Oracle (NASDAQ: ORCL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT). As a result of low barriers to entry, small startups such as Zoho CRM, Insightly, and Infusionsoft have also taken a significant chunk of the market.HUBS has been good to its investors. In 2014, the company raised $125 million in an IPO that valued it at $880 million. Today, the company has a market capitalization of $2 billion and has outperformed the benchmark and the peer index as shown below. As of December, the company had 21,658 customers.Source. Investing.comIn Q4, HUBS had a stellar performance with billings up 40% to $88.8 million from the same quarter in 2015. Deferred billings grew 48% to $96.6 million YoY. Total Gross margins reached 79%, up 4 points YoY. Subscription gross margin improved by 3 points to 84% while Services margins declined five points to negative 21%.Operating margins improved 7 points to negative 2%. International revenues went up 67% YoY representing 29% of the total revenues. HUBS expects Q1'17 revenues to range between $78.5 million to $79.5 million and operating income to hit a loss of $3.1 million to $2.5 million. EPS is expected to be between a loss of $0.01 to $0.08. In Q1'16, the company had total revenues of $51 million and EPS of $-0.11.ValuationAs I mentioned in the introduction, I believe in HubSpot and its CRM, marketing products and excellent customer care. My only problem with the company is its valuation. At the current share price of $57.4, the company has a market valuation of $2.069 billion and an enterprise value of $1.93 billion. Analysts seem to be in love with the company as 11 out of 19 analysts have a current buy recommendation with an average target price of $64.67, a 12% upside.When valuing companies, I first look at the price-to-book multiple and compare it with the industry average and the company's historical trend. HUBS has a price-to-book of 16.94 compared to the industrial average of 5.64. The company's average P/B multiple was 13.70, 15.88, and 9.54 in 2016, 2015, and 2014 respectively. As a relatively new company showing tremendous growth, this is expected. It has a book value per share of 3.456, which is lower than its peers. Salesforce, SAP, and Oracle have a book value per share of 9.769, 22.68, and 11.81 respectively.HUBS has a one year forward P/E ratio of 544.67 meaning investors are paying a significant premium. This compares to the one year forward P/E ratio of 48.73 of Salesforce, 17.87 of SAP, and 19.63 of Microsoft. While HubSpot is a good company that can grow by acquisition, I believe investors are currently paying too much.Consider the image below that compares HubSpot's price based on past earnings, expected growth, and value of assets.Source. Simply Wall StreetConsider the company's intrinsic value based on future cash flows.Source. Simply Wall StreetFurther, looking at the company, I am also concerned about the future profitability. As an investor, I look to buy undervalued companies that are profitable. HubSpot does not meet the first criteria of being undervalued as explained above. The second criteria is also not met despite the fact that the company has continued to grow its annual revenues as shown below.Source. YChartsAs seen, while the company's annual revenues have grown significantly since the IPO, the net revenues have not followed suit. HubSpot's main competitor is Salesforce, which as you will see below has followed a similar suit.Source. YChartsCRM has been a public company since 2004, and while the company has grown revenues to $6.67 billion a year, it has not been profitable. Part of the reason is that the company spends so much money on marketing its products. The company also spends a significant amount of money on acquisitions. Unfortunately, HUBS will need to invest significantly in marketing and acquisitions in future. Some of its past acquisitions can be found here.To continue its growth, the company will keep increasing its budget and adjusting its fees to customers. For instance, in Q3, the company ran a promotion, which offered new customers free onboarding, which was contingent on them paying their subscription fee upfront. In December, as well, the company offered a similar promotion. The management concur that such promotions hurt margins, which are already not good as shown below.Source. YChartsMarketo AcquisitionFinally, in May 2016, Vista Equity Partners paid $1.79 billion for a company called Marketo (NASDAQ: MKTO). Marketo offers similar products as HubSpot and had a market valuation of $1.56 billion and projected annual revenues of $206 million. Vista paid a 64% premium over the closing price. Yesterday, HubSpot reported full year revenues of $271 million.If the company was to be acquired today with a similar premium, the share price would be $95.91 and the market valuation at $3.4 billion. I believe this is a considerably high price considering the two companies had relatively similar financial results. Consider that in Q1'16, HubSpot had revenues of $59 million while Marketo had revenues of $62.2 million.Final ThoughtsHubSpot is a great company with pretty good growth. However, as demonstrated above, this growth might not translate to profits any time soon. Salesforce is a good example to show how increasing subscriber growth and revenues might not translate to good profits. As also demonstrated, HubSpot operates in a competitive industry with very low barriers to entry. Small local and international companies providing similar services will continue increasing the level of competition in the industry. Therefore, at the current price, I will keep the company in my watchlist and wait for it for a few months."

My brother's prediction might not have been exact in terms of its time-scale, but today it has most certainly come true. The data is incontrovertible. Six months ago, United Parcel Service Inc. (NYSE:UPS), noted that 'for the first time, consumers say they bought more of their purchases on the web than in stores.' 60% of marketers, according to stateofinbound.com, consider online content creation one of their highest priorities. The average person spends up to three hours online per day. Big data means all our personal information is available for targeted, direct advertising. I could go on. The fact is however, these trends are set to continue to rise and, with more and more of our lives lived online, companies that help others to market their products in the virtual space should benefit. This article turns its attention on two such companies: Hubspot (NYSE:HUBS), and CallidusCloud (NASDAQ:CALD). Hubspot & Callidus Cloud - 5 Year Share Price. Source: BloombergCallidus and Hubspot do not operate in precisely the same space, though there is some overlap. Hubspot is an inbound marketing company, that uses content marketing, social media and SEO to draw attention to its clients, whilst Callidus is an enterprise company providing cloud sales tools, including lead analysis and content generation tools. What they have in common, however, is a strong performance in share price terms, room to grow, good reputations, small to mid-cap market capitalisation and exposure to the digital marketing sector at-large - which is sure to grow. Granted there are big-hitter investments in these sectors from Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE), whose recent stock performance is more than worth keeping an eye on, to IBM (NYSE:IBM), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Salesforce (NYSE:CRM), et al.

In the year to date this figure is an excellent 22.45% and the company's price again seems to be testing that $60 mark, sitting currently near to the $57 range. The 11-year-old Massachusetts company has had an excellently managed rise since its inception in MIT, providing integration for its content delivery, SEO, and other services, with a host of widely used systems from SalesForce to SugarCRM.

Source: CNNThe content provider, amongst other services, is also rumoured to be a potential M&A target according to Stifel and Marketwatch, and with strong billings growth of 48% in its last filed report, you can see why. Indeed, they seem to have an eye on the future, having just recently announced a partnership with leading image-content provider Shutterstock (NYSE:SSTK) in order to boost their content delivery provision, a deal which is likely to be of some benefit. Fourth quarter and final year results are expected to be released on the 14th of February and with each of the last four quarters providing an average earnings surprise of over 15%, the outlook seems positive for the company. Hubspot has had a well-managed rise and is now one of the leading companies in its sector; it has 22.9% of the market share of the Alexa top 1m, as per Datanyze, and with the market set to grow, HUBS is likely to capitalise, and is certainly one to watch.

All in all, this and yearly gains of 71.44% signals a good yearly performance from the California based company. The FT's share price forecast for Callidus, broadly in line with market sentiment. Source: FTCallidus provides a web-based marketing solution for aligning sales and marketing campaigns in order to drive business demand and thus revenues, integrating marketing strategies through its platform provisions. Essentially an analytical suite with delivery provision, Callidus' software has helped the $1.33bn market-cap company to gather the plaudits, including 41 awards at the American Business Awards Ceremony of 2016, which, while perhaps not a direct share price support, indicates the company's market status. The 21-year-old company, which floated in 2003, is also no stranger to using M&A to boost its service offering, acquiring 14 distinct companies in the last seven years. Its revenues continue to increase year on year, though it has some way to go before becoming strongly profitable; still with little to no debt, and solid assets, the company retains a good base on which to build. In terms of growth, the company is expected by analysts, including those of the Nasdaq, to continue to grow, with 2017 projections of approximately 22.5%. Callidus Balance Sheet. Source: FTIn terms of its share price performance, Callidus has broken through recent levels of resistance and looks set to test the $21 mark it last tested in the summer of 2016. Generally speaking, analysts, including those of Craig Hallum, consider CALD a strong buy. The actions of large capital investors also follow suit, with BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) for instance, raising its investment by 21%. Stockinvest notes that shares in CALD may have a volatility level of around 5%, so an investment should be carefully monitored. The company has seen revenues rise, has exposure to a growing sector and is worth considering as an addition to your portfolio, though perhaps some patience should be exercised as the company's share price tests resistance levels.

But are all companies in a group the same?The allure of cloud plays has resulted in what I call ""X as a Service"" bubble.I take a look at HubSpot to see if it really belongs to what people consider its peer group.","I have been catching up on market news after a nice long vacation down under and came across Pacific Crest's cloud picks for 2017. SA News headline here. This included several well known names like Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE), etc., and a few others not many may know about. What I find crazy about this and several other such sector plays is how people decide to group companies. Sure, there are several attractive names if you are bullish on the growth of cloud based platforms, but it doesn't mean you can put all of them into the same bucket. I will use the example of HubSpot (NYSE: HUBS) included in their picks to illustrate this.The XaaS BubbleFor a few years now, it has been fashionable to say your company is providing ""X as a Service"". Just as a startup says they are like ""Uber for X"" to attract venture capital, public companies want to highlight that they have a subscription based model to try to get themselves into their target ""comparables"" group. Admittedly, there are some advantages to using a subscription model.1) You can claim a lower cost of entry, scalability, lower maintenance, etc., all of which are positive for your customers.2) You can potentially create an income stream which can be very profitable the longer you are able to retain your customers.3) Providing customer support is also arguably easier since you have more control over your customer experience.However, this does not mean all cloud platform companies are the same. The most important factor is the actual service the company is providing. I believe we are currently in a bubble where anything said to be provided as a subscription service is clubbed into the same group and gets an astronomical valuation.HubSpot: Operating ExpensesI believe one of the best ways to identify the core competency of a company is to see where it is investing its resources. Below is a chart of HubSpot's Operating Expenses over the past few quarters. Values are in thousands.Now, you might be wondering how it is that HubSpot has managed to spend so little on R&D as a tech company while supposedly being a leading cloud solution provider. Indeed, over this period, well over 60% of its operating expense went towards sales and marketing! The answer lies in one of the risks noted in its 10-K.What HubSpot is essentially doing is taking open source software, adding a few little tweaks, hosting it on a third party cloud platform (such as Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS or Microsoft Azure) and selling it as an all-in-one marketing solution to small and medium sized businesses. To be fair, there is nothing wrong with this. There are probably several hundreds of such digital marketing companies in the US. But that is exactly the point! HubSpot is just another digital marketing company, not a ""cloud"" play. It is not even in the same ballpark as other names like Microsoft and Adobe noted by the analyst in his top cloud picks for 2017. It just does not deserve these sky high valuations.An Insider's takeIf you are still not convinced, I strongly recommend you read Dan Lyon's ""Disrupted: My Misadventure in the Start-Up Bubble""It talks about his experience working at HubSpot along with some general commentary about the state of startups in Silicon Valley. I will not go into the ridiculous details about the company highlighted in the book, but I can tell you, it is a very entertaining read.Meanwhile, while analysts are talking up the stock, company insiders are selling shares hand over fist. Through 2016, insiders sold a cool $54 million worth of stock without a single insider buy apart from exercising stock options. It looks like they know what the company is truly worth.ConclusionAs more and more people invest in sector and industry plays, it becomes import to identify what the core competency of each company in a group is. While all names in a group may move in lockstep for short periods, every company's valuation will be driven by its fundamentals in the long run. HubSpot is the perfect example of a company that while may be providing a useful service, does not deserve to be in what a lot of people consider its peer group and certainly does not deserve the astronomical valuation it currently has. I would be short this name.Supporting Documents"
3981743,98236,2016-06-13T17:05:12-04:00,"HubSpot is the market share leader in the marketing automation space.The marketing automation space appears to be rapidly consolidating with two significant transactions recently announced at high valuations.The marketing automation space, while relatively small, is achieving double-digit growth that's centered on HubSpot's sweet spot.HubSpot appears to be on a clear path to profitability and is already generating modest levels of operating cash.HubSpot achieves the highest overall scores in its space with a significant advantage in terms of ease of use.","Another hyper-growth, loss making subscription software company - but with a bit of a twist!HubSpot (NYSE:HUBS) is just another one of those highly valued, loss making, software companies whose revenues are primarily based on a subscription model - or is it? Many of these companies have similar valuations, similar charts and roughly similar growth rates and business models. So why take a look at this one in particular. Simple really. Its size, its valuation and the recent purchase of Demandware (NYSE:DWRE) by Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) and the purchase of Marketo (NASDAQ:MKTO) by Vista Equity Partners has made HUBS a logical target for consolidation in a consolidating space. And the fact is that the company is a category leader with a bit higher growth rate and a bit more rapid improvement in profit metrics.Writing this on a Monday morning after the announcement that Symantec (NASDAQ:SYMC) is buying Bluecoat and that Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is acquiring LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) for $26 billion or no less than 7X sales at the least suggests that valuations in the IT space are going to reflect merger potential and HUBS has that for any company that wants to establish a toehold in the marketing automation space. Both SAP (NYSE:SAP) and IBM (NYSE:IBM) come to mind as potential acquirers but there are many others - I wouldn't have thought that MSFT would be interested in LinkedIn but that is what happens when companies feel impelled to build their cloud revenue base.As I will show below, based simply on a merger potential, and using Marketo shares as almost a direct comparable, HUBS has a potential takeover premium of greater than 40%. Marketo is being bought for 6.6X EVS, while Demandware, another significant competitor in the broadly defined marketing automation space, is being bought for 8X EV/S. HUBS is growing somewhat faster than these recently acquired companies. Further, it has achieved some level of positive cash flow. But no one can really know if a takeover will happen or at what price. So, after trying to compare the potential valuation of HUBS to that of Marketo in terms of the enterprise value of each company, I will have to see if the operating profile of HUBS might sustain a purchase recommendation as well.Marketo has been a direct competitor with HUBS. Needless to say, there are other vendors similarly situated to one degree or the other. Obviously, Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) has seen recent share price strength because of its analogs with DWRE, although it has now pulled back in the latest market correction. And there are other businesses in allied spaces that I plan to cover in subsequent articles. But for now, I will concentrate on HUBS, both from the point of view of its value as an investment but also as a potential consolidation target in what is logically a consolidating space.Just to make the consolidation analysis upfront and with as few caveats as possible, Marketo and HUBS are very similar in size according to the latest consensus estimates. HUBS is forecast to grow quite a bit more rapidly than Marketo over the next two years. Both Marketo and HUBS have significant losses. In Q1, however, HUBS was cash flow positive by a small amount while Marketo had a cash burn of almost $10 million. Marketo's stock-based comp expense was 50% greater than the same expense for HUBS and deferred revenue growth for HUBS was significant, rising by more than $8 million in Q1 while Marketo had no increase in deferred revenues. For what it is worth, HUBS had a Q1 beat and raise. Marketo's quarter was in line with flat guidance. HUBS has a bit more cash currently than does Marketo. The HUBS cash of about $4/share is 8% of the market cap.Marketo is to be bought by private equity for $1.79 billion. The current enterprise value of HUBS is $1.61 billion. Given the above statistics, HUBS would certainly have greater valuation metrics than Marketo in a buyout. Better growth, cash flow positive and significant growth in deferred revenues are worth something, although how much is not an easy metric to quantify. It is harder still for me to gauge the differences in technology and user satisfaction between the two companies. Just as a working hypothesis, I think that HUBS ought to be worth 25%-30% more than the takeout value of Marketo in terms of EV/S, suggesting that a consolidation would produce a premium of greater than 40% when compared to current share valuesWhat Is an In-Bound Hub?Sounds like a target for an artillery barrage.Basically, HubSpot offers solutions for relatively smaller enterprises to try to improve the efficiency of their marketing efforts. The target market is basically similar to that of Shopify, and HUBS and SHOP offer joint solutions. Of course, SHOP builds ""stores"" and websites and facilitates web transactions. HUBS helps users to improve their web sites and all other channels of digital marketing. Most recently, a company called Groove, which is a HUBS partner, has begun to offer a solution that leverages shopping cart data in order to develop targeted marketing campaigns. While SOP and HUBS play in the same space, they do so at different points in the life cycle of prospective customers. There is some, but not much, potential overlap.HUBS has something of a ""freemium"" pricing model. Users can try the application for free for 30 days. Potential users can get the HUBS CRM app for free. HUBS recently introduced a sales package. The basic version is free and the 'Pro"" version cost $50/month.The basic marketing software has a minimum set-up charge and then costs $200/month billed annually. The least expensive marketing package only includes 100 contacts as part of the package. Most users I suspect are going to need to buy add-on capabilities. There are price points for additional contacts, a pro package which is the most popular alternative and costs just short of $10,000/year and an enterprise package which costs $30,000/year. There are plenty of additional add-on features that are sold but the CRM package that is offered by HUBS is ""free"" or it really is part of the overall marketing software that users buy. The conversion rate of CRM users to paying customers is a key metric in terms of forecasting the company's profitability.Last quarter, the average revenue per customer grew a startling 18% year on year. A lot of this is actually users buying more add-ons and moving to higher pricing tiers and buying additional licenses. It should be noted that this company has sold lots of product to the ""small"" component of the SMB space. Those users churn as they go out of business or run into financial problems. Like many companies, HUBS reports its churn statistic based on the combination of actually churn and the value of renewals. That number is close to 100% which essentially means that the smallest users are falling off and the larger and newer users are spending more.Just to give those readers who are not involved in web commerce some idea of what one buys, the basic package from HUBS includes solutions that assist in content creation, facilitate targeted e-mail marketing, manage social media suites and a very primitive form of analytics. The most advanced package allows users to do A/B testing, predictive lead scoring, facilitates revenue reporting and helps users to build custom event automation triggers. At the enterprise level, HUBS solutions are going to be competing to some degree with the solutions of Salesforce's Exact Target and the Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) marketing cloud.To a certain extent, one might think that the HUBS process is rather elementary and perhaps it is that, but the process apparently gets significant results and reasonably favorable reviews. Given that this company basically targets the mid-market, not too surprisingly none of its references are particularly well known. Perhaps the best of these testimonials is one from Shopify that uses the HubSpot product to transform its own sales automation process to the one that it purchased from HUBS. Unlike some of the other testimonials that have somewhat incredible sales increase figure this testimonial merely talks to a higher volume of transactional sales and happier sales employees. Again, it was somewhat surprising to see the head of sales of one marketing automation firm talk about the success it was with the product of another marketing automation firm.The other interesting testimonial, again with the appropriate caveats, is a study done earlier this year by an MIT Sloan School student. I would note that the two founders of this company met as grad students at Sloan School and the CEO is still professionally affiliated with the school. So, the genesis of the report is probably a function of the MIT relationships. In any event, the study shows 4.1X the number of site visitors within one year, 3X more leads per month within one year and 72% of HubSpot users who saw an increase in sales revenues within one year.HUBS has a very partner-oriented sales model. Several of the testimonials are from industry participants who customize and resell the HUBS solution. An interesting aspect of the set of testimonials were just how many of them actually came from other marketing automation companies. This company currently has 3,100 partners. Clearly, not all of that number is going to be effective and a smaller cohort still is going to sell HUBS solutions every quarter. But a partnership effort of such a scale is a significant pillar in the growth of this company.One company, headquartered in The Netherlands, said to be a leader in something called branding automation and brand management, claimed it had increased revenues by five times and customers by three times. I confess to being a bit incredulous that a company in the field, which was founded as recently as 2010, needed a tool to improve its own marketing. Other than calling up all of the references it would be difficult to validate their claims - but I have to give HUBS the benefit of the doubt in assembling quite so many testimonials. In this particular case, the chief marketing officer of the Dutch company decided to integrate HubSpot with an existing application it was using from Salesforce. I say that is interesting because CRM actually offers a targeted marketing solution that it acquired when it bought Exact Target in 2012 and established its ""Marketing Cloud."" CRM has been more successful than most larger vendors in selling marketing automation software and perhaps this testimonial is an outlier… except that there are a few others that are shown by HUBS.Marketing Automation: Who's on top and who is notSometimes when I write these articles it is more or less impossible to quantify things like market share. It would seem to me that market share would be among the most significant information that a potential customer might want to know about in evaluating their potential supplier. You might think that all of the sites that purport to provide advice to prospective customers about which solution to buy would actually have such basic information. There are literally dozens of such services, but it is exceptionally rare to see any kind of credible market share analysis that can be used as presented.In this space, however, there is at least one service that does market share analysis. Marketing Automation Insider is actually a service that provides both blogs, tool reviews and tool comparisons. Marketing Automation uses data from something called ""BuiltWith"" which is a tool that monitors 309 million web sites and is thought to have the latest available information on usage in the web site software market. According to its most recent analysis, done earlier this year, HubSpot had by far the largest market share in 2015. HubSpot has a commanding 42% market share in the small business marketing automation space. HubSpot had by far the largest number of users.In the enterprise space, Eloqua and Pardot are tied for the leader position with both having a 31% share. HubSpot is in third place with a 22% market share. Pardot is nowadays owned by Salesforce and is part of that company's marketing cloud. Eloqua was bought by Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) back in 2012 for more than 8X revenues which is an extraordinary number to pay for a company that was growing revenues by all of 27% annually when it was acquired. Just as a gut check, HubSpot would be worth $2.15 billion using 8X revenues plus cash. Given its faster growth rate and positive cash flow generation, it would be easy to justify something like 20% more than the Eloqua valuation or $2.6 billion as a comparable.It is perhaps surprising to see just how low the marketing automation penetration rate actually is. As of the end of last year, fewer than 4% of the top 10,000 websites had adopted some kind of marketing automation solution. Of course, the penetration was significantly less than that in the SMB space that HUBS targets. Marketing automation appears to have reached what is called a ""credibility"" tipping point according to this survey. It forecasts that over the next 2-3 years that ""HubSpot and Eloqua will continue to engulf their respective corners of the market. Given the external growth of the market, though, it's likely that most major vendors will continue to grow with the expansion of the market.""To be sure, there are other sets of statistics that present a somewhat different picture because of definitions. A blog called Emailmonday says that 49% of ""companies"" are using marketing automation. Since the same blog says that only 4% of firms with 20 or more employees use marketing automation, it is a bit difficult to assess just how penetrated the space is. Another study says that 25% of Fortune 500 business to business companies use marketing automation. In trying to sift through all of the different surveys, it really comes down to definitions and the market that's being analyzed. Some users have tools but few users actually do anything significant with the tools they have. If they do use the tools, it is usually for the most basic functionality such as e-mail marketing or a tool to post blogs. It is safe to say, I believe, that there is a huge untapped market for marketing automation solutions and that proportionately it is larger in the SMB than in the enterprise space.When I try to take a holistic view of what this means to HUBS, I think the conclusions are straight forward enough. HUBS has a very high market share in its target space and its SMB target space is barely penetrated, at least from a usage standpoint. There is some evidence that the HUBS tool produces significant positive results. Some evidence that the HUBS platform is well liked and used by other marketing automation vendors included a testimonial from SHOP that it has adopted the HUBS solution. And there is lots of evidence that the marketing automation space is growing more rapidly than most other areas in IT and that the concept has reached the so-called ""credibility tipping point.""What's the competitive moat?When I look at software companies and competitive moats, I rarely look at feature/function differentiation. Technology itself is rarely a competitive moat in the IT space. Some readers may think that this company or that company has a unique feature or two, but the fact is that if such a feature or function is significant and if the large vendors in the space aren't asleep, whatever feature or function seems to be important will soon be copied and sold as part of their solutions. That is especially true when the competitors in the space include Oracle, Salesforce and Adobe. They have the resources and the infrastructure to create whatever solution seems appropriate to their own marketing departments.Usually I like to use the analysis of Gartner's MQ reports since they are widely distributed and accepted. But in looking at this space, there is clearly a definitional issue. The best that Gartner can do is to call HUBS ""a vendor to watch."" They do not include HubSpot in their survey of digital marketing hubs.That being said, however, HubSpot earned the highest customer satisfaction score amongst all products in the space according to G2 Crowd. Customer satisfaction, regardless of the source, is an excellent moat. G2 Crowd ranks HubSpot as the best overall marketing automation software with a rating of 88. Its nearest competitors are Pardot at 83 and Marketo at 80. Oracle/Eloqua has a ranking of 70.Most users believe that HubSpot's solutions are much easier to use, require much less training and are far more intuitive than the competition. Is there some magic technology silver bullet that accounts for HubSpot's success? Probably not. It is mainly a matter of emphasis and background. Marketo started life as an e-mail platform and that is where it still does best. HubSpot was always about an integrated platform and that remains its secret sauce. It is just far easier to use and it provides a far more holistic view of contacts. Further, Marketo is significantly more expensive than HubSpot and requires a third party tool that costs $1000 to do personalization.What's the competitive moat for HUBS? Ease of use, time to benefit, price and first mover advantage which should never be underrated. At the end of the day, all of those attributes are a powerful competitive moat even though technology per se is not amongst them. HubSpot is No. 1 in its space and there's nothing I have seen that's likely to change that any time in the foreseeable future.Growth of the Marketing Automation SpaceAs of today, the Market Automation market isn't huge. Current estimates range from about $2-$4 billion for 2016. The CAGRs over the next few years are in the range of 9%-14.5%. The CAGRs are in the SMB space where penetration rates are the lowest.The cost of marketing automation software is dropping modestly. On average, users spend about $800/month these days compared to $900/month in 2010. Part of the reason for the relatively modest growth rates is the inclusion of CRM as part of the growth rate calculation for marketing automation. CRM CAGRs are now in the 6% range and hence drive down the estimated growth rates for the product categories that are actually components of the markets in which HUBS competes.The major growth in the space is actually coming from the adoption of multi-function platforms. Targeted e-mail already has a 91% penetration rate. Social media automation has about a 70% penetration rate. Some of the more advanced functionality such web site personalization, social monitoring, content and score leads are really nascent and that is where most of the growth will come from.Rather than attempt to reach an answer regarding the growth of the automation space, it is adequate from an investment prospective to say that the growth rate is high and the opportunities are large. It is apparent that HubSpot, among others, is competing in the sub-sectors with the highest CAGRs. Overall, it appears that the size of the market will be great enough to allow HubSpot and its larger competitors to grow by more 20%-30% for at least the next several years.HubSpot's business model and its valuationEvery time I write about valuation for companies that are immature and sell their products on a subscription basis, I get lots of comments from readers looking at stock-based comp as a lodestar in the valuation constellation. Of course, the opposite is true. I rarely get questions from users regarding how much a particular company might be worth in a takeover.In a perfect world, companies would not be allowed to present a pro-forma EPS calculation that just isn't pro-forma. Stock-based comp is no more a one-time expense than R&D or sales and marketing. It's just another way of paying people whose primary advantage to companies is that it has no cash consequences.But then again, this is most certainly not a perfect world. In a perfect world, I could eat all the pasta I wanted and not get fat. In a perfect world, I might be summering in either Provence or Tuscany - I will go with Tuscany and I would be able to afford to buy all of the Sassicia I am able to drink. In a perfect world, the water in my pool would always be 86F without fooling around with a set of incomprehensible controls. In a perfect world, I would be able to eat foie gras several times a week without damaging my digestive apparatus. And in a perfect world, white truffles would be available 12 months a year at bargain prices.Sadly, we do not live in a perfect world and we are likely to have to put up with the exclusion of stock based comp from pro-forma calculations for many years to come. For the foreseeable future, share valuations, regardless of personal preference, are going to rise and fall based on some kind of discounted cash flow analysis coupled with comparisons to comparables. Personal preference just doesn't enter into the equation.I know that most analysts and institutional investors are all well aware of the arguments related to the exclusion or the inclusion of stock based comp and simply have not found the analysis useful in forecasting the performance of share valuation for individual companies. So far as it goes, companies are mandated to provide a bridge from GAAP to non-GAAP presentations. Saying that a company is not a good investment because it uses pro-forma presentations is simply not validated by the preponderance of the empirical data. In my articles for SA, I try to provide the relevant data for stock based comp and let readers do what they will with the information. The fact is that I am trying to present investment ideas that might work and the issues of stock based comp will have little or no impact on that conclusion.Regardless of the issue of stock based comp, shares of HubSpot are not in either the value or the GARP categories. Estimates are posted by 13 analysts. For what it is worth most of them are positive on the name. At the moment, there are three strong buys, six buys and three holds.Based on the consensus of those 13 estimates, the company's EV/S for 2016 is 6.2X. Based on 2017 estimates, the EV/S would be 4.8X. Those are relatively reasonable valuations for a company growing at 30-plus and with substantial improvements in both margins and cash flow metrics. As mentioned earlier, DWRE was bought for an EV/S of 8X and Marketo was bought for 6.6X EV/S. If HUBS were to get bought, it would clearly enjoy valuations at least as high as DWRE based on the company's better cash flow and higher growth.The non-GAAP earnings projections for HUBS are at below breakeven through next year. Estimates have crept up over the past quarter and the company has had a record of beating its forecasts since it has been a public company. That is likely to continue. The earnings guidance implies non-GAAP margins of about (8%). That would be a 600 bps improvement from 2015 results which in turn was a 1000 bps improvement from the prior year. Given the current trajectory, it seems that non-GAAP profits should be achieved in the second half of 2017.HubSpot did achieve positive operating cash flow in both Q4 2015 and in Q1 2016. The company does forecast both operating cash flow and capex. Operating cash flow for 2016 is forecast to be about $13 million. capex, was $8.1 million in Q1 2016 and is forecast to run at $21 million for the full year. For full-year 2015, operating cash flow was at breakeven levels, a significant swing from the year earlier period. Most of that was driven by higher levels of deferred revenue, lower GAAP operating losses and a relatively significant increase in stock based comp. Stock based comp expense has flattened out the last two quarters and is down about 40% from its peak quarterly levels. Stock based comp is forecast to rise a bit in the next three quarters and based on guidance it would be 12% of 2016 revenues compared to 11.5% in the full year of 2015.HUBS continued to achieve significant growth in deferred revenues which rose about 30% in Q1-2016 over the same quarter the prior year. Based both on Q1 results and the constituents of operating cash flow, it seems likely that actual 2016 cash flow will materially exceed guidance. Given that capex is very front loaded because of the build-out of a new headquarters, it seems likely that the company should be achieving positive free cash flow by the last quarter of the year.HUBS will not appeal to value oriented investors. But based on using a model that gives significant weight to comparables and looks at this company improving its cash flow margins consistent with the recent past will yield significant appreciation potential. And the takeover potential at a significant premium is not inconsequential.Summing up the Investment case for HUBS!While HUBS is a long way from appealing to value investors, valuations based on using a blend between comparables and discounted cash flow of future cash flows suggest that the shares have a significant upside potential."
3924666,56112,2016-02-25T11:16:53-05:00,"HubSpot has carved out an interesting and unique niche in inbound marketing and marketing automation for SMBs; direct competition is likely less intense than many assume.Unfortunately, the valuation bakes in continued success.Revenue growth is still very strong, but decelerating somewhat (albeit off insanely good comps).With the company a long way from true economic profitability (which I define as FCF net of dilution), HUBS is a very interesting ""monitor"" but not a buy.","I hate marketing. I hate it a lot. I'm not alone in my dislike of marketing, of course, but I may be alone in the extent of my dislike of most companies in the business of advertising, as I think many extract rather than create value, and competitive advantage and differentiation are slim to none, or otherwise completely inscrutable and mumbo-jumbo-y (especially in areas like ad-tech).To every rule, there is an exception, though - TechTarget (NASDAQ:TTGT) is the opposite of what you would first think upon hearing ""lead-gen."" I believe HubSpot (NYSE:HUBS) is similarly an exception - while ""marketing automation"" may call to mind a legion of spammy emails, in reality, the company started by focusing on ""inbound marketing"" (a less intrusive, more customer-friendly marketing approach) and makes the lead nurturing process more human rather than less.While the company's valuation is as high up in the clouds as its software, I do believe HUBS has a meaningful growth runway and potentially less direct competition than most casual analysts assume. With that, while the valuation is far too rich for my tastes today, it's high up on my list of names I'm studying in hopes of an eventual sell-off.SMB Software Rising From The Dead: Will It Be A Phoenix Or Zombie?It's not really a question whether HubSpot is gaining traction in the SMB marketing automation space. All the metrics look impressive. 57% y/y revenue growth in 2015 was off a 49% comp in 2014, and revenue retention increased over 100% (from 80% a few years ago). Customer renewal is in the low 80s (which sounds low, but is the name of the game in SMB), and revenue growth is split between mid-teens ARPU growth (driven by both pricing as customers move up tiers and add divisions) and strong new customer growth. Unlike its peer Marketo (NASDAQ:MKTO), which is waving bye-bye to its historic roots and shooting for the enterprise, HubSpot has no intention of scaling out of the SMB market - in fact, it thinks it has plenty of opportunity right where it's at.The question investors must ask, of course, is whether the SMB market is the right place to focus on in the long term. SMB has, to some degree, long been perceived as the graveyard of software companies, with failures far outnumbering successes. Customer acquisition costs via outside sales are pretty impractical, and if you had really cool technology, your highest and best use for it was in the enterprise. There are also challenges with significantly higher churn - if you sell to a Fortune 500, you can have relative confidence they'll still be in business five or 10 years from now; that may not be the case with a 10- or 20-person company where the owner could (and often does) decide to close up shop and do something else.I'm going to go out on a limb and make a non-consensus call: I think ""it's different this time."" Why? I think the SaaS model may have changed the dynamics in SMB going forward - and it's an area ripe for innovation. Particularly in the ""small"" part of small business, many segments are pretty underserved by technology and still functioning on spreadsheets because nobody wanted to develop software that fit their needs. The pace of innovation in the SMB market has not matched either that of the consumer market or that of the enterprise market, and this leaves much room for improvement. HubSpot is not the only company seeing traction by reversing this paradigm - Mindbody (NASDAQ:MB), for example, is doing cool things in the health and wellness vertical.Competitive Landscape: Maybe Not As Fierce As It Looks?At first glance, it looks like HubSpot has stiff competition. The list of marketing point solutions is mind-numbing, though there are only a handful of players offering full integrated platforms like HUBS. These players, however, are no slouches - besides publicly-traded Marketo, there's also competition from Salesforce (NYSE:CRM), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), and to some extent Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) - the last of which doesn't necessarily compete directly, but does compete for mindshare (per Marketo commentary).On a closer look, however, the landscape might not be as bad as it seems. First of all, Marketo has made it loud and clear that it has no interest in catering to the ""small"" end of SMB; it already has a poor win rate south of companies with 200 employees and, as I discussed in more depth in my write-up of it, has designed the product (and reorganized the sales team) to focus on the enterprise. Oracle's Eloqua similarly doesn't have much overlap with HubSpot until you get close to 2,000 seats.Salesforce is the big question mark. It's an interesting frenemy-esque relationship on multiple levels. To start with, it was one of the investors in HubSpot. Today, Salesforce is both a direct competitor in marketing automation (cute video here), and also a partner (a lot of HubSpot customers use Salesforce). HubSpot's new CRM product, which is rapidly gaining traction, could be seen as competing with Salesforce - but this actually isn't the case.To level-set here, HubSpot likes its customers to have a CRM - because once you are getting leads from your marketing system, where do those leads go? An Excel spreadsheet is not the ideal solution. HUBS found that roughly 20% of customers were using Salesforce, 20% were using another CRM, while 60% were using nothing at all. When they asked why, the answer was that mainstream CRMs were too complicated for the relatively simple needs of small businesses.So HubSpot set out to build the ""Apple of CRMs"" - a lightweight solution that is super intuitive. And no, that's not my lazy analogy - it comes from the company; the co-founders met Steve Jobs while they were in business school and took his simplicity and integration to heart.They seem to have accomplished their goal here. Indeed, on reviews site G2 Crowd, the HubSpot CRM is ranked #2 behind only Salesforce. Users seem to agree that it is highly intuitive and easy to use (which was the whole point of creating it).To tie this all back together: while there are a lot of people doing things that sound a lot like what HubSpot does, relative to some areas like ad-tech where supposed differentiation sounds like a lot of mumbo-jumbo and hand-waving to me, I do see where HUBS is taking a unique angle by keeping a narrow focus on providing a simple-to-use, all-in-one solution for the (very large) TAM of customers who desire that.Finally, HUBS has a couple interesting sources of competitive advantage. One, it has a much bigger brand name than its revenue line would suggest. It drinks its own punch and relies heavily on inbound marketing, as well as partners such as SEO consultants and digital marketing agencies (as I touched on earlier). Its ambitious inbound.org project - creating, essentially, a community for marketers to share expertise - could serve as an extension of the strong mindshare it already owns, thanks to its online content and conferences. Two, it has a strong corporate culture (see Glassdoor ratings, the culture code, the TEDx Talk, great-place-to-work awards, etc), and both founders (Brian Halligan and Dharmesh Shah) have a learning mentality and are focused on constantly evolving.Valuation: When The Revenue Multiple Could Be An EBITDA Multiple, It's Not Time To BuyHubSpot is a great story. The problem, unfortunately, is that despite the deep sell-off over the past few months, you'll still pay a lot for the privilege - over 6x trailing revenues and nearly 5x forward revenues.To say I have concerns about this valuation would be putting it mildly. First of all, the company's top-line revenue growth is decelerating - while it may sound churlish to complain about a 37% revenue growth forecast off a 57% comp, I think it's worth breaking it down. If pricing/upsell continues to contribute somewhere in the teens (flattish, plus or minus a few points), that means that growth from new customers will actually be decelerating quite markedly. I do think it has some room to continue to upsell customers by adding divisions and moving them up price tiers, but at the same time, the ""expand"" half of land-and-expand is necessarily smaller when a lot of your logos are John's Local Business versus, you know, Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) or some other Fortune 500 company. This is not to say that HubSpot's model is bad - I quite like it, actually - but it does make paying a high multiple a pretty big bet on the future success of the company.On the cash flow side, I would also point out that it's a ways away from being economically cash flow positive (i.e., FCF net of dilution). Stock-based compensation is expected to be $43 million in 2016 (more than 10% of revenue) while operating cash flow margins are expected to be in the 3-4% range and capex is expected to be in the 7% range.Speaking of capex: one note here on capitalized software. Per its last 10-K, the estimated useful life of software it develops is merely two years, and indeed on this AmA-style exchange, cofounder/CTO Dharmesh Shah stated ""things move too fast"" for the company to have a formal product road map:As such, while I do expect the company to get a lot of leverage on sales and marketing over time, I would be careful about how much EBITDA you assume converts into FCF, as I would treat a lot of this capex as an ongoing recurring expense.Wrapping It UpHubSpot is zigging where others are zagging, and that's something I always like to see. I wouldn't be willing to buy it at this price - or anywhere close to - but it's one of the few stories in the marketing world I can stomach, precisely because the company's approach is the opposite of everything I (and most people) hate about marketing. What HubSpot is doing creates real value for customers, and customers' customers - and I do believe that in the long term, real value creation wins out over chew-and-screw tactics.A fair question for you to ask me, incidentally, is why as a value investor, I'm spending my time working on a SaaS company trading at 6x revenues. The answer is simple: despite the ""cloud"" being omnipresent in terms of mindshare, it still comprises a very small portion of the total software market and the runway for growth here is long. Within this context, developing an understanding of the haves and the have-nots - and as such, being prepared to pounce if/when the sector falls out of favor or the broader market pulls back and punishes high-beta names - seems like a good investment of time. There's enough meat in the HubSpot story for it to be worth getting familiar with now, so if the valuation falls to a reasonable level later, you don't have to build your knowledge base from scratch.Disclaimer: Investing is inherently subjective and this article expresses opinions.

3883076,21305,2016-02-10T11:35:14-05:00,"HubSpot reports earnings today, February 10, 2016, after the market closes.It pays no dividend. It has not yet achieved positive earnings. Yet, it has been on a clear path to do so.A recession could possibly delay the achievement of positive earnings, but it should not derail that achievement. HUBS provides an essential service for online marketing.","Hopefully, this article will help you increase your wealth.When you see some stocks take dramatic nosedives, you really have to wonder about their performance going forward. However, the recent nosedive of HubSpot (NYSE:HUBS) seems far overdone. I believe HUBS itself will put the lie to its current down move when it reports earnings after the market closes on February 10, 2015. The chart below gives investors/traders a good idea of how good a rebound opportunity this may be:Before the beginning of 2016, HubSpot had been in a strong uptrend. The company fundamentals seemed to strongly support that uptrend. Fundamentally, there was no reason for the stock price to be cut in half within a month or two. Yet, it has been. The last part of the down move appears to have been strongly influenced by the earnings report of ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW).ServiceNow reported earnings on January 27, 2016. It beat on both EPS and revenues. However, it reported a billings miss of about -$5 million; although at $365.7 million, NOW's billings were still a healthy +33% year over year for Q4 2015. In addition, FY2016 revenue guidance was weaker than consensus guidance of $1.37B at $1.34-$1.37B. Mizuho and MKM both responded by downgrading the stock to neutral. HUBS's last leg downward seems to have been at least partially mediated by NOW's miss and the technology rout in general. I don't believe HUBS deserved to be treated that way by the market. I am not even sure it deserved the first big leg down as the market fell.The following is a brief description of what HubSpot does:HUBS is headquartered in Cambridge, Mass., where it can easily attract talent from MIT, Harvard, and a plethora of other top local universities such as Tufts, Boston University, Boston College, Amherst, and Brandeis University to name just a few. Such talent doesn't ensure success, but it makes it a lot more likely. This probably doesn't give it a huge advantage over ServiceNow, which is headquartered in Santa Clara, CA, in the heart of the Silicon Valley (near both Stanford and UC Berkeley - the Ivy League of the West Coast).HUBS does get the advantage on the product being supplied. NOW supplies a product that mainly deals with incident service such as incident management, change management, problem management, request management, cost management, etc. While these are all important services, they still pale in comparison to marketing/selling, which is the main thrust of HUBS's product(s). Even in a recession (or perhaps even more so in a recession) companies have to sell their products. If a company like HUBS can help a company increase its sales, it will have to spend on that product even in a recessionary environment. The phrase ""do more with less"" also comes to mind. Marketing organizations will want to become leaner in a recession. Companies will be much more likely to cut back or defer spending on the services NOW supplies - advantage HUBS.HubSpot is more of a direct competitor with Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM). It too has seen its stock fall dramatically (see chart below).The purple line in the chart above is CRM. The teal (blue green) line is HUBS. CRM has fallen, but it has not fallen nearly as much as HUBS. This does not seem valid, except for the idea that CRM is a bigger, more stable company. Plus they are not completely at odds with each other. HUBS product allows for the use of CRM products. However, it does provide good services on its own, and many customers seem to think that the way these services fit relatively seamlessly together is highly preferable to the mishmash of products that CRM has put together largely by buying other companies.HUBS seems to have learned from CRM's experience, and it has constructed a flexible, extendible product with great base functions. It has also had the advantage of designing and implementing it ""in-house"" with consistent tools, languages, operating systems, etc., and with top engineers from the excellent nearby colleges. Logic tells one that HUBS base product should be far superior to the many different companies' products that CRM has had to glue together somehow. The user interfaces have to be more consistent and easier to learn. That should translate into less training time. It should be easier to add new products onto a base that is well designed for that. Again the updates should be easier, and the learning curves for users should be much more rapid.The following review of HUBS product is from an independent review company. It should give readers an idea of why HUBS should be able to continue its good growth. It may also be able to take customers away from Salesforce.com.Of course, Salesforce.com's products have their admirers too. However, there are myriad complaints about CRM that don't seem to be nearly as prevalent with HubSpot. CRM touts its ability to let customers customize the product to their own taste. It touts the huge number of available apps - many of which are free. However, users complain that they have to spend a huge amount of time redoing all customizations and custom data whenever a new version of a Salesforce product is released. HUBS doesn't have this problem (or perhaps it is just an order of magnitude less with HUBS). Marketing organizations have to consider that customization means more training time. Often it will mean training time without documentation. This is a significant expense. Marketing can be political; and marketers can burn out. Significant turnover every 2-3 years is not uncommon in a marketing organization.Further some users complain that Salesforce.com disappears after they have made their sale. They do not think much of their customer service. Others note that CRM does not try to sell Service Level Agreements, which guarantee a specific amount of uptime. Apparently, a significant number of customers experience much more downtime of their CRM systems than they would like. Many complain CRM products are expensive.HUBS has a base product that:HUBS may be able to take significant business away from CRM and other competitors. Thus, HubSpot can expand with new customers it develops. Plus it can take business away from other competing platforms with a better user experience (and lower cost than some).Another significant point is that HUBS has an average analysts' five-year EPS growth estimate per annum of 42.10%. This is great growth. Further, the company has beaten earnings estimates for each of the last four quarters by an average of almost 17%. Another beat is most likely coming for Q4 2015. That should help the stock rise. The likely fantastic growth number should help too.In Q3 2015, revenue rose 57% year over year; and margin rose +8% year over year. This last is a very healthy sign. Subscription revenues were up 59% year over year; and even the average subscription rate was up 16% year over year. This last seems to indicate that HUBS has a popular product. Professional Services revenues were up 37% year over year. CEO Brian Halligan said on CNBC when Q3 2015 earnings came out in early November that HUBS is not seeing any signs of a slowdown. Hopefully, this remains true. Even if it is not, it seems likely that HUBS will see only a small slowdown. After the NOW announcement, this should not engender any further selling. In fact, HUBS should still rise.With a rebound in mind, the $40 per share level looks like a good technical point for HUBS to rally too (see chart above). It closed at $27.52 per share on February 9, 2016. CRM will likely rally too. However, HubSpot has a lot more room to the upside. It is a buy before earnings. I like it as a long-term investment. I believe in the company. Users like the product; and marketers (the users) can be very critical. Thus, HUBS is a very good product. I have not used it myself; but I have been a marketer. What I hear about it impresses me.Remember also that the FPE will move from referencing FY2016 to referencing FY2017 with the Q4 2015 earnings report. It is possible that HUBS will guide for actual positive EPS results for FY2017. If that happens, the stock may move up a lot. If it doesn't, HUBS's management seems likely to hint that actual positive EPS will happen in FY2018. Even that should be a positive for the stock price.The chart below tends to reaffirm that HUBS has been growing nicely:With this kind of revenue growth, customer growth, and average subscription revenue per customer growth, it is hard to see the company having significant problems in the near future. CEO Halligan was practically giddy when he talked about the Q3 2015 results and the outlook. I don't expect a change for Q4 2015. HUBS's total debt/total capital is only 0.49%. It does not have a debt problem. Therefore, it should be able to get loans for any money needs it encounters even in a recession. Likely, stock offerings will take care of this. With HUBS's growth outlook, even those should go well in a tough environment.I am not sure if you want to make an options play on HUBS over earnings. However, I do view the company as a good long-term investment. The stock is far oversold. The RSI is at 17.18 (far below the 30 level usually used for oversold conditions). The Stochastic Oscillator shows it far oversold at 2.76. Bollinger Bands show it far oversold. Technically, HUBS almost has to go up.Fundamentally, one expects a good to great earnings announcement from HUBS. I would not be surprised to see conservative guidance for FY2016. However, after the recent stock market fall, this is probably baked into the earnings report expectations. Any positive surprise seems likely to result in upside stock price movement. HUBS is a BUY before earnings. It should be a great long-term performer. There is a great call for SaaS marketing tools, especially well-liked ones. When you can get HUBS at half the price it was selling for in the late fall, it is a bargain. If you want to just ""play earnings,"" it is probably a good stock to do that with too. As of January 15, 2016, HUBS was shorted by 8.55% of its float. That makes an upward pop on earnings just that much more likely. It makes a large pop upward more likely too.Note: Some of the fundamental fiscal data above is from Yahoo Finance.Good luck trading/investing."
3750356,21305,2016-01-10T12:22:07-05:00,"HubSpot pays no dividend at this time.HUBS is still losing money; but it has been making large gains towards profitability.The FPE is still non-existent. However, the earnings growth rate indicates that the FPE should become solidly positive after the Q4 2015 earnings. This should lift the stock price.The chart below shows HUBS's revenue gains have shown large steady growth.","At this time, it pays no annual dividend. HUBS was started in 2005, and it is headquartered in Cambridge, Mass. For those who don't know, that is the home of Harvard and MIT. Having that kind of talent near at hand is a good point in HubSpot's favor.Some people would probably say that Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) has this market sewn up. However, I have read some of the reviews of their product, which I found online. These reviews were not provided by the company, but by companies that specialize in reviewing products. They indicate that HUBS will likely compete well with Salesforce.com. Plus it is not necessarily a direct competitor. A very apropos review is below.The graphic below shows an overview of HUBS's process. I note SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization.A second reason to believe in HUBS's longer-term outlook is the history of the two companies. Salesforce.com was put together quickly by continually buying companies (and hence their products) to enhance the services provided by Salesforce.com. The problem with this approach is that a consistent thought process behind the development virtually cannot be there. It's in reality a mish-mash of different products, and it feels that way to the users. A part of a review is below.Essentially, the above reaffirms my original point. The Salesforce.com product(s) is not one well-architected product (from either a software or a business perspective) that can be added to in a fairly painless way for customers. Instead, customers have to redo quite a lot of their work each time Salesforce.com comes out with an additional new product they want to use. The new product invariably does not flow into the rest of the program(s).As a consequence of the above, Salesforce.com also has a long-term development problem. Its programs use different languages. They use different design methodologies. They even use different presentation methods. This also means that there are more training costs associated with the development of Salesforce.com's products. People cannot move easily between projects. They have to be retrained (or let go). Salesforce.com began to try to address this problem a few years ago, but this problem and others seemingly will be with Salesforce.com for a long time to come. They will make it a more expensive and time consuming process for Salesforce.com to keep improving its products at a good rate of speed.In contrast, HUBS has been developed mostly by one company. Its architecture and design have been spearheaded by some of the best minds in computer science. The thought processes of its business strategies have gotten the benefit of the MIT and Harvard Business Schools (and others). This should allow HUBS to innovate faster, less expensively, and with less extra work for the customers as it goes forward. This makes me think that it has a good to great long-term chance of competing well with Salesforce.com (or exiting symbiotically with Salesforce.com).On top of this, CEO Brian Halligan recently said on CNBC that HUBS is not seeing any signs of a slowdown. He pointed to the +57% total revenue increase year over year and the +8% year-over-year margin gain in Q3 2015. HUBS's subscription revenues were up 59% year over year. It gained 1,015 new customers. This brought the total to 16,500+. Average subscription revenue was up +16% year over year. Professional Services revenues were $3.6 million. This was up +37% year over year. This is yet another reason to be interested in the stock.The charts below show the growth rates of three metrics since HUBS's IPO.As readers can see, the growth in virtually all areas is good to great. FYI, ASRPC stands for Average Subscription Rate Per Customer.Now for the bad (or not so good) news. GAAP Operating Margin was -27.9% compared to -36.0% a year earlier. Non-GAAP Operating Margin was -18.3% compared to -31.8% a year earlier. This is still negative, but it is a big improvement. The GAAP Operating Loss was -13.3% compared to -11.0 million a year earlier. The Non-GAAP Operating Loss was -$8.8 million compared to -$9.7 million. GAAP net loss attributable to common shareholders was -$13.6 million (or -$0.40 per share) compared to -$10.8 million (or -$1.84 per share) in the year earlier quarter. Non-GAAP net loss attributable to common shareholders was -$9.0 million (or -$0.27 per share) compared to -$9.5 million (or -$1.62 per share) in the year earlier quarter.The above looks bad for immediate profits. However, if you look at the improvements in metrics on a per share basis, they are considerable. They indicate good to great progress towards profitability in the near future. The FPE may still be non-existent. However, that FPE refers to FY2016 only until HUBS reports earnings for Q4 2015. Then it will shift its reference to FY2017. At that point, HUBS FPE should become a solidly positive number, and that would be a huge positive for the stock price.The average analysts' FY2015 adjusted EPS estimate is -$2.77 per share. The average analysts' FY2016 adjusted EPS estimate is -$0.80 per share. With this much progress expected in the next year, it is at least reasonable to expect that the EPS will be nicely positive for FY2017. On top of that, the average analysts' five-year EPS Growth estimate is +42.10%. That means that a lot more great years are expected after that. It means that HUBS should be a good to great long-term buy.The two-year chart of HUBS provides some technical direction for a trade/investment.As investors can see, the above is a very strong uptrend. The overall market has been in decline lately, and HUBS has declined a bit with it. However, unless the bottom falls out of the market, HUBS is probably a good buy at this time. It is even more likely to be a good long-term buy. If you are worried about the near-term performance of the market (or even the medium-term performance of the market), you may want to wait for the still expected Christmas upswing, or you may want to average in. HUBS is also small enough at a market cap of $1.95B that it will probably benefit from the traditional small cap surge upward in January. All told, I like this company, and its CEO looked very happy when he spoke to CNBC. That doesn't usually happen when the roof is about to fall in. HUBS is a solid long-term buy.NOTE: Some of the fundamental fiscal information above is from Yahoo Finance.Good Luck Trading/Investing."
3738076,29391,2015-12-07T12:35:00-05:00,"HubSpot's inbound-marketing platform is seeing intense growth and compliments Salesforce's current offering.HubSpot's new CRM platform, Sidekick, is gaining traction in the mid-market.Salesforce's history of acquisitions with marketing tech companies make this likely.","HubSpot's legendary Inbound conference, Source: Michael ConwayI first wrote this article a month ago when the company was trading at $49. Sadly (but proving me right), it has risen about 16% since then.Since its IPO, HubSpot (NYSE:HUBS) has rocketed from $30 to $58 a share. It currently trades at ~$58 and I think HUBS has further to go. It's an incredibly smart company with very smart people and I expect it will be acquired at a much higher price.I think Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) could, would and should make this acquisition.Where HubSpot fits in marketing tech fieldAny B2B company and many B2C companies need HubSpot to manage their ""inbound"" marketing processes. Over the past 10 years, as online marketing has become more dominant it has split into two factions.1) Outbound marketing - This is pay-per-click advertising, banner adverts, search advertising, social adverts, etc.2) Inbound marketing - Getting organic traffic from search, SEO (search engine optimization), creating blog articles, solving problems first, pushing products later.Outbound marketing is very complicated and fractured. But inbound marketing is much simpler: create informational, educational content around search terms people are searching for. Then you put a marketing funnel in place to collect leads and follow up with them.HubSpot has a real monopoly over this market because they've created such a quality platform. HubSpot's founder, Dharmesh Shah, even invented the term ""Inbound Marketing."" I was given his book as a primer when I started my digital marketing career.HubSpot is like a company selling magnets. It's selling the platform, the services and tools that connect business and customers. Its Inbound marketing platform provides huge value for any company with an online presence.The CRM platform that HubSpot have builtWhat's more, their Sidekick business could make it a strong CRM proposition as well for sales teams.It can notify sales teams what prospects are reading on the site and how many key documents they have read. It also tracks their customer stage.This offers huge value because it gives salespeople really granular data about what clients know.I've used HubSpot as a marketing consultant and I used Salesforce as a salesperson - in different jobs. From personal experience Salesforce is a horrible platform - it's heavy, it's clunky, very early 2000s. Its terrible UI means it takes about 20 clicks to add a lead and move them between stages. It's horrendous. HubSpot is clean and straight forward. I like the interface because it's very intuitive.I think what this shows is that the people at HubSpot are better at building products than those at Salesforce.HubSpot is going after a different market to Salesforce with SidekickI think the value of Sidekick to Salesforce is that it's attracting large number of mid-market companies. Below is an interview with Hubspot's founders last year.So why should Salesforce buy HubSpot?Why could Salesforce buy HubSpot?Salesforce has been buying growth in the past through years. To keep their growth numbers high they have had to keep buying small companies. HubSpot would integrate well into Salesforce's ""Marketing Cloud"" like ExactTarget did after their $2.5 billion acquisition three years ago.Of all the marketing/sales technology companies out there, I believe HubSpot has one of the strongest value offerings.By acquiring HubSpot, Salesforce could create substantial value by connecting and cross selling within the two companies' client bases.Why should Salesforce acquire HubSpot now?HubSpot is growing rapidly, as the stock price indicates. A smart team and strong product offering make this a very strong company.HubSpot has a market cap of $2 billion and annual revenue of $172 million (based on last quarter's earnings of $42.9 million). That revenue has grown 58% in the past year and I wouldn't be surprised if it has big growth like that for many more years because it's so powerful.While that valuation is not cheap, if HubSpot keeps beating growth expectations their valuation will keep rising.I believe in Salesforce's hands HubSpot's tools would be worth much more than its current market cap. Why? Because the companies would slot together so well.If Salesforce bought HubSpot now, it would be a bargain. If they bought it later, it may be too expensive for them.In summaryEven if Salesforce doesn't buy HubSpot now I think it's still a very tasty stock. HubSpot will eventually be acquired by a bigger fish because it has such a strong offering.And if you feel HubSpot is still too expensive, look to buy it on the dips. - source Wes Shaeffer, under a creative commons license)"

HubSpot is most recently coming off an excellent post-earnings equity showing at last reporting before running into some ""sell first"" action with regard to high beta, immature-model tech. Still, shares have managed to recover some lost ground now that macro market volatility has subsided a bit and investors are back to focusing on fundamentals. That said, with financial expectations being generally high for this quarter, and with a few moving pieces in regard to the narrative needing sorted out, I thought I would outline a few items to watch.HubSpot has done well to keep investor focus on what has been a continuously developing TAM/defensive leadership position narrative at the company rather than the all too familiar distractions that normally plague newly public/immature names. At last reporting I continued a long running argument that HubSpot was in the early stages of what should be a comprehensive, multi-year, total evolution of its platform - similar to that of other disruptive tech platforms like Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) (from a productivity suite standpoint) in their early days. I still believe this to be the case and am still fully supportive of the HubSpot story. That said, HubSpot has run into some distractions that it needs to address and there are in fact some potentially model shifting/expanding developments (largely positive) that I'd like to hear comment on. The following is what I'll be watching at earnings.Criminal ProbeThese are two words I never would have expected to be connected to the narrative at HubSpot - ""criminal probe"". So, for those unfamiliar, HubSpot has gone through some recent bad press in light of what has been made public regarding former executives attempts to ""obtain a draft copy of a book about the company prior to its publication (SOURCE: Boston Globe HubSpot Report)"". The two executives alleged to have attempted to procure a copy of the book have either been let go or have resigned. The book, it should be noted, was written by a former employee of HubSpot. Apparently, the book doesn't frame HubSpot in such a nice light - allegedly detailing a culture reminiscent of most college fraternities (the authors words, not mine). This already embarrassing and distracting fiasco was made worse by sitting CEO Brian Halligan's failure to report the former executives in a quick enough (or some would say reasonable enough) amount of time. Halligan has since been fined for his failures but has been allowed to keep his job - moves I would have agreed were fair on all accounts.That said, HubSpot is going to be dealing with this negative press and this embarrassing issue for quite some time going forward as the process of investigation and potentially punitive action plays out. Despite the negativity that is brought to front of mind by discussing the matter - HubSpot needs to do just that. Each and every time a new development takes place it needs to address the issue head on and put it behind it. With the Boston Globe breaking the story that a now criminal investigation has been launched HubSpot, again, has to nail this line of questioning that is no doubt coming on the Q3 call. I spoke recently with sources close to HubSpot insiders who tells me this will blow over and that the company internally at least is not worried about this. I'd like to hear these thoughts made public if at all possible. We'll see how HubSpot addresses the elephant in the room.CRM DataGetting to the actual business at HubSpot, I want to know more about the CRM product launch and what the take rate looks like so far. I've covered the CRM product at HubSpot for Seeking Alpha readers since it exited beta and I've been impressed with it since launch. I've been further impressed with the additional buildout of the platform solution since beta-exit. My guess is, so have a lot of existing customers who might have chosen to make the jump to the same platform product rather than using content packs or porting data via an exchange broker to external CRM's. HubSpot has made this switch or initiation even easier based on its pricing scheduling.Big questions I'd like answered, outside of boilerplate financial rundown from the CFO that might be relevant to CRM, are items like total engagement (downloads, key metrics like contacts uploaded per customer, time spent on platform, etc.) and did the CRM product led to any direct or ancillary increases to ARPU. Specifically, I think it would be nice to hear about customers that are considered mature - I'd like to know if the CRM might have created ARPU ""creep"" for a cohort of customers that the company might have internally written off as maxed out. Why? Although I highly doubt HubSpot would make something like that public, this might be indicative of further marketing platform product buildout leading to even higher ARPU from the base. This is a plenty speculative claim to make at this point without data and so young into the CRM maturation as a model overlay but that would be something to get really excited about. Any much information as management can give regarding CRM, I'll take it.International Reseller DataAgain, outside of the boilerplate but very important base financial rundown given from the CFO I would love to hear specific updates given regarding international resellers. HubSpot's indirect, non-English salesforce which sells product into becoming more and more important international markets might be adding to what has been hugely negative FX impact in the immediate term but their efforts in the mid and long-term will be crucial to growing HubSpots global presence. HubSpot reported international revenue growth at Q2/15 reporting of 70% Y/Y with international revenue now comprising ~23% of revenue. International expansion has been and will presumably continue to be a strategic focus of HubSpot. The period to period health of this focus is something I'm interested in tracking and hearing commentary one. Here's to hoping we get some granularity in this regard at Q3 reporting.Summary ThoughtsDespite my annoyance with what I think is unnecessary controversy and distraction brought to the company by the poor choices of two former executives and the sitting CEO, HubSpot is definitively one of my favorite names in all of tech. I'm also ranking HubSpot at the top or near the top of tech names that I'm bullish. I cover a lot of tech so take that as meaningful. I really do believe that Inbound Marketing isn't just the future of marketing but that it's the ""right now"" of marketing. HubSpot is categorically the best at helping facilitate this in my opinion. (I should note that I have familiarity with multiple platforms but that I am a HubSpot customer).I want to own HubSpot for as long as it's in existence, which in my opinion won't be too much longer. While not a reason to go out and buy stock, I believe HubSpot to be an incredibly attractive buyout target for several big tech names. To keep from sensationalizing the HubSpot story at the conclusion of this note I'll refrain from naming the prospective buyers but just know that I think this name gets taken out within 24 months at much, much higher pricing. That said, I hope management brings clarity to the questions/uncertainties I've noted above at Q3 reporting.Good luck everybody."
3526846,81316,2015-09-23T14:04:49-04:00,HubSpot spends too much on marketing and sales.HubSpot needs to review and optimize customer acquisition costs.EBITDA is negative in the long term.,"HubSpot (NYSE:HUBS) is a cloud-based marketing and sales software for SMB and Enterprises. HubSpot has a complex platform combining marketing automation, e-mail marketing, search engine optimization, analytics, blogging etc. The company is a lead generator with a high level of integration with the business. HubSpot went public on October 10, 2015 with a $30 stock price.At the moment of writing this article, the price was around $51.65, which is 72% higher than its initial price. It is significant growth, isn't it? This company reminds me of Shopify (NYSE:SHOP): a comparable business model and the stock performance as well. Shopify also grew rapidly within several months from its initial public offering.At first glance, the company's stock looks very interesting, especially after the Q2 results announcement: its customer base grew 36%, total revenue up 58%, so that sounds rather interesting.However, I am always trying to get a deep understanding of the business model. Leaping ahead, the results of the financial model are at least questionable.Operating metricsI will check several operating metrics in order to understand the business model's efficiency.We cannot compare HubSpot's business model with Shopify, because of the high difference in such metrics. HubSpot is oriented towards a wide range of clients from SMB to Enterprises. Such a differentiated and complex platform reflects on HubSpot's ARPA: it is around $7,814 (as a result of the 2014 fiscal year) with an 11.5% 3-y CAGR. My first assumption is the 10% annual ARPA growth; however, the company announced a 15% ARPA growth by the end of Q2.If we take a look at the number of customers - it is growing around 19% each year. I have already mentioned that according to the Q2 results, HubSpot increased the number of customers by 36% versus June 2014. I suppose that the company will have the most significant growth in its customer base this year. I assume that HubSpot will have around 17k clients by the end of this year.(Source: calculations and infographics by Author)Marketing expenses per one new client (or customer acquisition cost) are much higher than Shopify. However, HubSpot decreased the marketing expenses per each new client in 2014 by 17%. But if we compare the 6m of 2014 and 2015, we can see that HubSpot increased customer acquisition cost from $21,507 to $22,486. Therefore, my next assumption concerns the CAC. I suppose that HubSpot will increase this operating factor by 12% this year and 8% next year.(Source: calculations and infographics by Author)Financials and valuationTaking into account my assumptions concerning operating metrics, I got the following results from the P&L:(Source: calculations and infographics by Author)I would like to underline the following points:To sum up, my financial model gave me the following output:(Source: calculations and infographics by Author)OpinionI issue a HOLD recommendation with downside potential. I think that the company needs to take some decisive steps for cost optimization, otherwise the business model is absolutely inefficient. I think that the target price of HubSpot's stock is at least 10% lower than the current.Note: if you are disagree with my assumptions, you can move the control buttons in my financial model."
3481686,48411,2015-09-01T10:00:44-04:00,"HUBS is out with several additional CRM upgrades and additions.Including both platform specific and non-platform specific upgrades, HUBS moves the needle from a competitive standpoint with these announcements.Continue to be long HUBS.","HubSpot (NYSE:HUBS) is out with some serious upgrades to its CRM platform. I've been following HubSpot for Seeking Alpha readers since its IPO and for private clients long before that. Since HubSpot is, in my opinion, one of the most influential and important SMB solutions in the entire tech space when it makes major product announcements I tend to think of them as a big deal. HubSpot's CRM announcement, while admittedly unexpected, was something that I saw immediate value from when overlayed and integrated into the already existing Inbound Marketing/sales platform the company was deploying.HubSpot following up its CRM announcement, which it admitted the platform was being launched in skeletal fashion, with a slew of upgrades that I also detailed should enhance both value-add and overall take rate. Today's article will detail a few more that should do more of the same. While I don't see CRM being a huge market differentiator a massive market cap drive per se I do see it as being a large contributor to the broader Inbound platform which is the majority driver of the current $1.57 billion market cap. That matters and that makes CRM matter.HubSpot's CRM upgrades were as follows:CRM Platform Specific:NOT CRM Platform Specific: The final two updates that I'll detail here (an exhaustive list can be found here) aren't necessarily CRM buildouts but overall platform upgrades that will be synergistic with the CRM platform. Both of these upgrades are pretty well explained within the graphics but I do want to note that this general function, that of collecting real-time data and that of collecting granular data from channel specific deployments (read: marketing platform, CRM, mailer service, etc.), is becoming a huge talking point in both SMB and enterprise solution recommendation conversations. At least the ones I've had most recently with clients of my consulting firm. HubSpot, in an effort to never be late to the game, is smart to roll this out as an integration to its CRM. Again, it's a must-have feature and one with some sex appeal that HubSpot (because of its size) can offer to SMB's with an aesthetic and a functionality that many other competitors can't. I really, really like this and can't stress how important this has become.All told I think that HubSpot continues to be impressive and continue to be an easy long position. HubSpot is one of those names that's so obvious to own, to those who know what they're looking at, that years from now when it's done 10X to its IPO price folks looking back with 20/20 hindsight vision will wonder why everybody wasn't long this name the entire time. I still like HubSpot to buy some Gamification names, Playbasis would be an amazing snag for the company, as I've opined I think Gamification is and will become a new normal ""must-have"" feature of Marketing/Selling/CRM platforms but for now these updates are moving the needle just fine. Another excellent development from an excellent company.Good luck everybody."
3314175,48411,2015-07-09T11:19:11-04:00,"A few weeks ago, I detailed how excited I was that HubSpot was taking its CRM solution out of beta and into full launch.I don’t use HubSpot’s CRM, but being an investor and being a SMB/enterprise consultant that recommends CRM solutions, this is something I am closely following.Even at first launch and even at a skeletal structuring, I was impressed with what the solution could provide to existing HubSpot users.Since initial launch HubSpot has continued to fill out the CRM capabilities and I’m even more bullish on HubSpot’s future because of it.Apparently so is the market with both BofA/Merrill and Pac Crest out bullish with recommendations and price targets.","A few weeks ago, I detailed how excited I was that HubSpot (NYSE:HUBS) was taking its CRM solution out of beta and into full launch. While I don't use HubSpot's CRM, being an investor in the company since the IPO and being a SMB/enterprise consultant that actively recommends CRM solutions, you can imagine this was something I was closely following. Even at first launch - I enrolled in the CRM on day one of launch - and even at a very skeletal structuring, I was impressed with what the solution could provide to existing HubSpot users.Since initial launch, HubSpot has continued to fill out the CRM capabilities and I'm even more bullish on HubSpot's future because of it. Apparently so is the market with both BofA/Merrill and Pac Crest out bullish with recommendations and price targets (BofA/Merrill is out with a $60 target - ~20% increase from intraday trading). The CRM improvements which I'll detail shortly, while nothing ground breaking, work to create an even bigger value-add for existing HubSpot users and to create an easier transition for external free CRM users. Overall, as indicated in a previous article, this should lead to higher levels of core platform retention and accelerated revenue run rates in the mid-term. I reiterate, as I did prior to the upmove in the equity price, that HubSpot's CRM launch and continued build out is a trigger to buy.Now, let's break out the CRM buildout so far:Sidekick Integration: Sidekick, HubSpot's ""moments of interest tracker"", is now integrated with HubSpot's CRM. The connection should happen automatically but if it doesn't, HubSpot has made it a simple two click process. Being able to see actionable events like which prospects have opened or clicked/tracked emails you've sent from your inbox or HubSpot CRM, alerts that prospects are viewing presentations or PDFs you've shared with them (requires Sidekick for Business), and alerts triggered when certain leads revisit your website after a period of absence (requires HubSpot marketing) is a big deal. It also matters when evaluating the total cost/benefit of making a switch from say a non-free but still very affordable CRM to the HubSpot premium CRM option. I think this is a big deal.Contact Profile Update: HubSpot rolled out a feature that's pretty standard in top-end CRMs (read: Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), etc.) but was noticeably absent at launch of its own. ""Property History"" will track all changes made to a profile inclusive of details as granular as who made the change and when. It will also file and store these changes for backward looking reference in the future. Mind blowing? No. Bringing HubSpot CRM up to par with other solutions? Yes. And remember, HubSpot isn't trying to ""win the space""; it's simply trying to create exit hurdles and make its core competency stickier. If you're an SMB using HubSpot Marketing, you have to be salivating at the idea of this new value-added CRM.Zapier Integration: Zapier is an event broker that basically works to integrate platforms that don't have official integrations. For instance, I use Zapier to integrate Salesfore.com CRM and Slack. HubSpot not only is smart enough to promote Zapier use, something that Salesfore.com (I've heard from behind closed doors but obviously can't confirm) does NOT like users to do, it also provides a very easy, almost color by numbers instructional on how to execute the event broker connection. This, at least in the early going, immediately scales up HubSpot's CRM to comparable integration levels with upper echelon solutions. Again, HubSpot being innovative and forward thinking - being willing to accept what its solution is and what it isn't. This too will go a long way in expanding out use cases and figuring into the cost benefit of a CRM switch. I don't just like this, I love this.I'll stop my article here but there are plenty of other feature buildouts that deserve mention. If you're a HubSpot marketing user, make sure to give the CRM a look and see for yourself what you think prior to initiating or adding to a long position.Again, I'm not here to call out HubSpot's CRM as a best of breed, but I'm confident in saying it's nowhere near the bottom of the barrel. With a little more effort and innovation, it can actually be competitive in the space which would be an incredible accomplishment considering this isn't HubSpot's core competency or focus.I continue to like HubSpot to move higher. Even at all-time highs I recommend a long position for all durations. HubSpot is up 49% since initiation.Good luck everybody."

At this point it already does some of what LeadPages is doing, but in my experience using HubSpot, it isn't doing enough of what LeadPages is doing. That apparently matters based on the $27 million upround LeadPages just closed and it apparently matters from a profitability standpoint as LeadPages' business is cash flow positive and has been since inception.What's the downside to providing a great service and having a micro-segment be a net contributor from a cash flow standpoint? I don't see one.What LeadPages does primarily is help create leads. It does this via providing landing page templates that are easily customizable and publishable - which are dialed in using ""1 billion points of data (SOURCE: LeadPages.com)""; proactive leadboxes - popup forms that are integrated with email service providers that can be triggered using multiple touch points or triggers; and deploying text message campaigns - an industry first that allows customers to create landing pages (physical, online, integrated with power points, etc.) that are opted in via sms messaging.From there LeadPages provides a data and analytics platform that helps customers reflect on the efficacy of a campaign and drive more positive outcomes. Once the data and analytics efforts have resulted in a final decision, which by the way this platform isn't a third party integration but a prop system (read: this isn't your basic Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Analytics dashboard), LeadPages provides ways to offer segmenting campaigns (via ""LeadLinks"") to further funnel down gathered leads to more targeted efforts like webinars, particular lists for products or services, etc.Maybe best of all though, LeadPages allows existing pages to be imported into its system for conversion to a template that the platform will allow for editing, all without a developer. That is a fantastic reason for a Worpress, Wix (NASDAQ:WIX), or Squarespace user to use its services at the very least for optimization and in a best case scenario for any iteration updates.Now, with HubSpot already being the primary lead generation/lead management/lead nurturing platform in the Marketing space (I'd say salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) is this in the primarily CRM space) doesn't this just seem like a natural progression of the platform? HubSpot is already offering templates and landing page assistance as well as other content generation engines but it doesn't have a page conversion engine or a way to deploy text messaging campaigns. Both would be huge value-adds to the HubSpot platform and both, presumably, could bring higher ARPU.At the very least these additional features would make the HubSpot platform stickier and would bring the above mentioned benefit of creating transition use cases out of Wordpress/Wix.com/Squarespace customers. If this can be done at cash flow breakeven or better, clearly it can as evidenced by LeadPages and HubSpot would be able to leverage the minimal fixed costs of these services to a much, much greater degree, I ask again where is the downside?I'm always a fan of buying technology add-on's and that would be my recommendation for HubSpot in this case as well - just buy LeadPages and get the service ramped and running. HubSpot definitely has the cash with $129 million on the books at last quarter's reporting. Make good use of some of that cash and add some offensive firepower that also works out to be cash flow breakeven.I continue to recommend a long position in HubSpot. HubSpot is up 55% since initiation.Good luck everybody."

Frankly the news that the company has fired its then sitting CMO and that its VP of Content has resigned (ahead of an investigation concluding that may or may not have called for his termination) is as disappointing as it is annoying. This is something that the company simply did not need ahead of Q2/15 earnings and heading into a period in which it is finally being taken very seriously by the broader market.Still, the worst part this is that as HubSpot approaches $2 billion in valuation and what could be considered its most important growth stage in company history it will be entering this stage with uncertainty and a cloud above it. The uncertainty coming from a management shakeup, to two of the company's most important positions no less, and the cloud coming from the fact that CEO Brian Halligan had some knowledge that the alleged infractions were taking place. For clarity, what has been alleged is that the sitting CMO and the then sitting VP of Content were attempting to, ""procure a draft manuscript of a book involving the Company (SOURCE: HUBS PR)"". The fact that a manuscript of the goings on at HubSpot was something that two highly educated and well paid individuals thought was worth a monetization efforts speaks to the sheer value of Inbound Marketing and what I've called the ""new normal"" for advertising and marketing. Literally entire media companies have been created simply by instructing do it yourself startups on how to Inbound Market - growthhackers.com, blog.kissmetrics.com, etc. While really nothing positive can be taken from a PR like the one in discussion that fact might be the silver lining to be had. Inbound Marketing - which HubSpot invented, is the future and a very monetizable and lucrative one.The questions left on the table now heading into earnings that Halligan and Co-Founder Dharmesh Shah (who is really an excellent public and greater-social face of the company) are going to have to answer are meaningful - or at least they could be. I personally have questions regarding what role or how important either the CMO or VP of Content were in the development of the new CRM that was recently launched. I also have questions as to who will fill Kipp Bodnar's role in hiring and building out the EMEA and APAC marketing teams. Kipp Bodnar is the promoted and now CMO of HubSpot who prior was VP of Marketing but to my understanding had a more international focused role. HubSpot has recently made international a major focus and a major mid-term growth strategy. Again, the problem with the management shakeup is more the timing of the shakeup rather than the allegations. This could not have come with worse timing.Still, as noted in the HubSpot PR announcing the changes, none of this has anything to do with the company's financials, accounting, or general operations that are in-place. I don't believe this announcement should garner lower recommendations (via downgrades) or lower analyst price targets. I do, however, think that the Q2/15 investor call becomes that much more important in that HubSpot has to absolutely nail the questions regarding the go-forward plans (I assume analysts will have the same concerns that I have) and Halligan needs to be that much more transparent about what he knew and when. Just because the Board decided to let him stay doesn't give him a free pass with analysts or investors.All told this management shakeup does introduce unnecessary risk into the model ahead of earnings and with the shares trading at all-time highs the risk becomes especially amplified. That said, I still really, really like HubSpot into earnings (for what I expect are blowout financials and increased guidance) from the long-side. I've been long HubSpot since $33.30 in mid-January 2015 and intend to hold though earnings and beyond but I did want readers who've followed me into a position and/or followed the HubSpot story to have my take on what is a very scary headline.Continue to be long HubSpot but definitely be on that investor call.Good luck everybody."

I think this is a no brainer but allow me to explain why HubSpot in particular should make this happen.First, who and what is Playbasis?Playbasis is a gamification specialist that helps turn activities into game-like, trackable achievements that increase engagement and overall usage. Obviously, we've seen this model before from the likes of Foursquare and we've seen this rolled out to large, company specific platforms - think Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) with its Starbucks Card/App/Stars. The more you engage (read: use product) the more you're ""rewarded"". Of course, this is a great concept for the company no matter how it deploys it assuming it can get traction.This is also a highly commoditized service and one that I think is currently and will continue to be in a race to zero. With what I believe is minimal coding investment and minimal overhead this service can be replicated and deployed in-house (see: Starbucks). That said, I'm still pushing for an acquisition of Playbasis by HubSpot and here's why.HubSpot knows that if its customers use its platform, use it often, and use it correctly that it can help drive positive outcomes. It also knows, via its dollar retention rate, that when it can positively drive outcomes it can retain business. This, by the way, is a good thing for HubSpot and HubSpot investors like myself. So how can HubSpot drive engagement with its platform for those new to the solution and/or not especially tech savvy? By turning it into a game - something that HubSpot currently does not do.Listen, I'm not saying that this is or would be a game changer (no pun intended) for HubSpot or that this will make or break forward looking growth - it isn't and it won't. But, for ~$10 million in valuation (add a small multiple on that, call it 30% to 40%) HubSpot can have a ready to integrate out of the box technology that will bring it higher levels of engagement. HubSpot already is proactively driving platform user engagement with its certification programs which, to me at least, evidences that it understands the importance of the usage/outcomes/retention correlations.Also, and importantly, Playbasis is Bangkok-based which will give HubSpot even more APAC exposure, something that it is making a long-term focus.Finally, and this is maybe the one thing keeping Playbasis from being entirely commoditized - which by the way the commodity/race to zero concerns with the niche make Playbasis CEO Rob Zepeda's fantastical fantasy of an eventual IPO just that, Playbasis has developed a ""series of API's and modules developed to give app developers, game publishers and anyone creating apps the opportunity to incentivize users via rewards, and more (SOURCE: techcrunch.com)"" that should allow HubSpot customers to deploy intra-company gamification to their employees. I think that's a real value-add toss in that HubSpot could use to drive top of ""chain"" engagement - meaning its customer's Inbound Marketing engagement.Again, I don't think that a Playbasis acquisition is what takes HubSpot from $50/share to $100/share longer term but I do think Playbasis can bring something to the table that makes sense and that adds value. I also think that if HubSpot wants to start spending the ~$129 million in cash it had on the books at Q1/15 reporting that it can really secure market share in what is a total land grab right now - I've recently recommended HubSpot look into LeadPages as well. The more land HubSpot can plant its flag on (and retain) the more the company eventually sells for - which is how I see the HubSpot story ending.I continue to recommend a long position in HubSpot and view is as one of the more disruptive tech names in the market.Good luck everybody."

This is HUBS' fifth global office with other locations located in the US (both in Massachusetts and in New Hampshire) and in Ireland (serving as HUBS' Euro HQ).While HUBS is a company that utilizes its own creation of inbound marketing, HUBS literally created the methodology and coined the term, it does have a small sales team that actually deploys by traditional methods. Having an expanded presence in the region should lead to accelerated sales - at least that has been the case with the Sydney location since launching in 2014 and the Ireland location from years prior. HUBS, no doubt, is looking to time this APAC HQ and overall expanded presence with the explosion of ecommerce/mcommerce in the APAC region and with that the need for unique, demand creating marketing.I also anticipate, although this hasn't been stated just yet, that HUBS will look to create infrastructural redundancies in the area to further secure the stability of its platform and to deepen the overall value-prop of its platform. One redundancy that will be created that won't show up in the financials but will help contribute to growth is that of HUBS' INBOUND Conference. The annual INBOUND conference in the US (which also sees quite a bit of Euro traffic) has been huge into differentiating HUBS and into creating retention and growth - at least according to management on conference calls since coming public. Having a major hub to host at in the APAC region will be a meaningful immediate driver to both.Obviously further international expansion has its risks and I believe these are well known - FX impact, the inability to integrate or evolve methodology to meet local customary norms, an inability to acquire local sales talent, etc. But with ~$129 million in C&CE and $7 million in short term investments (as of Q1/15) and with prior international expansion success I view this as a high visibility catalyst that should show to drive share price in the mid-term. Put simply, I expect HUBS to execute on this and for this to be a positive that creates growth for a long, long time moving forward.I continue to recommend a long position in HUBS.Good luck everybody."

HubSpot, being primarily an Inbound Marketing solution, has responded to the call.Now, HubSpot is also offering a CRM solution.While HubSpot has done well integrating into CRM leaders like salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM), Zoho, SugarCRM, and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), its entry into the space should create opportunity for it to service the percentage of its customers that aren't integrating its core platform to partner CRMs. With HubSpot knowing the exact percentage of customers this applies to (because its platform will either read as connected to an external CRM or not) this should create easy, early adoption sales that should provide revenue upside into year-end. I expect management to elaborate on the growth strategy for the CRM solution and to update guidance inclusive of the CRM at Q2/15 reporting, which I was expecting yet another blowout to be reported even before this news.Outside of the easy cross selling, having another solution should create even higher levels of retention. To be clear, HubSpot has always had a stellar retention record but this will simply be an even greater barrier to exit and switching ""cost"" to consider even if customers are using the free version of the CRM. The concept of greater levels of retention with more product saturation is well-tested and well-proven across tech verticals and niches. It should also be noted that HubSpot's core solution will auto-load HubSpot data into its CRM which does create incremental value for the solution and could generate market share take from other free CRM usage that doesn't. To be clearer, while I'm not saying HubSpot's CRM is a best of breed by any stretch, it does have some attractive features.Now, I'm a HubSpot customer and use the Inbound Marketing platform for my digital properties. From my early testing of the CRM it seems very skeletal, as expected, but VERY user friendly - something that salesforce.com and others have struggled with. This is the main contributing point to my thoughts that this tool is primarily targeting HubSpot's SMB customer base with an even more dialed-in focus to the smaller SMB's within the subset.This is anecdotal but from my experience working with SMB's and launching SMB solutions my guess is that most of these are already using free CRM's. This should make the switching easier, as free to free makes sense, with the switching trigger being having a marketing platform and CRM solution under one umbrella.All told this is excellent news for those already long HubSpot and for those considering a long position. I think this is a buying trigger for those actively considering a HubSpot initiation.I continue to recommend a long position in HubSpot.Good luck everybody."
3242426,73565,2015-06-08T08:23:11-04:00,"In seven charts, we explore how HubSpot built its business.We explore revenue growth, average revenue per customer, sales efficiency, payback periods, net income, gross margin and engineering spending.The HubSpot journey to a public company provides a terrific set of benchmarks for other SMB SaaS companies.","One of the best ways I've found to understand SaaS companies is to pore through their public filings. A few months ago, I analyzed Box's S-1. In this post, we'll look at HubSpot's IPO filing and compare their journey to a public company with a basket of about 40 other publicly traded companies, in the hopes that this data will help other founders chart their path to IPO.In the next seven charts, we'll explore how HubSpot (NYSE:HUBS) built their business. We will explore revenue growth, average revenue per customer, sales efficiency, payback periods, net income, gross margin and engineering spending. In these plots, I've used HubSpot's colors as a consistent legend. HubSpot company data is orange, median values are black, and other company values are gray.HubSpot has achieved amazing revenue growth in their first 7 years as a company growing by more than 12x from $5.7M in 2009 revenue to 2013 revenue of $71M - an 88% CAGR. HubSpot's revenue trajectory is effectively identical to the median publicly traded SaaS company.HubSpot's average revenue per customer (ARPC) of about $7,752 is the fourth smallest of the companies I analyzed. HubSpot's target customer base are SMBs and with this price point, it's possible to support a profitable inside sales model if the team is very efficient. Only WIX, CTCT and RNG had smaller figures of $86, $265 and $352. FLTX], a maker of fleet tracking software, has identical ARPC. I've plotted a subset of them in the chart above.* estimated from the first six months of the S-1HubSpot is the second fastest SMB SaaS company to IPO yet, achieving the mark within 8 years. Most other SMB companies, defined for this analysis as having an ARPC of less than $15,000, took at least one more year to go public. Only WIX became a public company faster, achieving the mark in 7 years. Impressively, HubSpot has been able to record much faster revenue growth than other SMB SaaS companies. I've estimated $113M in revenue for 2014 by extrapolating their first six months of revenue this year and applying the 2013 growth rate to it. For comparison, DATA recorded $62M in its eighth full year of business, compared to $100M+ for HubSpot.  To grow at that pace, HubSpot has been investing aggressively in sales and the company is widely respected for its content marketing prowess. HubSpot's sales efficiency, defined as the incremental annual gross margin divided by the sales, marketing and general expenses incurred in the previous year, is somewhat lower than the median SaaS company. In 2013, the company recorded a sales efficiency of 0.47, meaning about $2 of sales and marketing spend is required to generate $1 in gross profit and the payback period, the number of years before a customer's revenue offsets the cost of customer acquisition is just over 2 years.Above, I've copied the unit economics data from the S-1. HubSpot has been either pursuing larger customers or has become more effective at generating more revenue from the same customer base by cross or up-selling. Average revenue per customer has increased by about 44% in the past two years. But that incremental revenue costs about 75% more in customer acquisition costs over the same period. The net effect is that HubSpot customers must pay for about 2.4 years before they become profitable on a unit basis. Given the current revenue churn rates, about 70% of customers on a dollar basis will be break-even or profitable, so the unit economics work.In the short term, the increasing costs of customer acquisition decrease net income. HubSpot must pay more to acquire a customers and as a consequence, the company's net income in dollar terms is below that of the public SaaS median, meaning the company is burning more cash than the typical public SaaS company. But, because HubSpot generates more revenue than the typical public SaaS company in its eight year, it can afford to spend more total dollars on customer acquisition than other companies at a similar stage.On a relative basis, however, HubSpot is closer to the median up until 2012. In 2013, with the big bump in CAC, HubSpot's net income as a percentage of revenue fell. However, only 5 companies had more negative net-income-to-revenue ratios: NetSuite (NYSE:N), Jive (NASDAQ:JIVE), Medidata (NASDAQ:MDSO), Box (NYSE:BOX) and Marketo (NASDAQ:MKTO). For the moment, HubSpot is among the least profitable companies in the set, but I suspect this is because the company is investing in growth.HubSpot's gross margin percent is rapidly improving, and tracking the median. This means that HubSpot's cost of revenue, which for SaaS companies includes hosting costs and customer support/success expenses, is right in line with comparable companies.Last, HubSpot has historically invested more in engineering (R&D) than most SaaS companies investing more than 50% of revenues just a few years ago, but as the business has grown, HubSpot's investment as a percentage of revenue has approached the median or about 20% of revenue.HubSpot has always been a leader in SMB customer acquisition, in particular because of their tremendous ability to acquire customers through content marketing. The HubSpot team has been able to build an explosive business, one of the fastest growing SMB SaaS companies in history with this model. The HubSpot journey to a public company provides a terrific set of benchmarks for other SMB SaaS companies. I'm excited to see how the company's story continues to evolve."
3445826,48411,2015-08-17T15:29:32-04:00,"HubSpot is an easy buy and has been for a while - buy all dips.HubSpot's growth looks great and its internals of the growth look good too - both signs of a healthy company.Expect much, much higher equity pricing for HubSpot going forward - as HubSpot matures it should be a cash flow machine.","HubSpot (NYSE:HUBS) continues to be an easy buy into excellent Q2/15 reporting. Absent its consistent high beta selling when macro markets experience pullbacks, this is a name that trades steadily higher into what has been excellent execution since IPO. I believe HubSpot's current selloff, shares have come down 11% from 52-week highs (giving the name 12.5 points to the topside before hitting its first technical resistance), offers an opportunity to take a long-term buy position. HubSpot, despite posting its first operational cash flow positive quarter at Q2/15, remains very early in its maturation cycle. Those that follow my tech coverage at Seeking Alpha understand this is a key investing methodology bullet point for me - invest early in maturation cycles of high growth, high retention, and highly targeted companies. HubSpot continues to fit the bill.This was evident in the quarter reported. HubSpot reported 58% revenue growth in the quarter which is a 10 point increase Y/Y and consistent sequentially. It should be noted, HubSpot faced 5 points of growth headwind from negative FX impact. I expect this headwind to remain present into next quarter and several quarters going forward. Should negative FX impact remain a constant, all indications are that it will, investors should normalize HubSpot revenue growth for between 5-8 points of impact. Depending on the rate of revenue growth acceleration for HubSpot international, which came in on the quarter at a growth rate of 70% (now representing 23% of total revenue), the top end of negative impact might need lifted 1-2 points. Still, I believe these to be non-core to the HubSpot fundamental story - which, again, is what I'm invested in.Within HubSpot's overall growth, which at this point is the single most important indication of health to track, come very healthy internals. Calculated billings, defined as revenue plus the change in deferred revenue, for the second quarter came in at $46.2 million, up 55% versus the second quarter of 2014. Subscription revenue grew at a healthy clip of 58% Y/Y and represented 91% of total revenue - total retention at HubSpot remains in the ""90%"" segment. This figure, for subscription revenue, was in line with previous quarters reported. It also sets the table for easy modeling and very controlled growth for the company while staying within the broader financials of the total income and cash flow statements. This has been paramount in helping the company avoid taking on debt to grow.In that, HubSpot posted its first quarter of operating cash flows during Q2. Adding to the positivity around subscription revenue, average subscription revenue per customer (the HubSpot ARPU line that should be of focus for investors) increased 15% compared to the second quarter of 2014. Again, this is in line with trends now well-established at HubSpot. HubSpot ended the second quarter with 15,839 customers, up 36% Y/Y. Growth is being driven by continued strength in both our direct and partner channels. Next quarter we should get our first look into international reseller data (HubSpot's indirect, non-English salesforce which sells product into becoming more and more important international markets). Stay tuned for updates on this. With HubSpot showing continued growth, growth beyond Street and internal expectations, and the uplift from an ARPU that meets both of the just stated, the company has increased its total revenue guidance on the full year. Now HubSpot expects 49% revenue growth on the full year using the mid-point of the range. Again, I believe HubSpot to be in the early stage of maturation and I believe this to be a figure that will need guided higher for full year 2016.That said, I believe HubSpots should continue to be held long in portfolios. I continue to consider it one of the more attractive names in all of tech and believe that it hasn't yet hit its ""peak adjusted growth"" period - a metric I use to adjust for dollar volume growth at larger numbers. Simply put, when companies grow larger of course growth rates on a percentage basis period to period show to ""slow"" while dollar volume growth continues to outpace prior quarters. Being an investor who focuses more on maturation cycles than anything (for tech companies), I track the dollar volume growth rate as a percentages of several moving factors (which are proprietary). I'll continue to use this metric adjustment in my evaluation of HubSpot for Seeking Alpha investors. As was just stated, I don't believe HubSpot has hit its peak nor do I believe HubSpot is anywhere close (when using this metric). I also believe that HubSpot has reasonably easy growth capture in the near-term coming from international markets and from it simply maturing into greater awareness.I continue to recommend a long position in HubSpot.Good luck everybody."
3236216,40031,2015-06-05T10:55:21-04:00,"HubSpot delivered solid gains since I initiated coverage in November 2014 and the stock is above my base case price target and the bullish case seems more realistic now.Revenue growth acceleration, customer and ARPU growth to drive further share price gains.The company in early innings of growth with significant expansion opportunities in international markets.Reiterating my view and raising my price target on HubSpot.","HubSpot (NYSE:HUBS) is up 38% since I initiated coverage in November 2014 and the stock has exceeded my $43 and $47 (see update here) base case price targets and given the criteria I outlined in my initiation article, it seems that the bullish case is coming through in the last couple of weeks. The company is having significant success in driving customer growth and increasing the ARPU and given the size of the addressable market, HubSpot is certainly in early inning of its growth story in current markets while the international growth opportunities remain largely untapped. Given the recent positive changes and expectations for continued strong growth, I am raising my price target on HubSpot.Revenue growth accelerates, margins improveHubSpot's Q1 revenue increased 58% to $38.2 million, which was the fourth straight quarter of growth acceleration. This turn of events was exactly what I was anticipating back in November, which was just a couple of weeks after the company went public and based on the rationale that the cash collected through the IPO would accelerate investments and drive higher revenue growth. The accelerated revenue growth was driven by both customer and ARPU growth. Total customers grew 35% Y/Y in Q1 to 14,746 while the average subscription revenue per customer increased from 15% Y/Y to $9,740. Gross margin increased from 69.2% in Q4 2014 to 72.6% in Q1 while the non-GAAP operating margin improved 400 basis points sequentially to negative 16%, which is also a significant improvement over negative 34% in the same quarter last year.The company also provided solid quarterly and full-year guidance, but it points to slowing revenue growth in the following quarters. Given the limited guidance history in the last two quarters and the significant growth acceleration in the last four quarters, I think that management is being conservative and that we should see higher top line growth than the current analyst consensus. If the company delivers at the mid-point of Q2 guidance, it would represent the slowest sequential revenue increase ever when looking at the available data going back to Q1 2012. I expect a Q2 top line beat between $2 million and $3 million while my full-year revenue estimate is in the $170 million to $180 million range.The company's niche expertise and the effectiveness of inbound marketing are really the reasons for the strong growth in the previous years and represent a strong basis for continued growth in the future. Given the addressable market of approximately 3 million mid-market businesses in North America and Europe and the number of paying customers, the company has barely scratched the surface. Fellow contributor Dallas Salazar paints a really good picture in his latest article about the strengths of its business model and the focus on the niche market instead of going after areas that the company lacks expertise (at least for now). The size of the current addressable market is more than enough for the company to grow substantially in the following years, in addition to international markets that the company is yet to penetrate.International growth is a largely untapped opportunity and should keep the growth rates high in the following yearsIn addition to barely scratching the surface in domestic markets, HubSpot is preparing to penetrate more international markets in the following years. The company has offices in Dublin and Sydney and has been focused on English speaking regions and management stated on the Q1 conference call that they are setting up the infrastructure to support multiple languages. International revenues accounted for 22% of total revenues in the first quarter and are growing north of 70% Y/Y. The growth should really accelerate once the company puts more focus on these opportunities and this is why I expect robust top line growth to continue in the following years, which should keep the company trading at a high P/S multiple and HubSpot should deliver significant gains to its shareholders in the long run.Higher P/S ratio target warranted by strong executionThe accelerating revenue growth, improving margins, the large addressable market and international growth are likely the main reasons why HubSpot should continue to trade in a high P/S ratio range. My previous price target of $47 was based on a 2015 P/S ratio of 9, and I am moving my P/S ratio target to 12 based on higher revenue expectations. In my previous article, I compared HubSpot's valuation to Marketo (NASDAQ:MKTO) and ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) and said that revenue growth acceleration might lead to a higher P/S multiple. HubSpot's P/S ratio has expanded from 9 to 10 to above 12 in the last couple of weeks and I expect the company to remain in the 11 to 13 range in the following quarters. Based on the 2015 P/S ratio of 12, I am raising my price target on HubSpot to $60, which translates into 20% upside from the current price. If HubSpot's revenue growth accelerates further, I would expect the company to trade in a valuation range similar to ServiceNow, which has the highest growth profile among the three companies at the moment.On the other hand, Marketo is a clear example of what happens when revenue growth slows down (Marketo's quarterly revenue growth has decelerated for three straight quarters from 60% to 42%), but I think that the market overreacted to the recent slowdown and that Marketo is quite interesting at current levels, especially when compared to ServiceNow and HubSpot. If HubSpot's revenue growth decelerates in a similar fashion, we can expect the company's valuation to come down to match Marketo's, although I think that the market overreacted to Marketo's recent results and that it should recover in the following months.Source: Yahoo! Finance, HubSpot earnings reportsConclusionHubSpot's growth story is progressing in line with my expectations and I believe that the company can still reward its shareholders despite the significant rise of its share price in the last couple of weeks. The large addressable market and international growth should drive high revenue growth in the following years and the long-term upside potential is still significant. The main risk to the thesis is currently the valuation, since the market is counting on the company to continue to grow at a rapid pace and a top line growth deceleration might lead to a contracting P/S ratio and result in a correction of at least 20% to 30%, but I do not expect this to happen in the next couple of quarters."
3228056,48411,2015-06-01T17:04:50-04:00,"HUBS recently presented at the JP Morgan Global Technology, Media, and Telecom Conference.As always CEO Brian Halligan put on a great show and really drove home the HUBS story.Key topics addressed and commented on in this article are the salesforce.com relationship, HUBS competitive position, and the possibility for a HUBS upmarket move.I continue to recommend a long position in HUBS.","HubSpot (NYSE:HUBS) gave us a little bit of everything at its JPMorgan Global Technology, Media and Telecom Conference presentation but it was all good. HUBS framed its platform capabilities and framed its place in the broader marketing/CRM space quite nicely. I continue to recommend HUBS as a long position and continue to view it, being one of my favorite SMB/enterprise solutions, as an attractive and high percentage acquisition possibility. Shares are up ~53% since initiation.There are very few presenters better than Brian Halligan, CEO of HUBS, who somehow finds a way to give the audience just as much interesting, captivating backstory as he does company information. But it's in the backstory that the investment community is able to put the HUBS story into context and it's in the backstory that the investment community is able to remember just what it is that makes HUBS a special, special company. In the same way that HUBS has essentially created inbound marketing its CEO might be creating a different way of presenting. I highly recommend a read of the presentation transcript if you have access to it.So, what were the highlights of the presentation for those looking for the cliffsnotes?What's the deal with the salesforce.com,Inc. (NYSE:CRM) relationship?Competition? I don't know about that but the relationship is interesting.I was asked by a commenter in a recent HUBS article (I think, it might have been a Zendesk (NYSE:ZEN) article) about the crossover and the headbutting between ZEN/HUBS/salesforce.com - to which I don't know that there is a whole bunch.I don't consider HUBS (or close comparable Marketo (NASDAQ:MKTO) for that matter) a CRM (customer relationship management) platform just as I don't consider salesforce.com an inbound marketing platform. I don't consider either a customer service platform like a ZEN. But to be clear, all these SMB/enterprise solutions do share bits and pieces of each other as we've effectively blurred the lines of all three ""core competencies"". Still, know that the verticals of marketing/CRM/customer service still exist in framed silo's that differentiate each other.So for HUBS to say there's ""healthy competition"" I think is misplaced but not by accident. The last thing that HUBS management wants to do is be distracted by what I think they proactively try to avoid - the obvious acquisition potential between HUBS and salesforce.com. They also, I'm sure, don't want to be tasked with trying to build out the HUBS model to become ""more attractive to salesfore.com"" which is what the financial media would turn into a viral clickbait/eyeball bait campaign because doesn't that just have so much juice to it?But even in saying that I have to be the blogger I hate and admit that the relationship between HUBS/salesforce.com and the close ties and the crossover and the great management salesforce.com could acquire do IN FACT make this an interesting scenario. The fact is that salesforce.com has a very close positioning to HUBS and that matters when telling the HUBS story.What's with the HUBS/salesforce.com relationship? Who knows. But what we do know is interesting.Before moving to my next highlight I would highly recommend readers give this next quote from the conference a peruse, it might make my HUBS/salesforce.com chatter a bit less sensational sounding:One Word: Upmarket?Recently we've seen ZEN become overt in its much speculated upmarket focus from SMB to enterprise. salesforce.com of course already is a dominating force in enterprise and MKTO competes with Eloqua and Adobe and all the other names in this broader solution market. So, the question was asked of HUBS about a move upmarket or at least a more directed focus. HUBS is apparently not interest in moving upmarket and based on everything I've read and seen from HUBS I believe it.I mean this is what makes HUBS brilliant. It's being run by realist, it understands what it is and what it isn't is, and it ""knows the room"" so to speak. HUBS knows that it either isn't ready for an upmarket move or simply isn't as competitive. If you're a world class sprinter why would you even consider running the mile? It just doesn't make sense.Look, based on what Halligan just laid out above - the greenfield opportunity, the competitive environment, the aggregation benefits and defensive characteristics, etc., I don't know that I should waste any of your time reiterating that I'm in complete agreement. Just know that I am.HUBS is still a BUY despite the recent earnings move ... If you've read my articles on SMB/enterprise solutions you know I love to buy these names on maturation cycles, I like to BUY them until they've captured so much market share that the model becomes more about cross selling or deeper penetration that it does landing and new development.HUBS is nowhere close to being done with the former and that's why I consider it still such a solid buy even despite the +50% move since initiation. That's also why I consider it such a strong acquisition story. In a zero GDP market and one where the more mature solution spaces are at least showing to be approaching mid-term maturity I think buying the next big growth space is a no brainer value-add for shareholders (read: the shareholders should hope the buying company does it).Buying one of the best names in the entire space and the hands down best player in its niche is an easy decision if you're asking me. HUBS is both of those.I continue to recommend a long position in HUBS.Good luck everybody."
3188326,48411,2015-05-15T15:39:22-04:00,HUBS just posted a blowout quarter in which it showed its fourth consecutive quarter of accelerating revenue growth.HUBS is just now hitting its stride from a growth standpoint and it's already realizing leverage while growing.I expect HUBS' growth to get even more efficient in time as its sales force matures and as it continues to realize the benefits of shifting market awareness and sentiment.,"HubSpot (NYSE:HUBS) is a company I wish more people knew about and more people spent the time to really understand. HUBS has made me money in more than one way - not only am I long HUBS (I have been since mid-January) but I'm also a HUBS customer. I use HUBS to power my prop research site CapGainr.com and what it has been able to do as a comprehensive product is nothing short of amazing. What's great is that the market is starting to take notice as well.The conversation for HUBS' salesforce has changed the last 12 months from ""what is engagement/inbound marketing"" to ""I need HUBS to help me do (insert specific use case)"". That's a huge difference TTM and it's showing in HUBS' financials. HUBS just posted a 58% Y/Y revenue growth rate which is impressive in itself but especially impressive when you realize that is the fourth consecutive quarter of growth acceleration for the company. That's right, four in a row - 44%, 48%, 51%, 53% and now 58%. That, my friends, is more than just having a great product, expanding your sales team, being effective in the field, and having a sizeable TAM to disrupt. That's called having a rocket powered tailwind helping drive results. And that matters. The tailwind is market acceptance and market sentiment. It's shifted in a big way to favor HUBS.The question that I get asked by asset manager clients who think they're late to the SMB/enterprise solution movement is of course, ""Am I too late?"". I don't think it's too late to hop on the HUBS momentum to higher pricing. Based on my analysis of the recent quarter and surveying the competitive landscape, to which only Marketo (NASDAQ:MKTO) is a real threat for what HUBS is doing (full disclosure: I'm also long MKTO and think it is fantastic as well), I just don't see anything getting in the way of HUBS growth. In fact, I see HUBS growth getting more efficient and healthier on a per dollar basis going forward.So that's the part about that topline percentage growth rate that I think is getting missed by those are following the stock but not long. Yes, that topline is impressive as I've stated. But it also comes with some VERY healthy internals.92% of that topline and the broader base of revenues is subscription based. That's huge in doing this thing called creating recurring revenues and creating this thing called easy modeling. Those are both big positives by the way. HUBS average revenue per customer is also up 15% Y/Y, its lifetime value of its customers is growing (and posted its best print ever during Q1 - via management on the Q1 investor call), while retention rates have grown ~10% from the mid-80% to the mid-90%. 22% of HUBS' total revenues are coming via international revenues which it should be mentioned are growing 70% Y/Y. Oh yeah, HUBS is doing all of this topline and overall revenue base growth while realizing 18 points of leverage on the bottom line Y/Y. That's right, HUBS is realizing leverage while accelerating growth. I've seen this story before and I've seen it recently in the SMB/enterprise solution space and it's so far led me to 200% gains.This isn't the best that HUBS can do either. Not by a long shot. Keep in mind that HUBS still has a very immature sales force in total and is nothing even close to having a saturated national footprint. HUBS has ample whitespace in front of it for both new market expansion as well as in-market and in-book saturation opportunity. As its sales team matures, as it can focus more on selling back into its book, and as it can more deeply saturate current and new entry markets the front end expense dollars will continue to be dwarfed - this creates operating leverage.HUBS also remains loaded from a funding standpoint having finished the quarter with ~$129 million in C&CE and no debt. HUBS has the financial flexibility with its model burning just ~$800,000 cash during Q1 (sequentially an improvement from Q4/14 - HUBS plans to be operating cash flow positive in ""early 2016"") to do whatever it wants to do in regards to driving growth. What it wants to do is brilliant.HUBS plans to invest into being able to deploy its solution in multiple non-English languages and with that, but separately, into international expansion. Currently HUBS is only located in Ireland and Australia, both big bets that have paid off in a big way as evidenced by the continued revenue composition shift to a heavier weighted of international revenues. What's interesting is that both of these initiatives, which are clearly in R&D and early innings (with the multi-language strategy being in R&D), make HUBS two things that are not currently being factored into its valuation: global and potentially enterprise.Now, HUBS has yet to have an enterprise focus (at least that it has expressed) but with the multi-language capability development and the expansion of its global infrastructure HUBS would be in-line to shift into enterprise markets where more and more marketing teams are realizing that engagement and inbound marketing is a much more effective solution (both short and long-term) than traditional avenues. If HUBS can break into the enterprise space, even without a focus and even if just by accident, I could see this stock move much, much higher - to the point that I would sound sensational if I gave a price target. Just know that.So, if you decide that HUBS is a good add to a portfolio just know that HUBS has several tailwind catalysts that won't show up in the key metrics and that won't be apparent until they are. If you take a second look at the chart at the top of this article you'll see that I looked pretty foolish for holding this name from about mid-February until the day after Q1 earnings. HUBS traded poorly, creating zero alpha and failing to capture SMB/enterprise solution beta, for a long, long time. I held and plan to hold through all the ups and downs to come because I really believe HUBS has a chance to be the next massive (eventually) enterprise solution. I really do.Consider some HUBS shares and if you decide to pick some up hang on for a fun ride.Good luck everybody."

All of these shares were sold by the company with no shares being offered by selling shareholders.Shares were offered above the midpoint of the preliminary offering range of $22-$24 per share. At the public offering price of $25, with some 30.4 million shares outstanding, equity is valued at $760 million.Banks which aided the company in its process to become a public firm were Morgan Stanley, J.P. Morgan, UBS, Pacific Crest, Canaccord Genuity and Raymond James.ValuationHubSpot offers its services as a subscription based offering, focusing on mid-market companies. From the more than 11,600 customers which the company had at the end of the second quarter of this year, the company generates average annual revenue per customer of little more than $8,800. The company cites the large opportunity with just a very low percentage of European and US mid-market companies having implemented any kind of automated marketing.For the year of 2013, HubSpot posted sales of $77.6 million which marked a 50.4% increase compared to the year before. Net losses nearly doubled to $34.2 million in the meantime.Growth continued in the first six months of this year, as sales were up by 46.2% to $51.3 million. Despite the growing sales, losses kept increasing as well although the increase was rather modest. HubSpot posted a loss of $17.8 million versus the $16.4 million reported in the year before.Ahead of the offering the company held some $7 million in cash and some preferred convertible stock which will be converted into common shares at the offering. Including the $125 million in gross proceeds, the company will operate with a net cash position of some $120 million in all likelihood.At $29 per share, the market values the company at around $880 million, or operating assets around $760 million after subtracting the net cash holdings. Assuming a current run rate of revenues of little above $110 million, shares trade around 7 times revenues as losses remain substantial.Investment ThesisAs noted above, the public offering of HubSpot has been a great success. For starters, the shares were offered nearly 10% above the midpoint of the latest preliminary offering range after which shares rose all the way towards $33 on their opening day. Ever since, share have fallen towards the $30 mark, still valuing shares some 20% over the final offering price of $25.Investors are attracted to the rapid growth, being forgiving about the losses which are reported at the moment. Second-quarter sales rose 47.8% on an annual basis to $27.1 million. It is also encouraging that losses of $8.3 million were slightly narrower compared to the first quarter and the second quarter of last year. So far the positive news, as other risks are still very much apparent including the still high pace of losses, intense competition, reliance on key staff and the fact that the effectiveness of its solutions may change depending on third parties.As such I am quite hesitant to justify the steep current valuation based on the current performance, although growth rates of close to 50% remain attractive. Given the lack of a structural competitive advantage, the declining growth, and the still sizable losses, I am not willing to pay these kind of revenue multiples at this point in time. Consequently, I will be watching the action from the sidelines for now."
2623215,40031,2014-11-01T09:04:23-04:00,HubSpot offers an opportunity to participate in the growth of inbound marketing.HubSpot has a large addressable market and the company is growing revenues at a rapid pace while incurring losses.IPO proceeds should help accelerate the top line growth in the next couple of quarters.Initiating HubSpot with a buy rating with at least 25% potential upside.,"HubSpot (NYSE:HUBS) had a successful IPO in early October and the stock is up more than 30% from its offering price. The company is delivering robust revenue growth while incurring losses, a practice that is expected to be continued in the following years. Given the prior success of SaaS companies in the stock market and their respective valuations, I believe that HubSpot is going to reward its long-term shareholders. I am starting HubSpot with a buy rating and a $42 price target.Company and industry overviewHubSpot provides a cloud-based marketing and sales software platform that enables businesses to deliver an inbound experience. ""An inbound marketing and sales experience attracts, engages and delights customers by being more relevant, more helpful, more personalized and less interruptive than traditional marketing and sales tactics"" - according to HubSpot's SEC filings. The company's integrated applications include social media, search engine optimization, blogging, website content management, marketing automation, email, CRM, analytics and reporting.HubSpot is the leading brand in the cloud-based inbound marketing and sales software industry and has the largest social media following in the industry. As of June, 2014, the company had 11,624 customers in more than 70 countries. The platform is sold on a subscription basis and revenues have grown rapidly from $6.6 million in 2009 to $77 million in 2013. However, the company had net losses of $18.8 million in 2012 and $34.3 million in 2013, and management expects to continue to incur losses in the future in order to grow the business.The transformation in marketing and sales has created a large market opportunity for HubSpot. The company focuses on selling its platform to mid-market businesses. According to AMI Partners, in 2013, there were 1.6 million of these mid-market businesses with a website presence in the United States and Canada and 1.3 million in Europe. HubSpot obviously has a large market to penetrate into, since it had just over 11,000 customers at the end of Q2 2014. The use of inbound marketing is intended to be more helpful, more relevant and less interruptive to customers, and we should see an increased use of these methods in the future, especially considering the rise of social media and the importance of brand building on the web. In addition to having the largest social media following in the industry and a strong brand, HubSpot also has a large and growing agency partner program with more than 2,000 marketing agency partners worldwide which help with promotion and enhance the company's reach to new mid-market businesses at scale.Higher retention rates and rising revenue per userHubSpot's number of customers has doubled from the end of 2011 to 11,624 at the end of Q2 2014. Revenue per user has also grown considerably in the meantime and continues to trend higher, but the customer acquisition costs have grown as well and stand above the average revenue per user. However, those customer acquisition dollars were spent wisely as the retention rates have improved significantly in the last three years (see table below). It is also evident that the customer acquisition costs have slowed down in the first six months of 2014 while the average revenue per user growth rate has exceeded the customer acquisition costs.Source: HubSpot S1 filingGross margin improvements have also been notable in the last two quarters. After contracting in 2013, gross margin has expanded 490 and 780 basis points in the first two quarters of 2014. Gross margin decreased in 2013 due to increased investments in subscription and hosting services and was the only year that the gross margin was down over the previous year. We should see further margin improvements as the company's revenue base expands.Growth strategyThere are several elements in HubSpot's growth strategy:- Grow the U.S. customer base. The company believes that the market for its platform is large and underserved and intends to leverage its inbound go-to-market approach to keep growing the domestic business.- Increase revenue from existing customers. The trend of increased ARPUs is evident and shown in the table above and the company intends to further increase revenue from existing customers through selling to other parts of customers' organizations and upselling additional offerings and features. HubSpot's scalable pricing model also allows the company to grow its revenue per user as the customer's business grows.- International expansion. The company generated 21% of its total revenue in 1H 2014 outside of the United States and there are significant growth opportunities in international markets. HubSpot opened its first international office in Europe in January 2013 and the company already has significant website traffic from regions outside of the U.S. We should see more international expansion in the following years and I expect higher contribution from international markets in the future.- Innovation and expansion of the platform. The company intends to introduce new products and applications to extend the functionality of its platform.- Acquisitions of complementary businesses.IPO proceeds to accelerate investments and growthBy looking at HubSpot's balance sheet, it is evident that the growth was constrained by low cash levels. At the end of Q2 2014, the company had just $7.3 million in cash and equivalents. I believe that the proceeds from the IPO should serve as a catalyst for higher growth in the following quarters as the company now has over $100 million in cash to invest in the growth of the business. The company intends to use the proceeds for general corporate purposes, including investing further in sales and marketing and R&D and to fund the growth strategy. The company also stated that it may use a portion of the proceeds for acquisitions and it will use $18 million to repay debt.Revenue growth has picked up in Q2 2014 and has ranged between 44% and 48% in the last four quarters. I believe that the increased cash levels should accelerate the growth going forward, and I expect revenue growth to pick up to 50% to 55% in the next couple of quarters and to be between 40% and 50% in 2015. Given the recent customer acquisition cost metrics, it would be conservative to assume that HubSpot could acquire around 70 to 80 customers for $1 million, and depending on the amount spent, the company could attract at least 3,000 to 4,000 new customers if it accelerates the sales and marketing spending in the next couple of quarters in addition to current growth rates, which would bring the company's top line growth to the before mentioned higher levels. I believe that these assumptions are conservative and that the actual numbers might be higher, since my anticipated customer acquisition costs are between $12,500 and $14,200 (if we divide the $1 million with 80 and 70 new customers respectively). We still do not have analyst estimates, and I will rely on these assumptions to assess the potential valuation and upside potential.Valuation and price targetSince HubSpot is expected to continue to incur losses in the next couple of years, I will use the P/S ratio to gauge the potential upside and downside in the next 12 to 24 months. Given the comparable gross margins and growth rates, I believe that there are two companies in the SaaS space that we can compare HubSpot to - ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) and Marketo (NASDAQ:MKTO). In the table and charts below, you can see the past and expected growth levels for the three companies as well as their TTM and forward P/S ratios (HubSpot's forward P/S ratio is based on my growth estimates).Source: Yahoo! Finance, HubSpot SEC filings, Author's estimatesIt is evident that ServiceNow's superior revenue growth has caused a premium valuation over Marketo and HubSpot. I expect that ServiceNow should continue to trade at a premium over its peers as long as its growth levels are higher. Given HubSpot's revenue growth rates, it's valuation should be close to Marketo's. If we look at Marketo's P/S ratio chart, we can see that it has traded in a P/S ratio range between 8 and 12 since early April 2014. My base case price target for HubSpot is $42 and is based on a 2015 P/S ratio of 8. I believe that this is a conservative target given the expected growth and represents a 25% discount from the current valuation. Sustained revenue growth should be enough to justify the targeted valuation for 2015.The bullish scenario assumes higher revenue growth rates, as the company spends the IPO proceeds to fund its growth strategy and it should lead to accelerating revenue growth in the following quarters. If the growth accelerates going forward, I expect HubSpot's P/S ratio to expand to ServiceNow's current levels, which translates into 45% short-term upside potential and triple digit upside potential in the next two to three years. This implies HubSpot trading in a TTM P/S ratio range of 14 to 16 as opposed to a more conservative range of 8 to 12.Risks and challengesThe main risk for HubSpot investors is its current valuation. If the company fails to grow its top line substantially going forward, it would leave investors holding a very expensive stock. The other issue is the absence of profitability and uncertainty over the company's future margin profile. If HubSpot is unable to attain high net margins down the road, it would be difficult to justify the current valuation. Apart from these issues, the competitive landscape is another risk that might dampen HubSpot's growth prospects.If we take the above assumed growth scenario, I believe that the maximum downside should be limited to 30% to 35%. This would bring HubSpot back to its IPO price, which I believe to be a very attractive entry point for long-term oriented investors, as the company would be worth around 6x its expected 2015 sales. Of course, if the growth expectations deteriorate significantly in the future, the potential downside would be significantly higher. However, we should not see a significant deterioration in growth expectations anytime soon.CatalystsThere are two short-term catalysts that might drive HubSpot's share price higher (or lower):- Q3 earnings report. HubSpot is slated to report its third quarter financial report on November 12 and the event might drive the share price higher. It will be interesting to listen to the first conference call to get more insight about the company's growth prospects.- Quiet period expiration on November 18. If analyst coverage and price targets are positive, they could drive the share price higher in the following months.ConclusionI believe HubSpot is poised to bring long-term gains to its shareholders. The base case scenario implies 25% upside from the current price, while the bullish scenario might bring triple digit gains to HubSpot's shareholders. The company's disruptive business model should attract new users, while the growing ARPUs and retention rates should lead to higher operating leverage. The proceeds from the offering should serve as a catalyst for accelerating revenue growth rates in the following quarters and might lead to a higher valuation."
2915966,48411,2015-02-13T12:05:21-05:00,HUBS just reported a blowout full year and guided above expectations.HUBS has plenty of momentum and a model that is doing some special things.Buy HUBS as I think it has a very long bull-run ahead of it in 2015.,"HubSpot, Inc. (NYSE:HUBS), the inbound marketing software platform company, just reported an absolute blowout quarter and full year. HUBS was already one of my favorite names in the SMB/enterprise solution space but this solidified its ranking at the top. I really think HUBS could go on the type of run that Paycom Software (NYSE:PAYC) has been on since its inception - the type of run that sees its market cap go up 10% with every earnings report and slowly move higher and higher perpetually. I really, really like this name and think that if you have some funds that need allocated to a tech name or a ""solution"" space within your technology allocation this has to be a name near the top of the list.The following are some highlights taken from the HUBS Q4 PR:Revenue:Revenue was incredible especially when thinking about the fact that the growth continued to gain momentum as the year went on. I think this happened for a few reasons:Revenue was huge in driving the income statement in the face of the year-long and what has been perpetual, scale-up. More on this next.Non-GAAP Operating Margin/Non-GAAP Operating Loss:Operating margin is largely a byproduct of revenue and we just detailed what revenue did during the quarter. But it should also be pointed out that HUBS was scaling up during the full year in a big way and increased OPEX 54%. So, when considering that non-GAAP (backing out non-cash charges and D&A) operating loss actually remained flat that's a big deal and really impressive. This means that even though non-GAAP operating loss in actual dollars remained flat it shrank as a percentage of revenue which is where we saw the non-GAAP operating margin improvement. See how that works? All told it just means that as HUBS is growing it's also growing more profitable. That is a really, really rare thing to be able to do and it should be bought before everybody else figures it out. This is one efficient company.Cash Flow/Balance Sheet:Speaking of efficiency, HUBS was able to actually decrease its cash burn operationally while growing. That too is extremely rare and this is actually the most important development reported. HUBS, knowing that its model is cash burn light and can still grow at absurd rates, now can act opportunistically when it comes to acquisitions or just flat out get uber-aggressive with growth initiatives like making massive spend increases to R&D and/or S&M. HUBS has a first mover advantage in this space as its only pure play competitor is Marketo (NASDAQ:MKTO) and even then MKTO is targeting the enterprise space and not SMB. That said, I would really like to see HUBS make an effort to go out and acquire its next solution add-on to its platform via a tuck-in or if it can try to find a completely bolt-on acquisition. Obviously the latter would be more expensive but heck the company has the cash and a super cash light model. Why not? I know that HUBS is really trying to improve its CRM integration ability and the CRM capability of its lower-end product and I think an acquisition could be the path of least resistance for making this happen. In any case, the cash flow/balance sheet section of this article is the most bullish. What a great showing.Key Metric:Finally, we have the excellent key metric growth shown by the company. I think these really speak for themselves but I would like to reiterate a few points:So, in summary, HUBS had an amazing full year that set the table for it to have in incredible amount of momentum in 2015. I continue to recommend a long position in the name and continue to believe that all dips should be bought."
2912446,72665,2015-02-13T14:56:37-05:00,Accelerated and consistent growth in subscribers and revenue.Bottom-up analysis points to fertile opportunity.DCF fair value is about 11% above the current price.,"HubSpot (NYSE:HUBS) is an innovative horizontal on-demand Leader in a greenfield SMB Marketing Automation software market with best-in-class inbound ""Conversational Marketing"" marketing automation solutions.I like the HubSpot story and I believe that the company's digital marketing suite is differentiated by its ""Conversational Marketing"" solution approach and its ability to address the marketing automation needs of significantly under underserved (<2.1% market penetration) mid-market B2B customers. I expect HubSpot to continue posting 28%-plus organic revenue growth in the near term, and to sustain a 25% compounded annual growth rate through 2030, while improving operating margin to ~30%. While I expect HubSpot to sustain its organic-revenue growth in the near term, I believe current valuation fairly reflects the growth and profit outlooks of the business.DCF fair value is about 11% above the current price My DCF model suggests an intrinsic value per share of $38. This assumes a weighted-average cost of capital [WACC] of 10.9% and a perpetuity growth rate of 5%. The DCF exercise helps quantify the potential benefits of assumed long-term margin expansion and top-line growth. The intrinsic $38 per share value or 7.6x EV/CY15 revenue and 4.8x EV/CY16 revenue is in-line with average revenue multiple for HubSpot B2B SaaS peer group (i.e. peer group filtered by % public float). However, I would like to emphasize that the DCF model is highly sensitive to inputs including the WACC; therefore, as investors adjust expected rates of return, intrinsic implied share prices can vary widely.Investment SummaryAccelerated and consistent growth in subscribers and revenue Subscription revenue has significantly grown over the last two years, growing from $13.8M million in Q4-2012 to $31.2M million in Q4-2014, a CAGR of 50.7%. During the same period, subscriber annualized growth reached 29.1%, growing from 8,159 in Q4-2012 to 13,607 in Q4-2014. Subscriber growth has been accelerating, with average quarterly net new addition of 874 in 2014 vs 594 in 2012. I believe that an early-stage market leader such as HubSpot, capable of 'planting more trees' (i.e. acquiring net new customers) early-on sets the company up well for long-term success, so long as the customer value proposition continues to be strong enough to support future upsells and cross-sells into the installed base. In addition, the pricing model transition in 2012 has proven to be fruitful, evidenced by the Dec-12 to December-2014 20.4% annualized growth in average monthly revenue per customer, growing from $584/month in Dec-2012 to $794/month in December-2014. Currently, HubSpot offers its marketing automation solutions in three editions, namely BASIC ($200/month), PRO ($800/month) and ENTERPRISE ($2,400/month);the tiered model evolved from a flat price of $250/month.Improvement in retention rates While the allure of the SMB segment is high due to the sheer size of the market, an SMB focused model may result in unit renewal rates below 80%, forcing the vendor into higher ongoing relative spend on Sales & Marketing. However, HubSpot focus on retention early-on, led to a consistent improvement in dollar retention rates (includes upsell), which reached the high 90s in Q4-2014. I believe that HubSpot new tiered pricing model may have attributed to the improvement as it gives the company the flexibility to accommodate customers, appealing to those who are looking to start with the basic edition and scale up over time and/or purchase incremental solutions.Bottom-up analysis points to fertile opportunity HubSpot is the leading vendor in a $27B+ on-demand B2B Marketing Automation solutions market. I forecast HubSpot should have 24,882 paying subscribers by the end of FY16, implying ~ 39% share of <2.2% penetrated mid-market Marketing Automation market for ""conversational marketing"" solutions. I assume a $796 per month average subscription fee, yielding an annual market opportunity of ~$27.7B (Exhibit 1).RisksCompetition from larger vendors The acquisitions of Eloqua, ExactTarget, Responsys and Neolane, to name a few, bridged across B2B and B2C, suggesting the continuous convergence of the Marketing Automation space. Going forward I believe that standalone B2C or B2B could be challenged to compete against the platform vendors with significant advantages of scale, product breadth, and integration.Initial Public Offering lock-up expiration The lock-up period, whereby pre-IPO stockholders agreed not to sell shares, expires on April 7th 2015. The lock-up period gives IPO investors some confidence that supply will be limited for a period of time. I expect the stock to be traded down ahead of and through its IPO lock-up expiration date as investors re-price their expectations for increase in share supply.Market OverviewBy leveraging the new IT ecosystem, marketers are getting an explosion of real-time feedback data from their customers and deeper insights into the individual customer behavior. The combination of Big Data (to pull together disparate data), in-memory analytics, smartphones (which can now real-time location and other data feeds) are all being utilized to help marketers be more effective. I believe that marketing automation technologies will become increasingly crucial to businesses in general and SMBs in particular, as marketers focus on stretching marketing dollars and customers demand personalized communication and service.""Conversational Marketing"" Marketing Automation Value PropositionIdentification of leads is one of the most crucial steps in driving incremental sales; however, traditional marketing analytics capabilities don't capture data at the individual level, but rather captures cookie-based demographic behavioral data. This type of data is suitable for executing advertising strategies, but is being rendered less effective as customers' demands for personalized experiences emerge and inbound marketing strategies take center stage. HubSpot inbound marketing or ""Conversational Marketing"" technology fills this gap. Through an uplift model, HubSpot allows marketers to focus their messages on prospects that would react positively to a marketing message, while weeding out those that will churn away, will never churn or could churn as a result of a marketing message.HubSpot inbound marketing solutions eliminate the need to push interrupting marketing messages out to unsuspecting audience; it focuses on attracting the right prospects by: 1) Providing social media engagement and blogging tools that enable a marketer to create educational content that engages prospects in collaborative conversations in order to drive leads, 2) Utilizing business logic decision rules to optimize decisions based on real-time customer data analysis to more effectively profile prospects and to interactively create models and explore in real-time the key drivers of marketing impact, 3) Automating marketing outflows by customizing timing for campaigns and email triggering based on the prospect real-time behavior (Sidekick), and 4) Routing qualified leads to specific sales reps and monitoring their progress to provide real-time feedback and report conversion rates (HubSpot CRM). The targeted and customized marketing approach enables marketers to significantly increase marketing ROI.Revenue Model OverviewNet new subscriber addition is the vital metric for growth and valuationHubSpot generates revenues in two ways - First and foremost, subscription revenue (92% of total TTM revenue) and second, professional services revenue, generated from training and implementing the HubSpot solution within the customers' business processes.Subscription revenue tends to be fairly predictable from quarter to quarter given the annuity-like streams monthly subscriber revenue and the less reliance on on-premise type quarter-end deals to make revenue projections. In this recurring model, I believe that the leading indicator of future revenue stream is the net new subscriber addition metric, which typically dictates short-term share performance. Unfortunately, the metric tends to be volatile; the volatility largely depends on the timing and size of deals. As a result, the predictable top-line may not always translate into lower share price volatility.Earnings AnalysisCosts and marginsI believe it is important to look at subscription gross margin in order to properly gauge the long-term operational leverage in the business model. HubSpot subscriptions gross margin is trending upward, growing from an annual average of 71.2% in 2013 to an annual average of 75.8% in 2014. As the company gains scale, I expect that gross margin to stabilize at the 77% to 79% range.Using gross margin as an indicator for value creation, I estimated the company's payback on sales and marketing by dividing the annualized net gross profit added during a given quarter by the sales and marketing costs of the prior quarter. The payback time on sales and marketing peaked in Q2-2012 at 0.68x after heavy upfront investments to 0.55x in Q4-2014; in other words, for each incremental sales and marketing $1 spent, $0.55 is paid back within a year.However, in the near term, earnings should not be the primary concern for investors as the company continues to invest in product development and in customer acquisition to support rapid revenue and subscriber growth, limiting the potential pace of near-term margin improvement.I believe that that the long-term margin structure will largely depend on the level of overhead needed to sustain the subscriber base as the company matures and the mix of new versus existing subscribers.The professional services business is currently a loss leader, with an average gross margin of -26.5% in FY 2013 and an annual average of -16.3% in FY 2014. Nonetheless, the business could provide HubSpot with some additional operating leverage as utilization improves following the recent steep ramp in headcount additions.Balance Sheet Analysis HubSpot bills 1/3 of its customers on an annual basis, 1/3 on a quarterly basis and the remaining 1/3 on a monthly basis. For annual contracts, revenues are recognized monthly as service is provided, generating deferred revenue for the amount billed but not yet recognized. As such, only the billed portion (i.e. billings to 1/3 of customers) shows up on the balance sheet in the form of deferred revenue, making the deferred revenue figure a 'less than ideal' leading indicator of future subscription revenues.Nonetheless, I continue to see a healthy build-up in deferred revenue. As of the end of Q4 -2014, HubSpot had $40.8M in deferred revenue on its balance sheet, up 65.5% year over year, and 19.5% sequentially.ValuationDCF model suggests a share price for HubSpot of ~$38 My primary assumptions include an estimated (Beta) of 1.28, a weighted average cost of capital [WACC] of 10.9%, and long-term growth rate g of 5.0%. I arrive at an intrinsic value per share of $38 by growing my estimate of FY-2015 revenue by a CAGR of 24% for 15 years and applying a steady-state operating margin of 30.4% to my 2030 revenue estimate. After adjusting for a post-IPO substantial cash of $123.7M, outstanding stock options fair value of $94.4M and debt, I estimate an intrinsic value of ~$38. The DCF exercise helps enumerate the potential benefits of implicit longer-term margin expansion and top-line growth. The model provides an estimate of fair value (which is only as good as the input assumptions) in contrast to a market multiple, which measures relative value across companies. However, the DCF model is highly sensitive to inputs; therefore, as investors continue to adjust expected return, intrinsic implied share prices can vary widely.Option grants reduce DCF value by about $2.97 per share I estimated the fair value of past grants to better capture the valuation implications of shareholder dilution from the company's stock option prior grants; for HubSpot, the impact of past share grants reduces the implied share price in the DCF model by about $2.97 per share. To value past option grants, I have calculated the Black-Scholes value for options outstanding as of June-2014, and netted this value less taxes to determine equity value. I estimate the total fair value for HubSpot's outstanding options is about $135 million ($95 million net of taxes), using the closing price of February, 11th 2015 of $39.9, the most recent assumptions for volatility and expected life from HubSpot S-1, and the 10 years historical risk-free rate of 3.25%.Net Operating Losses (NOLs) could also add incremental $3.44 to fair value per share As part of the DCF analysis, I also separately calculated the value of net operating losses, which theoretically can be used to reduce future taxes paid. The value of the NOLs is based on the projected usage benefit in the projection period and is discounted at the cost of equity of 10.9%. In my base operating scenario, I estimate that the fair value of the NOLs is $3.44. Adding back the estimated value of the NOL yields an intrinsic price per share value of $41.7Exhibit (1)Exhibit (2)Trading Comps (Market Valuation)* share performance as of January, 31, 2015Peers (NASDAQ:MKTO), (NASDAQ:CALD), (NYSE:CRM), (NASDAQ:CTCT), (NASDAQ:CSOD), (NYSE:ORCL), (NYSE:IBM), (NYSE:NOW), (NASDAQ:WDAY),(NYSE:CVT), (NASDAQ:FIVN)PAGE \* MERGEFORMAT 16 | Page"
2687745,40031,2014-11-18T08:55:29-05:00,HubSpot reported Q3 earnings and revenue ahead of analyst estimates.The number of customers and ARPU continue to trend higher.Management’s Q4 revenue guidance is likely conservative.Raising my price target on higher than expected execution in Q3.,"HubSpot (NYSE:HUBS) reported Q3 revenue and earnings ahead of views. Revenue increased 50.9% to $30.4 million, which was $2.7 million higher than the analyst consensus. Q3 loss per share was $1.62, compared to analyst estimates for a $1.96 loss. Revenue growth accelerated from 44.4% in Q1 to 47.8% in Q2 and 50.9% in Q3, and although I was optimistic about HubSpot's revenue growth going forward, I did not expect such a strong showing in Q3, since the company just went public, and did not have the chance to use the proceeds to accelerate investments. The company guided Q4 revenue between $31 million and $32 million, representing year-over-year growth between 38.5% and 43%.The total number of customers increased 31% Y/Y to 12,478 at the end of Q3 and the average subscription revenue per customer increased 15.5% Y/Y to $9,183. HubSpot has successfully completed its annual INBOUND conference, with more than 10,000 registered attendees, which was 80% higher compared to last year's conference. The company has also announced the launch of HubSpot's sales platform, which includes a free CRM offering and a sales acceleration product for sales reps called Sidekick. The HubSpot CRM is in use by select customers and will launch publicly in early 2015, and should serve as a catalyst for higher revenue growth in 2015.HubSpot's Q3 report strengthens my bullish thesis, and I am raising my price target from $42 to $47 on higher than expected revenue growth, which should lead to a higher than expected P/S multiple in the following months. I believe that the Q4 revenue guidance is conservative and that the strong business momentum should result in revenue growth of at least 45% to 50% in the fourth quarter, driven by higher investments, international expansion and higher revenues from existing customers. My previous price target was based on a forward 2015 P/S ratio of 8, and given the higher revenue growth, I am raising my P/S ratio target for 2015 to 9, which translates into the previously mentioned $47 price target. The price target is based on my own revenue estimates which remain unchanged and which are higher than the current analyst consensus. If we take the analyst consensus for 2015 revenue, the price target would be $43. I doubt that the HubSpot's revenue growth will be almost cut in half in 2015, and there should be significant upside to forward revenue estimates in the following months, which should drive HubSpot's share price higher."

Despite this transformation, most businesses are using an outdated marketing and sales playbook that is essentially the same today as it was 10 years ago.To compete effectively, HUBS believes businesses need to deliver an inbound experience by adopting new strategies and technologies to attract, engage and delight customers.HUBS designed its all-in-one platform from the ground up to enable businesses to provide an inbound experience to their prospects and customers.At the core of HUBS's platform is a single inbound database for each business that captures its customer activity throughout the customer lifecycle.HUBS's platform uses its centralized inbound database to empower businesses to create more personalized interactions with customers, such as personalized emails, personalized social media alerts, personalized websites and targeted alerts for sales people.HUBS provides a comprehensive set of integrated applications on its platform, which offers businesses ease of use, power and simplicity. HUBS designed and built its platform to serve a large numbers of customers of any size with demanding use cases.While its platform can scale to the enterprise, HUBS focuses on selling to mid-market businesses, which HUBS defines as businesses that have between 10 and 2,000 employees, because HUBS believes it has significant competitive advantages attracting and serving them. HUBS efficiently reaches these businesses at scale through its proven inbound go-to-market approach and more than 2,000 marketing agency partners worldwide.Mid-market B2B companiesHUBS's platform is particularly suited to serving the needs of mid-market B2B companies. These mid-market businesses seek an integrated, easy to implement and easy to use solution to reach customers and compete with organizations that have larger marketing and sales budgets.As of June 30, 2014, HUBS had 11,624 customers of varying sizes in more than 70 countries, representing almost every industry.Intellectual propertyHUBS protects its intellectual property through trade secrets law, copyrights, trademarks and contracts.Some of HUBS's technology relies upon third-party licensed intellectual property.In addition to the foregoing, HUBS has established business procedures designed to maintain the confidentiality of its proprietary information, including the use of confidentiality agreements and assignment of inventions agreements with employees, independent contractors, consultants and companies with which HUBS conducts business.CompetitionHUBS faces intense competition from other software companies that develop marketing software and from marketing services companies that provide interactive marketing services.HUBS's competitors offer various point applications that provide certain functions and features that HUBS provides, including:cloud-based marketing automation providers;email marketing software vendors; andlarge-scale enterprise suites.5% shareholders pre-IPOEntities affiliated with General Catalyst Partners 27.1%Entities affiliated with Matrix Partners 17.1%Scale Venture Partners III, LP 6.8%Entities affiliated with Sequoia Capital 10.3%Entities affiliated with Charles River Ventures 5%Larry Bohn 27.1%Dharmesh Shah 8.8%David Skok 17.1%Dividend PolicyNo dividends are planned.Use of proceedsHUBS intends to use the $90 million in proceeds from its IPO as follows:for general corporate purposes, including investing further in its sales and marketing and research and development efforts and payment of anticipated general and administrative expenses.HUBS also intends to use proceeds from this offering to fund its growth strategies described elsewhere in this prospectus.HUBS may use a portion of the net proceeds for the acquisition of businesses, technologies or other assets that HUBS believes are complementary to its own, although HUBS has no agreements, commitments or understandings with respect to any such transaction.HUBS also expects to use $18.0 million of the net proceeds to repay all of the outstanding principal and accrued interest on its revolving line of credit.

3029726,48411,2015-03-26T05:28:52-04:00,"HUBS acquisition of Rekindle bigger than most will assume.
        I believe HUBS bought Rekindle, which is hugely valuable to its platform as-is, to alter the technology to be able to make further smart suggestions within the HUBS platform.
        HUBS shares have stalled out recently and have traded range bound but this should get growth going again.
        I remain long HUBS and recommend a long position on all durations.","HubSpot, Inc.'s (NYSE:HUBS) announcement of its acquisition of Rekindle is another example of what a great eye management at HUBS has for furthering the platform and how to do that by way of unconventional methods. I view this announcement as a further confirmation of my bull thesis and I continue to recommend a long position of HUBS on all durations.So, what exactly is Rekindle? Rekindle is a company that ran a really successful networking platform, but not specifically a social network, that was powered by its Contact Graph technology. It was really a hybrid-social network/ ""life yearbook"" that brought a different value-prop to the human interaction chain. It will be a shame to see Rekindle be retired but what a technology addition HUBS is getting:By allowing users to plug in social network feeds and allowing the app to access the phone or device contact database Rekindle was able to generate helpful suggestions, not just create visual analytics or any other baseline function like that of say Facebook's friend finder or LinkedIn's platform which is limited to just professional connections. The actual ability to make the suggestions is what I find interesting and valuable about Rekindles contact graph technology. I've asked several friends who run technology companies and have heavy coding backgrounds, one who is developing a Thomson competitor and one who coincidentally is developing a HUBS competitor, and both agreed that with coding time and money to burn (HUBS has both) that this technology could realistically be altered to do plenty of things that would have huge benefits to HUBS.The applications of this technology ""as-is"" when dropped into HUBS platform are endless. If HUBS can take this in the direction that I think motivated the buy the applications could be game changing. The most obvious uses and monetizable end points for it will be in the blogging, social, email, and of course analytics verticals of the HUBS platform:Think about this scenario:Let's say HUBS is able to convince blog readers (the blog being created by its marketing customers of course) to allow the blog page (ran by HUBS platform technology of course) to make smart suggestions as to friends who might also really like the blog page being viewed. If you're reading a blog on filing taxes and you have several friends who have recently used social feeds to complain or express concern about tax filing I think it's realistic to think that the user would consider sending the page (link or in an email) to smartly suggested friends. Especially if the technology could provide a snippet in-blog showing the direct reasoning behind the suggestion. Here Mr. or Mrs. User, here's the post from your friend complaining about tax filing. Help them out. Go ahead, email this article to them.You see how that works?The bottom line is that even without altering the graphing technology and the ability to suggest is going to be hugely valuable to further dialing in an already dialed in HUBS platform. If HUBS can evolve the technology, and my two techie sources tell me that has to be the real reason HUBS went Rekindle hunting, I think HUBS might be deserving of some multiple appreciation.I continue to recommend a long position in HUBS. Hold this name for the long term folks, it has plenty left in the tank.Good luck."
2831826,48411,2015-01-21T07:30:00-05:00,BUY the HUBS excitement. At just 13X price/sales the company trades middle range to other potentially disruptive SMB/enterprise solution peers. BUY before Q4 EPS.HUBS platform is a CRM/Analytics/Content Management hybrid that is all-inclusive and for its SMB target clients that's going to make all the difference.With excellent cash visibility and the cash flexibility to get aggressive with acquisitions I'm looking for HUBS to buy to expand its platform capabilities and value-prop in the near term.,"Everyday people search online for answers, products, and services they need. They often don't read ads, they often don't open direct emails, but statistics do show they consistently and in huge volume search. The question is when they search are they finding you or are they finding your competitor?One company believes the best way to create leads is to create relevant, search worthy content that will attract click traffic and meet potential leads at the actual touch point rather than trying to create leads from the creation of a touch point - such as using direct mailers, email campaigns, using click through ads, etc. HubSpot (NYSE:HUBS) believes this overall strategy, Inbound-marketing, can best be accomplished by using its platform:HUBS believes its platform helps optimize the four steps of inbound-marketing that it feels turn a prospect into a sales:So, the HUBS platform in my opinion is a rounder wheel in a space with already fairly round wheels. It's a more all-inclusive platform than single point solutions like CRM's and is more workflow process friendly than simply hiring or outsourcing content creation alone. What good is content without analytics? What good is analytics on bad content? HUBS marries the two brilliantly and I think that affords it the potential to be one of the most disruptive names in SMB, potentially enterprise, solutions. I'm not sure how to classify HUBS just yet (is it a CRM? Should it be valued as a CRM? Should it be valued as an alternative to advertising content?) but I do know that I think it has an incredible value-prop to prospects and that I'm really excited to see its story play out in the public markets.Different banks value disruptive technology at different Price/Sales ratios with some in my experience valuing the classification as high as 60X - typically institutions are willing to pay up for early ownership in a name that has the chance to reach huge longer term valuations. Think about how expensive Google looked in the early days or how expensive Amazon looks currently, can we add Facebook to this list? The point is that industry shaping or industry shaping innovation commands strong multiples in the early days as usually the early days aren't completely reflective of longer term CAGR or valuation.With that being said, and before we get into the financials, HUBS currently has a PSR and an EV/Sales of 13X and a valuation of ~$1.05 billion. Shares are up 33% since its IPO and currently trade at $33.30:In comparison to some other recent and successful SMB/enterprise solution and/or CRM names, HUBS looks to be about in the middle of the range:Still, I think these comparison are mid-level in correlation at best as I don't think there exists a truly comparable company to value HUBS against. Even so, I wanted to illustrate that strictly from a PSR basis that HUBS is definitely not expensive when compared to other names in the space that are expected to disrupt.Finally, in regards to traditional valuation metrics, I don't know that the market is yet to fully understand the hole in the space that HUBS is addressing or how lucrative filling that hole will be. I just don't think the HUBS story has been well told at this point or is being fully understood. In that misunderstanding/lack of awareness lies the alpha in the trade. I would be comfortable initiating a position in HUBS up to a PSR of 20 as I think eventually its gets a PSR north of that. How far north and how soon? Well that's for the market to decide but I think that buying HUBS at a PSR of 13X is good risk adjusted move knowing the dynamics of the space itself and how HUBS' platform addresses concerns of the space. I think readers should seriously consider buying HUBS on any dips or if they have capital to deploy right now. I think we'll look back at a 13X PSR as a gift and we could start to look back as soon as a few weeks from now when HUBS reports Q4 earnings.Now, the financials at HUBS are impressive but very reflective of a company in the land and expand, high growth stage of maturation. For starters, the key metric growth has been encouraging and growing more encouraging:HUBS has consistently grown its total customer count and increased its average subscription revenue per customer. This is going to be huge in that down the line when HUBS reaches the peak of the current level of scale-up, where that initial point lies is going to be a moving target in the early innings of the current version of the company but likely it will run parallel to the company's what I think will be eventual jump from SMB to enterprise focus, this ability to aggregate business and grow that business more profitable organically will determine back-end margin expansion and true model profitability. With that point being years down the road I'm not sure it's worth spending much more time on but it is worth mentioning that in the near term both of those developments should help drive the bull case.Now, also importantly is the fact that as the platform has aged so too has increased the retention rate. I think this is happening for two reasons. The first is that HUBS has worked on its platform and made it more user friendly over time. With so many moving pieces and capabilities I can imagine earlier iterations were harder to learn. Second, I think that as time has progressed so too has 1) the value-prop of the platform and 2) so has the customer's perception of the value-prop. Just five years ago the idea of business analytics and refining the customer acquisition funnel was thought of as a luxury or something that was exclusive to the massive Tier 1 enterprises. Now, business analytics and the like are thought of as necessities. As the macro landscape has become more competitive the value-add of the HUBS platform has moved forward.With these improving key metrics you can imagine the top-line growth at HUBS has been stellar:Looking back five years the revenue growth at the company has been steady and it has been large - revenue growth has been 132%, 85.5%, 80.7%, and 50.4%. At year end 2013 the company was approaching and in-trend to hit $100 million in revenues on a full year basis, a major milestone for the company that would establish its scale.Today, HUBS most recently posted a 50.8% revenue growth rate on the quarter (on $30.44 million in revenues) and has a 9M/14 growth rate of 47.9% (on $81.72 million in revenues). Also important, the company has managed gross margins to 67.5% from 61.6% just one year ago on the 9M. Even better, gross margins for the quarter were 68.1% when 63.4% one year ago, posting a 550 bps improvement over the full year 2013 gross margin. As HUBS is growing into its scale of operations it's showing that it can expand gross margins which is a good thing.Now, obviously being in expansion mode everything below the gross profit line is counterproductive to profitability. With HUBS in heavy spend mode the net losses at the company have historically grown larger and larger with time. It is worth noting, however, that recently even with losses growing in absolute dollars that the company is creeping more towards profitability:You can see that both on the quarter and on the 9M that HUBS' net loss as a percentage of revenues has come down considerably as have operating losses. Again, profitability isn't something that bulls should focus on in the early going as that's not what the company is focused on but it is yet another encouraging sign to be able to see the company make progress towards this even in expansion mode. Bull should focus entirely on top-line and key metric growth and any gross margin expansion the company can post. For now, pay the losses no mind.Another point of focus should be the company's cash position, which currently sits at ~$118 million inclusive of HUBS higher IPO pricing than expected:This cash becomes important to protecting shareholders from the company taking on debt, of which it has none post-IPO pay down of an $18 million balance on its revolver, or dilutive/debt-based financing vehicles like preferred shares (to which the company has none post-IPO conversion to common shares).At an annualized current burn rate of ~$25 million (simply annualizing cash outflows from operations and investments) and minimal contractual obligations scheduled to come due over the next few years the company stands well positioned to fund its growing operations. In fact, HUBS has the cash visibility to get aggressive with acquisitions if it wants to and I would personally like to see them acquire a point solution provider that is best of breed. I think anything HUBS can do to add to its platform to increase retention and grow dollars per client is going to be paramount to prepping for the jump to enterprise customers, which I believe to be coming within 24 months. Regardless of a shift in client targeting, the company has operational flexibility and is no near-term danger of diluting shareholders:In total, I'm bullish HUBS cash positioning as I think it has the company on the look currently for an addition to its capabilities which is bullish the share price as well.Where's the trade?I think the trade is to get long HUBS and to continue to stay long over the next 12-24 months. I'm extremely bullish the platform, the cash position, and Q4 earnings which will be announced in a few weeks.I think HUBS has smart and capable management who have been smartly promoting the shares post-IPO on the network circuit and that they understand that share price management early is going to be key to attracting and retaining top talent. Also, to avoiding making cash payments in whole for acquisitions. To that end, I'm more than happy to see what management has done so far.I also know this space well and know that the end-markets for HUBS' platform are desperate for this type of solution. This platform is going to be one of the big game changers were going to be talking about during ""year in review"" articles in late-December. I believe it to be that type of platform and that type of company.I recommend a long position in HUBS with at minimum a 12 month hold.I look forward to providing continuing coverage in the future. Good luck to all."

2548885,21820,2014-10-08T14:24:20-04:00,"IPO of rival Marketo was strong and sets up a nice open for Hubspot.Company is growing its customer base, average revenue per user, while keeping acquisition costs in check.Hubspot trades with a favorable price to sales ratio to Marketo and other rivals.","Later this week, cloud based marketing SaaS company Hubspot (Pending:HUBS) will go public in an IPO. The company is offering (Prospectus) 5 million shares at an expected range of $19 to $21 per share. The company entering the market follows a successful IPO by competitor Marketo (NASDAQ:MKTO) last May. This IPO will likely see strong demand and offers an exciting opportunity for investors to cash in on the continuing shift in how companies market their product.Hubspot the CompanyHubspot has more than 11,500 customers in more than 70 countries. The company counts on no single customer for more than 1% of revenue. Some recognizable customers listed in the prospectus include: Verizon (NYSE:VZ), GE Healthcare (NYSE:GE), ADP (NASDAQ:ADP), USA Hockey, Panasonic (OTCPK:PCRFF) and the American Medical Association.Hubspot offers an all in one platform that caters to social media, search engine optimization, blogging, marketing, email, customer relationship, and analytics. The company caters to the mid-market of companies, listed as those with 10 to 2,000 employees, by Hubspot. As of June 30th, Hubspot had 11,624 customers with average revenue per customer of $8,823.Company Strengths and Growth InitiativesThe company lists the following as its strengths:· Leading platform· Market leadership and strong brand· Large and growing agency partner program· Mid-market focus· Powerful network effectsThe company's key areas for growth are:· Grow our U.S. customer base· Increase revenue from existing customers· Keep expanding internationally (as of 6/30 20% of revenue was 20%, 21% of customers were international)· Continue to innovate and expand our platform· Selectively pursue acquisitionsValuation the KeyMarketo shares have returned 37.4% since their May 2013 IPO. After pricing at $13, shares are now above $31 and traded as high as $45 in the last year. At current levels, shares trade with a market capitalization of $1.3 billion. Estimates call for Marketo to lose $0.91 per share in fiscal 2014 and lose $0.75 per share in fiscal 2015. Revenue estimates call for $145.1 million in fiscal 2014 and $192.9 million, representing annual growth of 51.3% and 33.0% respectively.Another rival, Infusionsoft, who focuses on marketing for small businesses, recently raised funds at a $500 million valuation. Since 2012, the company's valuation has more than doubled. Infusionsoft expects revenue to increase 40% to $80 million in the current fiscal year.At the mid-point of its IPO range, Hubspot would have a market capitalization of $607 million. This is just slightly more than smaller Infusionsoft and less than half of Marketo's current cap. A look at the comparison between market capitalization and annual sales shows an opportunity for Hubspot to see a strong IPO.Marketo trades at 9.0 and 6.7 times its current and next fiscal year sales estimates respectively. Privately held Infusionsoft trades at 6.3 times its current expected annual sales. Hubspot, at a $20 price point, trades at 7.8 times its sales from the last fiscal year. The company has not given estimates for revenue but I did my best to come up with conservative estimates. In the first half of the year, Hubspot saw sales of $51.3 million. In the second half of 2013, Hubspot had sales of $42.5 million. With flat sales in the second half, Hubspot would have annual sales of $93.8 million. This would give Hubspot a price to sales of only 6.5. Remember this is with only flat sales in the second half. In the first half of the year, the company saw growth of 46%. That same growth in the second half would translate to annual sales of $113.4 million. With a $20 price, the company would trade at only 5.4 times current sales.Now I believe shares will possibly price above $20 and will likely trade above that range when they hit the open market and many investors have an opportunity to accumulate a position. At the $25 level, shares would have a market capitalization of $759 million. This would translate to a price to sales multiple of 8.1 on conservative flat second half sales and 6.7 times second half growth of 46%.As you can see, even at $25 a share, Hubspot will trade at a cheaper current valuation to rival Marketo. The price to sales would also be only slightly more than what Marketo is being given on a forward basis, with growth expected to be 40%. As you can see, Hubspot will likely be hot and readily compared to Marketo.FinancialsHere is a look at the company's financials:The company continues to posts net losses in each fiscal year. In the first six months of 2014, Hubspot has a net loss of $17.7 million. This comes as a slight increase to the $16.3 million net loss in the first six months of 2013. In fiscal 2013, the company had a net loss of $34.3 million. Hubspot also has negative net tangible book value. The company's negative book value and continual net losses are two key risks going forward. There is a chance that the company will need to raise more money in the future to continue to fund non-profitable operations.Here is a look at other key figures for the company:The company's customer base has more than doubled over two and a half years. The company's average revenue per customer has also increased nicely by 64% in two and a half years. The alarming figure is the customer acquisition cost, which has risen 77% over the same period. This is a key risk to watch going forward as it now stands significantly higher than the average revenue per customer. However, after seeing a sharp rise from 2012 to 2013, the customer acquisition cost rose only 2% in the second quarter from the prior year. This is a positive sign that the company has seen its costs level off.ConclusionI think Hubspot will be one of the hottest IPOs in recent weeks. The company is in a high growth new technology market. Proven rival Marketo hit the market first and saw a nice climb on its debut. This sets up well for Hubspot to see the same. I would watch and see what shares price at, but would be a buyer on opening day at the $25 level. If shares hit higher than that, I would re-evaluate and consider buying based on high growth and expansion in international markets."

4349984,80516,2020-05-26T06:05:22-04:00,"Imperial Oil has an impressive portfolio of assets. The company has a long reserve life and extracts value along the way, all the way to its retail business.The company performed incredibly well in 2019, generating strong shareholder returns. This is a good benchmark for the company's performance in a normal oil environment.There is some risk of continued volatility in oil prices, however, the company's AA credit rating allows it to withstand this.The company's majority ownership by ExxonMobil provides it with valuable technology and insights and makes it a potential acquisition target.","Imperial Oil (NYSEAMERICAN: IMO) is one of the largest integrated oil companies in Canada with a market capitalization of more than $10 billion. The company is majority owned by Exxon Mobil (NYSE: XOM) making up roughly 4% of the latter giant's valuation. As we'll see throughout this article, Imperial Oil's size not only justifies its valuation as an Exxon Mobil investment, but it will mean the potential for significant long-term shareholder returns. Imperial Oil - CBCImperial Oil has responded strongly to COVID-19 and the threat it has put on the company and Canadian oil as a whole. Global Oil Supply / Demand Balance - Imperial Oil Investor PresentationAs can be seen above, from the EIA April forecast, demand has fallen off of a cliff as a result of COVID-19. That led to a dramatic decline in WTI prices to less than $20 / barrel. That massive decline in oil prices is expected to result in a substantial and long-term price decline in oil supply. That will lead to a supply shortage as we get into late-2020. That is expected to lead oil prices to begin to recover. The forecast for WTI prices is for more than $40 going into 2021. That's nothing substantial, however, it's enough for the company's financial portfolios to improve significantly. Imperial Oil Spending Forecast - Imperial Oil Investor PresentationImperial Oil has dramatically cut its capital and exploration spending. The company's planned $500 million reduction is a ~30% reduction in expenses and combines with the company's $500 million reduction in operating expenses. At the same time, the company has suspended its share repurchase program.Putting all of this together, the company will be saving itself more than $1 billion annually, positioning it well for both the downturn and a price recovery. Imperial Oil performed incredibly well in 2019 showing the company's potential in an environment with strong cash flow. Imperial Oil 2019 Results - Imperial Oil Investor PresentationImperial Oil's fundamental strength comes from its position as one of Canada's largest integrated producers. The company has almost 400 thousand barrels / day of upstream production, with 350 thousand barrels / day of refinery throughput and 475 thousand barrels / day of petroleum product sales. As an integrated producer, Imperial Oil can free itself from the confines of takeaway capacity while extracting profits at every step of the chain. Essentially, the company frees itself partially from the bounds of global oil supply and demand by selling its oil as local refined products. However, what's especially important here is the company's financial position and its ability to reward shareholders in a normal environment. The company had $2.2 billion in net income and $4.4 billion in cash from operations.The company turned that to more than $2 billion in shareholder returns. For those who invest today and hold on, that's a nearly 20% yield on their investment in a normal market environment. Imperial Oil's financial strength is supported by the company's integrated asset base, which we discussed partially above, along with its strong upstream reserve base to support this. Imperial Oil Upstream Asset Base - Imperial Oil Investor PresentationImperial Oil's upstream production has decreased dramatically over he past 7 years as the company's Kearl asset, with its 71% interest has come online. Overall, the majority of the company's asset base is supported by 3 major assets, Syncrude, Cold Lake, and Kearl. Backing this up is the company's >25 year proven reserve life, which will support continued long-term shareholder rewards. Imperial Oil Downstream Asset Base - Imperial Oil Investor PresentationImperial Oil, on top of its upstream asset base, is Canada's largest refiner and product marketer. The company has 3 main refineries, however, over the past decade, it has seen refinery throughput decline and petroleum product sales increase. That disparity hasn't hurt the company at all, as it continues to be able to manage turning its production into valuable product sales. As a part of this, Imperial Oil, as an integrated company, also has a major chemical business. The company focuses on various high value resins and feed stocks to maximize the potential profits from its refining business. Putting together Imperial Oil's asset base, combined with its recent expansions, the company has been dramatically increasing cash flow. Imperial Oil Annual Cash - Imperial Oil Investor PresentationImperial Oil has focused on dramatically increasing its cash flow from operations as WTI has recovered. The company's current annual cash from operations is now topping $4 billion supporting a strong business for the company. Given that cash flow potential in an environment with >$50 WTI, that will, as we discussed above lead to significant shareholder returns.It's also worth noting that Imperial Oil's dividend obligations are roughly $500 million annualized. That means the company's cash flow from operations, even accounting for capital expenditures, is more than enough to cover the company's dividend obligations. The company's coverage ratios will continue to support shareholder returns and share buybacks can resume once prices recover. Supporting Imperial Oil through this difficult time is the company's impressive financial strength. Imperial Oil Debt-to-Capital - Imperial Oil Investor PresentationImperial Oil's debt-to-capital ratio is incredibly manageable at less than 20%. The company has focused on a strong balance sheet along with its reliable and growing dividend. The company is also focused on returning surplus cash to shareholders and investing in high value projects. However, the company, throughout this time has maintained a AA credit rating. That means two important things. First, the company has access to incredibly low interest rates, especially with recent interest rate cuts in overall rates. That low interest rate will mean the company can borrow money at a low interest rate, i.e. the potential for strong shareholder returns even with a decent ROCE. Additionally, Imperial Oil has significant room (on top of low interest rates) to expand its debt load. The company could comfortably add a billion or two to its debt load, allowing it to increase shareholder returns. It could do that at an incredibly low interest rate. Buying back shares at its current interest rate would mean cash flow improvements if it can borrow the money for less than its 4% dividend. In fact, Imperial Oil has a long history of rewarding shareholders. Imperial Oil Shareholder Returns - Imperial Oil Investor PresentationThe above image shows Imperial Oil's shareholder returns ability. The company has, while remaining fiscally responsible, doubled its dividends per share over the past decade. Simultaneously, the company aggressively repurchased shares, decreasing its shares outstanding by roughly 15% over the past 3 years through the oil crash. In fact, over the past 3 years, the company's average shareholder return annualized has been in the double digits. Going forward, the company has announced it has halted share buybacks, while it's continuing its respectable dividend. We'd like to see the company take advantage of low share prices to continue its repurchases, however, with that said, we respect the company's desire to maintain its fiscal strength. One other massive advantage Imperial Oil has is that it's nearly 70% held by Exxon Mobil, one of the largest publicly traded integrated oil companies in the world. Imperial Oil has been a part of the Exxon Mobil portfolio since the 1800s as a result of the activities of Standard Oil. Throughout that time, Exxon Mobil has had a substantial stake, while benefiting from share buybacks and dividends. At the same time, as the majority owner, Exxon Mobil has continued to share with Imperial Oil its overall expertise in investing and allow the company to access its technological strength. For now, Exxon Mobil has shown no interest in acquiring Imperial Oil. However, in both the late 90s and the 2008 oil crashes, Exxon Mobil made significant acquisitions. Exxon Mobil is in a worse financial position right now, so Imperial Oil's overall strong debt position makes it more enticing. That also combines with Imperial Oil's strong cash flow ability in a good market. These things together make Imperial Oil an interesting investment on the basis of an acquisition. We don't know if one will occur, but Imperial Oil is a good target for one. On the flip side, Imperial Oil's largest risk is continued low oil prices. The company's integrated nature and direct-to-consumer selling means it has continued to perform well. However, it relies on both continued strength in oil prices along with continued demand, on the retail side of things, for oil and gas. While those assumptions have historically been true, COVID-19 has shown they can change at any time.Currently, the worst appears to be behind us. However, even if it isn't, Imperial Oil is one of the best positioned to handle the downturn if it needs to. The company's credit rating, cash withdrawal abilities, and integrated production all support this. Imperial Oil is one of the best positioned integrated Canadian oil companies. The company takes the oil it produces, upgrades it, and sells it direct to retail customers. That means that the company can extract value at every step of the chain while separating itself from various manufacturing problems that affect Canadian companies.At the same time, the company has a long >25 year reserve life and is incredibly profitable in a normal oil environment. It has a long history of shareholder rewards while benefiting from its majority ownership by Exxon Mobil. Looking at the long run, the company will generate strong shareholder returns and is a quality investment."
4344060,105133,2020-05-07T09:21:52-04:00,"Increased production was insufficient to offset profit declines caused by lower prices.While the upstream segment was hard hit, the firm's downstream division mitigated losses to an extent, showing the strength of Imperial's vertical integration.Non-cash impairment charges played a large role in the firm's negative earnings for the quarter.The firm maintains a strong liquidity position despite an approximately $300MM cash outflow.Business outlook is still negative, but Imperial has a strong chance of survival.","Author's Note: All figures discussed will be in CAD unless stated as otherwise.Reduction in production levels, globally, has pushed oil prices off their previous lows. Many producers, however, would be unable to sustain their businesses at current prices. Energy demand is unlikely to rebound quickly as efforts to reopen businesses will be very slow. Many firms over-indebted and with high capital costs could face insolvency as refinancing credit could prove difficult. The risks facing the industry as a whole are significant, but the probability of survival for some is higher than others.Imperial Oil's (IMO) first-quarter results showed the strength of the firm's business model through a tumultuous environment. Its vertical integration mitigated losses stemming from the upstream division. Cash flow generated in the quarter proved sufficient to meet capital expenditures, damping the negative quarter's impact on the business' financial position. Being financially backed by one of the largest global oil producers, Imperial should prove capable of remaining a force within the oil sands region, but it is still wise for investors to remain cautious.Production volumes increased year over year through the first quarter, despite the reduction in energy demand. Net oil-equivalent production rose by 14% to 403 thousands of barrels per day from a year prior. The increase comes largely as a result of the firm's supplemental crushers coming fully online at its Kearl site. The capital project began in 2017 intending to reduce the impact of a bottleneck at the front end of the plant which had previously led to longer downtime.Increased productivity at the Kearl site should create greater cost efficiency for the firm as operational costs can now be spread out against a larger volume of products, reducing the per-unit costs of the facility. However, any benefit to be had from the increased productivity was overshadowed by the steep decline in average commodity price realizations.(Source: Imperial Oil Q1 2020 News Release)As a result of unfavorable market conditions, the upstream division posted a significant loss as production and operating expenses remained essentially flat, while revenues fell by 26% to $2,374MM. The strength of Imperial was evident in the first quarter despite these weaknesses, as the business's downstream segment's revenue fell by only 9% to $5,379.As discussed in a previous article, the strength of Imperial's vertical integration lays within the fact that the downstream business is less susceptible to commodity prices, instead profiting from the margin between crude oil inputs and the resulting petroleum products the business sells. While this approach limits the gain to be had on surges in oil prices, it provides downside protection.Net income losses of $608MM in the upstream division were mitigated to a large extent as the downstream business posted a net gain of $402MM, which is up from Q1 2019 income by 56%. The positive impacts for the downstream business came as a result of higher margins accounting for approximately $190MM of the total income for the period.A large portion of the total losses was a result of non-cash impairment charges. As with many firms in the industry, Imperial saw a write down in its inventory totaling $281MM, $229MM of which came from the upstream division. Non-cash expenses, while not of importance for short-term liquidity, hold relevance in the fact that, all else equal, they can impair a firm's leverage. This could require businesses to sell assets at disadvantageous prices to maintain target capital ratios.In Imperial's case, the write-down was not significant to the firm's overall financial health due to the relatively small size of the expense. A cash inflow of just over $1 billion from accounts receivables and a simultaneous reduction in accounts payable of approximately the same amount helped the firm maintain its positive working capital position.The exact nature of the adjustments in the current accounts is not made available in interim reports. It would be advantageous for the analyst to understand such changes to a greater extent, specifically in regards to accounts receivables and payables. The current economic environment creates a great deal of uncertainty surrounding the business's capability to fulfill credit obligations. It is then of concern to understand how just over 1.5 billion in current assets could be impacted. In section 5 of the notes to the quarterly financial results, the interim report states that ""no material adjustment to credit allowances in the quarter was required.""(Source: Imperial Oil Interim Report)Despite the hit to earnings, free cash flow was positive for the quarter as Imperial was able to generate $423MM in cash from operating activities compared to $310MM used for capital expenditures. The ability to cut CAPEX significantly on fairly short notice surely benefitted the firm in this respect, and the results for the first quarter put the business on pace to achieve within its target range of $1.1- $1.2 billion for the year.One point of potential concern to highlight is the large disparity between the downstream segment's earnings and cash flow. As mentioned already, the division posted a significant gain of $402MM, this, however, is in stark comparison to the CFO generated of only $22MM.The consolidated cash flow statement does not provide any clear indication in terms of large non-cash adjustments. It is possible that the significant reduction in accounts payable came largely from the downstream division, thus resulting in a reduction in cash received from the business. Without the calculations showing the adjustment from net income to CFO for each division, the analyst cannot identify with certainty the cause for such a disparity.In terms of net cash generation, the firm posted a net outflow of $330MM for the quarter; the amount was fully funded from cash holdings. The spending was largely attributable to shareholder compensation, as thus far management has been reluctant to reduce the dividend, currently, paying out $164MM per quarter. Added to this, the cumulative share buybacks resulted in an additional $274MM, almost entirely accounting for the net cash outflow.Management had indicated in previous a news release that the business would be suspending its buybacks as of April 1. This creates a large area of cash savings for the business, but given the fact that the current crisis plaguing the industry did not begin until late in the quarter, it is uncertain if these additional savings will prove sufficient to maintain cash flow if prices remained subdued, although it can only help.If commodity prices remain subdued during the remainder of the second quarter, Imperial's cash flow may be significantly lower than that in the first. While prices may be rebounding to an extent, the fundamentals would suggest the demand for energy moving forward will be remarkably lower than that in the past.Further disruptions brought about by dispute within OPEC+ could very well send markets again for a spin. Many countries within the group cannot survive with prices at such prices and may be tempted to leave the cartel. Countries such as Venezuela have been hard hit with economic catastrophe long before coronavirus was a topic of discussion. The country could leave the cartel if it believes it is to its advantage. With a significant portion of global oil reserves, Venezuela could easily flood oil markets and drive prices lower.This possibility makes it necessary for firms to create cost efficiencies to ensure they can maintain with lower for longer oil prices. Management had indicated on the earnings call that its objective was to push all-in sustaining costs to the USD $20/bbl level and believes it is on a path to do so. Increased efficiency at the Kearl site could certainly help led the way in this effort. The target CAPEX spending range of $1.1-1.2 billion is approximately $100- $200MM above the minimum spending level to maintain operations. Management has indicated that, if necessary, they could cut current spending by these amounts.The government aid allocated to the oil and gas industry thus far has been significantly less than estimates originally reported on. Those looking for a recap can find it in a previous article here under ""Government Stimulus"". Whether the funding is justified would depend largely on who is asked, as the divide over any matter that has environmental impacts has grown considerably over the years. What is evident, however, is that the proposed stimulus will not support those failing within the industry. The type and relative size of the aid are inadequate to cover the liquidity needs of producers.This could lead to the insolvency of several firms within the region. If firms who are in danger of defaulting on their respected financial obligations begin looking for larger firms to buy them out, Imperial Oil could benefit from discounted asset purchases.Not only does the firm's financial backing by Exxon (XOM) create stability, but it also gives the firm capacity to grow during times when many other businesses cannot afford to make acquisitions. This can be a very advantageous position for the firm as long-term prosperity could come from the ability to buy assets at depressed valuations.Management was prompted on the subject during the recent earnings call and responded in kind.(Source: Imperial Oil Earnings Call Transcripts)The evidence for a ""V-shaped"" recovery that some have suggested is insufficient. Output is likely to be considerably lower for some time, as governments will be slow to remove lockdown measures. Even if these restrictions were removed rapidly, which is highly unlikely, consumer confidence and thus economic activity are likely to be damaged for the foreseeable future.Imperial Oil's strong financial position backed by Exxon Mobil, in conjunction with its vertical integration has proven beneficial through the first quarter, but there is likely more pain to come. The firm's prospects of surviving and even growing through this crisis are good, but having capital at risk at this time may not be the wisest decision for investors. Only time will tell, but those who remain patient will likely protect against near-term losses.In my previous article, I had indicated my intentions to delve deeper into a valuation analysis of Imperial. However, the current economic environment creates far too many uncertainties to value businesses, especially oil and gas, with any degree of accuracy. For those anticipating the insights, I apologize; the conclusion of any valuation at this time would only prove to create a sense of false hope, as predictions for cash flow are fraught with potential risks. The analyst is best during these times to remain diligent in their research, but more importantly, to remain honest with the potential gaps in understanding. For while curiosity killed the cat; hubris will kill the individual investor.Author's Note: Thank you for taking the time to read my work.

4339370,105133,2020-04-23T07:52:01-04:00,"Having Exxon provide credit creates greater financial security.A strong balance sheet and ample access to capital give Imperial the capability to endure low prices for long periods.Vertical integration can support the business in the face of tightening margins, but reduced energy consumption will place strain on the downstream division.Reduced CAPEX could allow the business to maintain positive free cash flow, but if prices stay depressed, this is unlikely.Extreme levels of uncertainty make an investment unadvisable until a clearer sense of the pandemic's impact is available.","A difficult business environment for oil producers persists as prices continue their descent with futures contracts turning negative for the first time in history. Supply gluts build as the novel coronavirus pandemic severely cuts energy consumption globally. The recent news of OPEC+ production cuts have done little to slow price declines. Many producers are now facing unprecedented reductions in operations in hopes of bidding time until more favorable conditions return.Imperial Oil's (NYSEMKT:IMO) strong balance sheet and access to capital, largely financed by majority owner Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), give the capacity to weather low oil prices. Vertical integration allows the company to offset falling margins to an extent. A reduced capital expenditure program could allow the business to maintain free positive cash flow, but the current uncertainty creates an unjustifiable level of risk.Investors have little to gain by jumping into energy stocks given the current halt in economic activity; Imperial Oil has given itself a good chance of surviving this crisis and providing profitable returns to long-term investors. But waiting until there is more evidence to support this theory will prove a wise decision.Imperial Oil is one of Canada's oldest oil and gas producers. Through its long history, the firm has been able to build a strong balance sheet to assist in handling economic crises. Long-term debt stands at $4,961MM, approximately 12% of total assets, leaving Imperial's debt-to-equity ratio at 0.2, significantly lower than that of competitors.Long-Term Debt, millions of CAD(Source: Imperial Oil's Financial Statements)One caveat to this assessment arises when considering the business' outsized capital expenditures through 2012-2014. The period saw $17 billion in CAPEX and $1.6 billion in acquisitions directed towards increasing the business's upstream assets by 99%. The additions were less than ideal in terms of timing commodity markets, but do not pose a significant cause for concern as management was able to largely fund the growth with internally generated funds (70% CFO).Statement of Cash Flows Analysis, millions of CAD (Source: Imperial Oil's Financial Statements)A unique strength for Imperial comes from the fact that its majority owner, Exxon Mobil, also acts as the business' primary financier. As of Dec 2019, Imperial had four credit facilities; the varying sizes and available funds can be seen below.Credit Facilities, millions of CAD(Source: Imperial Oil's 2019 Annual Report)The combined facilities have $3,842MM in credit available. This combined with a cash account of $1,718MM gives Imperial approximately $5,560MM in immediately accessible credit to draw from. This is a strong position given the firm's historical cash flow and expenditures and could prove vital through the current crisis. It is an added benefit that the firm can lean on the financial stability of its parent, leaving it unlikely the business would need to contend with capital scarcity in an attempt to maintain operations.This point, however, implies Exxon Mobil is financially stable. A preliminary financial analysis of the business supports this assumption, but the analyst is always encouraged to spend time assessing this point to the best of their ability before making an investment decision.Annual Free Cash Flow, millions of CAD (Source: Imperial Oil's Financial Statements)The available capital should prove sufficient for Imperial to handle the coming reductions in revenue. Management recently updated its 2020 guidance, cutting expenditures to minimum sustaining levels. This will require approximately $2 billion in cash from operations to cover CAPEX while continuing to pay out investors and creditors.Dividends could likely be cut moving forward; given their relative size, this could be another source of capital savings for the business. Management has been reluctant to cut shareholder payments in the past and hasn't yet made any indication to do so.Compared to historical figures, $2 billion in CFO would appear manageable, but the current crisis precipitating the drops in energy consumption and commodity prices has proven unprecedented in magnitude. (Source: Imperial Oil's 2019 Annual Report)When assessing free cash flow, it can be useful to conduct a hypothetical scenario rather than attempting to identify an accurate forecast, as the latter can prove extremely difficult. If Imperial were to produce zero in cash from operations, meaning it failed to generate enough revenue to cover operating expenses, the firm could maintain its capital expenditures and payouts entirely from its available funds approximately into Q1 2023 ($5,560MM/ $1,951MM = 2.85 years).While not impossible, it would appear to have a lower probability that the business will be unable to meet its capital requirements, at least within the near term. The long-term prospects of the business, however, remain uncertain at this point as with the industry at large.The current crisis could erupt into a global depression as the extent of leverage through the global financial system cannot be sustained for long during a virtual economic shutdown. A change in global politics, specifically regarding OPEC, could lead to a shift in global energy production dynamics if countries elect to opt-out of the cartel, as Saudi Arabia has been playing hardball against Russia at the expense of smaller members. A lasting impact on energy consumption due to the novel coronavirus pandemic is also possible, leaving many pitfalls for businesses within the industry. Imperial Oil will have to face these challenges head-on, and its strategic vertical integration could prove beneficial in this effort.Vertical integration refers to a business that acquires assets within its industry vertical, either up or down the supply chain. In the oil and gas sector, there are three distinct divisions in which a firm can seek to vertically integrate. Imperial Oil has done so with prominent positions in the upstream (exploration and production) and the downstream (refining, processing, and distribution) businesses.When assessing the balance sheet, Imperial Oil appears to lean more towards that of a crude oil producer as the majority of its fixed assets are accounted for in the upstream segment of the business, making up approximately 82% of total assets as of Dec 2019. The economic engine driving much of Imperial Oil's success of late, however, clearly rests within its downstream division. Note the percentages will not total 100% as the Chemical business segment has been omitted due to size.Percentage of Consolidated Total(Source: Imperial Oil's Financial Statements)The downstream segment has provided stability to the firm's cash flow over the previous decade. Oil and gas production will often exhibit high levels of volatility due to the nature of commodity prices within the previous half-century. Some theorize the detachment of state currencies from precious metals, combined with the steady reduction in interest rates and explosion in peacetime fiscal stimulus, has created a higher susceptibility for asset bubbles and increased volatility in asset pricing. This hypothesis holds weight when considering the changes to asset valuations post 1980.The vertical integration provides some downside protection for the business as retail petroleum products are impacted more by consumer demand rather than supplier production, and this leads to relative stability in end prices. The evidence for this can be seen when assessing the separate financials over the previous 12 years. The trade-off for this downside protection comes at the expense of narrower margins, but where the business losses in this respect it gains in a higher return on capital employed.The other major benefit of vertical integration is the ability to reduce costs along the supply chain that would normally impact businesses. Producers require a justifiable return on their investment and thus would look to sell their product to downstream distributors with an embedded margin. Imperial Oil, selling a large portion of its production internally, can avoid this cost and create greater economic efficiency across the supply chain, making the firm more flexible to adverse economic conditions. In the previous five years, internal sales totaled approximately $21 billion.The graphs and tables studied above include periods of high volatility in oil prices and thus give some credibility to Imperial Oil's ability to handle adverse market conditions. The current environment, however, far surpasses past cyclical troughs. Consumer demand has been severely restricted due to the shelter-in-place regulations that have emerged globally. Much of Imperial's downstream division supplies the Canadian market, and while their regulations have proven less restrictive than some US states, the impact on sales will still likely prove significant.The reliability of the downstream segment to support the business during this period then falls into question. The predictability of energy consumption is highly uncertain and thus conclusions on the downside protection should be left until more evidence is available.The analyst should also be forewarned on the reliability of early indication economic data. Data analysis exhibits a principle that one could compare to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle famous within the field of physics. The principle asserts that one cannot know with certainty both the velocity and the position of an object. For the velocity to be identified, the object must be studied over a distance, which then creates uncertainties of its position. Knowing its position means one cannot then by practice identify its velocity.Economic data, likewise, cannot be both timely (measured as the time from today and the last period studied in the data set) and accurate, with a great deal of accuracy. There is a time lag in which data can be received and made useful. Often to speed up the process assumptions, various shortcuts need to be made; this reduces the accuracy of the data. Monthly statistics (such as GDP) are routinely revised for this reason. Thus the analyst trying to infer information on future energy consumption based on monthly, or in some cases weekly data, needs to be careful drawing actionable conclusions. Timely data is not necessarily inaccurate; it is rather that the probability of inaccuracy is higher, and that alone makes it less reliable.The ""buy the dip"" mentality prevalent in market participants shows a very troubling ideology emerging over the previous decades. The idea that stocks will generally rise over long periods relies on the presumption that economic growth exhibits a perpetual upward trend. While some may point to economic data that suggests this to be true, this is simply due to the use of an insufficient time series.Historical study shows both long and short periods of great prosperity followed by financial ruin and widespread socioeconomic destruction. The analyst is best to avoid clichés surrounding portfolio allocation or economic trends and rely on fundamental analysis ensuring to identify, as best as possible, potential circumstances for financial loss and to prepare against them.While Imperial Oil's current valuation appears attractive given its recent historical levels, the grave amount of uncertainty leaves any business within the field out of the question for cautious investors, at least within the short term. While its financial position and vertical integration give the business a strong chance of surviving this crisis, there are significant headwinds in the form of oversupply, dropping energy consumption, and continued resistance from regulators in response to activists' pressures.Evaluating the business using a cash flow multiple would be unwise as the level of uncertainty surrounding sales is too high to give the valuation much use. Currently, Imperial Oil trades at a steep discount to book value, approximately 50% as of the time this is written. Compared to historical levels, this could create the potential for 100% gains; this fails to assess the potential impact on the business' equity value.Imperial's market capitalization is objectively cheap. The firm's sound position could very well create an opportunity for investors to profit significantly at current levels. But the current coronavirus pandemic creates a high probability for a significant economic recession. The interconnectedness of financial markets creates too many potential pitfalls for investors. Remaining on the sidelines with increased cash positions is the wisest strategy for the short term.Authors note: A subsequent article investigating Imperial Oil's business outlook and valuation, in greater detail, is planned to follow.Thank you for taking the time to read my work.

4335785,50662,2020-04-04T11:35:00-04:00,"Imperial Oil's upstream division is hurting right now, but the downstream segment will be more important for the company's survival.Even at a C$50 oil price in 2019, the downstream division reported a 51% higher pre-tax income than the upstream division.The relationship with Exxon Mobil (its largest shareholder) will help the company to power through the current pricing environment.","It has almost been a year since I had a look at Imperial Oil (IMO) here on Seeking Alpha, and I wanted to check up on this producer of heavy oil as the price for Alberta heavy oil has decreased to a single digit price per barrel. Imperial Oil previously touted low sustaining capital expenditures and is quite fortunate to have a long-standing relationship with Exxon Mobil (XOM), but I wanted to figure out how hard Imperial will be hit by the current abysmal oil prices.Data by YChartsIn 2019, Imperial Oil produced a total of 372,000 barrels of oil per day (gross), of which the vast majority (285K boe/d) were bitumen, and about 20% (73,000 barrels per day) consisted of synthetic oil (coming from the Syncrude joint venture).Source: Management Discussion & AnalysisThanks to the decent production results (up from the 2018 and 2017 production results, I was expecting the downstream segment (the refinery division) to perform well but unfortunately an incident at Sarnia reduced the company’s flexibility, and the utilization rate of the refinery capacity dropped to just 83% after having averaged well over 90% in the previous two years.Source: Management Discussion & AnalysisAs the price for Bitumen held up pretty well throughout 2019 (Imperial received an average price of C$50/barrel, which is approximately 25% higher than in the previous few years), it was able to protect the margins of its upstream segment against the lower NGL price (down 41% compared to 2018) and lower gas price (down 16% compared to FY 2018). The increase of the received price per barrel of bitumen was mainly related to the higher WCS price (Western Canadian Select) and a lower diluent cost.Imperial reported a net revenue of C$34.1B and although this is approximately 3% lower than the revenue in FY 2018, its pre-tax income fell by approximately a third to C$2.05B. Perhaps a surprise given the relatively strong oil price, but the excise tax and fuel charges (+10%) and 8% increase of the production expenses caused the operating expenses to remain unchanged as they mitigated the impact of a lower interest expense, SG&A and a lower amount of purchased oil products. Interestingly, Imperial did get a C$154M tax credit (compared to a C$759M tax payment in 2018) and thie was the only reason why the net income fell by just 5% to C$2.2B. And as I explained in my previous article, Imperial Oil appears to be a believer in repurchasing its own stock so despite the 5% decrease of the net income, the EPS actually increased by 1 cent thanks to the continuous share buybacks throughout 2019.Source: financial statementsImperial Oil announced a C$4.43B operating cash flow and after deducting the lease payments and investments in the working capital position, approximately C$3.6B remained as adjusted operating cash flow. The capex was just C$1.64B, and this results in Imperial generating approximately C$1.95B in free cash flow.Source: financial statementsGiven the current share count of 744M shares, that’s roughly C$2.63 per share (or just below US$2/share based on the current USD/CAD exchange rate).Just a few weeks ago, Imperial Oil was referring to its history and tried to reassure the market the company was ready to ‘weather market challenges’. As Imperial is currently in a low capital investment period, IMO referred to the lower capital needs to keep the operations humming along nicely while maintaining flexibility to deploy its investment capital.As the oil price continued to trade around multi-year lows (with the price for a barrel of heavy oil in Canada’s Alberta province dropping to less than US$5/barrel), more decisive action was required and Imperial Oil announced a substantial reduction to its planned level of investments. Whereas the oil company was planning to spend C$1.6-1.7B, it has now reduced this guidance by C$500M to C$1.1-1.2B. Most of the capex reduction is from deferred investments (with for instance the coker turnaround at Syncrude being deferred into Q3, while Imperial Oil has now also suspended its ongoing share repurchase program. Additionally, Imperial will also be able to save C$500M per year on operating expenses, and the combination of both should be a big help to the company.Source: financial reportAs Imperial Oil is an integrated company divided in an upstream, downstream and chemical segment, it’s difficult to guesstimate the impact of the low oil price on its business. Even in 2019, when the average oil price was around C$50 for Imperial’s type of oil, the upstream segment generated a pre-tax income of ‘just’ C$867M while the downstream segment reported a C$1.3B pre-tax income and the chemical division reported a C$141M pre-tax income. So the main question for Imperial Oil will be the efficiency of its refinery operations and the demand and pricing for finished products like gasoline and jet fuel.Additionally, having Exxon Mobil owning in excess of 2/3 rd of the share count will help as Imperial will very likely continue to be supported by Exxon.Imperial Oil is a ‘special’ case as it is a vertically integrated company refining its own crude oil into finished products like gasoline, jet fuel and lubricants. While the upstream segment is definitely hurting at the current oil prices, the downstream segment should help to mitigate the impact of the weak upstream segment. However, don’t expect the downstream segment to fully mitigate the negative performance of the upstream segment but it will surely buy Imperial Oil more time to get through the current era of low oil prices compared to some of its competitors.With C$1.7B in cash and C$5.2B in gross debt on the balance sheet, Imperial Oil can survive an extended period of lower oil prices, but the true impact will only be visible later this year. I currently have a small long position in Imperial Oil and am looking to slightly increase this position."
4379435,96726,2020-10-17T11:00:00-04:00,"Imperial Oil is one of the cheapest and highest quality stocks on the market today.IMO's majority ownership by Exxon Mobil provides it with many advantages.If I had to chose one oil company to buy, it would be IMO.","Co-produced with Long PlayerImperial Oil Ltd (IMO) is a Canadian company that's far more fully integrated than many Canadian companies. The stock trades in New York under the ticker IMO. The company's structure is similar to that of the parent company Exxon Mobil (XOM) which owns roughly two-thirds of the company. That integration gives this company an important advantage when the industry recovers.Imperial Oil began as a group of refiners in Canada that combined their businesses more than 100 years ago. At a certain point, the business needed capital to continue to expand and grow. So the group approached John D. Rockefeller’s Standard Oil Company for some growth capital. When Standard oil broke apart, Exxon Mobil was the company that received the Canadian company division (which is now Imperial Oil), and has continued to own a significant stake in the company today.Source: IMO WebsiteThe result of the Exxon Mobil influence is a continuing integration strategy really only seen in the United States “super majors.” That makes this company different from the typical oil and gas company in Canada.Unlike Exxon Mobil, Imperial Oil has far greater reliance on thermal oil followed by the ability of the refining business to “upgrade” the product to more profitable end products. This process allows for larger product margins than would normally be the case to just produce and sell the heavily discounted thermal oil.In fact, much of the Canadian thermal production industry is integrated with the ability to upgrade the product for refining. Generally, the independent thermal producers and heavy oil producers have an extremely challenging time during periods of pricing weakness. In the 1990s, oil prices were high enough to allow thermal and heavy oil producers to make an adequate return in the production business alone. That has not been the case lately since the big oil price crash at the end of 2015. Therefore, the significant production survivors are generally integrated enough to make up for low production sales prices with higher refined prices.The latest economic decline was so fast and so severe due to the coronavirus demand destruction that integration really didn't matter much. This was the primary of several reasons for the decline in price of integrated oil companies. But investors can expect that fully integrated strategy to lead to a superior recovery in the stock as well as superior future prospects.Imperial Oil has long outperformed its less integrated peers in terms of profitability and return of capital. In addition, this company traditionally keeps a very strong balance sheet like parent company Exxon Mobil. Therefore unless the current demand reduction lasts a relatively long time, this company will return to thriving in top-notch condition as one of the industry's leaders well into the future.Like the controlling parent company, this company completely controls the entire industry channel to the retail or business consumer as well as some whole customers. This includes the following products and services depicted in the image below.Source: IMO WebsiteThis is not a very common strategy for an integrated “major” company in Canada and it sets Imperial apart from much of the industry as a result. Some of these products, such as chemicals, have their own cycles that may not coincide with the oil and gas industry cycle.Then there are the consumer products, such as gasoline, that tend to be recession resistant. Asphalt is another recession-resistant product because there's a large government business component. As long as there's not a complete collapse as there was in the second quarter of the current fiscal year, this company will have businesses that “keep on chugging away” during the more frequent recession type mild downturns that are generally far more frequent.These businesses are likely to be among the first to recover as well from the demand loss in the second quarter. Gasoline, for example, is badly needed before many other recession-resistant products. Therefore, the recovery of this company will be stronger than many during the early halting or lumpy recovery from the low second quarter demand.This stock is clearly priced for a long-term recession or worse.Source: Seeking AlphaRarely does this stock yield anything close to 5.3%. Generally, the yield for a stock of this quality is much closer to 1%. That gives the investor an idea of how far out of favor this stock has fallen. As usual, Mr. Market has figured that this company will never recover within our lifetime. That happens to be a very typical attitude during cyclical industry bottoms.Source: IMO Annual Results Press Release Jan. 31, 2020A far more typical result from 2019 is shown above. That typical result shows that the stock is now trading at about 3 to 4 times reasonable results basically because of one outlier quarter. By the end of the second quarter, total debt was C$5.193 billion. That was a little more than one times cash flow for the fiscal year ending 2019. This means that the way things are going, IMO can pay down all of its debt in a single year. Despite the reservations of Mr. Market, the finances are nothing to worry about. Therefore Mr. Market has gone far overboard due to one outlier quarter as usual.One caveat would be that generally growth occurs as significant new production capacity comes online from relatively large thermal project additions. Therefore growth in the dividend will vary depending upon the management outlook for demand. Currently much of the industry sees no need to add to production capacity for “awhile” due to the demand loss from the pandemic.Recent history has shown that financially leveraged companies like California Resources (OTCPK:CRCQQ) do run into trouble no matter how good their asset base is. But assets alone rarely work in this industry. Financial leverage almost never works unless the company de-leverages very quickly. Generally the companies that do best long term are the financially strong companies that hit a lot of “singles and doubles.” Almost any baseball coach will tell you that the players connecting with the best batting averages are the ones more likely to hit home runs. That's also the case in this industry for oil and gas stocks in general.Much of the oil patch is under review or on negative watch due to the lower demand during the pandemic. However Imperial Oil has the advantage of being part of the ExxonMobil organization. That allows for a higher financial strength rating than would normally be the case if Imperial was independent. Imperial Oil had a very bad second quarter with highly negative cash flow. Yet the effects of that quarter could be mitigated when the ratings companies re-evaluate the oil patch due to the same association. The fact is that Imperial maintains some of the lowest debt ratios in the industry as well as a history of above average profitability. No matter the outcome of the ratings agency, those superior performance measures are unlikely to change. Therefore future access to capital is likely to remain a non-issue. Source IMO presentationAs the chart above shows, IMO is one of the least leveraged companies in the oil patch. This financially strong company now has a yield that could well appeal to income investors with its dividend yield of 5.3%. The financial strength does indicate that the stock can be held long term. But any oil and gas stock, even the integrated ones, is very volatile. Therefore, a buy and hold strategy is only suitable for those that can stomach the price gyrations that come with the oil and gas industry. Those who want the price to not drop more than 10% or 15% at any given time do not belong as investors in the oil and gas industry.As was demonstrated before, financially-strong companies will increase their dividend from time to time and will appreciate over time.Second quarter results stunk. But those results are probably an outlier.Source: IMO 2Q-2020, Earnings Press Release July 31, 2020On top of that “wonderful” news shown above, the company also reported negative cash flow of roughly $C800 million. Therefore, the bears will celebrate the one quarter failure of the integration strategy of the company. But investors should expect that the company history of superior profitability and cash flow will quickly reassert itself in the future.That would mean that the recent stock price selloff in tandem with the rest of the market was way overdone. As has been typical lately the “flight to safety” was toward Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and the “FAANG type” stocks. As that pattern ages, the strategy is likely to fail and at some point will result in a lot of fund manager pink slips. That happens to be typical for the fund management industry which is also cyclical.Any company like IMO has a pretty big insulation from oil prices. It's really the end products they make that matter – for example gasoline, chemicals, LNGs. Now a lot of that does ""tend"" to vary with the price of oil and gas but not necessarily. An integrated company like IMO does not depend upon the price of oil because refining and further processing will make up the profits if the end product prices recover. IMO sells very little if any oil to the market. It sells instead gasoline, asphalt, lubricants etc., and depends upon the prices of those markets. Therefore demand must recover in those markets and they are consumer markets.So it's not necessarily the sharp decline in oil price that has impacted the full extent of the price decline of IMO, but rather weaker demand for its products from the pandemic. As soon as the economy recovers from the impact of the pandemic, IMO should see its stock price soar, with the potential to more than double.This is the same story for Royal Dutch Shell (RDS.A) (RDS.B), Chevron (CVX) and Exxon Mobil. When you are that integrated the price of oil only matters to the extent that other products at the end of the line also go up.IMO has a few ways to win:Here it's important to note that due to oil supply reduction as result of COVID-19, once the economy picks up there's going to be a significant shortage in oil which will drive the price much higher. We believe that oil at $60 a barrel would double or triple the price of IMO at least.Imperial Oil is an integrated company that's far more integrated than many would expect. This company also will likely be controlled by Exxon Mobil for the foreseeable future. The business strategy of producing heavily-discounted products and then upgrading those products through the chain of integration has long provided an above average return on capital for shareholders.This stock is volatile like many in the oil and gas industry – but finances are rock solid. Therefore, an investor who can withstand the oil and gas volatility can probably invest in this company for its current dividend yield while ignoring stock price variations due to the industry volatility. IMO's yield will grow over time to provide an ever-increasing return.The current stock price is far below anything close to reasonable as it's trading at dirt cheap valuations. This would allow an investor to gain a very decent dividend yield along with the ability to participate in an eye-popping but predictable industry recovery over the next five years.Imperial Oil has the financials to wait out whatever economic crisis may lie ahead. Meanwhile management has a strong track record of profitability for a very long time. Therefore, investors should be able to sleep well at night regardless of the mood of Mr. Market over the next year or two. This is a stock with the potential double or triple, in addition to a decent dividend yield of 5.3%. If I had to chose one oil company to buy today, it would be Imperial Oil.Thanks for reading!

4263873,50662,2019-05-18T11:20:00-04:00,"Imperial Oil prefers to buy back stock instead of paying big dividends.After an excellent first quarter, it did increase its quarterly dividend by 16% for a current yield of 2.3%.Exxon Mobil owns almost 70% of Imperial's stock but as it continues to tender a pro-rata amount into the repurchase program, it doesn't appear interested in acquiring full ownership.As Imperial's oil production is completely oil sands related, the leverage on the oil price is quite high due to high production/transportation expenses and lower prices vs. the benchmark.","Imperial Oil (IMO) is a Canadian vertically integrated oil producer which has the number one market position on the jet fuel, gasoline, and asphalt sales. With gasoline and diesel representing almost 80% of the company's sales (in terms of barrels oil equivalent). Now the Canadian oil prices have performed very well in the first quarter of this year, I wanted to check how Imperial Oil has performed during the quarter as the company is now solely relying on oil sands operations now its conventional assets have been sold.Data by YChartsAs Imperial Oil's main shareholder is Exxon Mobil (XOM) with a total ownership of almost 70%, one could argue Imperial acts as Exxon's oil sands division.Under the impulse of a higher WTI oil price (compared to Q4 2018), the average price for a barrel of Western Canada Select averaged almost US$42.5 which is a substantial increase compared to the oil price last year (US$38.67 per barrel of WCS). Additionally, the price received per barrel of bitumen increased from C$35.61 in Q1 2018 to C$48.84 in the first quarter of this year on the back of the higher oil prices and the weaker Canadian dollar (as the CAD lost approximately 5% on the US dollar compared to a year ago).Source: press releaseAs Imperial Oil reports its financial results in Canadian dollar, the weaker Canadian dollar actually does help. The oil giant produced an average of 388,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which is a 5% increase compared to Q1 2019 and this resulted in the sale of 477,000 barrels per day of oil-related products, which is almost exactly the output Imperial Oil was able to sell in Q1 2018.The revenue increased by less than 1% to 7.98B CAD, while the pre-tax income fell by approximately 40% to just C$398M on the back of higher purchases of crude oil and products (the intersegmental sales whereby the upstream division sells the unrefined product to the downstream segment at a slightly higher cost. According to the segmental information, C$948M of revenue in the upstream segment was generated through intersegment sales). The bottom line showed a net income of C$293M or C$0.38/share. Definitely not very impressive for a stock trading at around C$37 per share.Source: financial resultsImperial's cash flow statement appears to be more robust. After adjusting the reported C$1B in operating cash flow for working capital changes, the adjusted operating cash flow was approximately C$813M. Of this amount, roughly C$431M was spent on capex, resulting in a free cash flow of C$382M. A bit higher than the net income, but divided over 772M shares, this still results in an FCF/share of around C$0.50. It also indicates the company is trading at a free cash flow yield of approximately 6%.On the back of the aforementioned strong results, Imperial Oil has hiked its quarterly dividend to C$0.22 per share, starting with the Q2 dividend. Considering the current share count totals approximately 772M shares, the dividend hike will cost Imperial Oil approximately C$680M in dividends (although the ongoing share buyback program will very likely reduce the share count and the dividend-related cash outflow).Source: company presentationApproximately C$149M was spent on dividends in Q1 as A) the average share count was slightly higher and B) the dividend was lower.More than twice as much (C$361M) was spent on buying back stock. As the footnotes to the financial results confirm, a total of 9.98M shares were repurchased which results in an average price of C$36.17 per repurchased share.At first, I thought the share buyback program also puts Exxon Mobil into the pole position to make a move to acquire full ownership of Imperial Oil further down the road. As the company is now buying back stock at market prices, every share Imperial can repurchase and cancel is a share Exxon won't have to pay a premium on to push for a delisting of Imperial Oil.However, Exxon Mobil has participated in the previous buyback programs and tendered a pro rata amount of its own shares to Imperial Oil's buyback program, so its ownership remains below 70% for the time being. The positive is that all shareholders are being treated equal, but it also reduces the odds of Exxon Mobil making a move to acquire full ownership, removing any takeover speculation.Data by YChartsSo, pretty much the entire free cash flow that was generated in the first quarter was spent on dividends and share buybacks. That's a bit surprising considering Imperial has just greenlighted a massive C$2.6B investment in the Aspen oil sands project, which will increase the production rate by approximately 75,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Sure, the development has been 'delayed' now due to the intervention of the local Alberta government in the oil markets, but it would perhaps be wise to keep a bit of money on the side in case it will go ahead with the construction in the next few years.Additionally, Imperial's balance sheet still contains roughly C$5B in debt (C$4B in net debt after subtracting the C$1B in cash). Fortunately, the debt is provided by a subsidiary of Exxon Mobil, and XOM has made up to C$7.75B available under this credit agreement. But while I was wondering if buying back stock is a solution that benefits all shareholders, as right now, it looks like Exxon is cashing in twice: it sells Imperial Oil stock and generates cash from selling those shares while it continues to charge interest on the C$5B loan, I was pleasantly surprised to see Exxon charged just 1.5% on the short-term debt and 2% on the long-term debt which undoubtedly is the cheapest debt funding available.'Why would I buy Imperial Oil as its dividend yield is just 2.3% after hiking the dividend? I'm better off buying another oil stock' is an often-heard argument against an investment in Imperial Oil. But (potential) investors need to dig a bit deeper. The real value in Imperial Oil indeed isn't the dividend yield but its potential to buy back stock, further boosting the value per share.In the first quarter of this year, in excess of 1% of the share count was repurchased by Imperial Oil, and the company remains on track to retire roughly 5% of its share count by the end of this year. This will have a positive impact on the FCF per share and EPS in the future and will ultimately benefit every investor. If you're looking for a high-yield investment, Imperial Oil definitely isn't a good fit.The current free cash flow yield of 6% isn't too exciting either, but if the company continues to repurchase stock at a rate of 4% per year, Imperial Oil's free cash flow per share will continue to increase at the same percentage. Rather than buying stock at the current share price of US$27.7 (on the US listing), one could consider writing an out of the money put option in an attempt to acquire stock at a lower price."
4250737,104807,2019-03-25T04:53:25-04:00,"Between the Syncrude, Aspen and Kearl projects, the company produces about 400,000 barrels of oil each day and is expecting to raise production ~15% over the next 2 years.The Alberta provincial government will affect operations by squeezing refining margins and delaying development of the Aspen in situ oil sands project.The NAV model suggests Imperial Oil is worth $65/share.","Although the sector has been beaten up pretty severely over the past 4 years, if you are looking to get exposure to the O&G sector Imperial Oil (NYSE:IMO, TSX:IMO) and Suncor (NYSE:SU, TSX:SU) are definitely the safest bets due to being integrated energy producers with downstream segments.After selling off conventional oil assets, IMO is now 100% focused on production from the oil sands. The company has 3 main assets in Alberta, including a joint venture with Suncor (the Syncrude oil sands project) and its Aspen, and Kearl oil sands projects. Between the 3 asset bases, the company produces about 400,000 boe/d. IMO has plans to grow production from both its Kearl and Aspen oil sands projects 15% in the next couple of years.IMO’s downstream assets include three refineries, two are located in Ontario, with the third in Alberta, as well as a rail transport terminal located in Edmonton. The company supplies gasoline to nearly 2,200 Esso and Mobil stations across Canada and is Canada’s largest jet fuel supplier and a major asphalt producer.Controversy continues in Alberta as the mandatory production cuts introduced by Alberta’s provincial government that began in January 2019 and are designed to bolster the price of Canadian oil prices, i.e., Western Canadian Select (WCS). The province issued a mandate on December 2, 2018, to remove 325,000 barrels of oil production per day from the market. Key opposition for the cuts has been from integrated energy majors IMO and SU for fears of reduced profitability in their downstream segments. A wide differential between WCS and WTI means they can obtain the feedstock for their refining operations at a deep discount to the price they can charge for processed fuels and other products.The intervention by the Alberta government has caused IMO to decelerate development of the Aspen in situ oil sands project. In November 2018, this was a planned C$2.6 billion project with intent to commence production by 2022. The Aspen project is projected to produce 75,000 barrels of oil per day as well as generate provincial revenues of more than C$10 billion in royalties for Alberta. The project was sanctioned before the government of Alberta even announced its production curtailment program in response to the widening crude price differentials.Given the current economic outlook for IMO, let's estimate the NAV.The reserves data set forth below (the ""Reserves Data"") comes from IMO's 2018 annual information form. The table below shows the net present value after-tax estimates at varying discount rates from the crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas reserves (i.e., barrels of oil equivalent at 6 million cubic feet per one thousand barrels of oil) using forecast prices and costs prior to the provision for interest, debt service charges, general and administrative expenses, the impact of hedging activities, and after deduction of royalties, operating costs, certain estimated well abandonment and reclamation costs and estimated future capital expenditures.The assumptions used for pricing the reserves shown above are quite reasonable in that all of the different forms of oil and gas are in line with their respective futures curve prices.Using a 10% interest rate (as this is the closest to most oil company WACCs), we find that the net present value of the reserves is $27.5 billion, which can approximate the value of IMO's E&P and oil sands segment.The value of the downstream segment is best approximated via use of a market multiple comparison (i.e., EV/EBITDA). Below are 5 small-to-mid cap downstream marketing & refining companies and their current multiples.IMO does not report adjusted EBITDA from its various segments, but it can be approximated from information provided in the operations by segment in the notes to 2018 YEFS shown below:As we can see, IMO breaks out its petrochemical business as a separate operation from its downstream, but by combining them we can come up with an EV for the downstream segment using the combined EBITDA and a 7.43x EV/EBITDA.Using debt of ~$17 billion at 2018 YE, we can derive IMO's NAV as follows:(Figures in billions, except price per share)This analysis ignores the value of the corporate and eliminations segments, as they add little revenue. In fact, the eliminations would decrease the value of IMO, as it is an operating loss segment given that its main purpose is environmental protection and remediation.It appears IMO is significantly undervalued from its current market price at $36/share on the TSX (~100% undervalued), even with a bearish outlook on O&G prices over the next ten years as evidenced by the NYMEX WTI and WCS futures curves. The high NAV can largely be attributed the company's strong debt management, as it hasn't been more than 40% of the capital structure the last couple years, but more importantly, to the strong performance of the downstream segment which has offset the impacts of low oil prices on the top line.What must be remembered is that the production cuts mandated by the Alberta government will likely squeeze EBITDA margins in the downstream segment and impact the top line of the upstream segment; how much this will hurt consolidated cash flow for 2019 will require further analysis. However, the results would have to be pretty dramatic to bring the intrinsic value of IMO down closer to its current market price.The factors and risks that could challenge the assumptions used herein include increases in royalties payable to the Alberta and federal governments of Canada or regulations that affect major costs, such as abandonment or reclamation, political unrest or continued pipeline capacity bottlenecks in Canada. Time horizon risk is another issue, since as long as fears about the stability of oil prices persist, there is no telling how soon this return can be realized.I recommend a Buy for IMO."

Sometimes you can get the entire investing thesis correct, and the stock price can still take a vacation in the exact opposite direction. Investors in Imperial Oil (IMO) know exactly what this feels like. Imagine buying this company in 2016, right when everyone thought oil would forever be relegated to sub $30/barrel. In fact, back then the major banks were all over each other trying to see if someone would get to negative barrel prices alongside negative interest rates.Source: CNNSo imagine if you were the contrarian that bought IMO right when nobody could see any scenario of even $40/barrel oil prices. Such guts and foresight would surely have been rewarded, no?Not so much unfortunately.Even if you did get the 93% rebound in oil prices correct, you did unfortunately lose almost 13% on your IMO purchase.Data by YChartsNot only did you lose 10% on your investment, but you also missed out on a 66% rally in SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF (SPY).Data by YChartsAs it stands today, we will not make a case for why the markets have gone insane. Instead, we will make a case that this is easily one of the best opportunities for a dividend growth investor.IMO has a superb array of assets that span every step of the energy chain.Source: Imperial Oil Q3-2019 presentationFrom conventional upstream and oil sands production, to refineries, gas stations and production of chemicals, IMO extracts every penny of value from its barrel of oil.Source: Imperial Oil Q3-2019 presentationIts refinery run rates are almost exactly the same as its oil production, making it one of the best hedged oil producers against wide differentials that can arise in the Canadian market. Suncor Energy (SU) is another name that we like but its upstream production far exceeds its downstream capabilities. So IMO is possibly the best positioned in an era of pipeline approval delays.IMO's upstream assets have some of the best reserves in the world.Source: Imperial Oil Q3-2019 presentation6.5 billion barrels of reserve alongside 400,000 barrels a day of production is almost exactly what we have in another stock that we dearly love.Source: Cenovus EnergyWhere IMO is differentiated versus Cenovus Energy Inc. (CVE) is in the fact that its downstream refining capacity matches its upstream production whereas CVE has much lower downstream operations.IMO's oil sands are tiered along the cost curve with Cold Lake being the lowest operating cost.Source: Imperial Oil Q3-2019 presentationKearl is the second oilsands project and it is slightly more expensive to operate and maintain.Source: Imperial Oil Q3-2019 presentationFinally, IMO also owns a stake in the Syncrude project and this has turned out to be the most expensive on a per barrel basis.IMO complements this upstream base with strong downstream assets.Source: Imperial Oil Q3-2019 presentationIMO's downstream assets are a steady source of cash in all crude oil price environments. In the 2015-2016 downturn, its downstream (light blue) powered more than 80% of total operating cash flow.Source: Imperial Oil Q3-2019 presentationIn 2019, IMO so far produced $3.4 billion CAD in operating cash flow. Investing activities to maintain and grow production used up $1.3 billion CAD in cash.Source: Imperial Oil Q3-2019 financialsThat left a surplus of $2.1 billion CAD and IMO returned almost 75% of that to shareholders via dividends and buybacks. That is a stunning rate of return. Buybacks have reduced shares outstanding by about 11% since the end of 2016.Source: Imperial Oil Q3-2019 presentationDividends have been ramping up rapidly as well and the five growth rate is quite respectable.Source: Imperial Oil Q3-2019 presentationImperial still yields only 2.58% but the opportunities for upside are enormous. For starters, the dividend is a very small part of the total cash flow. IMO was able to comfortably maintain it even in 2015-2016 time frame and add buybacks on top of that.At $60/barrel which we think is a minimum long-term price to balance demand and supply, IMO would generate $4.6-4.8 billion in operating cash flow and have $2.1-2.5 billion in free cash flow after dividends and after growth capex.Source: Imperial Oil Q3-2019 presentationThat is a large amount of free cash flow in relation to its market capitalization.Data by YChartsThis free cash flow is a superior metric to that shown by many MLPs as this is free cash flow after dividends and even after growth capex. If we just use sustaining capex as a deduction from operating cash flow, we get a 13-15% free cash flow yield. Now there are some MLPs that have a higher free cash flow yield, but none that come remotely close to matching IMO's balance sheet.Source: Imperial Oil Q3-2019 presentationWe made some rather conservative assumptions for extrapolating returns.Based on those numbers, we see a $2.07 dividend just consuming 12% of the free cash flow per share before growth capex (16% after growth capex).Source: Author's CalculationsIn other words, dividends in spite of growing at 10% for a decade would consume less of the free cash flow than they do today, thanks to buybacks reducing share counts substantially. Even if valuation compresses as we have shown (free cash flow yield after dividends and capex more than doubles), IMO can return 8% a year in total returns.The biggest risk is if IMO overpays for a large acquisition. The company has been extremely disciplined and most Canadian plays are so cheap that the risk of materially overpaying is very small today. But it could happen in the future. The second large risk for this dividend growth model is the share price escalates rapidly. Paradoxically, that would make buybacks less effective and the dividend could grow less. Approval of more pipelines might also get IMO to focus more on growth and less on shareholder immediate returns. Electric Vehicle is often cited as a risk but as the latest numbers from InsideEV show, 2019 growth has slowed to just 1% over 2018. Even with 30% compounded growth rates, the earliest EVs would make a dent in the global ICE fleet is post 2030. IMO also has a massive controlling stake from Exxon Mobil (XOM) and while we see this as a positive, there is a risk that XOM may try to outright buy this at an opportunistic price.AA+ rated balance sheets with shares priced for disaster are good opportunities to step in. We like the risk-reward here and any spikes in oil will likely just create a faster return policy by the company. Patient dividend growth investors are getting one of the best opportunities of a lifetime and they should grab it with both hands.It appears the company certainly feels that way about its own shares.Source: Canadian Insider"

In January 2020, Mr. Fink wrote a letter to CEOs entitled, “A Fundamental Reshaping of Finance.”Within the letter, Mr. Fink stated that “climate risk is investment risk.” He also wrote,Norges Bank is the central bank of Norway. It also manages the country’s Government Pension Fund of Norway, a stabilization fund that may be the world's largest sovereign wealth fund. It's worth about $1.1 trillion and earned a return of 19.9 % in 2019. It owns about 1.5% of all stocks listed globally and so its investment policies attract much attention.On May 13, 2020, it announced its decision to exclude certain oil companies from its portfolio, due to ethical considerations, as follows:In the Guidelines, it states:Taking into account Mr. Fink’s and Norges Bank’s guidance, I developed an investment thesis to trade the “carbon spread” by going long an energy company that has a low carbon footprint and is moving forward on renewable energy, Equinor (EQNR), and to short two of the companies excluded by Norges Bank’s Government Pension Fund for their high carbon emissions, Imperial Oil Limited (IMO) and Cenovus Energy Inc. (CVE).By taking roughly offsetting long and short positions in these stocks, the strategy should be oil price neutral. The spread will profit if the EQNR’s gains relative to IMO and CVE.Looking back over the past year, their relative performances do support the thesis. EQNR lost 17.6% of its equity value.Source: Seeking Alpha.whereas CVE lost 46.3%.Source: Seeking Alpha.and IMO lost 41.2%.Source: Seeking Alpha.Equinor (EQNR), formerly Statoil, is 67% owned by the Government of Norway, 3% owned by the Government Pension Fund of Norway, and 29% owned by others. It's the largest operator in Norway, one of the world’s largest offshore operators, and has a growing presence in renewables.Equinor started production on the giant Johan Sverdrup offshore oilfield on Oct. 5, two months ahead of schedule and under budget. The field already was producing well over 300,000 b/d and loading volumes are expected to average around 400,000 b/d in December. All eight production wells drilled are now on-stream, ahead of schedule.The field will be powered from shore to run the platforms, instead of local supply, which reduces carbon emissions. Norway’s electric grid is 95% supplied by hydropower from 937 dams.EQNR also has an offshore wind portfolio that includes three wind farms off of UK, and is involved in large-scale wind projects off of the UK, Germany and the US. Empire Wind, off of Long Island, New York, is projected to power one million homes starting in 2025.Curiously, both IMO and CVE had announced plans to reduce their greenhouse emissions prior to Norges Bank’s decision. On April 19, 2019, Imperial released its study, Energy and Carbon Summary: Positioning for a Lower-Carbon Future. “The report outlines Imperial’s commitments to addressing the risks of climate change, while providing energy solutions that enable global economic progress in an environmentally responsible way.”The company reported that it had “reduced the intensity of greenhouse gas emissions from its operated oil sands by 20 percent, and plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions intensity of these oil sands facilities by 10 percent over the next five years, compared to 2016 levels.”On Jan. 9, 2020, CVE set “bold sustainability goals.” Cenovus President and Chief Executive Officer, Alex Pourbaix was quoted saying:Source: Cenovus Energy Inc.Prior to the pandemic, climate change issues had become a prominent, global issue. And Larry Fink’s letter to CEOs and investors impressed upon them the importance of climate risk as investment risk.Apparently, IMO and CVE’s emissions reduction plans and goals did not go far enough for Norges Bank. And the market already had punished their stock performance relative to Equinor, which has made the production of low carbon energy a significant part of its longer-term development strategy.Therefore, I expect the carbon spread thesis to profit regardless of the future direction of oil prices. Oil firms without a transition plan to non-oil energy will eventually end up with near-worthless stranded reserves.On July 29, Total SA (TOT), the French oil and gas giant, reported it would book an $8.1 billion impairment in its second quarter of 2020 results primarily associated with the value of its Canadian oil sands assets. The company has set a target of reaching net-zero emissions from its operations by 2050. It said this could leave a portion of its Canadian oil sands assets ""stranded.” And it will make no further investments in capacity additions."

4317004,96726,2020-01-20T08:38:00-05:00,Imperial Oil is one of the cheapest and highest quality stocks on the market today.The key differentiator is the ultra-low sustaining cost of capital.Lack of growth opportunities means that investors will see cash flow bonanza over the next decade.The free cash flow yield is +15%.This is HDO Expert Trapping Value’s largest position.,"Co-produced with Trapping ValueHigh Dividend Opportunities, as the name implies, focuses on higher yield assets. We understand how important yield is to investors and realize that the 2% yield that we see on indices just doesn't cut it. Hence our portfolio averages more than 9% and we generally target a minimum 6%-7% from our investments. But occasionally, just occasionally, we break the mold. The reason we do this is because sometimes investments that have extraordinary capital appreciation potential, do not necessarily come with big yields. If our research uncovers these and we do not pass them on to you, we would be doing you a big disservice.Many of our readers will remember our recommendation of iStar (STAR) which has a low common yield but massive upside potential.We have since sold out of STAR in our portfolio, capturing profits and moving on. Today, we see another opportunity too good to pass up to add a little capital appreciation to your income portfolio. Opportunities like this provide fuel for members to catch up on their portfolio size if they haven't saved as much as desired before they retired.The true massive upside opportunities in markets happen when stock price and cash flow have gone in opposite directions for some time. An improving cash flow and free cash flow profile coupled with a general disenchantment for a stock is the best place to find truly extraordinary values. We think we have possibly the best such investment today.Imperial Oil Limited (IMO) is one of the best examples of where the stock market's obsession with growth and disdain for value has been personified. The company is majority owned and controlled by Exxon Mobil (XOM) and has a long rich history. Today, it's extremely hard to find stocks in our universe which have the balance sheet strength and upside potential of IMO, alongside exceptionally low risk.Note: IMO trades with the same symbol on the NYSE and TSX (Toronto) stock exchanges. Amounts in the article reference Canadian dollars. The free cash flow yield is of course the same, whether looked at in CAD or USD. IMO has a diverse array of assets in Canada that span every step of the energy chain.Source: Imperial Oil Q3-2019 presentationWhile it gets attention for its upstream assets, IMO has refineries, chemical production and gas stations that complement its oil production.Source: Imperial Oil AGM PresentationThe integration creates a synergy where the whole is significantly better than the sum of its parts.Source: Imperial Oil Q3-2019 presentationThis synergy can be best seen in the average cash flow produced over the last 10 years.Source: Imperial Oil AGM PresentationIn times of higher crude oil prices, the upstream kicks in and the opposite happens when prices are low. While the integrated model is nothing new, what sets IMO apart from the ultra large XOM and other energy giants is the very low sustaining costs. That low cost alongside the compressed valuation is what make IMO an excellent play today.One of the key reasons that IMO has the lowest sustaining costs in the world is because they have all the reserves they will ever need. IMO is set to produce about 149 million barrels in 2020 (407,000 barrels of oil a day). It currently has 2P reserves of near 6.5 billion BOE. That calculates to a reserve life index of 44 years.Source: Imperial Oil Q3-2019 presentationThis is in stark contrast to the other E&P plays in US which have to constantly spend tons of cash on exploration and development. Having the resources at its feet makes a world of difference in cash flow.IMO's downstream assets are top notch and the refining capacity is almost identical to its upstream production.Source: Imperial Oil Q3-2019 presentationIn 2019, IMO so far produced $3.4 billion CAD in cash flow. We expect the forward run rate in 2020 to be closer to $1.3 billion CAD a quarter, or $5.2 billion CAD annually (at $62 USD WTI oil). What makes IMO such a fantastic investment is that it will require just $1.0-$1.1 billion CAD of that to maintain production and sustain its assets. In other words, we expect around $4.0 billion CAD of free cash flow before growth projects. That translates into a 15.24% free cash flow yield. Data by YChartsOn the downside, IMO can fully fund its dividend and sustaining capex at prices as low as $30/barrel. While IMO is investing in small growth and efficiency projects, it's sending a lot of that free cash flow to shareholders.IMO returned almost 75% of free cash flow to shareholders via dividends and buybacks in 2019. Now the dividend is currently small and the dividend yield does appear paltry. But we want to stress that many high-yield investors DRIP their dividends anyway by buying more shares. Here the company is doing that for you. IMO is doing this not by increasing your shares, but by reducing shares outstanding and thus increasing the value of your shares.Source: Imperial Oil Q3-2019 presentationSince the end of Q3-2019, IMO has retired another 1.5% of shares (source company filings). They also are raising the payout, although it's still on the small side. We expect that this will grow at a minimum 10% rate every year from here on out.Source: Imperial Oil Q3-2019 presentationMost of the high-yield investments we bring to you lack an investment grade rating or at the lowest rungs of that rating system. We don't see that as necessarily bad as many smaller companies do not bother to try and get a debt rating due to its cost. However, we do want to bring your attention to the extraordinary rating that IMO possesses. At AA+, IMO stands apart from all other oil companies and that is due to rating agencies recognizing the same capital discipline we do.Source: Imperial Oil Q3-2019 presentationThere are two things that make this a perfect setup. The first is that IMO is trading at a lower price than when oil reached $25/barrel and sports the lowest price to operating cash flow ratio we have seen.Data by YChartsThe second is that lack of Canadian pipelines being built means that IMO is just being forced to buy back shares and raise dividends vs. investing for growth. Finally, while we have calculated returns at $62/barrel oil for WTI, we expect much higher prices as capex has been abysmal for the past few years outside of shale and that will create a strong bull market.IMO has so much cash gushing into its coffers that it really has no choice but to return it to shareholders. But, beyond that, it might be tempted to make an acquisition with its cash. One company that could use an overhaul (and access to superior IMO management) is MEG Energy (OTCPK:MEGEF). MEG has been rumored to be a target for some time and its oil sands would fit really well with IMO's assets. MEG almost did get taken over in 2018 as Husky Energy (OTCPK:HUSKF) made a bid for buying it. The widening of heavy oil differentials in late 2018 alongside MEG's reluctance to accept the bid ultimately led to demise of the deal.Source: Financial PostWhile we put the probabilities of a buyout at less than 50%, we don't see a moderate premium deal as negative for IMO. There are a few reasons for this. For starters, MEG is burdened with debt. While that may sound negative, we like it as even if IMO pays a premium on the equity, it will be paying a rather small premium on the enterprise value.Data by YChartsSo for example, if IMO paid a 40% premium on the stock price, it would be just equivalent to an 18% premium on the enterprise value. The second and more important reason is that MEG holds some rather massive tax loss pools.Source: MEG Energy PresentationThese would become part of IMO's tax base and IMO free cash flow would ultimately be even higher. Any ""overpayment"" by IMO would be recovered several fold over as it used up those tax loss pools.Our conservative ""target price"" for IMO (or fair value price) is at $35/share, or roughly 32% upside from here, without counting the dividends.IMO's free cash flow yield dwarfs the actual yield of 9.5% on our HDO portfolio. Only two companies in the world have balance sheets rated AAA. IMO holds the next highest debt rating. This is an ultra-high quality player that will supply dividend growth and capital appreciation for the next decade. Patient dividend growth investors are getting one of the best opportunities of a lifetime and they should grab it with both hands.Thanks for reading!

4222204,21702,2018-11-14T14:40:23-05:00,"Imperial Oil, which is majority owned by Exxon, has decided to move ahead with ""Aspen,"" a 75,000 bpd, C$2.6 billion oil sands project.This decision was a big surprise considering the lack of pipeline exit capacity that has WCS trading at a $44/bbl discount to WTI.It looked to be worse of a decision after a federal Judge subsequently dealt the Keystone-XL pipeline another blow.Meantime, oil prices have crashed as President Trump backtracked on the Iran sanctions by giving waivers to Iran's top-eight customers.There are very good reasons why no oil sands projects have been green-lighted since 2013. Aspen shouldn't have either.","Imperial Oil (IMO) recently announced plans to move forward with the C$2.6 billion, 75,000 bpd, ""Aspen"" oil sands project. As most of you know, Imperial is an oil sands producer as well as the largest refiner in Canada and sells its gasoline under the Esso and Exxon brands. IMO is also majority owned by Exxon Mobil (XOM). As an Exxon shareholder, I could only let out a deep sigh when I heard the Aspen news. Here's why.As all of you no doubt know, due to a lack of pipeline exit capacity, WCS is currently trading at a massive $44/bbl discount to WTI, and the discount doesn't look a whole lot better all the way out to April of next year ($30/bbl+):Source: CME FuturesPhillips 66 (PSX), the largest importer of oil sands, expects the WCS/WTI differential to be a positive catalyst (i.e. a wide differential) until the 2H of 2019. I wrote about this issue back in December of last year (see Woe Canada!) when the discount was a ""mere"" $24.55/bbl. It's obviously gotten much worse - much of it due to Suncor Energy's (NYSE:SU) new Fort Hills oil sands project. Fort Hills came online earlier this year and in Q3 produced an average 128,300 bpd.That's an additional 128,300 bpd of production that needs to be cleared via a pipeline system that was already chock full. So as producers struggled to find exit capacity via rail or even truck, the WCS differential to WTI totally blew out. Not surprisingly, WCS is simply dirt cheap these days. Note that WTI closed today at $55.66/bbl. Tacking on the discount, that means WCS is trading around $12/bbl. Incredible. Woe Canada! is right.Now, to be sure, IMO recently delivered a very strong Q3 EPS report - recording $749 million in earnings, roughly double the year-earlier quarter. Gross production at the Kearl Oil Sands project was 244,000 bpd - 20% (or 41,000 bpd) higher than the previous record. Not surprisingly, and like PSX, downstream refining delivered very strong results with quarterly earnings of $502 million. Refining throughput averaged 388,000 bpd and petroleum product sales averaged 516,000 bpd - the highest quarterly sales in nearly 30 years.But if we look at IMO's production profile in Q3, we can see that the company's refining throughput in the quarter (388,000 bpd) was nicely matched by its own oil production along with its share of joint ventures - a total of 371,000 bpd:Source: Q3 EPS ReportThe point being: Why add another 75,000 bpd of oil sands production only to either:A) Sell it into a glut of oil sands production at terribly low prices orB) Add more refining capacity in order to profit off the refining margin.In either case, one could question management's thinking here. And if the refining segment needed more feedstock, why not save the C$2.6 billion in cap-ex and just go out onto the market and purchase it at a deeply discounted price? Heck, Phillips 66 imports about 500,000 bpd - most by pipeline - and some of IMO's refineries sit right on top of the oil sands production, a big advantage for IMO.Imperial President, Chairman and CEO Rich Kruger seemed to acknowledge all the issues when he said in the press release:The ""right time?"" What?!As if the Western Canadian pipeline exit capacity issue wasn't enough to dissuade new oil sands greenfield investments, subsequent events further exposed management's flawed thinking here. While oil sands producers are hoping (praying?) that Enbridge's mainline expansion projects will actually go in-service in the second half of 2019, there also was hope that TransCanada's (NYSE:TRP) Keystone-XL pipeline would rise from the dead. But -XL was dealt yet another setback last Thursday when a judge in Montana halted construction on the grounds that the U.S. government did not complete a full analysis of the environmental impact of the project. Oh boy.Meantime, the bottom has just fell out of the price of oil due to President Trump backtracking on previously announced plans to put sanctions on Iranian oil. That initial sanctions announcement (and some presidential tweets...) caused Saudi Arabia and other oil producers to ramp up production to make up for the lost Iranian barrels. Then, Trump backtracked and issued waivers for Iran's top eight customers. Now there's a glut and OPEC is running around trying to figure out how to cut supply again. Meantime, the bottom has dropped out of both Brent and WTI, both of which are firmly in bear territory and down over 20% in a matter of weeks after hitting four-year highs:Source: BloombergBut of course many analysts already were expecting a weak oil market next year as pipelines from the Permian to the Gulf Coast come online and will deliver over a million bpd of new production onto the global oil market.I think Aspen is a big mistake and I hope Exxon takes control here and cancels the project before the C$2.6 billion is spent. Yet I could be totally wrong. Note that, just today, respected energy analyst Paul Cheng raised IMO to overweight saying the company has reached an ""important inflection point"" of improving operating and financial momentum. I would agree the company appears to have reached an inflection point in Q3.But I would say that subsequent events have put that inflection point into question. There's a reason that Exxon management was asked this question by analyst Rob West of Redburn on the Q3 conference call:In general, Exxon seems to be going on a spending spree while its peers are remaining disciplined. Recent events show why the peers were right and Exxon is wrong. While I can certainly understand and agree with Exxon investing and indeed - fast-tracking - its massive Guyana discoveries, the decision to move forward on Aspen is a big mistake. In my opinion, it's C$2.6 billion that could otherwise have been paid out to Exxon and Imperial shareholders in the form of dividends. Considering Exxon's stock has done nothing in 10 years, those shareholders needed something to cheer about.Meantime, I would avoid shares of Imperial Oil. Aspen is a project that should not have been green-lighted. Hopefully, IMO and Exxon will come to their senses and cancel this project before another dime is spent on it.Source: Yahoo Finance"

It is Canada's largest refiner of petroleum products and a leading marketer of fuels, lubricants, asphalts and specialty products.By revenues, downstream constitutes 71% of total revenues, followed by upstream segment (25%) and chemicals segment (4%).Imperial has a presence in both upstream and downstream parts of the value chain. In the upstream part, it owns and operates some of the best oil sands in Canada. Its Cold Lake operations is one of the largest in-situ operations in the world, whereas Kearl is considered as one of Canada's highest-quality oil sands deposits.In the downstream part, the company operates 400 kbd of refining capacity in strategically located refineries. Imperial's Sarnia and Strathcona are amongst the largest integrated refining capacities in Canada. In addition, the company also operates a profitable polyethylene business. Imperial Oil enjoys nationwide leadership across the entire value chain. Source: Imperial's Investor Day ReportFounded in 1880, Imperial Oil has a deep experience of operating in diverse geological and geographical environments, and has witnessed several ups and down cycles in the oil industry. This long-standing experience enhances the company's resilience in combating volatile and tough times in the energy industry.Since Imperial has a presence in both upstream and downstream parts of the value chain, it is less vulnerable to volatility in the energy sector and is in a position to better capture the synergies arising through integrated manufacturing and marketing activities.Imperial operates through a well-diversified asset base of upstream, downstream and chemical assets, consisting of high-quality oil sand deposits, large refining capacities and an extensive pipelines network. The company is working towards increasing the annual production of its Kearl mines, Aspen in-situ project and Cold Lake expansion projects, which should drive top line growth.Its Esso and Mobil are popular brands across Canada. Popularity of Imperial's products can be measured by the fact that the company manufactures and sells about one-fourth of the petroleum products used by Canadians everyday. It is an industry leader in research & technology, having invested more than billions in R&D over decades. The company is further enhancing its portfolio by focusing on highest-value assets and core competencies.Ownership of long-life, quality upstream assets, strategically positioned refineries, strong logistics and leading brands are strong competitive advantages of Imperial. The company also stands a good chance to benefit from the rising demand of oil and gas, which is estimated to increase 25% by 2040. Source: Imperial's Investor Day ReportImperial Oil has a century-old history of making consecutive dividend payments to stockholders. The company has been increasing its dividends for the last 24 years in a row. It returned more than $1 billion to shareholders through share purchases and dividends in the last year and around $2 billion this year.The company has compounded dividends at a rate of 6.5% for the last 10 years. The last dividend raise was 18.8%. Imperial also has a share buyback plan and has repurchased 50% of shares since 1995. The company further extended its buyback plan in 2017.Imperial's upstream assets have a proved reserve life of more than three decades, generating over $17 billion in the last ten years. It is estimated that Imperial Kearl mines could alone help meet North America's energy needs for the next four decades. The company is further targeting a 15% overall production growth through FY 2020, on the back of sustained production at Cold Lake, improved reliability at Syncrude, ramp-up of Norman Wells and supplemental crusher at Kearl.Imperial is a subsidiary of Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), which holds a 70% stake in the company. A strong parent adds to Imperial's financial strength and improves access to cheap capital sources. Imperial generated strong cash generation in each of the Upstream, Downstream and Chemicals businesses throughout the year. It is expecting between $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion in capital expenditure for the ongoing year. Strong technical expertise and efficient operations make it a leader in core markets of Ontario and western regions.Given the company's sound balance sheet and strong future production projection, Imperial Oil should comfortably continue its dividend growth streak going forward.After the oil price downturn, many large energy companies like Royal Dutch Shell (RDS.A, RDS.B), Total SA (NYSE:TOT) and ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) sold their oil sands deposits. Suncor Energy (NYSE:SU), which is the largest oil producer in Canada and derives a majority of its revenues from its oil sand business is Imperial's largest competitor. Canadian Natural Resources (NYSE:CNQ) also holds some of the best oil sands assets in North America, particularly thermal in-situ properties. Cenovus Energy (NYSE:CVE) is a large integrated oil & gas company based in Canada. The company got a boost after the acquisition of most of ConocoPhillips' operations in Western Canada, which almost doubled its oil sands production. Source: Imperial's Investor Day ReportImperial Oil should leverage its leading position in the Canadian oil sands industry to benefit from the rising demand for oil and gas. The company's large scale of operations, integration across the value chains, ownership of well-known brands and a strong parentage should allow it to grow profitably in the future without much risk. A payout of just 25% and strong cash flows should provide enough room for future dividend growth.I would prefer to hold Exxon Mobil as a long-term holding, but if the US dollar exchange rate is a barrier, Imperial could be a proxy, though I prefer Suncor as a Canadian oil producer, as it passes my Chowder Test.Disclosure: Please note that I may have a position in one or many of the holdings listed.

4255510,102137,2019-04-20T01:19:48-04:00,Canadian Dividend All-Stars are companies that have raised dividends for at least five consecutive years.Imperial Oil is the lone All-Star expected to raise dividends.The company's stock is gaining momentum and also appears undervalued.,"It has been a quiet number of weeks of late. Although there have been Canadian Dividend All-Stars that have reported, none announced a dividend increase. This week however there is one All-Star that is expected to raise dividends. It should kick start what is expected to be the start of a very busy few weeks. Of note, all figures are in Canadian dollars unless otherwise noted.Imperial Oil (NYSEMKT:IMO) [TSX:IMO]What can investors expect: Imperial Oil is one of Canada's best dividend growth stocks and is on the verge of reaching 25 consecutive years of dividend growth. As a dual-listed stock, it will also join the coveted list of U.S. Dividend Champions. Since 2016, the company has raised dividends at the end of April along with first-quarter results.Last year, Imperial Oil deviated from historical trends and raised dividends by $0.03 per share, or 18.75%. This was well above historical averages and in line with strong raises across the industry. Will the company's raise be higher than historical averages this time around?It would not surprise me. The company has a low payout ratio (high 20s) and, as such, has plenty of room for growth. Likewise, Suncor (NYSE:SU) [TSX:SU], the only other All-Star from the Oil & Gas Integrated industry, announced a better-than-expected raise earlier this year.Why is this relevant? Imperial Oil and Suncor tend to trend in the same direction when it comes to dividend increases. As such, I'm estimating a similar result for Imperial Oil.As a bonus, here is a chart from F.A.S.T. Graphs which signifies that the company may be undervalued.I chose to look at the company's valuation as compared to operating cash flow. Earnings in the industry tend to be more volatile and less reliable. In looking at the chart above, one can see that Imperial Oil hasn't been this cheap as compared to cash flow in a number of years.As you can see, the company tends to trade near historical OCF valuations. As such, the company looks attractive at today's levels. Imperial Oil is up 10% year to date, and has been building momentum. There are currently 11 buy signals against 1 sell when looking at the company's moving average technicals."

(NYSEMKT:IMO), I laid out how after its Q2 2016 report, the company had not only become the only major Canadian energy company with a positive forward P/E ratio, but that same P/E ratio had become unreasonable at 74.50 on the TSX and 47.94 on the NYSE. Fast forward to today, and fresh of the release of its Q3 2016 report, Imperial's forward P/E ratio has skyrocketed again to 112.29 on the TSX and 78.36 on the NYSE.Now, we must find out if this star-gazing P/E ratio is justifiable or a warning sign, to do so let's take a look at Imperial's Q3 2016 report. Right off the top, revenues and other income in Q3 improved to C$7.44 billion from C$7.15 billion last year, this helps to offset the decline in revenues during Q2 2016, which dropped to C$6.24 billion from C$7.3 billion. The higher revenues came from a 10,000 barrels per day average increase in petroleum sales which totaled 505,000 bbl/d. Production of gross oil equivalent barrels per day in the quarter came in at an average of 393,000 boe per day, up from 386,000 boe per day.It should be noted that the bulk of the increased production came from increased natural gas production, which reached 135,000 boe per day from 116,000 boe per day, and from higher production from Syncrude which reached 85,000 boe per day from 59,000 boe per day. While Imperial's Cold Lake and Kearl operations both had decreases in production in the quarter, the company attributes these declines to maintenance. On a positive note though, Imperial's refinery capacity rose 4% to 97% during the quarter showing that the energy industry is back to normal operations following the rough spring and early summer.The Esso shuffleWhen we get to the bottom line numbers over at Imperial, this is where things begin to get interesting. In Q3 2016, net income rose to C$1 billion (C$1.18 per share) for the first time in two years, eclipsing the C$479 million (C$0.56 per share) generated during the same period last year. For context, in Q2 2016, net income fell to a loss of C$181 million from a gain of C$120 million.At face value, this looks like a massive turnaround for the oil company, that is until we see the source of this sudden increase to profits - the sale of its Esso retail locations. This drastic and contentious move to sell off the remainder of its corporately-owned Esso retail gas stations and convenience stores generated C$2.8 billion for the company. In doing so, Imperial dismantled the last of its network of 497 corporately-owned retail gas operations, and sold it to buyers such as Parkland Fuel (OTCPK:PKIUF)(who also received 80 On the Run/Marché Express convenience stores), Alimentation Couche-Tard (OTCPK:ANCUF) and 7-Eleven Canada.This affected net income in Q3 2016 as it added C$716 million to Imperial's net income, putting this return to C$1 billion net income territory in a completely different light.SourceSo far this C$716 million gain from the sale of its corporate Esso stores has only helped to increase year-to-date net income to C$721 million from the C$1.02 billion the company was at by this time last year. Again, with the sale of the corporate stores and the Fort McMurray shut down, this was an unusual year for the company, which makes the triple-digit P/E ratio even more confusing to some.This is highlighted in that Imperial's Upstream operations still posted a net loss in the quarter of C$26 million; still, this is an improvement over the C$52 million net loss incurred by the Upstream operations in Q3 2015. Year-to-date Upstream operations have posted a net loss of C$764 million, and is in a worse position than where it was by this time in 2015, when it was only at a net loss of C$415 million. This is thanks to year-to-date operating revenues in this segment falling to C$3.69 billion from C$4.46 billion, and C$155 million in losses attributed to the forest fires.When the sale of the retail Esso stations is excluded, Imperial generated an adjusted net income of C$0.34 per share, which did manage to exceed analyst predictions of C$0.31 per share. In order to maintain these levels of profits, Imperial has also dramatically cut its capital and exploration expenditure budget. In Q3 2016, capital expenditures fell to C$205 million from C$1.14 billion, and year-to-date capital and exploration expenditures fell to C$948 million from C$3.01 billion. This drop is believed to be in part due to pressure from its parent company Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE:XOM) (which owns 69.6% of Imperial) to lower costs as it deals with its own issues in the energy sector.A shooting starCurrently, the average price targets leave a varying degree of potential depending on which side of the border you are living on. The average price target on the TSX is currently at C$45.31, but carries a range of C$45.00 to C$50.00. On the NYSE, the average price target has a healthy amount of growth potential at C$32.63 with a top end of $50.00. There is still a slight possibility to generate some short-term returns with Imperial, but its crumbling Upstream operations and a low dividend will keep many investors from making a big long-term play at the moment. This, in turn, opens up the possibility that Canada's largest oil company Suncor Energy Inc. (NYSE:SU) as being perhaps the better option for those looking to go long in one of the larger energy companies in Canada. The soaring forward P/E ratio for Imperial should be seen as a sign that this company has become greatly overvalued, and while I'm not calling for a crash in the stock price, there are other better alternatives for those looking for consistent growth with better dividends.Author's note: If you enjoyed this article and found it helpful, please ""Follow"" me on Seeking Alpha to receive notification whenever I publish a new article.You may also be interested in other recent articles I have written for Seeking Alpha with my Canadian point of view that focus on stocks and stories that I have found compelling.

4074823,56212,2017-05-19T15:23:46-04:00,"Imperial Oil Corp is a rationally integrated enterprise -- assessing any given business segment in isolation ignore synergies which are especially important during the lower half of the commodities cycle.The upstream business segment, by far the largest in terms of capital investment, is heavily exposed to Canadian oil sands projects which are marginal in the current commodity prices environment.Yet, records profits from the downstream and chemical business segments demonstrate how they have benefited from cost advantaged feeds.In the current commodity price environment, IMO's common shares are likely fairly valued $22 to $32 per share; there is significant uncertainty in that estimate.Given non-compelling valuation and risks, I do not hold the equity outright. However, I believe that call options may provide favorable risk-reward characteristics given their leverage to crude oil prices.","ForwardThis article is the second installment of Drilling for Value. This series' intent is to uncover instances of probable mis-pricings which are conducive to long and/or short investment theses. But if nothing else, I intend to report when no inefficiencies are apparent.This simple seeming endeavor has proven itself to be more troublesome than I had originally imagined since oil prices began to tank as of late 2014. I found that markets were more efficient and resilient than I had originally perceived.A more thorough introduction to the series as well as technical gouge on valuation methodologies are contained within the series' first installment on Cenovus Energy (NYSE:CVE). The main thrust of it is that I have learned to eschew reserve-based estimates as proxies for fair value, instead opting for an independent methodology. S&P Capital IQ's white paper, Drilling for Alpha, demonstrates the inutility of reserve-based proxies of fair value as a means of anticipating future equity returns.Summary of Investment ThesisI assess the fair value of Imperial Oil's (NYSEMKT:IMO) common stock to be in the range of $22 to $32 per share, with a point estimate of about $29, assuming that the present fair value of WTI is $50 per barrel. At the current market price of $29 per share, the common shares are well within their fair value range. Yet, this estimate is particularly sensitive to even a slight change in commodity prices, suggesting that common shares are a levered bet on commodity prices. Although I do not believe that the common stock is a necessarily bargain at current prices, I believe that long-dated call options could provide a significantly more favorable risk-reward profile.The wide margin of error in the estimate of IMO's fair value is attributable to low netbacks. IMO's oil sands operations are quintessentially ""marginal"". With WTI at $50 per barrel, per barrel upstream operating netbacks are in the range of $2.50 to $3.25, meaning that a small change in either commodity prices and/or price inputs can be expected to exert a disproportionately large change in cash flows. Furthermore, the rather meager netbacks do not offset the maintenance capital spending of $85,000-$120,000 Boe/d, implying upstream cash flows will remain negative at constant production rates and at current commodities prices. The temptation to extrapolate on marginal production and globally efficient oil prices is almost irresistible.The firm's well-integrated downstream footprint more than compensates for this spending shortfall, though -- a testament to the benefits of rational vertical integration. The net effect of integration allows IMO's upstream operations to sell at advantaged prices while purchasing inputs, such a diluent, also at advantaged prices. A complimentary view is that because Imperial's refineries can purchase cost-advantaged feeds from upstream operations, downstream margins are abnormally and sustainably inflated. For well-integrated companies like Imperial, I believe it's an error to consider the value of any given business segment in isolation, especially during the lower half of the commodity price cycle.That said, the stock's estimated fair value is extremely dependent on factors largely outside of the firm's control. Should upstream cost structures continue to improve and/or should commodities prices recover, the stock should enjoy disproportionate upside. The downside, however, kicks in fairly quickly. All things held equal, I believe that IMO bleeds equity should WTI drop much below $50 per barrel.For this reason, I do not have a long position in the equity outright. This risk-reward profile of common shares outright is neutral at best. Although the company has significant upside gearing, and may be decent speculation to those who are bullish on crude prices and/or WTI-WCS spreads, I am a devout agnostic with regard to commodity price forecasts.Yet, I do currently have a position in long-dated calls. The company's prospects are an almost binary outcome on commodities prices, which suggests that long-dated call options likely possess similar downside risks as the equity but with much greater leverage on the upside. The downsides risks of such a position are a likely loss of principal.Business OverviewFigure 1: Imperial's Scope of OperationsImage source: Imperial Oil Corp. Corporate Overview - Winter-Spring 2017. pg. 5.Imperial Oil Limited is a subsidiary of Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM). The firm operates as an integrated oil company based out of Calgary, Canada. The firm reports in three segments: upstream, downstream, and chemicals. The company also has a significant midstream and retail footprints. Imperial's core strategy is to develop, operate, and integrate large-base, long-lived petroleum resources. Assessing any of the business segments in isolation ignores the synergies provided by vertical integration.Oil Sands in FocusFigure 2: Imperial Upstream FootprintImage source: Imperial Oil Corp. Corporate Overview - Winter-Spring 2017. pp. 15-16.Imperial's upstream operations are heavily weighted in oil sands and heavy oil upgrading projects. In 2016, the firm grossed 386 mboe/d in upstream production. Interests include a 71% working interest (WI) in Kearl oil sands, 100% WI in Cold Lake oil sands, and a 25% equity stake in the Syncrude upgrading project. Aspen, located north of Fort McMurray, is expected to become the company's next major growth platform. Imperial has submitted an operating permit to the Alberta regulators. First production from Aspen is expected to earlier than 2020. Neither Kearl nor Aspen have booked any proved reserves as of FY 2016.In the current commodity price environment, the firm's upstream footprint can be described as marginal, yet it provides significant gearing to commodity price upside if oil prices or differential improve. Assuming WCS-WTI spreads remain elevated to around C$13 per barrel, and WTI spot prices remain near the $50 per barrel handle, I believe that company's all-in realized selling price of around $31.25 per Boe will results operating netbacks of $2.00 to $4.50 per barrel. WTI averaged $46.25 per barrel in 2016, during which the company eked out netbacks of $1.33 per Boe.Although Imperial's upstream operations might be marginal in the current price environment, oil sands extraction has benefited disproportionately from efficiency gains during the recent downturn versus off-shore and on-shore conventional extraction.Unlike with tight oil and gas (i.e., shale) -- where decline rates kick in very quickly and service provider margins are sensitive to business activity -- efficiency gains in oil sands are likely to persist and compound throughout the cycle. Imperial is likely to be at the forefront of the technological curve; the company spends heavily in R&D (C$195 in 2016), and also benefits from its relationship with technology leader, Exxon Mobil. For example, Imperial's upstream operations are expected benefit from efficiency gains in solvent technologies which are further expected to increase recovery, lower transportation costs, and reduce greenhouse gas (NYSE:GHG) intensities going forward. For low-margin, high-volume operations, a small improvement in cost savings often determines the difference between the winners and losers.Figure 3: Solvent Technologies  Image source: Imperial Oil Corp. Corporate Overview - Winter-Spring 2017. pp. 15-16.Midstream and Downstream IntegrationI am fully committed to the idea that rational integration within a commodity value chain provides an enormous competitive advantage. Simply put, there are more ways for integrated business models to succeed, whereas non-integrated companies must focus ruthlessly on cost in order to create value throughout the cycle. The ability to cut out the middle-man creates more profit opportunities which respond differently to changes in the underlying economic environment. Still, it is possible for a company to be irrationally integrated (i.e., through diversified operations that provide no synergies and/or detract from core competency/focus). Previous SA articles provide more color on this view.To that end, I believe that Imperial is a marvelously well-integrated enterprise.The company's midstream exposure helps the upstream achieve more competitive differentials, and connects its refining and chemical operations with retail channels. The company owns and operates natural gas liquids and products pipelines in Alberta, Manitoba and Ontario, owns and operates the Edmonton Rail Terminal (210 mboe/d capacity), and has interests in the capital stock of one crude oil and two products pipeline companies. The company also engages in volume commitments with third-party logistics providers.The importance of integrated midstream operations is especially relevant to oil sand operations. In order to move crude to refineries, operators blend bitumen with natural gas condensates (or other very light hydrocarbons). The resultant product, known as ""dilbit"" (diluent + bitumen), trades as a heavy oil equivalent. The planned build out of a diluent recovery unit at the Strathcona refinery is expected to enhance the company's ability to source cost-advantaged diluents, thereby providing a significant competitive edge versus non-integrated operators.Imperial's downstream operations consist of three refineries, one chemical plant, and about 1,700 affiliated Esso retail outlets. According to Oil & Gas Journal 2016 refining survey, its refineries have a combined nameplate crude distillation capacity of about 421,500 boe/d, with an aggregate Nelson Complexity of 9.57. In terms typical North American complexity, these refineries rank about average. With the exception of the Sarnia chemical complex, these downstream asset are fine-tuned to maximize throughputs of fuels, notably destined for Mobil and Esso retail outlets.In 2016, the refineries ran at a combined 86% utilization rate, which is well below the three-average of about 90%. In the 2016 10-k, management attributed the decrease in throughput to turnarounds. In spite of this, the downstream and chemicals division produced record earnings; C$3,833 MM (~$2875 MM USD) EBITDA in 2016.Cyclically strong downstream earnings conform to the narrative that Imperial's downstream and chemical segment source 100% cost-advantaged feeds. Notably, the company's average downstream throughput of around 380 barrels per day is commensurate with the company's barrel equivalent production volumes. As evidenced by the operating results, the ability to buy and sell commodity inputs at advantaged prices translates into an enormous competitive advantage, especially during the lower half of the commodities price cycle in which higher refining profits blunt the impact. Also notable is that the company's refineries are beneficially located between upstream operations and the major population centers.Figure 4: Imperial Downstream and Chemical Portfolio  Image source: Imperial Oil Corp. Corporate Overview - Winter-Spring 2017. pg. 48.Imperial markets most of its petroleum products under the Esso and Mobil brands through approximately 1,700 Esso retail service stations. The company divested itself of company-owned retail outlets for C$2.8 Bn in 2016, but maintains the branded wholesaler model where independent owners agree to operate retail sites in alignment with Esso brand standards. The divestiture was likely motivated by the present-day tendency for the market to value parts more than the whole. If so, such a decision is likely to have ceded a long-term pricing advantage for short-term gain.Upstream ValuationMy independent evaluation of the company's upstream assets indicates that -- at $50 per barrel WTI -- aggregated estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) of developed and undeveloped reservoirs is in the range of 7.1 Bn to 8.8 Bn barrels of oil equivalent, with an after-tax net present value of $15.3 to $32.3 Bn. The wide margin of error in this estimate of fair value is attributable to narrow operating margins and uncertain cost inputs. A small variance in pricing and/or cost inputs elicits a disproportionately large expected change in economic recovery and its net present value.I believe that the company's proved reserve volume estimates and corresponding estimate of net present value disclosed in its 2016 10-k are neither representative of the firm's actual resource base nor its fair value. In 2016, the company booked just 1,382 MM Boe in proved reserves -- valued at just $2.06 Bn, according SEC's Standardized Measure (roughly equivalent to PV-10). Notably, the company's Kearl oil sands operation, even though it has been a major growth platform, booked no proved reserves in 2016. However, according to the corporate presentation, the company internally books 6.1 Bn barrels of oil equivalent in proved+probable (2P) reserves, with an even larger recoverable resource base.Figure 5: Imperial's Resource Base  Image source: Imperial Oil Corp. Corporate Overview - Winter-Spring 2017. pg. 28.The following passage from page 82 of the 2016 10-k corroborates this position regarding SEC fair value estimates:Compounded subtleties further drive a wedge between disclosure and reality. The estimation and valuation of reserves is an immensely interesting and quite convoluted topic.Yet it suffices at least that the cost-basis for upstream assets should provide a better representation of the assets' actual economic value, albeit at somewhat manipulated historical cost bases. My internally generated estimate of fair value aligns more closely with upstream net capitalized costs of $23.6 Bn as of 2016. Management's discussion and analysis corroborates this position. Successful efforts accounting rules compel management to impair an asset if/when its undiscounted cash flows are less than the asset group's carrying value. Yet, an internal ""assessment indicated that Imperial's major asset groups have future undiscounted cash flow estimates exceeding carrying values"" (see FASB's ASC 932-360 and ASC 360-10 for more information on impairment tests).Note: my assessment of economic resource potential infers production volumes and fair values using decline curve analyses and economic limits. This discounted cash flow estimate was prepared under the continuous risk-neutral measure assuming WTI is fairly valued at $50 per barrel. In doing so, the point estimate captures both upside and downside risk dynamics due to commodity price variability.[See attachment for a detailed breakout.]Downstream and Chemicals Segments ValuationViewing Imperial's remaining assets as simply a means by which the company improves its price realizations and costs advantages greatly simplifies the analysis; much value-add is already realized in upstream reporting.Based on the refineries' complexity-barrel (""equivalent distillation"") capacity, regional crude differentials and crack spreads (i.e., margins), and capacity utilizations, I have upwardly revised the downstream and chemicals segments from a carrying value of $1,769 MM to a fair value of $3,540 MM. The 123% increase is actually quite modest due to the manner in which the assets are rationally vertically integrated. Had I considered abnormally high margin capture rates due to integrated upstream and retail operations, the fair value estimate would exceed $10 Bn. Indeed, applying a modest 4-5x multiple on the downstream and chemical segments' combined 2016 EBITDA of $2875 MM would yield much greater fair value estimates.Considering the disparity, one might conclude that integration allows the downstream segment to purchases advantaged crude feeds at abnormally low prices without exerting a negative impact on upstream price realizations. This is just another anecdote which I feel vindicates the view that integrated businesses should be assessed holistically.Summary of ValuationThe following crib sheets and economic balance sheet summarize the economic reassessments. Certain assets and liabilities, such as those relating to tax liabilities and contingent liabilities, have been omitted in order to recognize that some accounting entries are simply there to appease lawyers and tax collectors.Figure 6: Economic Resource Report, side A  sources: multiple; author's estimatesFigure 7: Economic Resource Report, side A  sources: multiple; author's estimatesTable 1: Imperial Oil Corporation - Economic Book Value (2017Q1)  sources: multiple; author's estimatesDiscussionAs I mentioned earlier, the temptation to abstract globally based on firm-specific analysis is tempting. If IMO's oil sands operations are generally representative of typical marginal global oil production, and netbacks are still slightly above break-even, then one can conclude that its cost structure is representative of globally efficient prices over the intermediate term. IMO existing supply cost is about $50 per barrel WTI; its sustaining cost is around $65 per barrel.Wood Mackenzie's 2020 cost curve estimate corroborates that Imperial's upstream cost structure is typical of marginal production at $50 WTI. Production from oil sands is considered to be an important resource in meeting expected future demand, especially as legacy resources draw down. Notably, costs has come down significantly during the downturn due in part to lower cost inputs and operating efficiencies.Figure 9: Wood Mackenzie's 10 Year Cost Curve for Pre-Final Investment Decision (NASDAQ:FID) ProjectsSource: Wood Mac1kenzie. 70% of pre-FID oil projects commercial at US$60/bbl.Since oil is a globally traded -- and is, for all intents, fungible -- commodity, global oil prices are fairly valued at the marginal barrel of oil production. The marginal barrel is the one which barely earns enough profit to motivate its owner to keep producing. To understand this, it is helpful to consider how if supply and demand are not matched, supply build-ups and draw-downs would lead to volatility, then arbitrage, and then a new equilibrium. The new equilibrium is determined by the last barrel of oil produced which is required to sate current demand. Any other price is too dangerous to quote for an extended period of time. Generally, any price which does not result in arbitrage can be considered efficient.Importantly, though, assets with depleting resource bases may be efficiently priced in any range within the marginal cost of existing production and the all-in sustaining cost of replacing depleted reservoirs.Figure 8: Petroleum Supply-Demand EquilibriaSource: authorGiven modest depletion rates of its resources, companies like Imperial can underinvest for years on end without feeling the pinch of disequilibria. Generally, large petroleum projects take years to develop, and when they all come online at once, it can takes several years for the market to balance itself back to mid-cycle prices. As long as cash flows are positive going forward, producers will continue to produce (even projects which lose money over their lifetimes often keep producing). In fact, as we've seen over this past cycle, lower prices can even lead to more aggressive production in order to meet non-operating financial obligations. This in turn can even further exacerbate the severity of the cycle.The current situation is actually quite sustainable for at least several years. In spite of the fact that oil discoveries are at 60-year lows, there is a lot of recoverable petroleum which recent technological advances and domain expertise have unlocked. Wildcatters tend to produce oil regardless of whether regulators decree that it was discovered yet. The EIA's June 2013 report, Technically Recoverable Shale Oil and Shale Gas Resources assess technically recoverable but undiscovered resources of 137 shale formations in 41 countries outside the United States. The key finding is the North American geology is not special. It's only a matter of time before thus expertise find roots elsewhere.At some point though -- assuming all else is held constant -- higher prices may be needed to justify new investments. Production volumes tend to decrease over time unless they are continuously replaced. To the extent that Imperial is a good proxy for the market, oil prices must find an equilibrium which is higher than today's priceAs always though, there are a multitude of externalities which complicate the calculus of efficient pricing. On one hand, further efficiency gains and technological breakthroughs could lower the full-cycle sustaining costs of present levels of production. On the other hand, cost inflation and potentially unfriendly regulation could raise the cost curve. There is also the ""peak oil"" component whereby resource depletion elevates the technical and cost intensities of future resource extraction. There is also the distinct possibility that demand shocks will decrease society's reliance on petroleum-based hydrocarbons. The importance of the complex tug-of-war between geology and technology is not lost to academic sources, even if they do fail to provide accurate models.Finally, there is the possibility that Imperial is not a typical marginal producer and all this speculation is for naught.All things considered, I have concluded that global oil prices are virtually indistinguishable from a random walk. I take as evidence all of academia's extensively documented failure to provide useful and/or predictive models. Hopefully, this adds some color to my earlier declaration of being a devout agnostic with regard to forecasts. In fact, overwhelming evidence shows that the most accurate commodity price forecast is the risk-neutral (i.e., ""random walk"") expectation.ConclusionIMO shares are trading around 52-week lows. However, unlike with CVE, I have no cause to believe that purchasing shares now is likely buying at peak pessimism. Whereas with IMO, the narrative was pessimism regarding the C$17.7 Bn acquisition, I do not know of any such event-driven impetus for a sell-off in IMO's shares. Moreover, I don't think the stock is necessarily under-valued and I view the company's valuation as essentially a risk play on commodities prices. For these reasons, I am not long the outright stock.Figure 10: 12 Month Total Returns of CVE and IMOIMO data by YChartsFurthermore, short interest has also been increasing on both the NYSE and TSE, indicating that investors have been piling on bearish bets. While the combined days-to-cover on NYSE is abnormally high, inter-market arbitrageurs should keep the two exchanges in alignment. Still a short squeeze is possible in the event of a positive news story... namely, oil prices breakout out of their range to the upside.Figure 11: IMO's Market FootprintIMO 30-Day Average Daily Volume data by YChartsOn the flip-side, US institutional investors have been net buyers of IMO, increasing their stake in the US shares by about 5% over the last quarter. All thing held equal, I cede an edge to short sellers as the ""smarter money"".Though I am not bullish on the stock outright, I have recently opened a position in the 2017 November $30 calls. I believe that if oil prices do perk up, efficiency gains attained during the downturn could translate into immense profitability going forward. This levered dynamic is favorable to options since traders tend to underprice event-based volatility. For example, the 2017 November $30 calls can presently can be purchased for about $1 to $1.30, representing an implied volatility of about 20-25%. Yet, the CBOE crude oil volatility index (OVX) discounts 30+% crude oil volatility. How can a thing which is exceedingly levered to oil prices have a volatility price which is lower than oil's?Anyhow, should oil prices recover to $60 by November, I believe that the stock could easily trade up to $45 to $50 per share. In this somewhat likely outcome, the November calls will have returned 10-15x their initial principal.The downside of such speculation are limited to initial capital invested. In this case, if oil prices remain stagnant, the most likely outcome of buying out-of-the-money call options is a total loss in principal. As always, prudent risk management is advisable."
4078280,103238,2017-06-02T03:20:48-04:00,The energy sector has been underperforming and is out of favor.Imperial Oil has an attractive valuation by a number of metrics.It has an outstanding management with a record of providing value and returning capital to shareholders.Its fully integrated business model allows it to profit regardless of the price of oil.,"Investment ThesisThe energy sector is out of favor and underowned. Imperial Oil (NYSEMKT:IMO), in particular, has an attractive valuation, great management, and a good business model that doesn't necessitate a rise in oil prices. Shares in Imperial Oil offer an excellent buying opportunity.Energy Sector UnderperformanceThe energy sector has had a rough time over the past several years. While most sectors and the stock market as a whole have rebounded following the financial crisis, an oil and natural gas glut has punished energy producers.SourceCommodities are characterized by booms and busts, and energy is no exception. The traditional PE ratio often fails to identify when a commodity producer is cheap, as low stock prices coincide with low commodity prices and reduced earnings. The cyclically adjusted or Shiller PE, on the other hand, was designed specifically to account for the whole business cycle and provides a much better window into valuation.By examining the Shiller PE of the energy industry, we can see that it is significantly cheaper than the broader market. The energy sector is trading at the lowest level of any sector with a Shiller PE of 16.30, while the S&P 500 as a whole is trading at 29.90.SourceThe metric has its flaws, however. While it is good at indicating long-term value, it is terrible at identifying short to medium term changes in prices.The fact is, nobody truly knows the future direction of oil and gas prices. Many try to predict it and few are successful. All we can tell from this is that the energy industry has underperformed in recent years and it is relatively cheap compared to the rest of the market. It can certainly continue to underperform, but in our quest for value, it behooves us to take a look at out of favor industries such as energy.Imperial OilAs I searched the energy sector, one name kept popping up: Imperial Oil.Imperial Oil is one of the two biggest Canadian integrated oil companies, along with Suncor Energy (NYSE:SU). Imperial Oil is engaged in all parts of the petroleum industry in Canada. Its upstream business is tied to Canada's oil sands. It is involved in the transport and refining of petroleum products, as well as their sale through primarily Esso branded gas stations. Additionally, it is involved in the manufacturing and marketing of petrochemicals. Notably, Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) owns a roughly 70% stake in the company and the partnership between the two companies is deep.Attractive ValuationWhat first attracted my attention about the company was its low valuation relative to its energy sector peers. As previously mentioned, the energy sector has a Shiller PE of 16.3, which is already at a discount to the broader market. If you examine Imperial Oil alongside its biggest investor, Exxon Mobil, and its closest competitor, Suncor Energy, it is apparent that its valuation is even more attractive than the industry average. Imperial Oil has a Shiller PE of 9.28, vs. a Shiller PE of 12.28 for Exxon Mobil and a Shiller PE of 19.17 for Suncor Energy.IMO PE 10 data by YChartsMany energy investors prefer to look at the metric of EV to EBITDA. This also shows Imperial Oil in a favorable light. Its EV/EBITDA is currently 7.62, vs. 9.76 for Suncor Energy and 11.12 for Exxon Mobil.IMO EV to EBITDA (TTM) data by YChartsImperial Oil is not just a valuation story, however.Superb ManagementAs I reviewed the investor day transcripts, slideshows, and latest earnings report, the thing that struck me most of all was the quality of the management. It came through not only in its presentation and its responses to questions from the media and from shareholders, but it came through in the cold hard numbers of its business.One item from its presentation which was very illustrative of this was its slide on return on capital employed or ROCE.This is a popular metric for judging management effectiveness, and the amount by which it beat its Canadian peers is astounding. Imperial Oil also compares quite favorably to its international competitors by this measure.Another way in which the company displays its discipline and its dedication to its shareholders is its dividend history. While the current dividend yield of 1.68% is not incredible, the company makes up for it with consistent dividend increases combined with share repurchases.IMO is a few years away from becoming a Canadian Dividend Aristocrat and its dedication to returning capital to shareholders even during difficult times is admirable.Integrated Value ChainCanada's oil sands are not the cheapest region of the world to produce oil, but through technology, scale, and currency weakness it is becoming more and more cost-effective. Since I can't predict the future movements of oil, I am comforted by the fact that the company is so sensibly integrated.This allows the company to remain profitable throughout the entire business cycle. As the price of oil goes down and the upstream operations suffer, the input costs for its extensive refineries also go down and that segment of the business can make up for a portion of the lost cash flow. In the words of the CEO, ""it amounts to a bit of a natural hedge.""If oil prices go up rapidly, you will wish that you owned a more leveraged oil play. If oil prices crash, you'll wish you didn't own any energy company at all. But in the long run, this business model will allow the company to outperform during periods of deteriorating or stagnant conditions and enjoy some of the upside in the event of a full oil recovery.ConclusionBecause of the underperformance of the energy sector over the past several years, energy stocks are out of favor. Imperial Oil has an attractive valuation, excellent management, and an integrated business model that will allow it to perform well no matter what happens with the price of oil. If you are looking for a long-term investment, shares in Imperial Oil are an excellent buy."

This gives Imperial Oil a leg up over other oil companies of similar size.Imperial Oil has significant assets and production growth potential going forward. However, the company's stock has dropped by 40% since the start of the crash.Imperial Oil should recover as oil prices recover, allowing the company to increase its dividend for the next two years and become a dividend aristocrat.","Imperial Oil (NYSE: IMO) has 23 years of consecutive dividend increases making the company just 2 years away from reaching coveted dividend aristocrat status. The only other two oil companies to do this are Exxon Mobil (NYSE: XOM), which fittingly owns almost 70% of Imperial Oil, and Chevron (NYSE: CVX). As we will see through this article, Imperial Oil's impressive asset base, growth potential, and financials, will make it a dividend aristocrat and currently make it a strong investment.Imperial Oil - CBCImperial Oil has a strong asset base that will provide the company with both significant growth opportunity and financials going forward.Imperial Oil Production - Imperial Oil Investor PresentationImperial Oil has an overall upstream asset base spread across three major assets. These assets are Syncrude, Kearl and Cold Lake. The company has a 71% interest in Kearl, a 25% interest in Syncrude, with a full 100% interest Cold Lake. Overall, supported by consistent growing production from Cold Lake, the company has had total production recently of roughly 0.4 million barrels per day.The company’s Cold Lake project should support strong consistent growth, while the company should also see growth from its Syncrude assets. The company’s Kearl asset is a fairly recent project and the production from this region has grown the company’s production modestly these past several years. The company averages $1.5 billion in cash from operating activities annually, with a $26 billion market cap.Given the company's current dividend costs it just over $0.4 billion annually, Imperial Oil will be able to comfortably cover its dividend including any increases.Imperial Oil Resource Base - Imperial Oil Investor PresentationTogether these assets hold almost 8 billion barrels of 2P proven and probable reserves that given the company a reserve life of 30+ years. These resources are spread across in situ, mining, and unconventional resources. Taking into account, the company’s contingent resources, the company has total potential contingent resources of almost 16 billion barrels.These significant barrels of twice the company’s 2P reserves will support the company significantly growing its production in the future. These 2P reserves are incredibly impressive given that oil majors, like Exxon Mobil have noticeably smaller reserve life of 13 years. This valuable resource will allow the company to increase its production going forward while keep a reserve life similar to other oil companies. Imperial Oil’s assets are impressive and generate the company significant cash. These assets also have incredibly impressive asset growth potential. Starting with the company’s Kearl Asset, that asset will likely cause the company respectable growth.Imperial Oil Kearl Production Growth - Imperial Oil Investor PresentationImperial Oil is currently producing below design capacity at its impressive Kearl asset as the company ramps up. The company currently produces roughly 180 thousand barrels per day which it plans to grow to exceed 220 thousand barrels annually. Given overall production from the company of just over 300 thousand barrels per day, this will increase the company’s overall production by almost 15%.At the same time, Imperial Oil is aiming for $20 / barrel US operating expenses all-in. Decreasing those expenses, as the company increases its production, should help to significantly increase the company’s earnings going forward. This incoming growth in profits should result in Imperial Oil's share price recovering, providing shareholders with respectable rewards. Going forward, Imperial Oil anticipates increasing annual production all the way up to 240 thousand barrels per day with additional crushing capacity and piping. This will overall increase the company’s production by almost 20%.Imperial Oil Overall Production Growth - Imperial Oil Investor PresentationImperial Oil anticipates that its upstream production will grow to almost 400 thousand barrels by next year, a 10% increase in one year. That will come from the elimination of one-time events at Syncrude and the improvement of ore performance at Kearl. And that increased performance combined with lower costs will significantly increase Imperial Oil’s cash flow.Imperial Oil Downstream Improvement - Imperial Oil Investor PresentationImperial Oil also anticipates significant downstream synergies. The company has earned $8.3 billion in cash from its downstream activities over the past 5 years from its more than 0.5 million barrels per day of operating activities. The company anticipates with its Exxon Mobil connections and unique locations it will improve its financial position.As we can see here, an improvement of its downstream assets and growth potential shows Imperial Oil’s strong financials.Now that we have discussed Imperial Oil’s assets and the growth potential of these assets, let’s finish up by discussing the company's financials.Imperial Oil Cash Operating Activities - Imperial Oil Investor PresentationImperial Oil has exceptional financial strength with a debt to capital ratio of just 15%. The company generates almost $2 billion in cash from operating activities. That $2 billion in cash from operating activities is incredibly impressive for a company with a market cap of $26 billion. Imperial Oil anticipates its cash flow will recover to $4+ billion in the coming years giving the company a market cap:cash flow ratio of just 6. At the same time, Imperial Oil anticipates that its production will increase 10% alone next year and should continue to increase in the coming years. That will increase the company’s cash flow even further going forward. The combination of increasing production and increased cash flow means Imperial Oil's cash flow will increase, something that the company could use to payout to shareholders as a reward.Imperial Oil Dividend Growth - Imperial Oil Investor PresentationImperial Oil anticipates that it will earn more than $4 billion in cash flow from 2017 - 2021. Imperial Oil has a 6.5% 10-yr compound annual growth rate, a growth rate that is incredibly impressive. The company has more than 100 years of consecutive payment and 23 years of consecutive growth, something few other oil companies can only dream of matching.Given the increase in cash flow going forward, supported by a 10% increase in production, there is no reason to think that Imperial Oil will not continue this history of dividend increases for another two years. In just two years, when Imperial Oil reaches dividend aristocrat status, the company should see an appreciation in its price from dividend aristocrat investors.As the first oil dividend aristocrat in almost half a decade, Imperial Oil is a strong buy. Imperial Oil has an incredibly impressive portfolio of assets that are incredibly valuable. These assets are backed by more than 5 billion barrels of oil, giving the company a reserve life of more than 30 years. At the same time, these assets have significant growth potential that should result in almost 10% production growth in the next year alone. This will provide incredible support for Imperial Oil's cash flow. Imperial Oil is just two years away from becoming the first dividend aristocrat in half a decade, something that should provide material support to its price. The company has had a difficult time since the start of the crash, and the company's improving cash flow combined with its dividend make it a strong investment at this time."

        Imperial Oil Ltd. posts a second consecutive net loss in Q2 2016.
        What to do now the P/E ratio is over 70.00.","As we continue down the earnings report pipeline in the energy industry we now come to Imperial Oil Ltd. (NYSEMKT:IMO) which joins the majority of the industry in posting a net loss in Q2 2016. Much like its counterparts in the oil sands region of Alberta, Imperial Oil saw the negative effect the Fort McMurray forest fires had on its financials through shutdowns of production and pipelines for the better part of a month.Imperial saw its revenues fall in the quarter to C$6.24 billion from C$7.3 billion and this drop in revenues carries over into Imperial's year to date revenues of C$11.4 billion which is down from C$13.5 billion during the same period last year. With the shut down of operations from the forest fires revenues dropped across the board. Upstream operations saw revenues fall to C$1.73 billion from C$2.51 billion. Downstream revenues fell to C$4.79 billion from C$5.4 billion, chemical sales fell to C$317 million from C$373 million and then there was Eliminations & Other charges of -C$592 million which was an improvement from -C$1.04 billion last year. These revenues boiled down to cash flow from operating activities of C$443 million which is up from C$377 million.For Imperial this was the second consecutive quarter with a net loss, in Q2 2016 the net loss was C$181 million (-C$0.21 per share) down from a net income of C$120 million (C$0.14) last year. For the year so far the total net loss is currently at C$282 million compared to a year to date net income of C$541 million at the end of Q2 2015.In the following chart we see how Imperial's net income and EPS have fallen in the past couple of years.source Q2 2016 report. Net income and EPS in CDN$Net income in the second quarter was hit by a perfect storm of issues, first of all was the above mentioned forest fires which shut down 60,000 boe/day of production and attributed to C$170 million of the C$181 million net loss. In all total production in the quarter fell to 329,000 boe/day from 344,000 boe/day, if not for the fire related shutdown Imperial projects that average production would have been 389,000 boe/day. Production at Imperial's refineries also fell to a throughput of 323,000 from 383,000. Then there is also the continued lower price of crude oil, in Imperial's quarter WTI crude held and average price of $45.64 which is down from $48.90 last year and Western Canadian Select crude averaged out at $32.96 down from $46.61.On top of the effects from lower production and commodity prices Imperial also had the unfortunate timing of maintenance at two of its production facilities and at two of its refineries. It has been estimated that the maintenance shutdown at the Kearl and Syncrude production facilities lowered production by 40,000 boe/day. The maintenance at the Nanticoke and Strathcona refineries also cost Imperial 163,000bpd of refinery throughput in the quarter.Coping with the crashAs a means of attempting to ride out the current market conditions Imperial has drastically slashed its capital expenditure budget. In the second quarter Imperial only spent C$335 million on capital expenditures which is down from C$819 million during the same period last year. For the year so far Imperial's capital expenditures have fallen to C$743 million from C$1.86 billion and Imperial has been able to reduce its upstream unit costs by 18%.In the past year Imperial has not only been cutting its capital expenditure budgets but it has also taken the drastic and contentious move to sell off the remainder of its corporately owned Esso retail gas stations and convenience stores. In a move that generated C$2.8 billion for the company Imperial dismantled its network of 497 corporately owned retail gas operations and sold it to buyers such as Parkland Fuels (OTCPK:PKIUF)(who also received 80 On the Run / Marché Express convenience stores), Alimentation Couche-Tard (OTCPK:ANUCF) and 7-Eleven Canada.For investors this can be seen as the final nail in Imperial's plan to have all of the 1,700 Esso branded stations held by franchisees or other corporations. This also was a quick way for Imperial to generate some fast cash for assets which should not have much of a negative net impact on the overall performance on the company. Imperial is still the primary fuel and lubricant supplier for the Esso brand, although consumers may notice a shift away from Esso branded petroleum packaged products in favor of Mobile 1 products.The worry over the P/E ratioImperial's stock has pretty much been treading water since March of 2016 and is presenting a conundrum for everyday investors. The pros of Imperial are its size and the assumed-inevitability of some sort of recovery in crude oil prices, which should help the stock price recover. On the other hand you have Imperial in an unusual position: it is the only major Canadian oil producer with a positive forward P/E ratio at the moment. The problem being that the forward P/E ratio right now is 74.50 on the TSX (with a trailing P/E ratio of 117.50) and 47.94 on the NYSE (with a trailing P/E ratio of 116.95). This immediately sets off red flags as not only is this number so high but it is the only major (or even medium) oil producer not in negative p/e territory.This presents difficulties from a valuation point of view and could present trouble for the stock in the near future. When we look at the average price targets we see that Imperial is currently sitting at C$45.17 on the TSX and $45.50 on the NYSE while Monday's closing prices were C$40.85 on the TSX and $31.67 on the NYSE. On the TSX side the average price target is now below Imperial's 52 week high of C$47.96, and the most recent report issued from TD Securities saw it cut its price target from C$49.00 to C$48.00. The second most recent price target report which was from Scotiabank saw it reiterate its price target of C$45.00.In a stock market full of deals on energy firms Imperial now finds itself as one of the few firms that investors may avoid for a longer-term hold. In fact with the current stagnation of the stock price and a continued environment of below $50.00 WTI crude prices Imperial could be at risk of seeing its stock tumble backwards once again. Already in the past year Imperial has seen four separate spikes and crashes in its stock price and with the traditional September stock price slump from refinery and facility maintenance coming Imperial could be positioned for another one of these crashes in its stock price. Depending on the severity of it and the current price of crude Imperial's net debt of over C$7 billion could creep into the spotlight.Author's note: If you enjoyed this article and found it helpful, please ""Follow"" me on Seeking Alpha to receive notification whenever I publish a new article.You may also be interested in other recent articles I have written for Seeking Alpha with my Canadian point of view that focus on stocks and stories that I have found compelling.

3914286,80986,2016-02-21T08:11:51-05:00,"Imperial recorded a 27% production increase year-over-year.Despite its downstream, it showed a significant decline in Q4 net earnings.Its near-term production growth is limited.","Imperial Oil reports in CAD; unless otherwise noted all prices quoted are in that currency.Imperial Oil (NYSEMKT:IMO) is an integrated Canadian energy company, in effect Exxon Mobil's (NYSE:XOM) 69.6%-owned Canadian subsidiary. During the continued oil price decline, at least in comparison with other producers, it has not done badly, partly because its size, balance sheet and huge parent have made it appear to be among the ""safer"" bets, and partly because the support it has received from its downstream operations has offset the declining returns on production. Over the past year, its share price has declined only by about 15%, among the larger Canadian producers a figure only slightly bettered by Suncor (NYSE:SU), a company that would also fall into the category of one of the ""safer"" plays.Kearl Oil Sands operation (Imperial oil photo)Q4 and 2015 ResultsOn February 2, Imperial reported its Q4 and preliminary 2015 results. Although there were some brighter spots, given the expectations, its results were at least disappointing. The financial results especially were mixed. Although the company earned $1.1 billion for the 2015 year, only $102 million of that was in the fourth quarter. In fact, as compared with Q4/14, the latest quarter was down by a full 85%, even with support from downstream operations. Total earnings for the year were down from $3.8 billion the year before.Obviously, the major contributor the decline in earnings was Imperial's low realized pricing for its crude. A comment from CEO Rich Kruger observed:In fact, for Q4, refining and marketing operations earned net income of about $352 million, offsetting Imperial's loss of $289 million on its production for the same period. Yet even the $352 million was lower than the $397 million the company had earned from its downstream operations in Q4/14. The Weekly Refining Indicators Report now provides some general indications that current Q1/16 crack spreads have dropped sharply from earlier Q3/15 highs, in some cases even approaching a 50% decline. With any higher crude pricing in the future, there is even more likelihood that there will be less downstream support to the integrated producers than there has been in the recent past.For the 2015 year, Imperial had reduced its capex to $3.6 billion, far less than the $4.7 billion it had spent in 2014. It was also able to reduce operating costs, especially in the second half of the year.Imperial Oil's overall production figures for the fourth quarter were up considerably with the coming on stream of Kearl Phase 2, but the new production from the Nabiye expansion (Cold Lake) seemed to have come in below expectations. Total gross production averaged 400,000 boe/d, a 27% increase over the same period a year earlier and a two decade high for the company. Kearl produced an average of 203,000 boe/d gross (144,000 net; Kearl is a j.v. with XOM) that contrasted favorably with the 137,000 boe/d gross (97,000 net) produced in 2014. This reflected the continuing ramp up of Phase 2, which produced an additional 22,000 boe/d (gross) as compared with the previous quarter.The Cold Lake total production figure for Q4 averaged 155,000 bbls/d, up from the 152,000 bbls/d output of Q4/14. This raised some eyebrows, since it was just a 3,000 boe/d increase. The Nabiye expansion had come on stream in January and has a nameplate capacity of 40,000 bbls/d. This should have been in addition to the average 150,000 bbls/d that Cold Lake had been producing before. In fact, Nabiye had produced 20,000 bbls/d in May and had been expected by Imperial to reach 40,000 bbls/d by the end of 2015. Imperial spoke of ""cycle timing of the base operation"", but the Q1 figures for Cold Lake will be closely studied.The production from Syncrude, which is operated by IMO/XOM personnel, as also down from the previous year. Imperial netted an average of 64,000 bbls/d, which contrasted with the 73,000 bbls/d in Q4/14. Syncrude put previously scheduled maintenance forward into December, but the Syncrude production figures have been anemic for some time and again bear close watching.Imperial's production of conventional crude for the quarter averaged 15,000 boe/d, about the same as the year before. Gas production was down from 159 to 122 Mmcf/d, due to natural declines.The downstream operations for the quarter were healthy, with a throughput of 390,000 bbls/d, up from 373,000 a year earlier. Moreover, Imperial's refining capacity was 92% utilized.Esso service station (Imperial Oil photo)2016 OutlookSince Imperial has now completed both Phase 2 of Kearl and the Nabiye extension, it currently has no major upstream projects underway, although the potential Aspen project will require some start-up capital. Without providing details, the company did project that its 2016 capital expenses budget would be $1.8 million, just half the amount it spent in 2015. Since the company requires about $1.2 million a year or so in sustaining capital, this leaves about $600 million for future improvements, including perhaps Aspen and the Strathcona diluent recovery unit it is proposing.Cold Lake/Nabiye will obviously require some attention, since year end production was perhaps 35,000 bbls/d below nameplate capacity. So will Syncrude, where Imperial is the operator. The results for the last several years were at least disappointing and certainly trending lower. Before it was taken out by Suncor, Canadian Oil Sands Management had suggested that the situation had stabilized, but almost immediately a turnaround scheduled for 2016 had to be pushed up to last December. Whether Suncor will now make a greater contribution to Syncrude operations is also a question.Imperial Oil had earlier announced its intention to sell its 500 company-owned service stations (of a 1700 total), and had begun to solicit proposals in mid-year 2015. It may be that a sale is now close. Some rumored potential buyers were said to be Alimentation Couche-Tard (OTCPK:ANCTF), Parkland Fuel (OTCPK:PKIUF) and CST Brands (NYSE:CST). Some estimates are that a sale could realize $1 billion or so.Future PlansWhile Imperial currently has no major construction projects underway, it does have two projects that are under active consideration for future capital spending. The first of these is a novel solvent-assisted, steam-assisted gravity drainage (SA-SAGD) in situ project called Aspen, for which a pilot has been completed. This project would involve the Cold Lake play and could produce upwards of 55,000 bbls/d; it would have a 25-30 year life. No firm investment decision, however, is expected before 2019, although production might begin as early as 2020.Perhaps more immediate is the company's proposal for a new diluent recovery operation connected to its Strathcona (Edmonton)refinery. This would remove the diluent required for pipeline transmission from heavy crude before it is transferred to rail cars, where diluent is not needed. Regulatory approval has been sought and economic feasibility studies are being undertaken.It should be noted also that Imperial has be considering a potential LNG project in connection with its Montney/Duvernay gas assets although the status of this is indeterminate.Some ConsiderationsImperial's record has (perhaps apart from Syncrude) been good. Focusing on Canada's oil sands, its reserves are vast. Over the past several years, it has grown its production consistently. Cash flow should grow commensurately, although how much will depend on crude pricing.It also has the advantage of size, as Canada's second largest energy producer by market cap, as well as the backing of a still larger parent. Its own financial position is sound, and its payout is on the very low side.It has clearly benefited from a ""flight to safety"" in the oil patch. Especially in Canada, where energy holds such a large position in the economy, sector and index allocations often require some investment in energy. Here Imperial's size and conservative position make it a ""go to"" name in an energy downturn. This position is enhanced by its downstream operations, which benefit from low crude pricing.The company is in a position where it has just completed major capital expenditures, and is not currently obligated to large future capital expenses.Although perhaps reflecting its parent's attitude toward climate change issues, Imperial did not join other energy leaders in endorsing the new Alberta carbon tax policies, these, and the results of the royalty review, are very beneficial to the company.Some of the reasons, however, that have made Imperial a relatively attractive investment in a pricing downturn may make it relatively less attractive should oil prices increase.IMO will certainly remain a major vehicle for the conservation of capital within the energy sector. However, there are other companies that have been hammered perhaps disproportionately, including some with much more generous yields than Imperial's relatively low dividend. In an increasing crude price environment, these companies might attract funds that are becoming less concerned with safety and more with growth and income.Two other factors may also be operative in that situation. The first is that Imperial will have no new major projects coming on stream in the near future. The second is, of course, that Imperial's nature as an integrated company will be far less attractive as refining margin spreads decline with higher costs for crude feedstock.Analyst RecommendationsAs one might expect of a long established dividend payer, Imperial Oil is widely covered by analysts. Here, however, are included only analyst recommendations since January 1, since earlier recommendations and consensus target prices do not always take into account current levels of oil pricing. Prices here are in Canadian dollars for IMO on the TSE. The closing price on February 19 was $42.46 (NYSE $30.82).DISCLAIMER: The information provided above is not a recommendation to buy or sell a stock.

3295985,80986,2015-07-01T04:03:06-04:00,"Although crude has declined by some 40%, Imperial’s share price is down by far less.
        The company has benefited from both a “flight to safety” and increased production.
        The share price is unlikely to grow as much as others as crude pricing improves and stabilizes.","Unless otherwise noted, prices are in CAD.The collapse in crude prices since mid-2014 has treated the whole energy sector in an unkindly manner. Still, some companies have been treated far more kindly than others. While high debt companies often have been decimated, and those that paid had higher dividends forced to retrench or face the censure of the marketplace, the companies with large market caps that pay more traditional yields have done not too badly. One example is Imperial Oil (NYSEMKT:IMO), Exxon Mobil's (NYSE:XOM) 69.6%-owned Canadian subsidiary.Today, Imperial, whose dividend is 1.08%, is trading, even with uncertainty about the Greek referendum and the Eurozone, at $48.02 on the TSE, just 17% below its August 2014 high. This is despite the fact that crude is trading at some 40.6% lower in the same period. (In U.S. dollar trading, IMO is down 28.3%; the difference is attributable to a decline in the Canadian currency.) In fact, in April, Imperial's TSE share price hovered around $55, just a little lower than its 2014 high of $57.96. In effect, the IMO shares seem to be pricing in WTI at about US$80 or more (allowing for a 17% discount from crude's August levels). Is this realistic, or is IMO over-valued?What is working in Imperial's favor?First is Imperial's size. It is Canada's second largest energy producer by market cap, second only to Suncor (NYSE:SU). Moreover, with Exxon's majority stake, the market sees Imperial as being backed by the vast resources of XOM. Imperial's own financial position is sound, and its payout is on the very low side. It feels confident enough that it has just announced a renewal of its share repurchase program, which has been an historical strength. (Obviously the extent to which Imperial will act on this remains to be seen. Actual repurchases under the last program were negligible, but that was probably to be expected.Acting to Imperial's benefit is also the macro factor of the large place of energy in Canada's marketplace. While U.S. markets reflect a large share of health care and technology stocks, these are a much less important factor in Canada, where commodities in general and energy in particular hold a much greater share of the market. This means not only that Canadian investors, both individual and institutional, tend to gravitate towards energy stocks, but that funds tied to Canadian indices need to invest in them to a proportionately greater extent than would happen in the U.S. In any ""flight to safety"" scenario the size and security of an Imperial puts it at a certain advantage.At the same time, Imperial's own record has been good. Focusing on Canada's oil sands for its production, its reserves are vast, and are better expressed in decades rather than in years. And if the company has not grown its dividend in the present situation, it has grown its production, and even in the nearer term, should grow it still further. IMO 2014 production was 281,981 boe/d. Its current year's production should be something like 357,000, and 2016 production perhaps 420,000. Cash flow should grow commensurately, although just how much will depend on crude pricing. It has just brought on stream its Kearl Phase 2 development on time and on budget (jointly with XOM, which holds 29%),which eventually should ramp up to 110,000 boe/d. Another expansion project, Nabiye, started up earlier this year and should add a further 40,000 boe/d. Looking ahead, although IMO has recently suspended its Arctic developments, it has other oil sands ventures that could be undertaken even in the nearer-term future.In a low oil price environment, an added attraction for investors are Imperial's downstream activities: its refining capacity with its improved profitability and the company's chain of Esso service stations. (500 of these are company-owned and could be put on the marketplace in the short term to raise further capital.)Possible headwinds?While oil sands production, which will eventually comprise some 90% of IMO's total liquids output, should generate secure production levels for years to come and should require relatively low maintenance costs. Still, the capital costs involved in these projects are huge. In Imperial's case, with regard to the nearer term, much of this cost has been spent and the company must now recoup the costs.To increase production dramatically beyond 2016, however, the company obviously will still need to incur further large scale capital costs. Both to recover currently expended costs and to finance new projects, stable crude pricing at higher than current levels are important. It is very doubtful, considering capital and interest expenses, that much oil sands production is truly profitable at US$60 WTI. Estimates vary widely, but a more realistic overall figure to cover total breakeven costs of oil sands production is probably in the $75 range, and the price to justify entirely new oil sands projects is often reckoned at $90. Even the current breakeven costs for Kearl 2 are calculated by some to be at about $95. To finance future projects profitably, continued low interest rates are also of major importance. A further consideration is that while current service and construction costs have been reduced significantly, these are unlikely to remain at their present levels as the capex of the production companies begins to increase.A less than huge, but nagging, problem for Imperial is its interest in Syncrude, where it is the 25% owner and which it operates. Although Syncrude production comprises just 20% of IMO's total oil and liquids output, the project has experienced recurrent inefficiencies. An added negative for Imperial's Syncrude operation is the new carbon tax regime, which should negatively impact Syncrude production by perhaps 5-6% by 2017. Other Imperial operations in that province, including its refining operations, will also be affected, but Syncrude perhaps more than any. The company will also be affected by the raise in provincial corporate tax from 10% to 12%, and by an increase in royalties that may be the outcome of the royalty review that will shortly take place.Analyst RecommendationsAs one might expect of a long established dividend payer, Imperial Oil is widely covered by analysts. Here, however, are included only analyst recommendations since March 1, since earlier recommendations and consensus target prices do not always take into account current levels of oil pricing. Note that the higher CIBC target price is 12-18 months. Prices here are in Canadian dollars.Some ConsiderationsOf all the Canadian energy producers, Imperial Oil is probably as safe as one can find. Only Suncor, and perhaps Canadian Natural Resources (NYSE:CNQ), could be considered valid competitors in that respect. At least in part, that explains why Imperial has done so well in the current circumstances. Moreover, given its current circumstances, with major projects completed and ramping up production, IMO may be in a position in the relatively near term to re-commence share buybacks and/or to increase its dividend modestly.Still, while it is a solid company, the fact that its share price has advanced to levels relatively close to those of mid-2014, at least by comparison to other producers, may well mean that its share price will not make huge gains, again at least by comparison, if crude prices climb to a sustainable $65 to $70 level. Although financially healthy, without even higher anticipated pricing Imperial may also be reluctant to commit to longer term projects that will increase production.That may make Imperial a good investment for a long-term hold at its current levels of about $48 or below (especially since the share price was about $55 in April), but perhaps without the expectation of any large increase beyond that if oil prices climb higher. To some extent, better pricing may already be factored into IMO to an extent it is not elsewhere, and there could be an outflow from IMO to other holdings as crude prices stabilize and any previous ""flight to safety"" begins to reverse itself.Disclaimer: The information provided above is not a recommendation to buy or sell a stock.

3875936,97896,2016-02-08T16:40:02-05:00,Imperial Oil reported abysmal Q4 2015 numbers due to low oil prices.The company pays a small but sustainable yield.Oil looks to have bottomed. Imperial will soar if and when oil rebounds.,"Imperial Oil (IMO) is one of Canada's largest integrated oil and gas companies. The stock has seen a nearly 25% decline from its 2014 highs and may skyrocket once the oil glut subsides and the price of oil recovers in late 2016 or early 2017. Imperial Oil has a strong business of production as well as refining and distribution which gives Imperial Oil the ability to survive in the lowest of oil prices. With oil prices at $30, Imperial has shifted its focus to refining and distribution which will give them better earnings than their pure upstream peers in the oil patch which are currently on their knees and facing bankruptcy.Imperial Oil had an abysmal Q4 2015 earnings releaseThe Q4 2015 results were a disaster, Q4 2015 actual EPS was $0.12 which was a whopping $0.18 lower than analyst expectations of $0.30 EPS. The revenue was also lower than expected at $6.23 billion compared to analyst expectations of $6.84 billion for this quarter. Net income decreased by a shocking 84.8% to $102 million compared to the same quarter in 2014. Petroleum product sales decreased 2.7% to 467,000 barrels per day. Syncrude production decreased 12.3% to 64k barrels per day and cash flow from operations decreased 62.9% to $405 million. These are indeed ugly numbers and are a result of the collapse in oil prices. Despite such an ugly quarter, Imperial Oil will be maintaining their dividend which will most likely be safe because I believe that oil prices have bottomed and things will only get better for Imperial Oil going into the latter part of 2016.Small but sustainable dividend yieldThere is blood in the oil patch, many oil companies are slashing their dividends completely because their cash flows cannot keep up with their quarterly payouts. Many smaller upstream oil companies are on their knees and are facing bankruptcy if the current low oil price environment does not turn around quickly. While Imperial Oil is facing headwinds, Imperial Oil will survive since it is both involved with upstream and downstream part of the business, when combined with their strong balance sheet I believe that Imperial Oil may even be in a position to acquire one of the smaller upstream producers if oil drops back in the 20s. The small 1.28% yield looks sustainable in the low price environment, so investors should feel safe collecting their dividends as they wait for oil to recover.Oil looks to have bottomed — Imperial will soar if and when oil reboundsImperial Oil has been actively improving their operations to survive in a low oil price environment, if they can make a profit in $30 oil then any increase in the price of oil will have a huge boost to the share's stock price. With demand still up and many oil companies decreasing their production around the globe I see a recovery in oil to the $45-50 range by the end of 2016, this would imply a sharp increase in the share price of Imperial Oil. While a 1.28% yield does not seem like much, investors will be rewarded with this growing dividend as oil recovers above $70 and beyond going forward. If oil stays lower for longer, then you can feel comfortable that Imperial Oil has a diversified business that of both production and distribution revenue and may even acquire a smaller company going forward. Imperial Oil currently trades at a ridiculously cheap 1.6 P/B which is much lower than its five year historical average of 2.4 P/B. Value investors who believe oil has bottomed will benefit greatly from Imperial Oil shares in the next few years.Supporting Documents"

        The company is also looking forward to new investments, which can help improve production capability.

        Investors looking for an exposure in the oil and gas sector can look at Imperial Oil with a long-term perspective.","Imperial Oil Limited (NYSEMKT:IMO) deals in production and distribution of crude oil and natural gas. It operates through three segments: upstream, downstream and chemical. Recently the company reported third quarter results with earnings of $479 million, 49% lower than the same quarter last year. This is owing to the plunge in crude oil prices worldwide.Despite this, the company is keeping itself intact through capacity improvements and reduction of expenses leading to greater operational efficiency. Let's take a further look as how IMO is managing its finances.Into the numbersThe company's performance relating to operational efficiency for the third quarter is very compelling. IMO has been able to achieve $1.1 billion in savings through taking greater care in selecting new capital investments, proper management of operating expenses and making better deals with suppliers and contractors. All of this has resulted in efficiency savings that can be seen in relation to lower operating and capital costs for this quarter.For the quarter, capital and exploration expenses decreased by $292 million and the total expense decreased by 22.5% to $6.52 billion compared to $8.42 billion for the same quarter last year.Apart from the strategies leading the organization towards organic growth, the company is also making investments in other related companies to improve efficiency and customer base. A joint venture with Enbridge called Woodland Pipeline was successfully inked this quarter for expanding market reach and increasing capacity.Cash flow generating efficiency has led to $1.104 billion in cash flows from operating activities and has exceeded the capital and dividend requirement by more than $300 million. This is again an indication towards company's operational efficiency.The company's interest coverage ratio reduced to 29.1 times for the year to date period at the end of this quarter from 66.9 times for the same period last year. This fall took place because earnings for this quarter have been low which in turn has significantly reduced the ratio. Nevertheless, a ratio of 29.1 times still points to robust financial strength.Slump in crude oil pricesAccording to ICE Brent Crude Energy Futures, the price of crude oil has reduced 58% from June, last year. West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark for crude in North America also saw a decrease in crude prices by 52% as compared to the same quarter last year. The graph below shows the considerable decline in crude oil prices over the years and the projection for 2016.Source: U.S. Energy Information AdministrationSource: U.S. Energy Information AdministrationDue to the effect of a global decrease in crude oil prices, the company has faced a significant drop in prices for its products in all of its three segments in this quarter. The Canadian dollar realization for Synthetic crude and bitumen fell by 40% and 56% respectively, from the same quarter last year. This was due to decline in benchmark crude and weaker Canadian dollar. Natural gas realization was also down by $1.83 per thousand cubic feet from the same quarter last year. This shows the company faced many challenges related to the pricing for crude oil and natural gas, which has severely hit this quarter earnings.But even though the reduced global prices for crude oil has affected all the companies in this sector, Imperial Oil has been able to keep its head above water by boosting operational efficiency compared to other companiesCapacity increasedImperial Oil has made improvements at various production and refining facilities. Capacity improvement has led to reduction of per unit cost to the company thus improving operating margins. During the third quarter, IMO has been able to achieve Barrels of Oil Equivalent per Day of 386,000, which is up 26% from the same quarter last year in the upstream segment. Furthermore, in facilities like Cold Lake bitumen, production has increased by 17,000 barrels per day from the same quarter last year due to ramp up of Nabiye production. In the Kearl bitumen production facility, production increased by 103,000 barrels per day from the same period last year.The CEO of Imperial Oil Limited during an investor's day held on 23rd September, said that Kearl mines were producing 200,000 bdp during the start-up phase and has now expanded capacity further by 90,000 bdp. Further ramping of this will increase capacity to 220,000 bdp.Syncrude, the joint venture between Suncor Energy (NYSE:SU) and Imperial Oil has increased production by 2000 barrels per day. However, crude oil production fell by 4000 barrels per day in this quarter due to planned maintenance activity and decline in stock of the natural reservoir.Future ProspectsThe company plans to further increase productivity in all three segments of its business. Nabiye thermal project is expected to increase to a capacity of 40,000 from present capacity of 30,000 by the end of 2015. Further investment in long term projects like Midzaghe, a thermal project in North Alberta is expected to be completed in near future.The company also has a very long-term focus of improving capacity in accordance with projections made by International Energy Agency for 2040 to be further 50 million of bpd. IEA has also predicted that natural gas would surpass coal as the second largest fuel source by the end of 2040. With these projections in mind, the company has planned to adopt high impact technologies and innovations for boosting its operational excellence and growth.The Bottom LineImperial Oil at present is focusing on its operating fundamentals and driving synergies from recent investments to derive maximum value. Further, it is also looking forward to new investments, which can help improve production capability.While Imperial oil's relatively low debt to equity ratio indicates a lot more room for the company to finance organic or inorganic growth through debt, the P/E ratio of 17.34 seems quite low. However, that's probably a result of the company having one of the lowest gross margins in the industry.From the technical viewpoint, the Relative Strength Index at 57.76 shows that the stock is slightly in overbought territory. Money flow index at 48.18 also shows a relatively neutral position.Concluding RemarksEven though times are turbulent for the oil sector due to low oil and natural gas prices, the strategies adopted by the company would help it sustain and achieve long-term growth. Increase in production capability and improving efficiency is the key for any company to grow organically. With crude oil finally finding the bottom of its cycle, the road ahead promises recovery in prices and consequently higher yields for well-managed companies like Imperial Oil. And while the dividend yield may not be impressive enough, Investors looking for an exposure in the oil and gas sector can look at Imperial Oil with a long-term perspective.(Author: R. Murarka)"
2974126,80986,2015-03-04T17:14:21-05:00,"Imperial's sights are set on the next two decades.Imperial's annual capex should decrease.The IMO dividend is solid, and may grow near term.A resumption of its buyback program should lead to capital gains.","OverviewInvestors who are looking for a staid Canadian energy company would probably find none better than Imperial Oil (NYSEMKT:IMO). Created in 1880 by a group of refiners in southern Ontario, it began by refining locally produced oil. In 1898, it acquired Standard Oil's (now Exxon Mobil) (NYSE:XOM) Sarnia refinery in exchange for a majority share in the company. In 1907, it began to operate a fleet of Canadian service stations, something it has continued to do up to the present. Imperial became a pioneer in developing western Canadian production, pipelines and refining facilities, including, after 1947, the huge Alberta oilfields. The company began to be involved in the oil sands from the first experimental projects in 1960. It has continued to pay a dividend, without ever reducing it, since 1947.Today, Imperial's central assets are its three oil sands operations - Cold Lake, Kearl, and a 25% interest in Syncrude, its large refineries in Edmonton (Strathcona), Sarnia and Nanticoke, its Sarnia chemical plant and its 1700 Esso gas stations, some 500 of which are company owned. Imperial Oil itself is still owned 69.6% by Exxon Mobil.IMO has rebounded about 8.1% from its January low, and as of closing on 2 March, its shares traded at $47.96 on the TSE, and in USD $38.20 . The shares pay a quarterly dividend of CAD $.13 ($ .52 annually), for energy stocks a relatively small 1.07%.2014 SummaryOn 2 February, Imperial issued its Q4 and year-end 2014 results. Despite lower oil prices in the second half, and a large drop-off in Q4, IMO's net 2014 full-year income was up from $2,828 million in 2013 to $3,785 ($4.45 a share). Its production was also up, by about 5%, from 295,000 boe/d in 2013 to 310,000 boe/d last year.In terms of its downstream activities at its three refineries, net income was up $542 million to $1,594 million. This occurred in spite of a charge associated with the conversion of its former Dartmouth refinery to a fuels terminal. Its chemical (largely polyethylene) production in Sarnia also showed a net profit of $229 million, an increase of $67 million from 2013.A Future in the Oil SandsDespite its other operations, Imperial has to a great extent staked its future on the oil sands, which now constitute over 90% of its total proved reserves of 3.6 billion boe.The most successful of its oil sands projects to date is in the Cold Lake region, an in situ steam operation, which began to produce in 1985, and in 2014 generated an average of 146,000 boe/d, over 50% of IMO's total production. The company is currently involved in an expansion to this project (""Nabiye""), which started up operationally on a pilot basis in January of this year and would eventually add 40,000 boe/d to Imperial's Cold Lake production.Imperial has also developed (jointly with XOM) phase one of the Kearl mining facility, which last year had an output of 51,000 boe/d (IMO's share). Kearl production, however, has been impaired by several problems, including cost overruns and a temporary shutdown in 2014 that kept it well short of its planned output of 110,000 boe/d. Imperial is also committed to the completion of the Kearl expansion (the second of three phases). The Kearl expansion is now anticipated to come on stream in Q3/15 and would have an eventual output of another 110,000 boe/d.A third Imperial oil sands operation is Syncrude, in which it was one of the original owners; it holds a 25% stake and is the operator of the project. Syncrude gave IMO some 64,000 boe/d average in 2014, but it has had its own maintenance problems and is operating at less than planned production.The company has also embarked on a further project, Aspen, an SAGD operation,which is still in its initial stages, but on which major capital expenditures could begin in 2018. Production could begin from the first of three projected phases in 2020, at 45,000 boe/d, and might eventually reach 162,000 boe/d when all phases are complete.It is clear that the vast capital expenses required for these projects ($5.65 billion in 2014) has set Imperial on a well-defined course in which it is taking a long term view of oil supply and oil pricing. Even its 2014 oil sands production represented some 85% of its total output, with natural gas comprising another 9% and conventional oil (18,000 boe/d) the remainder. If current projects come on stream as anticipated, the IMO oil sands output could comprise over 90% of total 2015 production.Imperial Oil/Exxon MobilWith Exxon Mobil's ownership at 69.6%, Imperial Oil could be described as an Exxon subsidiary. That effectively puts its minority shareholders at something of a disadvantage, since basic decisions will be taken with the Exxon interest at the forefront. At the same time, Exxon's ownership allows Imperial to take advantage of the much larger company's support, experience and technical assistance.It should be noted that while investors sometimes assume that Imperial represents Exxon's Canadian interests, this is not accurate. Exxon is directly involved in plays on Canada's offshore east coast in which Imperial has no interest, including major stakes in the Hibernia (33.1%), Terra Nova (22%), Hebron (36%) and Flemish Pass (40%) plays off the Newfoundland coast and the Sable gas project (50.8%; IMO holds 9%) off Nova Scotia. Exxon also has a 29% separate interest in Imperial's Kearl oil sands project, and both companies are jointly involved in exploration in the Beaufort Sea.Acquisitions or Acquired?Due to both the recent oil price downturn and recurrent operating difficulties at Syncrude, the share price of Canadian Oil Sands (OTCQX:COSWF) has dropped significantly, and it has been widely suggested that its 37.6% stake in the Syncrude project could be a buyout target. As a 25% stakeholder and project operator, Imperial could be a natural buyer, since it almost certainly could achieve some immediate synergies. On the other hand, for COS investors, the price would have to be right, and an improvement in oil pricing would give it some traction. (The issues are discussed more fully in my SA article on Canadian Oil Sands.)At the same time, there has been a suggestion that Imperial's parent, Exxon Mobil, might at the present time want to buy out the minority interest in IMO. While Exxon has expressed itself as open to acquisitions and buying out the minority in IMO is always a possibility, XOM already exercises effective control, and Imperial's assets are hardly distressed. In the current situation, almost every energy company seems to be intent on conserving its cash and to be looking for new assets only when they seem to be especially attractive.In terms of divestitures, Imperial announced on January 28 that the company was considering the sale of its remaining 500 or so company-owned Esso-brand service stations.Dividends vs. Share BuybacksFor a Canadian energy company, Imperial seems to pay a minimal dividend (now 1.07%), although one that has increased regularly and may increase again in the near term. Still, it has compensated for that by an aggressive share buyback program. Imperial has boasted that in the 10 years between 2004 and 2013, through its combination of buybacks and dividends, it returned $13 billion to its shareholders, a ROC average of more than 25%.Although its program has not been as active since 2010, the company still has in place a share buyback program for up to 1 million shares that would end on 24 June 2015. IMO's buybacks always have been exercised in such a way that Exxon Mobil retains its 69.6% of the shares outstanding. While Exxon has cut back its own share buyback program for 2015, Imperial has not yet given any similar indication.The chart below deals with a more recent examination of Imperial Oil returns, covering the period from 31 December 2009 to 31 December 2014. The total return for that period on a single share would have been 28.9%, or an annualized average of 5.8%. This has been a time of large capital spending and reduced buybacks, and seems to indicate a less impressive record than in the past. With the new phases of Nabiye and Kearl soon complete, however, short-term capital spending should be reduced, and Imperial may be able to resume its active buyback policy.Analyst RecommendationsAs one might expect of a long established dividend payer, Imperial Oil is widely covered by analysts. Here are included only analyst recommendations since 1 December 2014, since earlier recommendations and consensus target prices do not always take into account current levels of oil pricing. Prices here are in Canadian dollars.RisksObviously, as with any production company, the greatest risk to Imperial would come from a sustained further major decline in oil prices.At the same time, there are always particular risks to a company like Imperial from some major incident damaging its physical operations at an oil sands project like Cold Lake or Kearl that could shut down or greatly curtail its production. In projects like these, it is not simply a question of a single drilling rig being put out of action, but the risk of a major shutdown.There is some risk with IMO's large scale capital expenditures that there could be major cost overruns, although currently theses are being phased down.There would be similar risks from any major delays in the completion of its current project expansions.For U.S. investors there is a risk from any further decline in the Canadian dollar. Given a Canadian economy that is weaker than the U.S., the CAD could decline still further; another factor would be a further rate cut by the Bank of Canada. At the same time, the current slide in the CAD is largely attributable to the economic damage from low oil prices. An increase in crude pricing would likely strengthen the currency and could benefit USD shareholders.Investment ThesisDisclaimer: The information provided above is not a recommendation to buy or sell a stock. It intends to increase investor awareness and to assist investors in making smarter decisions. Prospective investors should always do their own further research, and take into account their own current financial holdings, their risk levels and their shorter or longer-term outlooks."

        Imperial’s focus is long-term and centered on the oil sands.
        Its recent return on capital has bettered its peers.
        It could increase its dividend this year, and resume its share buybacks as oil prices increase.","OverviewInvestors who are looking for a conservative energy company with major growth prospects need not go further than Imperial Oil (NYSEMKT:IMO), a company owned 69.6% by Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM). Created in 1880, Imperial became a pioneer in developing western Canadian production, pipelines and refining facilities. Involved in the Alberta oil sands since 1960, Imperial has now made the development of these long life reserves its major focus. It has now paid a dividend for 120 straight years.Today, Imperial's principal assets are its three oil sands operations - Cold Lake, Kearl, and its 25% interest in Syncrude, its large refineries in Edmonton (Strathcona), Sarnia and Nanticoke (both in Ontario), its Sarnia chemical plant, and its 1700 Esso gas stations across Canada, some 500 of which are company owned.In a recent SA article comparing the five major Canadian oil sands players - Suncor (NYSE:SU), Imperial, Canadian Natural (NYSE:CNQ), Cenovus (NYSE:CVE) and Husky (OTCQB:HUSKF) - I observed that IMO had rebounded about 23% from its recent lows, less than its peers. This is readily explicable given the fact that at its bottom IMO had fallen far less than them, only 6.5% compared to a range of about 15% to 33% for the others. As of closing on May 1, IMO shares traded at $52.59 on the TSE, and in USD $43.30. The shares pay a quarterly dividend of CAD $.13 ($ .52 annually), for energy stocks a relatively small 0.99%.Imperial Oil / Exxon MobilWith Exxon Mobil's majority ownership, Imperial Oil is effectively an Exxon subsidiary. This could put its minority shareholders a disadvantage, since basic decisions will certainly consider the Exxon interest. At the same time, ownership by the larger company allows Imperial to take advantage of Exxon's support, experience and technical assistance.Investors sometimes assume that Imperial represents Exxon's Canadian interests, but this is inaccurate. XOM is directly involved in plays on Canada's offshore east coast in which IMO has no interest, including major stakes in the Hibernia (33.1%), Terra Nova (22%), Hebron (36%) and Flemish Pass (40%) plays and the Sable gas project (50.8%; IMO holds 9%). Exxon also has a 29% separate interest in Imperial's Kearl oil sands project, and both companies are jointly involved in the Beaufort Sea exploration.Q1 ResultsOn 30 April, Imperial issued its 2015 Q1 results. The company was still profitable, although as expected the low oil prices for the quarter led to an large earnings decrease of some 55%, to $421 million or $0.50 per share, as compared with $946 million or $1.11 per share in Q1/14.At the same time, there were brighter signs. Operating costs were reduced and production grew. Imperial's downstream activities were also helpful. The company's refinery throughput increased from strong 2014 numbers, as did their utilization rates, and refined product sales remained stable. The Sarnia chemical plant, which did a record business in 2014, continued to be assisted by the low natural gas prices from the north-east U.S. Downstream operations also profited from the weaker Canadian dollar.One of the most significant notes in the Q1 report indicated that capital expenditures were down some $200 million from the same period last year. In other cases, this might simply reflect capex cuts, but in the case of Imperial what it signals is that the large capital expenses it had committed to Kearl Phase 2 and Nabiye have now diminished materially. As these costs drop still further, and production from both projects comes on stream, this should bode well for the company, even in 2015.An Oil Sands FocusIn terms of its production, Imperial represents an almost pure play on the Canadian oil sands, on which it has largely staked its future. Oil sands reserves now constitute over 90% of its total proved reserves, and by 2018, with the completion of projects now underway, oil sands production will comprise about 92% of its total.Imperial's major production assets are all oil sands ones - Cold Lake, Kearl, and Syncrude. The most successful to date is Cold Lake, an in situ steam operation, which began to produce in 1985, and in 2014 generated about 146,000 boe/d, or over 50% of the company's oil production. Imperial is currently involved in an expansion to this project (""Nabiye""), which started up in February, and in March averaged 12,000 boe/d. This would eventually increase Cold Lake production by about 40,000 boe/d.Imperial has also developed (jointly with XOM, which holds 29%) the Kearl mining facility, which last year had an output of 51,000 boe/d (Imperial's share). Kearl production, however, has encountered several problems, including cost overruns and a temporary shutdown in 2014 that kept it short of its planned output of 110,000 boe/d. The latest report was promising; during Q1 Kearl was producing 95,000 boe/d of bitumen (67,000 to IMO). One of the past problems came from third-party power supply. This has been resolved by a new company-operated generating plant tied to the Alberta grid.Imperial is also committed to the completion of the Kearl phase 2. This expansion is now anticipated to ramp up ahead of schedule in mid-year and will have an eventual output of another 110,000 boe/d (78,000 net to IMO). Imperial has said recently that both its thermal Nabiye and Kearl phase 2 mining expansions are now ""essentially complete.""The other Imperial oil sands operation is Syncrude, where it was one of the original owners; IMO currently holds a 25% stake and is the project operator (with XOM personnel). Syncrude gave IMO some 64,000 boe/d average in 2014, but it has had significant reliability problems and is still operating at less than planned production.At its recent annual meeting, CEO Rich Kruger indicated that the company's next big interest was in targeting several new in situ extraction projects. He was no doubt referring especially to Aspen, a SAGD operation that is still in its initial stages, but on which major capital expenditures could begin in 2018. (Production could come from the first of three phases in 2020, at 45,000 boe/d, and might eventually reach 162,000 boe/d when all phases are complete.)It is clear that the vast capital expenses required for these projects has set Imperial on a well-defined course in which it is taking a long-term view of oil supply and oil pricing. Even its 2014 oil sands production represented some 85% of its total output, with natural gas comprising another 9% and conventional oil the remainder. (In 2014, it sold off conventional assets worth $855 million.) Imperial is Canada's second largest oil sands producer by volume, with its 2015 oil sands production estimated at 340,000 boe/d to Suncor's 462,000. By 2018, production from Imperial's oil sands operations should reach some 409,000 boe/d.Acquired? Acquisitions?There have been suggestions that Imperial's parent, Exxon Mobil, might want to buy out the minority interest in IMO. While Exxon is open to acquisitions and buying out the minority in IMO is always a possibility, XOM already exercises effective control, and Imperial is hardly distressed. There would not seem to be any particular reason for such a move at present, especially when assets more attractive to XOM may be readily available.With low oil prices and recurring operating difficulties at Syncrude, the share price of Canadian Oil Sands (OTCQX:COSWF) has dropped considerably, and there have been persistent rumors that its 37.6% stake in Syncrude could be a buyout target. As a 25% stakeholder and project operator, Imperial could be a natural buyer, since there are clear synergies. Rising oil prices and more stable Syncrude production, however, have lessened COS difficulties, and some recent market suggestions have spoken, instead of an outright buyout, of a sale by COS of perhaps 2% of its stake to either IMO or SU. At the same time, the 5% Murphy Oil (NYSE:MUR) stake, which appears to be on the table, might make a more feasible acquisition for either company. While Imperial has given no concrete sign of any interest, its CEO has suggested in the past that the company could be open to acquisitions that tie into current operations.In terms of divestitures, Imperial confirmed at its annual meeting that it was still actively considering the sale of its remaining 500 or so company-owned Esso-brand service stations and hoped to decide on the matter this year.Dividends and Share RepurchasingFor a Canadian energy company, Imperial seems to pay a minimal dividend (now 0.99%), although one that has increased regularly. Still, the company has compensated for that by an aggressive share buyback program. Its 10-year return to shareholders is near 80%, and it boasts that in 2014 it had a return on invested capital of 7.5%, which far bettered its peer group (SU, CNQ, CVE, HSE) loss of 7.1%.The company also boasts that in 2014 its dividend increased for the 20th consecutive year. Given that it may want to keep that streak alive, and with somewhat higher and stable crude prices, falling capital requirements and increased production, Imperial may well choose to go for a small dividend increase later this year.Imperial has always been active in share repurchasing. The company still has in place a buyback program for up to 1 million shares that will end on June 24 of this year, although this is currently inactive. It could announce a renewal of that program, without actually repurchasing shares until a later date, perhaps next year, if conditions were right. Right now, a dividend increase may be a more likely option. Note that IMO's buybacks always have been exercised in such a way that Exxon Mobil retains its 69.6% of the shares outstanding.Analyst RecommendationsAs one might expect of a long established dividend payer, Imperial Oil is widely covered by analysts. Here are included only analyst recommendations since January 2015; earlier recommendations and consensus target prices do not accurately take into account current levels of oil pricing. Prices here are in Canadian dollars.My own suggestion is that, barring another steep decline in oil prices, IMO will gradually drift back toward its 2014 high of $57.46 (NYSE: $54.09), though its progress may be very gradual.RisksObviously, as with any production company, the greatest risk to Imperial Oil would come from a sustained further major decline in oil prices.At the same time, there are particular risks to a company like Imperial from an incident impairing its operations at an oil sands project like Cold Lake or Kearl. Projects like these always involve the risk of a major shutdown or significant curtailment.There is some risk, given IMO's large scale capital expenditures, of unanticipated cost overruns or major delays in project construction, although as current projects come on stream that is less likely.A challenge facing the oil sands companies with rapidly increasing production is in getting their product to market, and at maximum pricing. Any extended delay in major future pipeline projects or any curtailment of shipping by rail would obviously affect Imperial's profitability. Imperial's construction of a new Edmonton rail terminal is a sign of its attunement to these problems.Because of their larger carbon footprint, oil sands producers like Imperial Oil will be more exposed than conventional oil producers to any new taxation on greenhouse gas emissions. There is a similar risk from any new royalty or taxation system in Alberta due to a change of government, although in the present circumstances, any new tax regime is likely to be measured.For U.S. investors there is a risk from any further decline in the Canadian dollar. At the same time, the current slide in the CAD is largely attributable to the economic damage from low oil prices. The CAD has been rebounding from recent lows, and a further increase in crude pricing would likely strengthen the currency.Investment ThesisImperial Oil is a solid company. Unlike many other producers, where the current situation has triggered additional difficulties, Imperial's only real problem is the low level of oil pricing. Its capex commitments are falling, operating costs are being cut carefully, and production is on target. IMO is taking a very long-term view, and its own outlook seems to be focused on the decades between 2020 to 2040 and later and on oil supply/demand and pricing in that era. As an investment, it is probably best suited to those who would take a similar view, and are prepared to overlook temporary fluctuations.Imperial Oil, apart from its downstream operations, is now virtually a pure play on the Canadian oil sands. By 2018, its oil sands production will be over 90% of its total. In fact, Imperial compares favorably to Canadian Oil Sands, a total oil sands play, which is saddled with proportionately greater G&A costs, pays only a slightly higher dividend, and lacks Imperial's downstream diversification.Imperial's dividend must be regarded as safe, and may even be increased slightly in the current year. Its formerly aggressive buyback strategy is likely to resume once oil prices increase further and become stable.Imperial's very low dividend in comparison to other Canadian energy companies probably make it less suitable for investors who seek dividend income (retirement income, trusts, etc.). For possible alternatives, see my SA article earlier referred to comparing the major Canadian oil sands producers (including SU, CNQ, CVE and HSE).U.S. investors, instead of buying IMO shares, might consider buying Exxon Mobil. The XOM dividend is significantly higher (currently 3.29%), and one is exposed to Imperial's oil sands assets through the Exxon majority ownership. Beyond that, there is exposure to several major Canadian east coast plays in which Exxon is directly involved but where IMO has no or little stake.DISCLAIMER: The information provided above is not a recommendation to buy or sell a stock.

1603702,42741,2013-08-05T08:45:57-04:00,,"The first article of the series has introduced the Carbonate Triangle of the renowned Canadian oil sands. The region is the world's third-largest oil reserve with its rich carbonate-hosted bitumen deposit located in the northern Alberta's deep underground. Precisely, the Carbonate Triangle is situated between three major bitumen areas, Athabasca, Cold Lake and Peace River.In today's investment guide on the Carbonate Triangle, I will present the main characteristics of the Athabasca area to have a better assessment of its potential. Then, I will review one of the largest oil producers that has been analyzed previously with its Cold Lake assets and that owns a few assets as well in Athabasca. So far, I looked into several producers involved in Peace River and Cold Lake regions of the Carbonate Triangle:Peace River's most notable producers:Cold Lake's most notable producers:Athabasca's most notable producers:An analysis of the current operations of the company will be examined with the objective to provide the most complete information available to potential investors before deciding to seize the opportunity that the 54,132 square miles of the Carbonate Triangle has to offer. Let's start by introducing Athabasca, a famous and most prolific region in the Canadian oil sands as well as one of the largest reserve in the world.Athabasca RegionThe Athabasca oil sands are named after the Athabasca River, which cuts through the heart of the deposit, and traces of the heavy oil are readily observed on the river banks. Commercial production of oil from the Athabasca oil sands began in 1967, when Great Canadian Oil Sands Limited, now incorporated into an independent company known as Suncor Energy, opened its first mine, producing 30,000Bls/d of synthetic crude oil.The Athabasca region can be defined with two major oil sands deposits: the Grosmont Formation and the Wabiskaw-McMurray Formation. The Grosmont Formation is a late-Devonian shallow marine to peritidal platform carbonate consisting of four recognizable units within the deposit. All of the hydrocarbons are located in an updip position, structurally trapped along the erosional edge and contained by the overlying Clearwater Formation.Source: ERCBThe McMurray Formation was deposited on an exposed karstic landscape of ridges and valleys and varies in thickness from being absent over Devonian highs to over 426 feet thick in the Bitumont Basin. Bitumen-rich reservoirs formed within estuarine valleys stacked above the Lower McMurray channel sands and are assigned to the Upper McMurray Formation.Source: ERCBThe Athabasca region is estimated to hold total reserves of 1.34 trillion barrels of oil. Approximately 8-10% would be recoverable with current technology, which would represent a total reserve of 134 billion barrels. Compared to the estimated 7 billion barrels contained in Peace River and approximately 16 billion barrels in Cold Lake, the Athabasca region is the most prolific and the most promising of the three, located in the Carbonate Triangle.Imperial OilImperial Oil is a leading member of Canada's petroleum industry. It is one of the country's largest producers of crude oil and natural gas and is Canada's largest petroleum refiner with the leading market share in petroleum products sold through a coast-to-coast supply network that includes about 1,850 service stations.Athabasca' Oil Sands ProjectsSource: Imperial OilImperial owns significant undeveloped land in the Athabasca region. This area has promising development opportunities and the company continues to target future resource additions to build on its current high-quality oil sands assets. As a matter of fact, the producer's upstream division has approximately 200Mbls/d of projects starting up or in construction while it plans to deliver 300Mbls/d of new production by 2020.Source: Imperial Oil's June 2013 Investor DayLet's take a look at its most promising assets in the region.Kearl Mining ProjectSource: Imperial Oil's June 2013 Investor DayThe Kearl Project is a joint-venture where Imperial owns 70.96% in interests, ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) owning the remaining 29.04%. The project will use the producer's proprietary PFT (paraffinic froth treatment) technology to process bitumen on-site to where it can be blended with natural gas condensates to create a diluted bitumen product.Source: Imperial OilDiluted bitumen is suitable for transportation direct to market via pipeline from the mine site. This process eliminates the cost and environmental impacts of an on-site upgrader. Since Kearl will be connected to a substantial North American pipeline system, diluted bitumen can be transported directly to refineries that are already configured to process heavy oil and bitumen.The mining process consists of using high-capacity shovels and heavy-haul trucks to remove ore and transport it to an on-site facility where the ore will be crushed and mixed with water for slurrying. From here, the slurry will be transported by pipeline to a bitumen extraction facility where bitumen will be separated as froth, a mixture of bitumen, water and fine solids, and the froth will be further treated in a PFT plant to produce bitumen suitable for blending.Source: Imperial Oil's June 2013 Investor DayIn addition to mining equipment, Kearl will also require development of related infrastructure, such as a river water intake and water pipeline to allow water volumes to be withdrawn from the Athabasca River and stored on-site. Recycled water will be the main water source for the operations once the system is filled and a steady state is reached. Fresh river water will then be used as a supplementary source.Imperial Oil reported that the construction on Phase 1 is complete and start-up activities are under way. The project is now expected to cost $12.9 billion, a $2-billion increase from previous estimates. It also announced the start up of one of three froth treatment trains at Kearl on April 27, 2013. Start up of the remaining two will happen sequentially as planned, bringing production to capacity of 110,000 barrels per day later in 2013, the initial capacity of Phase 1.Source: Imperial Oil's June 2013 Investor DayAt the end of Q4 2012, the company said that Kearl Phase 2 was 32% complete. This second phase is estimated to add another 110,000Bls/d to the production and start-up is expected for 2015. Finally, a Phase 3 Debottleneck is scheduled for 2020, adding 70,000Bls/d for a total production of 290,000Bls/d.According to the company, the development cost per barrel for the entire project is estimated at $6.80, relying on a competitive cost structure over the life of the asset.Source: Imperial Oil's June 2013 Investor DayFurthermore, the quality of bitumen that would be recovered is considered above-average grade. The chart below illustrates the positioning of Kearl comparing the ore grade percentage with the total volume of bitumen in place. Kearl has a recoverable resource of approximately 4.6 billion barrels of bitumen.Source: Imperial Oil's June 2013 Investor DayAs seen in my previous article in Cold Lake, the Cold Lake asset combined with Kearl and its participation in Syncrude will drive a significant growth for years to come for Imperial. The following chart shows the estimated 3.6 billion oil-equivalent barrels of long-life proved reserves of these world-class assets in the Carbonate Triangle.Source: Imperial Oil's June 2013 Investor DayAspen SAGD ProjectLocated approximately 21.7 miles South of Kearl, the Aspen project consists of 52 sections of lease lands will come in two 40,000 barrels per day stages over the next decade. However, only Phase 1 has been announced but no date has been determined yet for construction.Source: Imperial Oil March 2011 SlideBottom LineImperial Oil is a strong competitor in the Canada's oil sands play as it owns about 301 square miles of lease lands in Cold Lake, developing a world-class asset there. However, the company owns several lands in the Athabasca region as well, developing the very promising Kearl project. This asset is also assessed as world-class, estimated to contain about 4.6 billion barrels of recoverable high ore grade bitumen.Imperial Oil holds an extensive and attractive portfolio of future development opportunities with a proved and non-proved resource base of over 16 billion oil-equivalent barrels. The following picture represents the current ratio of its proved reserves for Athabasca and Cold Lake as well as its mineable and in-situ operations.Source: Barclays Americas Select Franchise Conference, May 2013Imperial Oil is the largest refiner and one of the largest crude oil and gas producers in Canada. Besides its upstream operations, the producer has generated free cash flow of about $5 billion over the last 4 years with its downstream and chemical division. Its capability to optimize use of its existing systems to maximize value is an asset on its own. Imperial also participates in multiple new pipeline opportunities, to develop further its capabilities, currently transporting more than 400MBls/d of crude oil from Alberta by pipeline.Finally, Imperial Oil is a leader in R&D for years, its Calgary research center is considered one of the leading oil sands research facilities in the world. Imperial Oil and Exxon Mobil have held more than 160 upstream patents since 1961, including the first patents on CSS (cyclic steam stimulation) and SAGD (steam-assisted gravity drainage), two key processes used across the industry in bitumen recovery. Today, those inventions are continually being refined at the center to improve productivity and environmental performance.Imperial Oil is definitely a major producer that cannot be ignored by the seasoned investor as the future looks very bright. Trading around $42/share, the stock price is discounted, in part because of the oil price declines of the last few months on the market. However, Morningstar assessed its fair value at $52 a share, which gives plenty of room to go short on the stock or, getting it at great discounts to maximize its long-term growth over the years while pocketing its dividend payouts. Whatever the decision, Imperial Oil is a great way to get involved in the Canadian oil sands play.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2699785,74665,2014-11-20T15:46:27-05:00,"Imperial Oil is the second largest Canadian oil company, with excellent exposure to the Alberta oil sands.
        The company has a strong balance sheet and superior management, offset by paltry dividend growth.
        I like the company, but won't be adding just yet.","With all the hubbub over falling energy prices, energy stocks have suffered as of late. Good companies like ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), Chevron (NYSE:CVX), and ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) are all approaching ""undervalued"" territory. Many dividend growth investors are piling in, and for good reason. I'll suspect I'll be buying the majors soon myself. But me being me, I also like to take a look at the other stocks out there. Smaller names that most people miss are often good companies to invest in, yet few people know of them. I hope I found another hidden gem today in Imperial Oil (NYSEMKT:IMO).Quick Background:Quoting from Scottrade:The company was founded in 1880, and is currently headquartered in Calgary, Alberta. It is currently the second-biggest oil company in Canada. The company produces roughly 247,000 barrels of oil and 280 million cubit feet of natural gas a day. A majority of IMO's oil comes from the Alberta oil sands; IMO owns the Cold Lake oil sands operation completely, and owns a 25% stake in Syncrude, another major producer. As mentioned above, IMO is an integrated company, meaning that it also owns refineries and chemical plants. 3 of the 4 refineries are in Eastern Canada, and one is in Alberta. On average, the refineries have a throughput of about 440,000 barrels of oil a day. The company also owns gas stations (under the ""Esso"" brand) and convenience stores (under the ""On the Run"" and ""Tiger Express"" brands). (Main source)IMO's competitors include XOM (which owns about 70% of the company), Marathon Oil (NYSE:MRO), and Hess (NYSE:HES).For more basic information, check out the company's website and the 2013 annual report.Fun fact: An investment of $10,000 in December 2000 would be worth $71,571.45 today, all dividends reinvested. This yields a annual rate of return of 15.2%. (Source: FAST Graphs)Investment Criteria:Let's run IMO through our screening criteria to see how it does.Other Bonus Ratings:Financial Overview:IMO has a dividend yield of 0.96%, which is subpar for a large oil company. The payout ratio is 10.6%, and the company pays out $0.48 CAD annually. Although there is plenty of room to grow the dividend, it hasn't done a great job of doing so over the past 10 years. The 10 year dividend growth rate is 4.9%, the 5 year DGR is 5.3%, and the 3 year DGR is 3.8%. Clearly, the dividend is not management's first priority. To the company's credit, IMO has attempted to buy back shares over time, going from 994 million at the end of 2005 to 847.6 million today. However, the shares outstanding has stayed constant since 2009, so there have not been significant buybacks recently. The company's debt-to-equity ratio is 0.28, indicating that the dividend is not in danger of being suspended due to debt interest payments. The company has had two 3-for-1 stock splits, in 1998 and 2006.Please keep in mind that as a Canadian company, there is a dividend tax of 15% when the dividend is paid to a non-Canadian citizen. If you are an American (as I am), you could possibly invest in IMO in an IRA and avoid that withholding tax. You should definitely consult with a tax advisor though, should this be a concern for you.IMO has a current P/E ratio of 11.0 and a forward P/E ratio of 12.8. This suggests that either earnings will slightly decrease or the price will get ahead of itself a small amount. IMO's gross, operating, and net profit margins all exceed the peer groups': 21.02% vs 12.80%, 14.86% vs 2.98%, and 11.18% vs 2.77%. (Source: Scottrade) The company has a very solid balance sheet in general, and has extremely good returns on invested capital (~18% in the last three years). Finally, Morningstar rates IMO's economic moat as ""narrow"" and management as ""exemplary"".According to FAST Graphs, IMO has a 5 year estimated earnings growth rate of 11.5%, and a 5 year estimated total return of 12.9%. The 5 year ETRs of IMO's competitors are 9.2% , 15.8% , and -4.1% . Since MRO spun off its lower-margin refinery business in 2011, it makes sense the MRO will perform a bit better over time. When IMO is compared to a more integrated peer like XOM, it appears it will hold its own over time, and possibly help drive XOM's own returns (due to XOM's ownership stake).Risk Factors:There are quite a few risks in IMO. First is that the price of oil keeps dropping, which is a negative for obvious reasons. IMO is also very geographically centralized. This isn't much of a problem, since Canada is a very safe and stable country, but it is something to think about. Currency fluctuations are a concern. IMO reports costs in Canadian dollars, but revenue is tied to the US dollar. So a lower CAD and higher USD bode well for the company. If the USD suffers, revenues could take a hit. And of course, if the CAD strengthens, costs will be higher. IMO, although diversified, does get a lot of revenue from oil sands. Although these tend to be higher quality and successful, we have to be careful that IMO does not get too over-reliant on them. Further, the more development takes place in the oil sands, the harder it will be to hire good labor and find cheap-yet-quality materials. Finally, as always, government regulations could stifle oil companies like IMO.Final conclusion:I feel IMO is a buy at this time. It passes each of my criteria, except for the Chowder rule limit. I am disappointed that the company doesn't seem to care much about the dividend, but IMO still has a solid balance sheet, excellent management, and a good position in the Canadian oil industry. The risks are there, of course, so I wouldn't call this a riskless investment. Honestly, IMO seems like an interesting, well-run company, and I am mildly interested in buying. But first, I intend to initiate positions in or add to higher-yielding companies like XOM, CVX, and COP; that XOM position will give me plenty of exposure to IMO as it is. If you are bullish on Canadian oil, and don't have a very large position in XOM, then go ahead and take a look at IMO for yourself."
1331651,45761,2013-04-10T05:27:43-04:00,,"Background and ThesisWe published an article last month on Imperial Oil. We have decided to update our readers for two reasons; the stock has fallen a further 5% since then and Imperial's principle upstream project Kearl is about to start production. We have re-crunched our numbers and are very excited about the prospects of the stock at these levels.The purpose of this article is to calculate the returns one can reasonably expect by buying Imperial Oil (NYSEMKT:IMO). We believe the stock offers excellent growth prospects in relation to price (9.2x trailing 12 month earnings).Imperial Oil in which US-based Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) holds a 69.6 percent stake, is Canada's second-largest integrated oil company (by market capitalization).The stock has been investing significant amounts of capital in its Kearl Oil Sands Project which is now finally starting production.We believe the stock has fallen out of favor with investors because of the long term nature of its CAPEX projects and a misleading slowing in growth.As production from Kearl will now start to come on stream, growth will reappear and Returns On Invested Capital (ROIC) will start to grow. This should result in a re-rating of the stock and eps growth.In the chart below you can see Imperial Oil's historical Upstream production levels. We have added to the right our estimates for 2013, 2014 and 2015 based on increasing contributions from Imperial's Nabiye and Kearl projects.Imperial OverviewStrong historical cash flow generation….As Kearl starts to kick out cash, we expect an increased focus on returning excess cash to shareholders (buybacks and dividends) like in 2005 - 2008….Below one can see how cash is deployed. The key observation is the significant growth capex over the last 5 years….Naturally significant growth in the levels of invested capital….Revenues/Invested Capital have been falling as the Kearl Project had yet to start production….Margins have been expanding as the downstream business has been very strong recently….ROIC is below its historical averages as the CAPEX going into Kearl has been growing without a commensurate increase in revenues feeding through. This is about to change....Using maximum, minimum and average historical Returns On Invested Capital in the previous chart, we have calculated based on the historical levels of invested capital possible ranges for where NOPAT could be (see below). Right now, NOPAT is slightly below average ROIC levels. We believe that as Kearl begins production, ROIC will break up through the average and NOPAT will follow. Please note that this is based on current levels of invested capital and we expect invested capital to continue to grow going forward that should result in an even higher NOPAT.Historically, Imperial Oil has traded on an average relative p/e of 0.95 to the S&P 500. Applying this to the current multiple of 15.47 gives us 14.75x earnings. We have multiplied the current P/E of 9.16 by the historical NOPAT levels (derived from minimum, average and maximum ROIC levels) to get a sense of where the market cap for the company can trade. In the chart below you can see the actual market cap of Imperial plotted against the market capitalisation calculated using NOPAT derived from the minimum, average and maximum historical ROIC. We can see that right now the market cap of Imperial is 15% below its fair value level. We believe that as ROIC expands, the market cap has significant upside potential.EPS AssumptionsOur annualized average EPS estimate for the next 5 years is 17.3%. The various components can be seen below.Expected ReturnAssuming Imperial will trade on its average relative P/E of 0.95 x S&P 500 which would equate to 14.75x trailing earnings, then we are looking at an 29.8% IRR over the next 5 years with a CAD$143.72 price target. In the event that multiples stay at the current level (9.17x trailing earnings), then the IRR would be 18.5% with a CAD$89.80 price target. Please note, we are long Imperial Oil through its primary listing on the TSE not the US listing.Risk FactorsOil price volatility and North American refining capacity could have a significant impact on the earnings of the stock.Disclosure: I am long IMO. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article."
1529622,42741,2013-07-01T11:51:19-04:00,,"The first article of the series has introduced the Carbonate Triangle of the renowned Canadian oil sands. The region is the world's third largest oil reserve with its rich carbonate-hosted bitumen deposit located in the northern Alberta's deep underground. Precisely, the Carbonate Triangle is situated between three major bitumen areas, Athabasca, Cold Lake and Peace River.In today's investment guide on the Carbonate Triangle, I will briefly recap the main characteristics of the Cold Lake region to have a better assessment of its potential. Then, I will introduce a major oil producer owning a few assets in that specific play.So far, I examined the following producers involved in the Carbonate Triangle. The first area analyzed was Peace River. The producers were:The current area, Cold Lake, has been reviewed in a past article as well as the following oil producers:Notably, an analysis of the current operations of the company will be examined with the objective to provide the most complete information available to the potential investors before deciding to seize the opportunity that the 54,132 square miles of the Carbonate Triangle has to offer. Let's start by reviewing briefly Cold Lake, the second largest oil sands deposit of the Carbonate Triangle.The Cold Lake RegionSource: Strata Oil and GasHistorically, the majority of the primary bitumen has been produced from the Cold Lake oil sands area using vertical wells and progressive cavity pumps that tolerate the large volumes of sand produced with the bitumen. More recently, with improvements in horizontal and multilateral drilling technology, primary bitumen is being produced from the Athabasca and Peace River oil sands areas.Source: ERCBThe Cold Lake oil sands lie within a package of stacked incised valleys that rest encased within more regional deltaic, shoreface sands and marine mud. These overlie the fluvial and estuarine sands of the Clearwater formation. This formation is overlain by regional deltaic, progradational barrier complexes and incised valley-fills of the Lower and Upper Grand Rapids formation, which extends to the top of Mannville group.The entire Cold Lake area is estimated to contain 201 billion barrels of initial in-place volumes, within a total oil sands reserve estimated at 1.8 trillion barrels for the entire Carbonate Triangle. Approximately 8% of the 201 billion barrels would be accessible given the available technologies, which would represent 16.08 billion of recoverable barrels for Cold Lake.Imperial Oil (NYSEMKT:IMO)Imperial Oil is a leading member of Canada's petroleum industry. It is one of the country's largest producers of crude oil and natural gas and is Canada's largest petroleum refiner with the leading market share in petroleum products sold through a coast-to-coast supply network that includes about 1,850 service stations. The picture below illustrates the assets owned by Imperial Oil as well as the ones from Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM).Source: Barclays Americas Select Franchise Conference, May 2013Over the past 40 years, Exxon Mobil has invested more than 2,000 work years in heavy oil research alone. These heavy oil research efforts include developing proprietary in-situ recovery processes, enhancing surface-related technologies to improve the economics of mining operations, and creating technologies to increase the value of heavy oil and aid in its transport.A R&D Leader In The Canadian Oil SandsImperial Oil's Calgary research center is considered one of the leading oil sands research facilities in the world. Imperial Oil and Exxon Mobil have held more than 160 upstream patents since 1961, including the first patents on CSS (cyclic steam stimulation) and SAGD (steam-assisted gravity drainage), two key processes used across the industry in bitumen recovery. Today, those inventions are continually being refined at the center to improve productivity and environmental performance.Imperial Oil now operates the world's largest thermal bitumen recovery project in Cold Lake using this process. The company's R&D program delivered efficient processes through time and is still very promising. (Click to enlarge)Source: Barclays Americas Select Franchise Conference, May 2013Cold Lake operation uses CSS technology to access the in-situ resource. Exxon Mobil and Imperial Oil developed a produced water technology in the late 1970s, which has allowed approximately 95% of produced water to be reused for steam generation. ""Produced water"" is water extracted with oil and gas during production. As a result, it has been able to reduce the freshwater use intensity at its Cold Lake facility by almost 90% since the project's inception. Other conservation initiatives are underway that, if successful, will reduce fresh water use at Cold Lake by up to an additional 30% from current uses.Novelties Developed To Improve Bitumen's ProductionAfter more than a decade of research and pilot testing, the producer deployed a new technology called LASER (liquid addition to steam to enhance recovery) that complements its CSS processes. The technology co-injects low concentrations of pipeline diluent (gas condensate) with steam. The diluent helps to further reduce the viscosity of the bitumen and aids its ability to flow. The condensed water, diluent and heated oil are produced back from the same well after a soak phase. (Click to enlarge)This process results in improved, more efficient oil production. By adding the diluent, the technology enables more resource to be recovered from mature wells for the same amount of steam injected in traditional CSS production. LASER technology has the potential to reduce GHG intensity by more than 25%.Recently, Imperial Oil commissioned a pilot project at Cold Lake that adds light hydrocarbon solvent to SAGD wells SA-SAGD, which is recovered during production. By adding solvent to steam, it can produce more bitumen with the same amount of steam, resulting in lower energy and GHG emission intensity. (Click to enlarge)Source: Barclays Americas Select Franchise Conference, May 2013The objective was to improve the SAGD process similar to the improvements LASER has shown over traditional CSS. This technology has the potential to enhance recovery for certain reservoirs in the Cold Lake and Athabasca areas. Steam injection for the pilot project's well pairs is underway. The pilot project received recognition from the Alberta government through the Innovative Energy Technologies Program.According to Imperial Oil, every dollar invested in the oil sands creates about $8 in economic activity, with much of that value generated outside Alberta: in Canada, the U.S. and around the world. According to CERI (Canadian Energy Research Institute), large investment in the oil sands industry contributes to increased economic activity in the rest of North America by stimulating demand for goods and services across a wide range of industries.As oil sands production increases, CERI estimates that 343,000 new U.S. jobs will be created between 2011 and 2015, adding an estimated $34 billion to U.S. GDP in 2015, $40.4 billion in 2020, and $42.2 billion in 2025.Cold Lake Operations (Click to enlarge)Cold Lake bitumen is located more than 1312 feet below the surface of the ground and the company extracts it by injecting steam into the oil sands to thin the heavy bitumen and enables it to flow to the surface through wellbores. Its Cold Lake operations are located in northeastern Alberta near the communities of Cold Lake and Bonnyville.Source: Barclays Americas Select Franchise Conference, May 2013Imperial Oil leases at Cold Lake cover about 301 square miles of oil sands and it operates four plants in the area: Leming, Maskwa, Mahihkan and Mahkeses. In 1985, it commissioned its Phase 1-10 and it currently produces 110,000Bls/d. Its Phase 11-13, commissioned in 2004, added 30,000Bls/d. Cold Lake operations produced more than 160,000 barrels of bitumen per day in 2011, an annual record for the company.The Nabiye Project (Click to enlarge)Source: Imperial Oil Nabiye Project May 2013 UpdateIn 2004, Imperial Oil received regulatory approval to expand its Cold Lake operations in a new area called Nabiye. The expansion will include new producing well pads and a new bitumen-processing plant. In 2010, the company received approval to amend its development plan with a $2 billion expansion to include technology improvements such as a field development plan to reduce surface footprint, a co-generation facility to enhance energy efficiency and sulfur-removal facilities to reduce sulfur-dioxide emissions.The recent updates are the following:Source: Imperial Oil Nabiye Project May 2013 UpdateThe Nabiye Project, complete at 37% by year-end, should be operational by 2014, adding 40,000Bls/d to more than 140,000Bls of daily production.Core FinancialsImperial Oil reported earnings of $3.8 billion or $4.42 per share in 2012, up from $3.4 billion or $3.95 per share in 2011. Cash flow from operations totaled $4.9 billion last year, an increase of $100K at $4.8 billion the year before. Total debt at the end of 2012 amounted to $1.65 billion up from $1.21 billion in 2011, a 36.4% increase. The company reported an industry-leading return on capital employed of 23%, even with significant investments in assets under construction.In 2012, capital and exploration expenditures spent were $5.7 billion. For 2013, it anticipates capex to be about $7 billion. Cold Lake continued to operate with reliability, achieving a production rate of 154,000Bls/d. Average total daily production of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids was 282,000Boe/d before royalties.Source: Imperial Oil's 2012 Annual ReportImperial Oil holds an extensive and attractive portfolio of future development opportunities with a proved and non-proved resource base of over 16 billion oil-equivalent barrels.

However, the company owns several lands in the Athabasca region as well. Furthermore, a very promising project, Kearl, is underway. A forthcoming article will explore the Athabasca assets and the potential of Kearl project.

841871,24389,2012-09-02T04:30:14-04:00,,"Edited by Marianna AvilkinaImperial Oil (NYSEMKT:IMO), Canada's second largest petroleum company, is engaged in the upstream business of exploration, extraction, and production of crude oil and natural gas for the past 130 years. Additionally, the company is involved in the downstream business of refining and marketing as well as the chemical business. ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) owns 69.6 percent of Imperial's shares, so many of Exxon's products are sourced from Imperial Oil. The majority of the company's operations take place in Canada's oil sands - including Cold Lake, Kearl, and Athabasca - though it is also exploring, developing, and producing oil on offshore rigs.The scale of Imperial's operations can be estimated by considering that Imperial Oil produces a gross 247,000 barrels of crude oil and natural gas per day. In 2011, it completed a $4.1 billion capital and exploration program in order to enhance its upstream capacity. The company continues investing in expansion as it is investing up to $40 billion to double its upstream production. It also had an average return on capital of 25.4 percent and earned $3.4 billion.Imperial's impressive financial results have become possible due to its incomparable network of businesses spread across the United States and Canada. Diversification has allowed it to reap the benefits of demand from a larger market area. It is notable that Imperial Oil has paid increased annual dividends per share over the past seventeen consecutive years. Moreover, the last year was marked as the 120th year in which Imperial has paid a dividend without any interruptions to shareholders. It is also the only company in the Canadian industry that has maintained an AAA rating from Standard & Poor's.Financial SituationIn 2011, Imperial's cash flow was at $4.8 billion. The company's EPS has demonstrated a steady, positive trend. As of August 31, 2012, the EPS level was standing at $4.12, up from $2.59 in the last year. Return on capital was also an industry leading 25.4 percent. In addition, last year the company invested $4.1 billion in capital and exploration projects, covering most of the costs of such efforts through internal funding. However, $1.2 billion was ultimately raised as debt by the end of the year. Nevertheless, a cash on hand level of $1.2 billion allowed Imperial to end 2011 with zero net debt.The dividends declared at the end of 2011 were equivalent to $373 million, or $0.44 per share by, by the end of 2012's second quarter, they had soared to $848 million, or $0.75 per share. Gross earnings increased because of lower royalty costs and stronger industry margins. However, they were offset by a weak Canadian dollar, higher maintenance costs and lower costs of commodities. For the year 2012 up to the present, Imperial reported a net income of $635 million, compared to $726 million by this time last year. This unfortunate decline in income was mainly due to lower commodity prices accompanied by higher maintenance costs.Company Stock and Dividend ProfileImperial's main competitors are Valero Energy Corp. (VLO), Marathon Petroleum Corp. (NYSE:MPC), China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (SNP) and Suncor Energy (SU). The company's current market capitalization is $46.11 Billion.The figure below shows that Imperial's stock price roughly been following the market trends. However, in the last 12 months, it has underperformed the S&P 500 by about 6 percent.IMO data by YChartsSince 2009, Imperial's stock value has been volatile within the US market. Recent investment in exploration programs and full integration of new oil fields might have had affect on the price of Imperial. However, the rewards of this research are bound to emerge over the long-term as upstream production increases.The figure below demonstrates that the company has been performing well, in line with its main industry competitors. Compared to them, only Valero Energy (NYSE:VLO) shows potential to trump Imperial's performance. However, Suncor (NYSE:SU) could be a better choice for the future depending on their Q3 and Q4 performance. At present, the main reason to favor Imperial is its stable quote trend, which closely follows overall market performance trends.IMO data by YChartsAs of August 30, 2012, Imperial's price-to-earnings ratio was 11.0, compared to an industry average of 9.1. For the 52-week range, Imperial falls between $32.18 and $49.32. Meanwhile, the Return on Invested Capital is 23.08 percent, making it a leader in the market since last year. Imperial's Beta of 0.54 signals that the company's stock price is affected by the market price changes in a sensitive, but not very extreme, way. This supports Imperial's ability to maintain its own stability over the years.Furthermore, Imperial's five-year average dividend yield is 0.9 percent, which is very low when compared to the industrial average of 3.1 percent. 2012 will be the 18th consecutive year in which its dividends have grown, if they are increased from the $373 million paid in 2011. The current dividend value stands at $ 0.74 per share, the lowest value since Q2 of 2011.Present Economic OutlookAt the end of Q2, Imperial Oil experienced a 13 percent drop in revenue because of lower commodity prices and higher planned maintenance. Compared to last year, oil production also decreased due to planned maintenance activities at the Syncrude and Cold Lake mining fields. The $10.9 billion Kearl oil sand facility is almost completed and expected to start up later this year. Meanwhile, the Cold Lake oil sands rolled out 160,000 barrels of oil per day in 2011, achieving an industry record for production.Imperial continues its decade long growth strategy in 2012 by investing from $35 billion to $40 billion in an upstream enhancement project to increase production in order to meet global demand. Imperial expects the global demand for oil and gas to double by the year 2020 and is taking appropriate steps to meet this need. The company's demonstrated ability to finance all these expansions from internal revenues puts it in a strong position for the future. Increases in both production levels and profits can be expected over the coming years.SummaryThe slump in oil demand has forced Imperial to shut off and auction some of its offshore refineries in order to reduce losses. This is also a move to fund its expansion program that focuses more on extraction and upstream functions. However, all indicators predict stability for Imperial Oil, even though its dividend yield and price quotes are average at best. It is recommended to hold this stock for future activity, because this company is currently undergoing a significant transition. The returns on newly invested assets for Imperial are predicted to perform particularly well in the future. Investors should look forward to holding the stocks, but buyers may prefer to consider Suncor Energy or Valero Energy for a higher short-term return.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

With this ruling, the NEB effectively approved the building of a 1,200-kilometer (750-mile) long Mackenzie Valley Pipeline, part of the Mackenzie Gas Project. (For comparison, this is about the same distance as New York City to Lexington, KY or Seattle, WA to Sacramento, CA.)The Mackenzie Valley Pipeline would run from the Beaufort Sea all the way down the Northwest Territories (NWT) and into Alberta. It's designed to carry up to 34.3 million cubic metres (1.2 billion cubic feet) of natural gas per day. The Mackenzie Gas Project also includes three onshore natural gas fields, a pipeline-gathering system to bring the gas from the development fields to a processing plant, and a 457-kilometer (286-mile) pipeline to carry natural gas liquids from Inuvik, NWT to an existing oil pipeline at Norman Wells, NWT.[Click all to enlarge]The owners of this project are Imperial Oil (NYSEMKT:IMO),  the Mackenzie Valley Aboriginal Pipeline Limited Partnership (an LP established for the benefit of the First Nation peoples in the area), ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP), Shell Canada (NYSE:RDS.A), and ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) (owner of 70% of the shares of Imperial Oil). They will be required to obtain various permits and authorizations from other boards and government agencies before construction can commence, but they’ve already cleared the most important hurdle.Why is the Mackenzie Gas Project such a big deal? The Mackenzie Delta, up along the Beaufort Sea, and the areas along the Mackenzie River are already known to contain large reserves of natural gas – and may in fact contain massive amounts. The three major gas fields discovered to date in the Mackenzie Delta by the project owners can produce about 800 million cubic feet of gas per day. Let’s put this in perspective:(From the Mackenzie Gas Project website)One million cubic feet of natural gas can heat five homes for a year. The three fields delineated as worthwhile thus far can produce 800 million cubic feet per day. That means that every day they are expected to produce enough to heat 4,000 homes for a year. If they pump for 300 days a year, that’s 240 billion cubic feet per year, or roughly a quarter of the amount it would take to heat every gas-heated Canadian home. Heck, the 100%-IMO-owned Taglu Field alone (discovered by IMO 40 years ago – yes, the regulatory process does take time) is estimated to hold 3 trillion cubic feet of gas, enough to heat every gas-heated Canadian home for three years.And these fields also contain large amounts of natural gas liquids (NGLs) like butane and pentane, which will also be produced with the natural gas to the tune of somewhere between 12,000 and 15,000 barrels per day. These condensates couldn’t be better located or come at a better time. The massive oil sands in Canada contain more oil than Saudi Arabia. But unlike Texas sweet crude or even Saudi’s slightly more sour (higher sulfur content) oil, the oil sands are more like sludge. How do you move sludge? You dilute it. And since oil and water don’t mix, the best product to dilute a petroleum-based product with is another petroleum-based product. While most everyone else is chasing the latest tout on a new Marcellus play that has a short economic life, I’m quietly buying up NGLs and natural gas that will last a lifetime. And that’s what I like best about Imperial Oil. Their properties will be producing for my lifetime, your lifetime, and your kids’ lifetime.My friend Bob Howard, editor of the financial letter Positive Patterns, has produced an exhaustive and brilliant study of Imperial’s properties. I’ll condense it here, but if you ask, he may provide you with the original and a copy or two of his excellent publication. Here’s a brief summary of Bob’s analysis:The Kearl Oil Sands/Athabasca Tar Sands, Alberta: Oil production is projected to be around 110,000 barrels per day beginning in 2013 and ramping up from there. Reserves are estimated at 5 billion barrels of oil. 70% owned by IMO.Cold Lake/Athabasca Tar Sands, Alberta: Production averaged 139,000 barrels a day last quarter. In this location, IMO owns the rights to 194,000 acres.Syncrude/Athabasca Tar Sands, Alberta: IMO owns 25% of Syncrude and its share of this project is 65,000 barrels a day. In addition, IMO owns rights to 63,000 acres in the area.Horn River/NE British Columbia: 338,000 net acres in a 50/50 deal with XOM. As Bob says, this “could be a significant field but NG-shale is fun, quick, big, and then – over – the ""drop-off"" in almost all NG/fracked/horizontal drills-shale fields, etc. -- seems to be more severe than expected, in almost every case after the first five years the drop off is quite large, and the other thing you must remember is these fields require a lot more maintenance – which is one of the reasons the equipment/makers etc. are acting so wonderful!”Beaufort Sea: Key leases are offshore, deep and surely severe – but valuable someday. The main driver here is BP, and IMO is in for 25%. Again, directly from Bob: “These properties are huge – the Northwest Territories come to about 507,000 acres, a staggering number in a staggering place where it will be very expensive to do business, but at $150 oil it should be just fine and by then you can expect this to do something for the balance sheet.  Remember, not many companies have a 10-million acre land bank in Canada – I can’t think of many, can you? A place like this has value for the future and it is money in the bank.”Atlantic-offshore, Orphan Basin: Known as the “Orphan Basin,” this includes the offshore areas of Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and Labrador.Norman Wells: Conventional oil in NWT. Nets about 34,000 barrels and about the same in NG.Sable Islands: IMO has a 9% share of this shallow water natural gas venture. And it owns some nice rights in this area.I see Imperial Oil, King of the Wild Frontier, as having as much experience exploring, producing, and shipping from the cold frozen North as the Norwegians do in the North Sea. For all those Chicken Littles who’ve been saying the world is running out of fossil energy, I say what I’ve said for the last 40 years when anyone ranted to me about this: You invest in ethanol, hydrogen and solar, I’ll invest in what I call Nature’s Giant Storage Batteries – oil gas, and coal. I predict there will be more elephant finds in the frozen north and on the world's continental shelf offshore in the coming decades than anyone today dares to dream. And when it is discovered, I want to own the crème de la crème of who can find it, get to it, get it to the rest of the world, and clean up after themselves. That leads me to IMO.If you can find another company with this kind of experience, capability, depth and acreage – some 10 million acres of mostly-perpetual leases – tell me. I’ll be buying that one, as well. Speaking of which: When should you buy? We bought our most recent batch at 36-37 a couple months back, in late November and early December. It ran to 54 before backing off to 51. If the market pulls back, as I expect it will, panicky traders will sell the good along with the bad. In fact, counter-intuitively, most will sell their best stuff because to sell their worst means they must acknowledge they made a mistake. When they sell the good stuff, make sure you have some cash on hand. (See recent article here about that.) If I see IMO anywhere below 45, I’ll be adding to our positions. In the 30s, I’ll bet the ranch.By the way, I occasionally get comments from some who grouse that I’m telling them about a company at 51 rather than at 37. For those tiresome sorts, note that my first article on SA about IMO was written in August of 2009. I’ve written 10 since, on various subjects – China, Canada writ large, fossil fuels in general, wind, etc. -- that reinforced my opinion on IMO, during which time, through mid-December, it was still available at 37. I’m afraid if this article doesn’t whet the interest of those readers, they’ll just have to buy it from the rest of us when it hits 100 and is suddenly popular.Visit IMO's website here.Disclosure: We, and/or those clients for whom it is appropriate, are long IMO.

1273531,45761,2013-03-14T10:49:42-04:00,,"Thesis & Catalyst For Imperial OilThe market is very pessimistic about Imperial Oil's (NYSEMKT:IMO) ability to grow its earnings. If you believe that these fears are unfounded (which we do) then Imperial Oil offers patient investors a Gross IRR in the range of 15.2% to 24.9% over the next 5 years.The market is forecasting zero to negative earnings growth over the next 5 years. We are anticipating average annual earnings per share growth of 13.0% over the next 5 years. Once Imperial Oil starts to deliver, investors should expect to receive 13.0% annual average earnings per share growth, a 1.1% current dividend yield and possible multiple expansion.In addition we have analyzed Imperial's valuation relative to its peer group and conclude that it is 17.9% undervalued relative to Exxon (NYSE:XOM).In Chart A below, you can see how Imperial has steadily grown both its net income and cashflows over the last ten years. We believe Imperial Oil is the highest quality and most well run company in its sector and offers quality earnings and growth at a fair price.Relative ValuationIn figure 2 below, we have calculated the 5 Year Average Return On Invested Capital for Imperial's peer group. The average is 10.7% compared to 19.7% for Imperial. The average Price To Book Ratio for Imperial's peers is 1.3 compared to 2.3 for Imperial. From this we can estimate a fair value for Imperial's Price To Book Ratio of 2.4x (19.7% / 10.7% * 1.3). This implies 6.2% relative undervaluation. What particularly stands out here is that Exxon trades on a higher Price To Book Ratio than Imperial (2.4x) and has a 5 Year Average Return On Invested Capital of 17.1% (lower than Imperial). This implies that Imperial is 17.9% undervalued relative to Exxon, which we think is a great Relative Value trade given that Exxon owns 69.6% of Imperial.Calculation Of Expected ReturnsEarnings Per Share EstimateThere are 4 building blocks to our earnings per share estimate, Implied Growth In Earnings derived from Invested Capital, Organic Growth, Earnings Per Share Uplift from Share Buybacks and Earnings Per Share Dilution from stock compensation.1. Implied Growth Earnings Per ShareFirstly we took a look at Imperial Oil's cash flows to see how much cash it is generating and how it has historically deployed that cash (Table 1 below). We use our own Adjusted Operating Cashflow number that includes proceeds from employee stock options.Table 2 below breaks down how Adjusted Operating Cashflows are deployed. Over the last 10 years, the company has invested on average 32.8% of its Adjusted Operating Cashflows back into its business either in the form of Acquisitions or Growth Capex, 22.9% of Adjusted Operating Cashflows were required to maintain its assets (otherwise known as Maintenance Capex), 9.7% was paid out in Dividends and 30.1% went into Share Buybacks. In the last 5 years the company has spent 55.8% of Adjusted Operating Cashflows on Growth Capex and Acquisitions, 9.6% was paid out in Dividends and 15.3% was spent on Share Buybacks. Going forward, we estimate that spending 14.2% of Adjusted Operating Cashflows on Share Buybacks is sustainable without changing the capital structure of the company.Implied Growth Earnings Per Share represents the increase in earnings we expect to see from Invested Capital. The stock has a 10-year average Return On Invested Capital of 19.7% as can be seen in Chart 1 below. If we multiply the 10 Year Average Return On Invested Capital of 19.7% by the 55.8% of Adjusted Operating Cashflow spent on Growth Capex and Acquisitions, we get 11.0%, which is what we expect to be the Growth Earnings Per Share over the next five years.Chart 2 below shows the quarterly Return On Invested Capital since 2007. We can see that returns have been extremely stable over the last few years and there is no reason to assume that this situation will change.2. Organic Earnings Per ShareImperial Oil has three segments, Oil and Gas Exploration and Production (Upstream), Refining (Downstream) and Chemicals. In 2012, 50% of Net Income was derived from Upstream, 47% from Downstream and 4% from Chemicals.It is problematic to calculate the trend growth of the existing business excluding the effect of Invested Capital (Acquisitions and Growth Capex), as this is very reliant on the market prices of Oil, Gas & Gasoline. We have taken a prudent view and assumed stable Oil, Gas & Gasoline prices going forward given the offsetting variables of growing global supply and increasing population. This is what we refer to as Organic Earnings Per Share. Extrapolating the sales trend forward, we assume a compound annual growth rate of 0% over the next 5 years.3. Earnings Per Share Uplift from BuybacksIn Table 4 below we have estimated how much we anticipate Earnings Per Share to grow based on the % of Adjusted Operating Cashflow used for Share Buybacks. Based on the current market capitalization, we estimate the company can sustain buying back 14.2% of its stock every year.4. Dilution from Stock CompensationIn Table 5 below we have estimated the dilutive effect on earnings of the company's stock compensation plans. Over the last 5 years, the average annualized dilution to the basic share count was -0.2%Table 6 below pulls together the four drivers of our Earnings Per Share estimate. We calculate 13.0% expected Earnings Per Share growth over the next 5 years. This assumes stable margins throughout that period.Our next step is to identify the assumptions we will use to calculate the Internal Rate Of Return for the stock. Table 7 below shows the current P/E ratio of the company of 10.1, which is calculated based on a time weighting of the trailing 12 month P/E and the forward P/E. In addition we identified that over the last 5 years, the company's P/E has traded at 0.96x the S&P 500's P/E, which would imply a P/E of 14.62. The current trailing 12 month P/E of the S&P 500 is 15.3.In Table 8 below we calculate the 5 year Internal Rate Of Return of holding Imperial Oil stock based on 3 scenarios. Scenario 1 assumes that in 5 years, the stock still trades on its current P/E ratio of 10.1. Scenario 2 assumes that in 5 years, the stock trades based on its average relative P/E to the S&P 500 of 0.96 which would be 14.6x. Scenario 3 assumes that in 5 years, the stock trades on a market multiple currently 15.3x (for the S&P 500).ConclusionIn conclusion, we believe that for patient investors, a minimum gross return of 15.2% will be realized. Once Imperial Oil starts to deliver these earnings, we could see an earlier re-rating of the stock resulting in shorter-term gains for the more speculative investor.RisksImperial Oil is exposed to Oil, Gas, Chemical and Gasoline Prices. Price volatility in these asset classes can have a significant effect on Imperial's earnings.Disclosure: I am long IMO. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

2230933,65713,2014-05-21T14:21:06-04:00,"The company offers an Exxon-like balance sheet, but with production growth and long life reserves of 40 years.IMO, a AAA company, has been ignored by energy bulls with appetites for less diverse drillers operating in costly environments in North Dakota, Australia and the Caspian region.IMO is held back by short-term worries about Keystone XL pipeline completion, issues surrounding transportation of crude via rail, and environmental opposition to oil sands.The company has excellent dividend coverage. An inflection point has been reached where operating cash flow (Q1 2014) is roughly 8x or 10x the dividend.Given a clear path for expanding Kearl from 70K barrels (in Q1 2014) to 345K barrels in 2020, dividends should expand commensurately.","Imperial Oil Ltd. (NYSEMKT:IMO) is one of Canada's largest integrated oil companies. It is involved in the exploration, production and sale of crude oil and natural gas, and is one of Canada's largest petroleum refiners (with 421K barrels of capacity at FYE 2013).IMO, 70% owned by Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), plans to double its energy output to 600K BOE/day a day by 2020. Based on the growth and the diversity of the business, the shares could see dividend growth to $1.25 per year. Dividend growth could therefore improve by 17% per year, or from roughly $0.49 to $1.25 at the end of the decade.The company made investments of about $4.5 B during 2013, primarily to progress the development of reported proved undeveloped reserves, especially those associated with the Kearl project. Production from the initial development commenced in the second quarter of 2013. By 2013 year-end, the Kearl expansion project was 72 percent complete.The company's reputation for operational excellence has been hurt by cost overruns on the first phase of the Kearl project, which is now projected to cost $12.9 billion Canadian dollars (US$11.9 billion), about $5 billion more than originally estimated.In Q1 2014, gross production from the Kearl initial development was 70K barrels per day (50K barrels Imperial's share). Production continued to ramp up during Q1 2014 as progress was made towards stabilizing production at the targeted rate of 110K barrels per day (78K barrels Imperial's share).The Kearl expansion project was 72% complete at the end of 2013. The Kearl expansion project remains on schedule for a 2015 start-up and is expected to produce 110K barrels of bitumen per day, before royalties, of which the company's share would be about 78K barrels per day.Potential future debottlenecking of both the initial development and expansion would increase output to reach the regulatory capacity of 345K barrels of bitumen per day by about 2020, of which the company's share would be about 245K barrels per day.Oil sands leases have an exploration period of fifteen years and are continued beyond that point by meeting the minimum level of evaluation, payment of rentals, or by production. The majority of the acreage in Cold Lake, Kearl and Syncrude is continued by production.Kearl and a heavy-oil field called Cold Lake, now under expansion, will account for the bulk of Imperial's production. Part of Imperial's appeal is that these fields have very long estimated reserve lives-up to 40 years.Growth With Lower Geopolitical RiskThe slide from a recent XOM presentation shows how important Kearl and Cold Lake projects are to the success of XOM going forward. By owning IMO, an investor could avoid political risk in Papua New Guinea, Australia and Russia. All of these areas require extensive government and community consultation, although it must be admitted that Alberta is not devoid of political risk.How Does IMO Currently Stack Up?Given the heavy reliance on Kearl, Cold Lake and Syncrude for future cash flows, and that capital spending is at a high for 2014, free cash flow generation in the latter half of the decade is tied to performance of the oil sands business. These are analyzed below.Average Daily Production of OilThe company's average daily oil production by final products sold during the three years ended Dec. 31, 2013, was as follows: Production in thousands of barrels per day, net. All reported production volumes were from Canada.The company's bitumen production volumes included production volumes from the Cold Lake operation for all years presented in the table above and, beginning in 2013, also included production volumes from the Kearl initial development (16K barrels per day gross, 15K net). This shows how dramatic Kearl will be to IMO in 2017 through 2020 as production ramps up.Review of Principal Ongoing Activities Other Than Kearl-- Cold LakeDuring 2013, average net production at Cold Lake was about 127K barrels per day and gross production was about 153K barrels per day.Most of the production from Cold Lake is sold to refineries in the United States. The remainder of Cold Lake production is shipped IMO's refineries and to third-party Canadian refineries.The Province of Alberta, in its capacity as lessor of Cold Lake oil sands leases, is entitled to a royalty on production at Cold Lake. Royalty rates are based upon a sliding scale determined by the price of crude oil.-- Syncrude (25% owned by IMO)Syncrude Canada Ltd. is one of the world's largest producers of synthetic crude oil from oil sands. It has a nameplate capacity of 350K barrels/day, equivalent to about 13% of Canada's consumption. It has approximately 5.1 billion barrels of proven and probable reserves (11.9 billion when including contingent and prospective resources). Including fully realized prospective reserves; current production capacity could be sustained for well over 90 years.IMO holds a 25 percent participating interest in Syncrude, a joint venture established to recover shallow deposits of oil sands using open-pit mining methods to extract the crude bitumen, and to produce a high-quality, light (32 degree API), sweet, synthetic crude oil. The produced synthetic crude oil is shipped from the Syncrude site to Edmonton, Alberta by Alberta Oil Sands Pipeline Ltd.In 2013, IMO's share of Syncrude's net production of synthetic crude oil was about 65K barrels per day and gross production was about 67K barrels per day. The company's share of Syncrude's gross production in the first quarter was 73K barrels per day, up from 65K barrels in the first quarter of 2013.Downsides:Capital ResourcesConclusionGiven the company is shareholder-friendly, has a clear path to doubling production in six years, and is at the peak of capital spending in Q2 and Q3 2014, IMO could reasonably trade in line with S&P 500 names. Remember, less than 3% of the companies in the index have the AAA rating, and many don't have the same growth prospects.With a market P/E of 17x, and projected 2014 earnings of $3.80, the stock could reasonably see $64.60. Currently the shares trade at $49, indicating an upside of 32%.Disclosure: I am long XOM. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

249877,20089,2011-02-01T01:00:28-05:00,,"We recommend current purchase of the common stock of Imperial Oil (NYSEMKT:IMO) for unlevered appreciation potential of 51% to a McDep Ratio of 1.0 where price would equal Net Present Value (NPV) of $62 a share. On December 28, we raised NPV from $48 a share on the basis of a long-term oil price of $100 a barrel, up from $75. The stock also has unique appeal as the only Canadian company investing in a completely new, large scale oil sands mine during the past two years of economic lull. The Kearl facility is expected to begin producing marketable bitumen (heavy oil) late next year at 110,000 barrels daily (bd), 77,000 to IMO’s 70% interest. Adding that amount to current corporate oil production before royalty of about 250,000 bd suggests 2013 volume 30% higher than 2010. While it might still be early, such prospects may add a little excitement to the stock of a company that has been a solid performer for 130 years as the bluest chip Canadian industrial corporation.Ultimate Kearl Capacity 345,000 BDThe Kearl mine will send bitumen directly to conventional refineries without the more intensive upgrading undertaken by the 25% Imperial-owned Syncrude project. Apparently, solvent extraction substitutes for cokers and related processing units. Marketable bitumen sells for less than Syncrude product, but the tradeoff in a new plant is economical considering the availability of more sophisticated refining capacity in the rest of North America and the high costs of construction in northern Alberta.The Province of Alberta has given regulatory approval for ultimate producton from the Kearl facility of 345,000 bd (see chart Production Outlook below). At the same time, Imperial undertakes to expand production at its Cold Lake in situ oil sands project 20% by 2015. Syncrude targets expansion to 540,000 bd by 2020 from 2010 volume of 293,000 bd. Adding it all up, management suggests total IMO oil production could double within 10-15 years, which implies annual growth of 5-7% a year.14 Billion Barrels of ResourcesManagement’s assessment of its resource potential at 14 billion barrels equivalent is some 5 times proven reserves of 2.5 billion. NPV is about what we would estimate for large cap non-Canadian companies considering cash flow for the next twelve months and adjusted life for proven reserves only. NPV for Canadian peers includes some additional value for probable reserves not disclosed in the same fashion by IMO. Finally, the NPV estimate gives little credit today for 3 trillion cubic feet of IMO natural gas waiting for a pipeline from the arctic or a large acreage position in the Horn River shale gas of British Columbia.Some of our estimate of NPV is anticipatory as the futures market is not yet at $100 a barrel. Yet the trend in oil price for the next six years suggests $100 may not be far away.Conventional Oil Mostly GoneWhile oil volume was building over the years from Cold Lake and Syncrude, the overall volume was dampened by diminishing conventional oil production. In addition to normal decline, IMO sold properties when they became more suitable for other owners. Now the company is left with large Cold Lake and Syncrude whose inclining volumes will be accentuated with new volume from Kearl. Little of that shows in the comparatively flat trend we project for the next twelve months as we do for most companies for the purpose of consistent valuation.Unique among Large Cap Global Oil and Gas Stock IdeasCanadian oil producers are low McDep Ratio investments in energy for global growth. Canadian reserves are the most abundant in an advanced political economy. Uniquely, IMO is just two years away from a 30% volume increase by December 2011. As for most of our buy recommendations, IMO stock is in a price uptrend compared to its 200-day average.Originally published on January 7, 2011."

Like XOM does around the world; IMO has upstream assets and downstream refining and retail operations in Canada. It also has an AAA rated balance sheet and above peer safety performance, relying on XOM approach to safety and operations in general.Because XOM owns about 70% of the company, you can own an interest and effectively partner with XOM. The benefits the XOM relationship brings to IMO include access to R&D and a talent pool for executives that are the best in the industry.Its refining and marketing operation is not immune to the cyclical nature of that business, and is not a main part of an investment thesis in my view. However, IMO has been able to obtain above average return on capital for its downstream business.IMO is clearly focused on growing its upstream business. Specifically, it plans to double oil production from 300k bpd in 2012 to 600k bpd by 2020. It expects capital expenses of about $3Bln in each of the next 5 years after having spent over $5Bln per year in the last five.Investor day presentation, available on IMO website.Normally, such an aggressive growth plan in upstream would require caution from investors, as oil projects tend to be complex and can also be subject actual reservoir performance risk. This is not the case for Imperial's projects. The relatively low risk of this company's projects, their 40+ year lifespan and their economic characteristics make this company a good investment to hold for a long term investor assuming a constructive view on long term oil price.Here are some arguments to support such a view on long term oil prices. Despite the price of a barrel rising from $20 to above $100 in the last fifteen years, and repeated warnings of eventual shortage and ensuing chaos, we have not been able to find, and no one is close to finding a substitute for oil. Because of the high density of energy content of crude at room temperature and atmospheric pressure and the ease of handling and storing oil, it has been and will continue to be the primary fuel for transportation. Some heavy transport fleets like trains or ships may gradually switch to natural gas, especially in countries where it can be sourced cheaply. But on a global scale, planes and passenger cars, boats and motorcycles will continue using oil derived fuels.What has been achieved in the last couple of decades, incentivized by the rising prices and environmental concerns, is a tremendous improvement in efficiency. This is encouraging and should continue to be driven by high prices and regulation trends. It is encouraging because nobody can argue with the fact that the world's oil stock is a limited amount and will therefore eventually be depleted. Despite the success of producing from shale in the USA, companies still have to embark on risky and expensive ""unconventional"" projects in offshore fields, or in politically unstable areas in an attempt to keep production levels stable. Due to conventional fields declining production, XOM itself has struggled to keep production around 4m bpd despite many new major projects coming online in the last few years.A high price is needed to keep demand growth under control and to incentivize the risky capital intensive investments required to offset declining fields. In addition, if for some reason (like what happened in 2008) prices were to fall significantly, independent producers like XOM and IMO get to free ride on the OPEC put. This artificial supply adjustment is not found on other commodities and reduces the risk of experiencing a prolonged period of low prices.Going back to Imperial's projects; their low risk and long life profile comes from the characteristics of the resource base being exploited. IMO operates in Canada's oil sands, which means the extraction process is more akin to a mining operation than the exploration and drilling process.Imperial is expanding, its operations at Cold Lake. This is an in-situ oil sands facility that has been producing since 1,985. With each expansion, new methods are put in practice that improves the production efficiency and recoverable reserve estimates. With its Nabyie expansion, expected to cost $2Bln and start up in the next year and a half, IMO is committing to continued expansion of production of this long life asset (below projected potential, remember that production started 30 years ago!)Investor day presentation, available on IMO website.Cold Lake represents an important and low risk opportunity for IMO, but Kearl, its newest mine and main growth vehicle for the next 5 years. It started commercial operation late last year and will eventually produce +300k bpd. Kearl's resource is essentially on the surface which means it has been accurately measured and will not rely on reservoir pressure for extraction. Production is expected to last more than 40 years and Kearl's cash cost of producing a barrel is expected to stabilize at about $25 per barrel. This excludes depreciation and indirect costs like financing. With WTI in the high $90's there is a lot of margin for returns on the capital invested. In the short term, Kearl can't sell at WTI which has Oklahoma delivery; and until there is sufficient pipeline capacity, Kearl will sell at a discount to WTI for incremental transportation cost.IMO built Kearl in two equal phases expected to produce 100k bpd each and 175k bpd each after de-bottlenecking. Initial phase cost was $13bln. The second phase is being built much faster, has avoided delays due to experience from first phase and uses most of the engineering from the first phase so it will cost significantly less. To be conservative, let's assume the whole project ends up costing $25 Bln and it only achieves 300 kbpd instead of the planned 350 kbpd. At $25/ bbl cash cost, and $75/ bbl sale price, the project would earn $50/bbl, or $15 million per day and $5.5Bln per year. That is a solid 22% before tax return and 4.5 year payback on the $25Bln investment, assuming the long run sale price is constant. And 26% return and less than 4 year payback assuming long run price is $85/Bbl.Cold Lake cash costs and capex per new barrel are BOTH lower than Kearl, meaning the incremental returns will look even better. The cash produced from both expansions coupled with a lower capex profile in the next five years compared to the last five years means IMO is entering a ""harvesting"" phase were a lot of free cash flow resulting from past investment will become available for shareholders. Instead of seeing multiple expansions, IMO has traded at around 10 to 12x forward earnings for the last few years which indicates the market is not recognizing the change in risk and return profile for the company during that period. Should P/E multiple move up from 11, where it is now, to 15 (which is still below its long term average of 16), the stock should trade at around $66, implying a 38% upside potential."

That’s the view of RBC Capital Markets, which lifted its target price for Imperial from C$45 to C$49 and upgraded Canada’s largest and oldest integrated oil company from a “sector perform” rating to “outperform.”
The new rating is based on a 17% increase RBC is projecting for Imperial’s estimated 2007 and 2008 earnings, which in turn stems from the investment bank’s expectation that refining crack spreads will remain healthy.
Crack spreads are the difference between what an integrated oil company pays for product – oil – fed into its refinery and then pockets for the gasoline, diesel or jet fuel that flows out to consumers.
“Despite a 20% change in refining crack spreads in the past months, the share price of IMO has lagged its peers, despite having the most leverage to this commodity,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Gordon Gee, the recent winner the National Post Award for Excellence in Investment Research, wrote in a note to clients.

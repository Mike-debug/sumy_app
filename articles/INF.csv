I try to look for investments that may not be 1:1 correlated to market action. One source of potential differentiated returns is in closed-end funds trading at a discount to net asset value or NAV. Although discounts likely close or widen as the market comes and goes, there are other influences as well. These investments are by no means completely decoupled from the market, but I find some of them an attractive enough addition. Especially as I've been able to identify some safer type closed-end funds (fixed income, infrastructure, etc.) that I hope will help my portfolio weather a downturn while seeking out big discounts still provides that upside oomph!Today, I'll review the Brookfield Global Infrastructure Fund (INF) which is part of my closed-end fund cheat sheet. The cheat sheet contains positions in closed-end funds I have on.Brookfield Global Infrastructure Fund hopes to generate income by investing in publicly-traded infrastructure companies (equities). The fund mostly invests in the U.S. but aims to include some foreign country exposure at all times. It employs about 28% leverage.In Q4 2018, many closed-end funds got hit hard and discounts widened. This fund is no exception and it crashed hard in December perhaps due to tax loss selling. Followed by quite the quick rebound in early 2019.INF data by YChartsThe discount to NAV has been widening for a while now. It didn't rebound to the same extent early '19:INF data by YChartsFrom a historical perspective, the discount is wide but not unheard of:INF Discount or Premium to NAV data by YChartsIt all adds up to an implied distribution yield that's fairly impressive at 8.58%:INF Distribution Yield (TTM) data by YChartsWhat makes this fund a little less attractive than some of the other funds I've been reviewing is that it is full of equity exposure. There are both advantages and disadvantages to a closed-end fund full of equities vs. bonds. Overall, a discount on a closed-end fund is more valuable on a fixed income fund. If we are talking about some type of high yield securities, there isn't much difference between those and equity exposure. This particular equity fund contains equities of a ""safer"" kind namely infrastructure focused.I really like the manager here; Brookfield (BAM) and I really like the portfolio they've come up with, which also played into my consideration to buy into this closed-end vehicle. Brookfield is a private equity player focused on real asset investing on a global basis. They have considerable expertise around exactly these type of assets and I think the portfolio demonstrates that with lots of very attractive pipeline investments; MPLX (MPLX), Kinder Morgan (KMI), and Energy Transfer (ET) among others. Its biggest positions are Vinci (OTCPK:VCISF) and American Tower Corp. (NYSE:AMT) that offer a different type of infrastructure exposure. There are also some utilities and even Airports among its holdings, but it looks really geared towards midstream operators which probably tells us something about the value Brookfield perceives there.The average P/Es are quite elevated, but considering these are somewhat safer infrastructure assets and many are quite far from peak earnings, that's fine.Among all closed-end funds I've reviewed, this is one of my top favorites which is why I've included it in my cheat-sheet. I primarily like it because of the strong specialized manager, the portfolio being geared towards a space I believe to be undervalued in general (pipelines/midstream), and finally, the discount to NAV that's wide compared to history. The discount to NAV is also wide among the universe of U.S. traded closed-end funds."
4145551,103888,2018-02-12T06:04:49-05:00,"After writing an article on the Brookfield Real Assets Income Fund, I thought I would take a closer look at its Infrastructure-focused sibling.A tilt towards midstream companies makes this fund less of a diversified infrastructure play than its name suggests.Investors desiring leveraged exposure to the midstream space might want to investigate this fund further.","Recently, I wrote an article taking a look at the Brookfield Real Assets Income Fund (RA). Over the course of researching the fund, I thought that it might be interesting to research another publicly-traded closed-end fund that Brookfield manages, the Brookfield Global Listed Infrastructure Income Fund (INF).The fund was started in August of 2011, and its investment objective is to ""provide a high level of total return, with an emphasis on income."" The fund operates with a moderate deal of leverage (about 30%) and is comprised almost entirely of equity securities, with the exception of a bond issue from an Australian pipeline company and a few warrants issued by Teekay Offshore Partners (per the most recent N-Q filing).Investors in the Brookfield Global Listed Infrastructure Income Fund may be surprised to learn that over half of the assets in the fund are traded in the good ol' U.S. of A.A quick look through the fund's most recent disclosure of its holdings (as of September 30, 2017) shows a heavy concentration in American MLP companies, such as Enterprise Products Partners (EPD), Plains All American Pipeline (PAA), and Phillips 66 Partners (PSXP). Nonetheless, the fund does manage to give investors a good dose of exposure to some foreign infrastructure companies, particularly those traded in Canada, Europe, Brazil, and China. The chart below graphically illustrates the location of all of INF's holdings. The level of shading indicates the weight of that country within the portfolio.Source: Fund N-Q Filings. Data as of 09/30/2017. Chart by AuthorThe Brookfield Global Listed Infrastructure Income Fund has another major bias in its portfolio composition. About half of its portfolio is devoted to companies that are devoted to oil/gas pipelines in some way, shape, or form. For investors who desire the relatively stable cash flows which pipelines generate, this may be a positive. However, potential investors who already possess substantial holdings of midstream companies may not get much benefit from buying into a fund that duplicates many of their existing positions.Source: December 2017 INF Fact SheetOne of the possible advantages of investing in a leveraged closed-end fund is the ability to take advantage of borrowing rates that are lower than margin rates available to retail investors. Closed-end funds often have a borrowing advantage due to (1) the creditworthiness of their investment managers and (2) the fact that many closed-end funds' borrowing contains asset coverage provisions which limit the proportion of debt to the value of the fund. That gives the lender greater assurances that their loan is safe.As one of the world's premier alternative asset managers, Brookfield Asset Management has access to ample amounts of financial capital at inexpensive rates. As a result, the Brookfield Global Listed Infrastructure Income Fund finances its 30% leverage via a credit facility provided by BNP Paribas at an interest rate of 0.70% plus 3-month LIBOR. Compared to margin rates typically available to retail investors - usually at least 3% per year - this is a very competitive rate. Of course, investors should remember that some of these interest rate savings are offset by the various fees which Brookfield charges on the fund - an expenditure that works out to about 1.15% of the fund's net daily assets.The fund currently pays a monthly distribution of $0.0817, which at current prices works out to an annualized yield of about 8.1%. The fund also has a policy of paying out realized capital gains at least once per year. I have doubts about the sustainability of the current distribution rate due to the fact that (1) the distributions are primarily comprised of return of capital and (2) the fund has reduced its distribution in the past. While it is true that closed-end funds with large amounts of MLP holdings will necessarily have some return-of-capital component to their distributions, the history of cutting the distribution is an additional red flag that makes me cautious about the long-term sustainability of the current distribution level.Source: CEFconnectInvestors looking for bargain-priced assets are frequently drawn to closed-end-funds whose shares are trading at a discount to net asset value. In the case of the Brookfield Global Listed Infrastructure Income Fund, shares are currently trading at a 12% discount to their net asset value.Source: CEFconnectBefore getting too excited about this apparent ""bargain"", however, investors should keep in mind that INF has traded at a discount to its asset value for most of its existence. Therefore, investors shouldn't expect the INF's discount to NAV to disappear anytime soon. On the other hand, the Board of Directors of the fund have approved a share repurchase plan in an attempt to narrow the discount. Even if this action fails to eliminate the price/NAV gap, buying back fund assets at 88 cents on the dollar is accretive for existing shareholders.I purchased one share of the Brookfield Global Listed Infrastructure Fund in my personal Robinhood account several months ago. Having done further research on the fund, I don't think that I will be adding to my stake any time soon. I have issues with the fund's portfolio biases, and I believe that the fund's distribution will eventually have to be cut again. However, investors who are looking for a way to gain leveraged exposure to the midstream sector might want to take a closer look at the fund. INF's non-pipeline portfolio assets should add stability to the portfolio, while the fund's extensive midstream assets should continue to generate a stream of income for investors - at least until the next distribution cut.Disclaimer: Use my work as a starting point for your own due diligence, not as a substitute.

3976581,100806,2016-05-20T05:45:37-04:00,Germans believe the ECB has crossed a red line.Simply reducing interest rates is not enough.Europe's funds have the capabilities to invest in good infrastructure projects.,"Limits of Acceptable StimulusThe ECB has blurred the lines of acceptable stimulus, according to Jens Weidmann, the president of the German Bundesbank.This concept of 'acceptable stimulus' has been pushed by the Germans first under Axel Weber and now Mr. Weidmann. The concept has not been properly defined by the Germans to the point that they have almost become caricatures of themselves as we have all grown to accept that the Germans will always oppose decisions by the ECB.No other nation within the Eurozone criticizes the ECB as much as Germany. The question is whether this is due to a genuine concern about the future of the ECB or is it simply because it is not being done the German way.These are important because it gives an insight into the current split within the ECB and also insight into future ECB actions, especially if Jens Weidmann becomes the new ECB President by succeeding Mr. Draghi.The Germans are incredibly frightened of inflation, this is due to their experiences of hyperinflation during the Weimar Republic and thus their primary central goal is controlled inflation of no more than 2%. So when the Germans speak of acceptable stimulus, they are really speaking of no stimulus and austerity, especially in a negative interest rate environment when conventional monetary policy tools are not available anymore.Their reasoning is simply because there is an outside chance that inflation may catch hold and go out of control. It is interesting to also note that while the Germans have been speaking about overstimulation, they have not actually offered concrete proposals on how they would have managed the issues better in this environment.While I do not agree with the ECB about their methods of conducting monetary policy, I understand their reasoning because without it, the Eurozone will be in far worse shape than it is today.As I have said in previous articles, the ECB is trying to push money into the system through the banks but because of various constraints, banks have not been able to lend out as they would have liked to do because of the Basel rules and their pre-existing commitments on their balance sheet.One alternative would have been to set up development banks in the member states through which funds can be transferred directly into the real economy, where it can finance business development and growth.Within Europe, the European Investment Bank (EIB) plays such a role but does not really engage directly with the financial consumer whether they are businesses or individuals, but rather they primarily work through intermediaries like banks, investment funds or alternative financial providers.The net result of the current actions of the ECB is currently an asset bubble in the European financial market, whereas business and consumer spending remain depressed.While the ECB has continually sought to meet this noble goal of 2% inflation, it is proving to be much more complicated; this is not because of high inflation but extremely low inflation. This has resulted in the ECB continuing to increase the money supply and become a buyer of debt securities in order to stimulate spending and bring the inflation rate to the 2% goal.In my opinion, it seems that the Germans are being disingenuous because the Eurozone cannot be run like Germany which is largely export-orientated with a large internal market and an ageing population.Germany's goal is to maintain the value of the euro and ensure they remain competitive on the global markets.For the rest of the Eurozone, they have to contend with very high youth unemployment and chronic underinvestment in critical areas like research and development, and infrastructure. The main objective of the euro system is to maintain price stability, safeguarding the value of the euro and contribute to the soundness of the financial system in Europe.In analysing the actions by the ECB so far, it is clear that their actions have sought to fulfil their mission. The governing council has recently called for a three-pronged approach in its annual update on the global economy. The fund recommended that governments invest in infrastructure, keep interest rates low and embark upon wide-ranging economic reforms to boost growth.This is the route that they are taking as they seek to go further and further to mitigate the failure of governments to act decisively in the European Union.Some members of the council have suggested that low inflation had become entrenched, as weak price growth might have second-round effects for increases of wages and other prices. The ECB's minutes made clear that ""interest rates will remain very low for an extended period,"" and well beyond the end of the central bank's quantitative easing scheme.Nevertheless, the EU has become a classic case of the failure of conventional monetary policy. Simply playing within the boundaries of classical economics is not going to change anything, primarily because all interest rates do is either encourage people to borrow more or pay less on their financing costs.In our current global environment, people, companies and governments are already over-indebted and reluctant to borrow more and secondly, the economic uncertainty is forcing people to save more money and thus reducing spending, which would account for the persistently low inflation across the euro area.As this graph above shows, since 2006, private sector credit shot up significantly while household savings fell at the same time.It is very instructive to see gross household savings shooting up from 2009 to 2010. From then as money became even cheaper, savings rate fell again to a low in 2013, and it is now picking up again gradually because the public senses more global uncertainty.This second chart sheds even more light on this state of affairs because we see that loans to the private sector grew just as fast as money expansion. We have now reached a saturation point where low interest rates and abundant money have limited utility.I do not believe the answer is 'helicopter money' because that cannot be controlled but the concept of putting more spending money in people's hands is correct.One of the best ways to do this will be to reduce tax. The tax burden has increased steadily particularly in the last decade, it seems that whatever was given by the central banks was taken away by the respective finance ministries.This makes sense because whatever the finance ministries gain in higher tax, they lose from higher social security. The tax system in Europe makes very little economic sense at the moment.The second way that growth can be stimulated is by investing in creating jobs.What we have seen since 2013 is that the unemployment rate has been falling but it is still very high; in order to create jobs there has to be investment, but as global economic conditions worsened, nations have had this tendency to cut back on much-needed investment and thus slowing the economic expansion process down.The concept of infrastructure investment has been raised many times before but it is worth repeating; for example, sound transport investments sustain aggregate demand in the short run and secure solid investment returns in the long run.Furthermore, besides physical infrastructure, in Europe investments are needed to transform the transport system towards low carbon technologies and to deploy intelligent transport system to make better use of existing infrastructure. Extensive innovation in propulsion, navigation and alternative fuels are also therefore needed.When investments are done in Europe in these innovative sectors, they will also contribute to the improvement of the global industrial competitiveness of the EU, by ameliorating investment opportunities in sectors in which Europe and business leaders operate (in innovative construction, energy providers, clean and intelligent vehicles, logistical services, engineering consultants and alike).It has been shown that long-run transport investment levels (new investments) in developed EU economies have traditionally accounted for approximately 1% of GDP, whilst new Member States (MS) have been spending more as a percentage of GDP in order to catch up and complete their basic networks.Nevertheless, the recent trend that was made worse by the financial crisis is that this level of investment has decreased. In 2011, the EU 27 average was 0.7% of GDP. The short-term impact of such underinvestment may appear easily managed but in the long term it creates a backlog of maintenance, rehabilitation and new investments which will create further bottlenecks for trade and growth in Europe.When a study was made in the context of a 2001 IMF White Paper, it was calculated that in order for the European transport infrastructures to be able to cope with the expected increase in demand, investments of €1.5 trillion were necessary for the period 2010-2030, this was below the refugee crisis when millions poured into Europe and thus accelerating the need for infrastructure spending. The most intriguing idea of the study is that, according to the evidence gathered in a sample of advanced economies, ""An increase of 1 percentage point of GDP in investment spending raises the level of output by about 0.4 percent in the same year and by 1.5 percent four years after the increase.""In terms of figures, the needs of existing networks are estimated at some EUR 20 billion per year, but in Europe insurance and pension companies alone hold around €12 trillion of assets, equivalent to over 90% of EU GDP.These institutional investors are a reliable source of long-term capital, as they need to match their liabilities with long-maturity assets. This makes institutional investors particularly suitable to undertake counter-cyclical, long-term investments in sectors of the real economy characterized by high productivity, and therefore able to generate stable streams of revenues.Even if their level of investment in infrastructure is still limited, a growing interest in infrastructure debt is appearing. Such debt is usually long-dated and provides more attractive yield than other fixed-income products such as government or corporate bonds. This then allows the institutional investors to match their long-dated liabilities such as pensions and insurance pay-outs.This interest is reinforced by the current relatively low yield for government bond in high-rated countries; and because the yield on government bonds are currently so low, it will also help to reduce the discount rate demanded by these investors.I am a big believer in infrastructure and even though there is no direct European fund working in that area, there are good infrastructure ETFs that could give the investor access to the upside on these investments.An example will be iShares Global Infrastructure ETF (NASDAQ:IGF), I really like the geographical breakdown and sectors. For investors who want strong cash returns then this will be an ideal candidate to meet these investment goals.Labour Market ReformsFinally, the last area that I believe the EU needs is labour market reform. The chart below is very instructive because while we can pinpoint investments in productivity as one of the sources of economic growth, investments must be married to coherent labour relations.As this chart shows, as productivity rises labour costs in the EU did not fall but rose higher. In many parts of Europe, the cost to the employer for hiring an employee is almost half of that employer's salary. If that is reduced, then it releases employers to either hire more staff or pay higher salaries, but either way it is good for the economy as a whole.ConclusionIn conclusion, while we speak about monetary policy as an important tool, if we are going to see real GDP growth we must go beyond interest rates alone and see how we can put spending power in the hands of people in a sensible manner through tax cuts, more jobs and labour market reforms."
4031050,71525,2016-12-19T06:30:00-05:00,The changing of the guard in the U.S.More competition for commodities-Fewer regulations and infrastructure building will lower production cost and increase demand.Rapprochement with the Russians.A tough stance toward China.Commodity prices could react violently.,"In the world of commodities, Russia and China are both huge producers of raw materials but for many years it has been China that has been dominant on the demand side of the fundamental equation.Many industrial commodity prices hit rock bottom in late 2015 and early 2016. Crude oil dropped to the lowest price since 2003 when the active month NYMEX futures contract hit $26.05 per pound on February 11, 2016. Copper traded to its lows in January when it bottomed at $1.9355 per pound and other base ferrous metals hit their lows earlier this year. However, over the course of the year we have seen a rebound in all industrial commodity prices. The price of crude oil has almost doubled from the lows and copper has moved over 34% higher. Iron ore is more than twice the price per ton that it traded at less than one year ago.There is an inverse historical relationship between the dollar and most raw material prices. The dollar is the reserve currency of the world and it is the benchmark pricing mechanism for most raw materials. Commodities tend to move lower when the dollar appreciated but that has not happened lately. The U.S. currency is trading close to the highest level since 2003 and many commodity prices have shrugged off the strong dollar and have moved higher.Over the course of 2016 we have witnessed a political and economic change in the world. The Brexit vote in late June was a rejection of the European Union as was the no vote on a referendum in Italy at the beginning of December. Both votes were a rejection of globalism and the status quo in Europe. Perhaps the biggest change of the world came on November 8 in the world's richest and most powerful nation. The political change is likely to have huge ramifications for the other major powers in the world, Russia and China.The changing of the guard in the U.S.The election of Donald J. Trump as the forty-fifth President of the United States was unexpected and it was a watershed political and economic event for the nation and the world. The changing of the guard at the White House is always an event, but the rejection of the political party in power and election of a political outsider has serious ramifications for the global economy.Donald Trump ran on a platform of change. He pledged to make America great again and return the nation to a leadership role in the world. He promised an economic environment that would stimulate growth by decreasing taxes and renegotiating existing trade agreements with other nations to make them more fair to the United States. He promised an increase in good paying jobs and particular attention to security for the nation from terrorist threats and he stressed the need for energy independence.When it comes to the business environment, the President-elect has pledged to punish companies that move jobs away from the nation's borders and reward those who return to the U.S. and remain with a beneficial tax structure. He has also promised to rebuild America's infrastructure which has aged. The biggest infrastructure building project since the Eisenhower Administration in the 1950s was a cornerstone of his campaign. The chances are that after the inauguration on January 20, many of the campaign promises will begin to take traction. President-elect Trump will have the luxury of a majority in both houses of Congress which is likely have the road to legislation smooth and break the gridlock of past years.More competition for commodities - fewer regulations and infrastructure building will lower production cost and increase demandIt is likely that we will see a big change in the regulatory environment in the United States commencing in 2017. One of the areas hit hardest by regulation has been the energy sector. Compliance with regulation has increased the production costs for oil and gas in the United States and has been almost a death knell for the coal business. A wholesale change in the regulatory environment will lower total production cost for the energy sector as well as other businesses across the nation. At the same time, rebuilding the nation's roads, bridges, tunnels, airports and building a security wall along the southern border of the country will require raw materials or commodities which are the basic building blocks of infrastructure.The massive construction undertaking by a President that will likely be the builder-in-chief will increase pressure on the demand side of the fundamental equations for many commodities including metals, minerals and energy. When it comes to the energy markets it has been a very busy month since the Presidential election. The power-base of the international oil market has seemed to shift from OPEC, the international oil cartel to Russia, one of the world's leading producers of the energy commodity. In the world of oil production, the three nations that lead in production are Saudi Arabia, Russia and the United States.Rapprochement with the RussiansRussia has cemented their influence in the international oil market in 2016 and recently notched some impressive victories as Vladimir Putin together with his oil minister Alexander Novak and Rosneft chief Igor Sechin was able to convince OPEC to cut production. Throughout 2016, the Russians acted as a mediator within the cartel, solving some of the issues between Iran and Saudi Arabia that had prevented agreement on a production freeze or cut. OPEC announced the first production cut in nine years on November 30 with the help of Russia. As the price of oil moved higher in the wake of the OPEC move, Russia's star rose higher on the international scene and particularly in the Middle East. Arranging a deal amongst the OPEC oil ministers with so many divergent opinions and vested interests amounted to herding a bunch of wild cats.Following the OPEC move, the giant Russian oil producing company Rosneft entered into a deal with the Qatari sovereign wealth fund and Glencore, the international commodity producer and merchant firm, to sell 19.5% of their company for over $11 billion. The infusion of cash into Russia is enough to but the Russian deficit by one-fifth. Western sanctions have weighed on the Russian economy since 2014. However, things are looking up these days for Russia given the recent OPEC deal, the higher oil price, the cash infusion from the sale of a part of Rosneft and the Presidential election in the United States.Throughout the campaign, President-elect Trump stressed the need for a strong relationship with Russia and the Putin government. The incoming leader of the free world has said that Russian cooperation in fighting terrorism around the world trumps other issues that the U.S. has with the Russian leader. Moreover, Mr. Putin expressed his preference for a Trump Presidency during the early days of the campaign endearing him, to some extent to the U.S. President-elect. It is likely that Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin will establish a better working relationship with one and other than there has been for the past eight years. This week, the President-elect nominated Rex Tillerson, the Chairman and CEO of Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) as Secretary of State. Mr. Tillerson has a longstanding relationship with the Russian leader. All signs point to the strongest relationship of cooperation with Russia in many years for the new administration.However, while things are looking pretty rosy for a rapprochement with the Russians, the relationship with the Chinese government could be a little more difficult.A tough stance toward ChinaThroughout the campaign the President-elect took issue with Chinese economic policies as they impact the U.S. economy. He called China a currency manipulator for their benefit. He complained that unfair trade policies support the Chinese economy to the detriment of the U.S. economy.In the week's following his election, President-elect Trump took a congratulatory phone call from the President of Taiwan, a no-no from a diplomatic point of view in the eyes of the Chinese government. It has been reported by some in the media that former Senator Bob Dole advised the incoming President to take the call as a signal of strength to the Chinese that there is a new sheriff in town and the one-China policy that the U.S. has respected since 1979 could be changing. Throughout the campaign Mr. Trump expressed that he was prepared to play hardball with China but that he respected the business acumen of the Chinese and blamed previous U.S. administrations for not negotiating well to do beneficial deals for the United States. The builder-in-chief when it comes to infrastructure has also promised to be the deal-maker-in-chief when it comes to international trade.China and Russia are two of the biggest players in the world when it comes to commodity prices. Both are major producers of a wide range of raw materials. However, China is the world's most populous nation in the world and its infrastructure building over past decades has made the Asian nation the demand side of the equation for many raw materials. One of the reasons for the bear market in commodities that lasted from 2011 to early 2016 was the slowdown in economic growth in China. A closer relationship with Russia and hardball with the Chinese by the incoming administration is likely to have serious ramifications around the world. It is likely that nowhere will the redefinition in U.S. policy be felt more than in the commodities markets given the China and Russia's positions as two of the world's leading players.Commodity prices could react violentlyCommodity prices tend to have a higher volatility than most other asset classes. While the geopolitical landscape is always difficult to predict, it seems that the incoming administration has signaled a warming towards the Russians and a tougher stance when it comes to China. Statements from the incoming President as well as the nomination of Chairman and CEO of Exxon Mobil as the Secretary of State seem to point to this trend.I believe that the changing nature of relationships between the three most powerful nations on earth will lead to a continuation of volatility in commodity markets. While the path of least resistance for agricultural commodities will continue to be a matter of supply and demand and weather issues around the globe, the exponential rate of population growth will cause demand to continue to rise to new record highs. However, the protective nature of the incoming U.S. administration when it comes to fair trade could prevent certain forays by the Chinese into the U.S. market in the years ahead.As an example, China purchased the largest U.S. hog producing company, Smithfield Foods, in 2013. I believe that Republican domination of the White House and Congress will make it more difficult for the Chinese to purchase commodity resources in the U.S. to secure raw material or food flows. Additionally, legislation that would begin an infrastructure rebuilding project in the U.S. will put additional stress on the demand side of the fundamental equation when it comes to many metals and minerals. The U.S. will have to compete with China to secure supplies and further price gains in base and nonferrous metals as well as other industrial commodities like lumber and others are likely. Commodities do not go up or down in a straight line, but I expect more gains in the industrial sector from demand side pressures. Keep an eye on warehouse stocks of metals. Only two months ago, stockpiles of copper at the London Metals Exchange stood at 350,000 metric tons. As of December 13, those stocks were at 258,175 tons, a decline of over 26%.When it comes to the energy market, there have been many changes in the balance of power in the international oil market. It is my view that a warming of relations between the Trump Administration and Russia could lead to a stabilization of the price of oil above the $50 per barrel level. A price in the $50-$60 range will be beneficial for all parties. For the Russians it will stabilize and provide for revenue flows above the projections of Oil Minister Novak, which were around the $40 per barrel level. The Saudis will benefit as the IPO of Aramco could come to market in a better price environment than seen earlier this year. Finally, for the U.S. a price of oil above $50 per barrel will increase output and move the nation toward energy independence. A range of $50-$60 per barrel is a win-win level for all involved.From a consumer's point of view, that price is double the price seen on February 11 but at the same time it is half the price the energy commodity stood at in June 2014. Of course, any flare-up of violence in the Middle East that would impact production, infrastructure or logistics could cause spikes in the price of crude oil.The bottom line is that the political changes that will occur over the months ahead will have a definite impact on the world economy and commodities are global assets. Expect volatility to continue across all commodities as we move forward into 2017 and keep an eye on developments within China and Russia and their respective developing relationships with the United States. I continue to be moderately bullish for industrial commodities but those raw materials that are interest rate sensitive like precious metals are likely to continue to correct lower as rates rise.A new era is upon us when it comes to the balance of power in the world and the relationships between the leading nations. The U.S., Russia and China are all commodity producing and consuming nations so changes in relationships are likely to translate into price volatility over the months ahead.I have introduced a new weekly service through Seeking Alpha Marketplace.

297805,20502,2011-10-05T16:05:33-04:00,,"Earlier this year, I published a performance analysis of some closed-end fund IPOs issued in 2009/2010. In every case, the market performance was worse than the NAV performance.The general pattern has continued this year. But there was a recent infrastructure closed-end IPO that has had one of the worst initial short term starts I have ever seen.The Brookfield Global Listed Infrastructure Income Fund (ticker:INF) was issued on August 26 at a price of 20. The initial NAV was 19.06 reflecting the sales commission and marketing fees, so the initial premium was about 4.9%.Usually, the underwriters try to support the IPO price for several months. In this case, the underwriters supported the price at the 20 level for a few weeks, but the net asset value started falling with the markets and the pain must have been too great to continue supporting the price. So on September 23, the price support was discontinued.INF then started dropping rapidly. In the next week, it fell 23%. Today INF closed at 14.10, down a whopping 29.5% from the IPO price.Here is a price chart of the INF performance since inception. Notice the straight line at 20 designating the underwriter price support, then the sharp dropoff in price.The NAV performance of INF has certainly not been very good, but is not nearly as bad as the market price performance. The NAV at today’s close was 16.79, which is only down around 12% from the original NAV.The current discount to NAV has widened to -16% which is now a larger discount than for other infrastructure CEFs such as MGU or UTF. At this discounted price level, it may be worthwhile to place INF on a trading watchlist. But it may face some headwinds over the next few months if some of the original IPO buyers decide to sell it for a tax loss.I suspect the brokers who sold this IPO will be getting many phone calls from unhappy clients when they receive their third quarter and year end statements. INF is yet another example demonstrating why it almost never pays to buy a closed-end fund at the IPO price.  Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

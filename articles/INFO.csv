If you have bought the stock then and not looked at the stock market until today, you might be pretty pleased with the 5.77 percent gain enjoyed since, with the S&P 500 appreciating by a lower 3.57 percent.However, we have the softness in crude oil demand, which was exacerbated by the coronavirus outbreak. The consequential economic slowdown given the pandemic served as the proverbial last nail in the coffin and spooked shareholders into selling the steady revenue generator that IHS Markit is. The consultancy and information powerhouse covering sectors as wide as financials to energy and automotive plunged to as low as $44.81 in March amid the broader market swoon.In hindsight, it is easy to say we should have taken profit in January-February as the share price ""hit a peak,"" and then ""backed up the truck"" at the bottom in March. It wasn't like no alarm bells were ringing earlier in the year. IHS Markit had traded out of its multi-year price channel, something which I raised in the January article.As a regular contributor to Seeking Alpha's Chinese Internet Weekly column, I was also cognizant of the threat posed by COVID-19 which first escalated in China. What kept me vested was the lack of specific selling drivers given the bullish market where IHS Markit was ostensibly forming a new price support, keeping the stock on a steeper uptrend, which continued until February.Furthermore, the company was emerging as a dividend play with the declaration of its maiden payout for the first quarter of 2020 on January 17. The quarterly cash dividend was in the amount of $0.17 per share and was paid on February 14, 2020, to common shareholders of record at the close of business on February 6, 2020.After rebounding from the trough on March 23, IHS Markit appears to be trading on a new steeper price channel and on the verge of breaking out of its multi-year price channel, triggering a sense of déjà vu (refer to the red lines in the following price chart).Source: ALT Perspective (using Yahoo Finance charting tool)Consider it ""once bitten, twice shy"". With the Fear & Greed Index in the Greed zone (72/100), it's irresponsible to throw caution to the wind when a similar situation had happened in the first quarter of this year. If history repeat, shareholders should expect a price correction with the support at the 50-day moving average line or the floor of the multi-year price channel. However, it's possible that the share price breaches the support levels as it had happened several times in the past years, and the most blatant example was just in March.Source: CNN.comUnfortunately, for a stock like IHS Markit which has exhibited solid fundamentals and consistent delivery in business growth, it's easier said than done to decide whether we should take our profit and wait for a correction to ""back up the truck"".Although IHS Markit has difficulty meeting the consensus revenue estimates in the past seven quarters, it managed to post an earnings beat for 12 consecutive quarters. This demonstrates its commitment to deliver on the bottom line, which is more important than a ""grow-at-all-costs"" mantra.Source: Seeking Alpha PremiumLike many other businesses, IHS Markit was not spared from the deleterious effect of the coronavirus-induced macroeconomic slowdown. Its stellar revenue and EBITDA growth experienced a kink in the uptrend. The numbers could look better if we exclude the impact of COVID-19 in the form of EBITDAC (or ""earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and coronavirus"") like some companies have attempted to present as such.Data by YChartsHowever, IHS Markit doesn't have to shy away from the inevitable revenue hit this year. Analysts have revised the revenue estimate for the fiscal period ending November 2020 downwards by 6.3 percent from six months ago, but they have barely changed it since. This indicates the worst has been factored in their forecast.At the same time, the revenue estimates for 2021 and 2022 have been revised up slightly in the past three months. The EPS estimate for the fiscal period ending November 2022 was revised up by over 2 percent, signaling short-term pain, but cost-reduction measures adopted in response to the current slowdown could translate into longer-term margin improvements.Source: Seeking Alpha PremiumThanks to cost-cutting initiatives among other moves, IHS Markit is still expected to post a 4.34 percent year-on-year growth in its EPS despite a 2.79 percent reduction in its projected revenue for the fiscal year ending November 2020. Along with a return to revenue growth next year, the price-to-sales ratio could shrink to 6.73 from 7.65 on a forward basis, while the forward P/E could be lowered to 23.44 times on the results for the fiscal year ending November 2022.Source: Seeking Alpha PremiumAnother interesting nugget of information from the revenue forecast table is just how tight the range of estimates by 18 analysts from different entities is. For 2020, the difference between the low and the high estimates is a mere $0.02 billion, or a less than half a percentage point.For 2021, the difference is understandably larger, but still a small $0.08 billion out of the consensus $4.61 billion. This is telling of just how stable the businesses of IHS Markit are, leaving little ambiguity as to where the company is heading in terms of its revenue growth.Despite the pandemic already in full swing in Q2 FY2020 (IHS Markit Q2: March-May), IHS Markit managed to close the quarter with deferred revenue at $945.9 million, about 1 percent higher year on year. This also marked the third quarterly year-on-year improvement since Q3 FY2019, when the company registered its first deferred revenue decline after the merger of IHS and Markit.Source: ALT PerspectiveAs explained in a prior article on IHS Markit, the deferred revenue performance gives a good indication of the business health of the information and analytics company on the organic front. This is due to its subscription model, where revenue is locked in for the next couple of years. There can be plenty of bells and whistles to augment the top line number, as that is what the media loves to tout as headlines. On the other hand, the deferred revenue demonstrating a clear trend provides visibility into the company's future top line reporting.From the cash flow angle, IHS Markit also demonstrated strength with higher operating cash flow and, consequently, free cash flow in Q2 FY2020. While the increase in this year's second quarter is lower than the previous two years, the cash and cash equivalents at the end of the Q2 FY2020 rose to the highest in 15 quarters. Many companies have rushed to shore up their cash holdings amid heightened uncertainties. Thus, the jump in cash holdings at IHS Markit is certainly reassuring.Source: ALT PerspectiveWe have another half-year of reporting to go before IHS Markit ends the challenging fiscal year. Nevertheless, management is already guiding for organic revenue growth next year of 7-9 percent, albeit with the assumptions that ""we are going to have a gradual global economic recovery, no further major lock-ins and by major lock-ins complete world shutting down as we have seen in Q2, there may be small regional lock-ins like we’ve recently seen in Beijing, but that will be well managed and very conservative events revenue,"" as Lance Uggla mentioned during the Q2 FY2020 earnings conference call.Best of all, while his team has ""done a lot of work in this COVID period,"" Lance Uggla is still expecting ""approximately 100 basis points of margin expansion next year.""With such optimism and execution success, I do not want to risk taking profit and see the gravy train run past me. On the other hand, I would be sure to add more to my position the next time the share price falls out of the multi-year trading price channel."
4357040,102293,2020-07-06T05:49:29-04:00,"IHS Markit boasts of a very robust database offering and a broad and well-diversified client base.The company has a robust and highly visible revenue stream.Investors should consider risks such as impact of a longer-than-anticipated recovery from recession on the company’s transportation, events, and resources business.","Consulting services player IHS Markit (INFO) is one of the few stocks in the market which has escaped the investor eye despite solid growth prospects. The company’s revenues for the second quarter ending May 31, 2020, were around $1.03 billion, a YoY decline of 9.59% and lower than the consensus by $22.0 million. However, IHS Markit’s second-quarter non-GAAP EPS of $0.69 managed to surpass consensus by $0.02.Despite the mixed results, there is much to look forward to in this company. The demand for data and services related to pricing and valuation of indices, equities, and derivatives business has remained solid. Although the COVID-19 pandemic negatively affected the company’s sales in the enterprise solutions business, transportation business, and resources business, this trend is bound to revert as people gradually return to normal operations in the coming quarters.While there are some short-term headwinds, the pandemic has not caused any structural change in the business environment for the company. Data and insights will continue to be key drivers of the global economy. The company is all set to capture additional market share in this ever-growing market. Additionally, IHS Markit also stands to benefit from increasing information intensity or the rising financial worth of the information used. Based on its diversified business model and strong presence in the critical analytics and solutions business, IHS Markit is well-positioned to benefit from this secular tailwind. The company is just 0.66% up on YTD (year-to-date) basis and has much more upside left for 2020.IHS Markit is a prominent player in the fast-growing information services segment.We see that increasing demand for information, and an increase in information intensity will drive secular growth in this industry.IHS Markit has created a strong economic moat in the data and research services business. The company’s extensive and high-quality database is its core asset and is the most important competitive advantage over other players in the industry. IHS Markit enjoys an enviable position in its target markets since it is extremely costly for competitors to create such a deep and broad database.As seen above, this database contains financial data calibrated from more than 70 banks, exchanges, clearinghouses and dealers. Moreover, the database is also fed with 3 million quotes on a daily basis covering more than 10,000 CDS (credit default swap) curves which are collected from 3,800 CDS entities and all major credit indices. IHS Markit also provides mark-to-market pricing data for over 6,500 private loan facilities on a daily basis. The database also includes pricing data for over 2.5 million corporate and sovereign bonds and PMI data for over 40 economies worldwide. A major portion of this pricing data especially related to credit products and bonds involves significant technical complexity and is not easily available.Besides financial data, IHS Markit also boasts of extensive data and insights related to vehicle registration and VIO (vehicle in operation). The database covers national monthly new vehicle registration data across 80 countries, covering 97% of global vehicle sales. The company also records analysis and forecasts for 90% VIOs in more than 45% of countries globally. This data is used by automotive OEMs, national sales companies, and dealers to develop and assess their strategies. IHS Markit’s database also includes records for almost all wells drilled and produced in the U.S. all the way back to 1859. Besides, the company has also recorded data for more than 739,000 international wells.IHS Markit is not overly dependent on any single product or end market. The product mix is well-diversified and capable of sustaining any jolts in today’s uncertain environment.The company also has a diversified client base across areas such as financial services, transportation, natural resources, engineering, and product design. The commendable part here is that the company’s relationships run deep and include almost all key players in its target markets. IHS Markit’s deep penetration and broad reach is also a key competitive advantage.Investors are increasingly gravitating towards technology stocks with high revenue visibility in these times of heightened uncertainty. IHS Markit is also faring well on this criterion.The company will also not require to take significant price cuts despite the ongoing recessionary environment. This is because almost 85% of its revenues are recurring, while 72% of its revenues are not only recurring but also flowing from fixed-price contracts. Hence, chances of extreme revenue volatility are significantly low even in the direst of circumstances. Additionally, the company does not have to spend significantly to acquire a major chunk of its revenues annually, which implies higher margins than otherwise asset-heavy companies.IHS Markit is a company with high operating leverage, which has translated not only in high margins but also a robust mid-60s free cash flow conversion rate.Although IHS Markit is a company with solid fundamentals and a secular growth story, the company has not completely escaped the turmoil caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. In its second-quarter earnings call, the company revised downwards its overall guidance to better reflect the growth prospects in the current environment. The company may be forced to further reduce the guidance, in case the recession turns out to be lengthier and deeper than expected. Transportation businesses may get disproportionately affected by an exceptionally deep recession.IHS Markit’s offerings geared towards events market have taken a beating as conferences had to be canceled during the pandemic. The three flagship events of CERAWeek, Chem Week, TPM have definitely been major branding exercises for the company. The upside here is that this business only accounts for about 1% of the revenues and hence is not materially significant for the company’s financial performance.A bigger impact is being felt in the Resources business, where the pandemic has caused structural issues in the upstream oil & gas business. IHS Markit expects some of the customers to go out of business, while the company has itself provided price concessions to some players. In the worst-case scenario, the company expects these factors to have a maximum of -2% impact on the revenues of its resources business in 2021.IHS Markit’s net debt of $5.4 billion seems a tad bit high considering that a gross leverage ratio is 3.0 times on bank covenant basis and 2.9 times net of cash. This is at the higher end of the company’s target leverage and is also slightly higher than what is normally seen for technology companies.According to finviz, the 12-month consensus target price for the company is $84.60. The company is currently trading at PE multiple of 38.42x, a forward PE of 24.00x, and PS multiple of 6.93x. These multiples seem low when we consider the valuations at which businesses with high revenue visibility such as SaaS (Software as a Service) stocks or payment industry players are trading today. I believe that the target price of $90 is a better reflection of this company’s growth potential in the next 12 months.At end of May 31, 2020, IHS Markit had cash of $208 million and an untapped revolver worth $750 million on its balance sheet. The company’s free cash flow in the second quarter was $209 million. The company has also been consistently returning value to shareholders. The company’s dividend yield is 0.90%, while the company has completed share repurchases worth $852 million in 2020 YTD.The majority of analysts feel optimistic about the company. On June 24, Baird analyst Jeffrey Meuler raised target price to $84 from $69 and reiterated Outperform rating. On June 24, Wells Fargo analyst William Warmington raised target price to $90 from $70 and reiterated an Overweight rating. On June 24, BMO Capital analyst Jeffrey Silber raised target price to $82 from $62 but kept Market Perform rating. On June 24, RBC Capital analyst Seth Weber raised target price to $90 from $84 and reiterated an Outperform rating. On June 24, SunTrust analyst Andrew Jeffrey raised target price to $87 from $65 and reiterated a Buy rating. On June 24, Barclays analyst Jeffrey Meuler raised target price to $85 from $70 and reiterated an Overweight rating. On June 24, UBS analyst Alex Kramm upgraded the company’s rating to Buy from Neutral and target price to $85, up from $63. On June 23, Stifel analyst Shlomo Rosenbaum upgraded the company to Buy from Hold and raised target price to $89, up from $61.IHS Markit can prove to be a solid pick despite the ongoing pandemic, thanks to its high revenue visibility, well-diversified and asset-light business model, and solid niche offering. Hence, I believe retail investors with above-average risk appetite and investment horizon of at least one year should consider this stock for their portfolio in July 2020."
4335413,105306,2020-04-01T07:24:07-04:00,"The management team has also announced a cost reduction plan of $250 million to weather current economic downturn and protect EPS growth, as energy and automotive areas will be highly.IHS Markit is trading at lower P/E and EV/EBITDA multiples, suggesting some upside compared to the peer group.I would look to add positions in the stock in case there is a sustained price consolidation around the $55-60 mark in the coming days or weeks.","IHS Markit (INFO) reported earnings generally in-line with estimations and presented a cost cutting action plan targeting to achieve earnings growth in 2020, even in the most conservative scenario outlined by the company. While this effort is surely welcome by its shareholders, the company's exposure to energy and automotive sectors will be a headwind during this downturn.IHS Markit reported a revenue growth of 3% over a year ago, reaching $1.08 billion in the quarter, in-line with expectations and representing an organic revenue growth of 6%, considering divestitures during the period. This growth was driven by recurring organic revenue increase of 7% and strong performance of Financial Services and Transportation segments, with organic growth of 7% and 9%, respectively. Meanwhile, the Resources segment lagged others, with modest growth of 1%.Adjusted EBITDA margin was up 90 bps to 39.9%, in-line with company expectations, and adjusted EPS was $0.66 in the quarter, surpassing consensus by $0.02 and up $0.06 over a year ago. Adjusted EPS excluded the sale of AD&S by $372 million during the period.The management team has also announced a cost reduction plan of $250 million already in course. Around $50 million of this plan is related to permanent cost reduction measures. These include not revenue based initiatives, such as an office expansion or bring back in-house activities previously assigned to higher priced contractors that would be more suitable to accelerate top line growth in a normal environment. The remaining $200 million cost reductions are considered variable or temporary reductions and are basically composed of executive salary cuts, especially in the Autos segment, which should return to normal levels as the revenue recovers in 2021.With these costs reductions in place, the management team intends to counter the adverse scenario caused by the coronavirus outbreak and consequent lockdowns adopted in many countries. According to the analysis outlined by IHS Markit, the worst-case scenario considers a global recession with recovery beginning only in 2021. As highlighted in the earnings call, unfortunately this worst-case scenario is the most likely to happen, as a recovery in Q3 or Q4/2020 would have a probability of no more than 30%, according to their evaluation.This worst-case scenario also considers no OPEC+ agreement in 2020, further pressuring the average price of Brent in the low $20s through 2021 and demand stabilizing only in 2021. In the automotive front, this scenario assumes a recession in the auto industry impacting sales of new and old cars through 2020.The backdrop for 2020 takes into account the Resources segment being highly affected by the disruption of global industry demand, associated with growing supply due to the recent disagreement between Russia and Saudi Arabia to cut oil production. Therefore, global capex is expected to drop as much as 30% in 2020, mostly in North America, impacting IHS Markit's upstream business. Of note, upstream represents 60% of Resources revenue. The remaining 40% of the revenue is related to the downstream business, such as chemicals, power, gas, renewables and agriculture, which is expected to be less affected. In aggregate, the company expects the Resources segment should be a negative low-single digit organic revenue growth in 2020, in the worst-case scenario.The impact in the Transportation segment should be significant as well, as the shutdown has affected dealerships but also car makers and suppliers, leading to cancellations and temporary price concessions to dealers. As a result, the segment is expected to decline revenue in the mid-single digit, also in the worst-case scenario.The Financial Services, on the other hand, should be less affected, as its portfolio of ""must have"" products is expected to become even more important during the current volatile environment. As such, its organic revenue growth should stay in the mid-single digit in 2020.In summary, the management team expects an organic growth between 1% and 4% in 2020 and adjusted EPS of $2.76 to $2.81, still delivering a positive growth in the range of 7% to 9% over 2019, in part thanks to the $250 million cost reductions plan.I am going to compare IHS Markit's financial data and valuation with peers in the financial and in the research and consulting services industries. In addition, I will also compare IHS Markit with S&P 500 components in order to gauge its relative evaluation with the broader market.From the earnings quality perspective, we see on the table below that IHS Markit has delivered lower gross profit and EBITDA margins than the peer group, while both have increased at much faster pace on a relative basis compared with the same group. This growth is consistent with the operating leverage following IHS Markit's substantial revenue growth over the last 5 years.Comparing with S&P 500 components, IHS Markit shows even better figures, scoring 2nd quintile in margins and 1st quintile in margins / revenue growth over the last 5 year, evidencing the top quality earnings profile of the company related to the broader market.Source: Data from Finbox, consolidated by the authorRemark: The peer group includes the following companies (Equifax, FactSet, Gartner, Moody's, MarketAxess, MSCI, S&P Global, Thomson Reuters, TransUnion, Verisk Analytics)Turning to the financial health, IHS Markit scores relatively worse than the peer group and the S&P 500, as showed below.Source: Data from Finbox, consolidated by the authorWhile it sounds a weakness for the company, the gross leverage remains in-line with the company's capital policy. Furthermore, the financial debt/EBITDA multiple is trending down, despite its net financial debt growth over the past 5 years.Source: YChartsMoving to the valuation analysis, looking at the table below, we see IHS Markit with lower P/E and EV/EBITDA compared to the peer group. In addition, IHS Markit's long term earnings growth rate forecast is 12%, which is consistent with the double-digit growth expected by the company's team management, and close to the peer group average. Therefore, PEG ratio shows a similar picture to that of P/E and EV/EBITDA and also suggests that IHS Markit is trading at a discount.As a point of note, we can also see there is no any meaningful change in the long term earnings forecast by analysts (column B) compared with the past 5 years diluted EPS, which is an indication that the market is seeing the current downturn as temporary. Of course, this picture can change in case of a more persistent recession advancing through 2021.A comparison with the S&P 500 shows an opposite figure with IHS Markit trading at higher multiples. I see this premium is warranted as the broader market earnings growth forecast is relatively lower than IHS Markit at this point in time.Source: Data from Finbox, consolidated by the authorThe recent decline in IHS Markit's shares has been stronger than the peer group, but similar to the broader market. Despite the recovery seen last week, prices are still below 20, 50 and 200-day moving averages. The good news is that shares of the peer group, such as FactSet, MSCI and S&P Global dropped less than the S&P 500. This may be indicative of IHS Markit's shares resilience going forward.Source: Data from Finbox, consolidated by the authorIHS Markit's management team has made the right move, in my view, toward a cost reduction plan to mitigate this dramatic scenario, since energy and automotive areas will be highly affected, as they accounts for nearly 50% of the total revenue. I see some upside in shares and consider IHS Markit a valuable long-term holding. I would nevertheless only look to add positions in the stock in case there is a sustained price consolidation around the $55-60 mark in the coming days or weeks, as stock price momentum is not yet indicative of a steady recovery."
4377909,105526,2020-10-06T20:30:36-04:00,"The top-line trends in FQ3 were largely as expected, but ongoing cost savings initiatives are paying off, driving EPS above consensus.Guidance was also reaffirmed, but the compelling long-term financial framework keeps me bullish.Considering the range of growth drivers available and the margin expansion potential, I am constructive on INFO shares.","While cyclical impacts continue to weigh on IHS Markit's (NYSE:INFO) financials, there could be light on the horizon. For instance, the renewed emphasis on accelerating new product cycles through Data Lake significantly improves INFO's long-term growth prospects, while an increasingly diversified portfolio should help mitigate downside volatility in energy. Additional cost efficiencies also underpin a compelling EBITDA margin expansion story, with the potential to move toward the long-term target of 50% firmly in sight.In the latest quarter, INFO's organic revenue declined by -1% Y/Y on a constant currency basis but was closer to flat excluding events. The key detractor was Resources, which saw revenues down 9% Y/Y, as the company opted to take price discounts in exchange for multi-year contracts. Non-subscription organic revenue was also down significantly for the quarter, although the decline would have been less steep, excluding the impact from events.On a more positive note, Transportation revenue increased 5% Y/Y as both CARFAX and Auto Mastermind returned to growth in the quarter, with the latter helped by pricing normalization. Similarly, Consolidated Markets & Solutions revenue rose 1% Y/Y (normalized for BPVC; -13% Y/Y headline growth), with Financial Services also growing 4% Y/Y on solid growth in Solutions and Information.Source: FQ3 Press ReleaseAs a result, adj EBITDA margins expanded c. 450 bps Y/Y as INFO continued to benefit from COVID-19-related cost savings. The benefit also flowed through to the bottom line, with EPS above consensus at $0.77.Source: FQ3 Presentation SlidesThe company also reaffirmed its fiscal 2020 guidance, even indicating that it is trending towards the upper end of the EPS range. However, the Resources business remains under pressure for the upcoming quarter, although it is partially offset by improvement in Transport, with revenue growth at an implied c. 0% to +1% Y/Y (excluding events).The full-year guidance does also imply that adjusted EBITDA margins will contract Q/Q to c. 42.7% as variable costs are reintroduced, along with the rebound in activity, and as the company reinvests into the business.Source: FQ3 Presentation SlidesImportantly, INFO's long-term financial framework is attractive, supported by healthy organic revenue growth and a consistent multi-year EBITDA margin expansion target. The long-term annual organic revenue growth target now stands at 5-7%, though investments into new product development and an increasing mix of higher growth businesses (such as alternatives, renewable energy, and compliance solutions) could drive growth toward the upper end of the range.Continued reinvestment into the business should also fuel product innovation, driving EBITDA margin expansion to c. 100bps per year over the near to medium term, although further traction across cost savings initiatives could drive upside to that figure. The company continues to assess structural changes to its operating model, from decreasing travel to rationalizing its real estate footprint.As a result, INFO has reiterated its target of delivering double-digit annual EPS growth long term, on the back of healthy organic top-line trends and robust margin expansion. I see this target being very realistic even for fiscal 2021, with INFO now projecting organic growth of 6%-8% (up from 7%-9% prior), adjusted for a c. 1% impact from physical events.Challenges in the Upstream business have led to further reductions in the fiscal 2020 organic growth guidance. The updated guidance now calls for growth in the negative mid-single digits (from negative low-single digits previously), while fiscal 2021 guidance was also reduced to negative low-single digits (from -2% to +2% prior).Source: FQ3 Presentation SlidesThe rise of lower-cost competition in recent years has been the main driver of the decline, along with end-market pressure. With these headwinds in mind and to prevent elevated cancellations, INFO has essentially termed out c. 55% of its data contracts, with discounts in the near term followed by escalators in the later years.But even with growth likely to be pressured due to near-term headwinds in the upstream end-market, I think the fact that the Resources subscription business will see better growth in 2021 is positive, even if growth remains slightly negative at -2%.The Data Lake strategy could be a game-changer as it serves to make all of INFO's data discoverable in a single, fully cloud-native environment. The initiative benefits INFO on two fronts – it enables product development internally, while also helping customers find INFO's >5k subject matter experts across various data sets. Progress thus far has been encouraging – by end-2020, INFO is already on track to achieve centralization and data discovery, along with advanced functionality such as machine learning and AI tools to clients.Longer term, the key selling point of Data Lake will be its ability to help connect relevant data points across INFO's vast data universe. And with c. 15 clients in the immediate pipeline and 150 active conversations, Data Lake could soon become a meaningful contributor as INFO recognizes revenue and cost synergies over time.With net leverage now at c. 2.6x, the focus has turned to reinvesting for growth, mainly through organic means, followed by potential tuck-in M&A (deals in the range of sub-$500 million), and finally, return of cash and debt paydown. Encouragingly, the company has initiated c. $200 million in share repurchases as part of its commitment to returning c. 50-75% of annual free cash flow (including the dividend). Interestingly, management would like to see its multiple expand to make acquisition opportunities more attractive, which, I suspect, entails more share repurchases ahead.Even with headwinds in the Resources segment, the level of resilience in the other segments leaves INFO well-positioned to return to organic growth in FQ4 (and beyond). Now that the worst appears to be behind us, I think earnings estimates should rise in tandem. Meanwhile, shares should also benefit from improved execution, considering the growth opportunities ahead and cost efficiencies to be unlocked on the way to 50% margins. At c. 28x earnings, the multiple is below pre-COVID-19 levels despite an improved earnings outlook, and therefore, I am bullish.Data by YCharts"
4332847,20715,2020-03-18T17:37:28-04:00,IHS Markit is set to announce Q1 earnings before the open on Tuesday.The company has seen solid earnings and sales growth over the last few years.Sentiment toward the stock is skewed to the bearish side.The stock is oversold after plunging for the past five weeks.,"As we deal with the crazy market selloff from the coronavirus, can you imagine being the CEO of a company and having to release a regularly scheduled earnings report? That is the situation that Lance Uggla, the Chairman and CEO of IHS Markit (INFO), faces next Tuesday. The company is scheduled to release Q1 2020 results before the market opens on March 24.IHS Markit has performed well as a company in recent years and the stock had been performing well over the past five quarters until the recent downturn. The company has seen earnings increase by an average of 13% per year over the last three years and they were up 14% in the fourth quarter of 2019. Analysts expect earnings per share of $0.64 for the first quarter and that would mean an increase of 6.7% compared to Q1 2019.Revenue for IHS Markit has increased at a rate of 15% per year over the last three years and it increased by 5% in the fourth quarter. Analysts expect revenue to come in at $1.1 billion for the first quarter and that compares the $1.0 billion the company reported in Q1 2019.Looking at the company's management efficiency measurements, the profit margin is well above average at 30% while the return on equity is in the average range at 13.1%.The stock is trading at a trailing P/E of 45 and that is probably a little pricey for some investors.Looking at IHS Markit's business, it is interesting to consider how all that is going on in the world will impact the company. The company provides information and analysis to governments, financial institutions, and other large corporations around the globe. Given the chaos in the global economy and financial markets, could IHS Markit actually see an increase in demand for its services?With companies and governments alike looking for more data and more information about global economic trends and the impact of the coronavirus, I can see the potential for new business at IHS Markit. Unfortunately, there will also be current clients that might not be able to afford the company's services any longer because their own revenue is plummeting.The company will likely give us some insight into this theory when they announce next week. There will undoubtedly be changes to the forecast for the next few quarters for IHS Markit and for all companies reporting in the near future. The next traditional earnings season will start in early April and there will be huge changes to most corporate forecasts.IHS Markit performed well after bottoming in December 2018. The stock rallied nicely and gained almost 84% from its low to its high. But after the selling hit in February, the stock has dropped almost 40% from the high to the low.The stock went from being tremendously overbought to tremendously oversold in five weeks. The 10-week RSI was at its highest level ever on January 24. Now, the indicator is at its lowest level since October 2014 - four months after the company started trading publicly.The weekly stochastic readings are just now reaching oversold territory after spending almost the entire previous 12 months in overbought territory. If there is some good news to be had from this plunge and from the stochastic indicators, the stock has only hit oversold territory four times since the June 2014 debut. In each instance when the weekly stochastic readings hit oversold territory, the stock moved higher in the following year and was at least 25% higher within the year.Looking at the key sentiment indicators for IHS Markit, we see that the overall sentiment picture is skewed to the bearish side. There are 20 analysts covering the stock at this time with 13 ""buy"" ratings, six ""hold"" ratings, and one ""sell"" rating. This puts the buy percentage at 65% and that is right at the bottom of the average range.The short interest ratio is at 5.5 currently and that is higher than average. If you consider that the company's fundamentals are much better than average, seeing the short interest ratio considerably higher than average is surprising. In addition to the ratio being high, the short interest jumped from 10.88 million shares to 12.4 million shares in the most recent reporting period.The put/call ratio is at 0.64 and that is really low. Normally, I would say that this is a big sign of optimism from the options crowd, but there are only 3,132 puts open and 5,464 open at this time. This open interest only represents 859,600 shares of stock and the average daily trading volume is almost 3 million shares. That definitely diminishes the value of the low put/call ratio.I like IHS Markit as a company. The fundamentals are better than average with solid earnings and sales growth and a great profit margin. I think there is a possibility that the company could see an increase in demand for its services once the panic slows down.The chart is concerning in that the stock has moved below a number of key support levels. The stock gapped below its 52-week moving average last week and continued to move lower and moved below the 104-week moving average. I thought the $55 level might act as support as well, but that wasn't the case. The $55 area acted as resistance in September '18 before falling to the December low that year.The sentiment is encouraging because it is skewed to the bearish side. If it were skewed to the bullish side, I would be worried that the selling pressure could continue much longer.I would love to buy IHS Markit, but I don't think I can recommend doing that just yet. The reason isn't that I don't like the stock, but I don't like the overall market right now. Even though the company is well above average in a number of aspects, it has fallen with the overall market. I would recommend watching the weekly stochastic indicators as a possible trigger for an entry point. If the indicators make a bullish crossover in the next week or two, it could mean the worst is over.I can see the stock rallying 20%-25% over the next six to nine months. If the stock does start moving higher again, I would watch how it reacts to the 52-week moving average on its way back up. The moving average has acted as support during bullish moves and it could act as resistance just as easily. A move below the December '18 low would be very troubling and that is still 20% the current level."

Since then, the stock has risen over 20 percent, more than double the appreciation in the S&P 500 ETF (SPY). I was seeking to address shareholders' concerns that the stock might have run up too fast, after furiously making new highs in the first half of 2019 and ending up one-third higher in market capitalization compared with the end of 2018.Data by YChartsI concluded then that the uptrend remains intact. While the price movement in a couple of months following the publication seemed to cast doubts on my arguments, it proved to be just a period of consolidation after a good run. It served as another reminder that shareholders should be long-term minded, with the stock having provided fat returns over the years despite sporadic sharp pullbacks along the way.For instance, while I had first invested in IHS Markit years ago, I only wrote about it in early 2017 when I began contributing to Seeking Alpha. The neat feature on the platform showed that the stock has more than doubled since the date of publication, significantly outperforming the benchmark index, S&P 500. Astute traders who can time the market well would do much better given the numerous dips and plunges amid the uptrend. However, many readers would agree it's easier said than done.Source: Seeking AlphaFurthermore, it is not apparent from studying the company financials quarter to quarter whether we should take profit or not. Although IHS Markit has consistently surpassed consensus estimates for EPS in the past ten reporting periods, the same cannot be said for its revenue. In the past five quarters, it either missed on revenue or barely met analysts' expectations, providing an impetus for investors to sell down the stock. Nevertheless, as we know in hindsight, the share price has continued on its uptrend for much of 2019.Source: Seeking Alpha EssentialsIn the last concluded quarter, the decline in the deferred revenue was concerning. Although the quarter ending November 2019 could be considered seasonally weak, it marked the second consecutive quarter that the company has reported a negative year-on-year reduction in the deferred revenue. Before the 2019 Q4 reporting period, the company has not had a quarter where the deferred revenue did not grow since IHS merged with Markit in 2016, not to mention two quarters in a row of negative year-on-year growth.Source: ALT PerspectiveAs explained in a prior article on IHS Markit, the deferred revenue performance gives a good indication of the business health of the information and analytics company on the organic front. This is due to its subscription model, where revenue is locked in for the next couple of years. There can be plenty of bells and whistles to augment the top-line number as that is what the media loves to tout as headlines. On the other hand, the deferred revenue demonstrating a clear trend provides visibility into the company's future top-line reporting.To make matters worse, the cash and cash equivalents at the end of each quarter in 2019 were lower than the same periods a year ago. This is in spite of higher, albeit slightly, net operating cash flows and free cash flows.Source: ALT PerspectiveThe above could help explain why the stock suffered a dip post-results. However, when we look at the financials on an annual basis, we can see why IHS Markit continues to find favor with the market. Its EBITDA growth remains on an accelerated path post-2016 even with the revenue growth remaining steady.Data by YChartsThere are several other positives in IHS Markit that make the company a worthy investment for the long term. I have reiterated in my prior coverage of IHS Markit that the company has diversified effectively into three main verticals - Resources, Transportation, and Financials. In the conference call, Lance Uggla, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of IHS Markit, suggested that the three pillars enabled analysts to build a valuation of the company more convincingly than simply based off the ""subscription sales and the non-recurring revenue around it to actually support your valuation"" like they did five years ago.Lance Uggla also asserted that IHS Markit's role in helping its customers navigate the ""decision-making complexities"" meant the company could be insulated from the downturn in the sectors it covers. The services that IHS Markit provides would also bring about ""substantive savings"" to customers compared to them ""trying to do these things on their own"".It is often said that repeat customers are the best proof of the true need for the company services or products. According to the CEO, IHS Markit has been achieving a 92-93 percent retention rate across the firm rather consistently. This should be reassuring for shareholders. Lance Uggla also reminded investors of the company's track record in managing costs, even as they invest in organic growth and innovations.Inorganically, IHS Markit has proven it is capable of savvy acquisitions and successfully integrating the acquired units. Lance Uggla emphasized that the company is adding data science and analytics businesses which it identified as ""a growth region"".On IHS Markit's practice to make use of stock-based compensation ('SBC') to reward and retain its employees, it is comforting to know that as a percentage of annual revenue, the SBC now represents only around 5 percent. This is a percentage point lower than last year and a substantial reduction from the nearly 10 percent in 2014. This demonstrates prudence by the Board of directors and that the executives are not obsessed with lining their own pockets, a key positive for shareholders.Data by YChartsFor FY2020, the management reiterated the guidance given last year, which was in-line with analysts' expectations. While the upside to the consensus price target is small, it's important to note that this has been the case for much of IHS Markit trading history post-merger. Both bullish and bearish analysts have been rather active in revising their targets upwards. Thus, I am not too worried about potential appreciation.Data by YChartsHowever, I am more concerned that the stock has seemingly overshot its multi-year price channel. The consolation is that the stock has perhaps found itself on a new trajectory since bottoming in late 2018 and that its out-performance is something in-line with today's buoyant markets. Furthermore, market players might have re-priced how they value IHS Markit as it now gives out regular dividends.Source: ALT Perspective (using Yahoo Finance charting tool)"

(NASDAQ:INFO), with a market cap of $27 billion, is a major player in data and analytics services for a variety of industries including transportation, resources, and financial markets. The company was formed by the merger of IHS and Markit back in July 2016 with the combined entity now a big winner as the stock price is up 90% in the period since including an impressive 2019, where the stock has returned 37% year to date. Growth has been driven by a number of acquisitions in recent years while benefiting from the strong environment for business services and the equity bull market. IHS Markit has presented steady growth with an overall solid financial profile. This quarter the company just announced its intention to initiate a dividend in 2020 which should make INFO an interesting pick for dividend- and income-oriented investors. This article recaps the company's latest earnings release and our view on where the stock is headed next.(Source: FinViz.com)INFO reported its fiscal Q3 earnings on September 24 with non-GAAP EPS of $0.67, which was ahead of consensus expectations by $0.04, while GAAP EPS of $0.10 missed by $0.25. Revenues in the quarter of $1.11 billion increased 11% year over year. Overall, it was a positive quarter for the company which saw its adjusted EBITDA reach $452.9 million, up 16% from $390.5 million during the period last year as the margin increased.(INFO Q3 financial performance. Source: press release)One of the important metrics for the company is its percentage of recurring revenues which reached 84.9% in the quarter from 84.2% last year. This component is further broken down between fixed recurring and variable recurring. Organic revenue growth as a measure of new business increased 6% which was consistent among the main segments of resources, transportation, 'consolidated markets and solutions', and financial services. The proportion of recurring revenues is seen as more stable and adds to earnings quality which is positive for the company.(INFO Q3 revenue breakdown. Source: press release)One of the big developments this quarter was the announcement of a dividend initiation which the company intends to begin in 2020. Based on comments in the conference call, INFO is targeting an initial dividend yield in the 1% range. By this measure we estimate the dividend will be announced at a quarterly rate between $0.15 and $0.20 per share. This will be part of a broader ""capital allocation framework,"" including ongoing share buybacks. Here is what CEO Lance Uggla said during the conference call:The company is citing four reasons why now is a good time to initiate the dividend and we agree that given the company's steady growth and earnings profile, the dividend will be supported by ample cash flow. For perspective, INFO has generated approximately $1.1 billion in free cash flow over the trailing twelve months. Considering a current outstanding share count of 400 million shares, the company could pay a quarterly dividend of $0.175 representing an annual payout of ~$280 million at a payout ratio of 27% to full-year adjusted EPS guidance. A dividend in this range would yield 1.0% for the stock. Again, the per share amount has not been confirmed but we view this implied payout as an overall conservative level.In terms of guidance, management is targeting revenue around $4.41 billion which if confirmed would represent an increase of 10% year over year, 5.5% of organic growth at the midpoint. This is in contrast to annual revenue growth above 25% y/y for 2018 and 2017, which was driven by acquisitions. Notably, the midpoint of the revenue guidance was very slightly lowered from a previous $4.46 billion back in its Q2 results. Nevertheless, the numbers here are positive with the target EPS in a range of $2.52 and $2.57, representing a 12% increase from 2018 results. Management sees the adjusted EBITDA margin expanding 100 basis points compared to 2018.Source: Company IRAmong a peer group of what we consider to be comparable financial and industry-specific data service providers, we note that valuations in terms of EV to EBITDA are very similar around 20x between INFO and S&P Global Inc. (SPGI), Moody's Corporation (MCO), MSCI Inc. (MSCI), Thomson Reuters Corp. (TRI), and FactSet Research (FDS). The reality is that there really isn't a direct comparison to IHS Markit as each of these companies services different market segments considering SPGI and MCO with their credit ratings business, and TRI operating through more diversified business model. Still, it's impressive to see that INFO has presented higher growth to the group with revenues up 11% year over year compared to 8.5% for TRI, 6.2% for MSCI 5.9% for SPGI, and just 3.3% at MCO in the last reported quarter highlighted below.Data by YChartsOn the other hand, we note that INFO is structurally less profitable, with a net income margin over the last three years that has averaged under 10% while S&P's and Moody's profit margin is closer to 30%. The EBITDA margin for INFO is also lower but has trended higher over the past year which is favorable but still well below levels from SPGI and MCO. INFO reported an ""adjusted"" EBITDA level of 40.7% in Q3.The point here is to demonstrate that among standard valuation multiples compared to peers, there isn't much to say IHS Markit is significantly undervalued or overvalued, by all accounts INFO is fairly valued and for this reason we rate the stock as a Hold. INFO presents higher growth among these companies yet lower margins in what is simply a different business.Data by YChartsThe forward outlook for INFO is going to come down to growth expectations and market opportunities. We view INFO as having a strong leadership history given bold strategic decisions from management including the 2016 merger between IHS and Markit along regular product innovations like the recent launch of its global carbon credits index just last week.The main risks for this sub-industry of data providers are the cyclical trends in financial services. It's important to remember that broad equity markets like the S&P 500 (SPY) are within 2% of their all-time high, suggesting an overall favorable environment for typical INFO customers. On the other hand, we see the current macro environment as tilting risks to the downside, considering ongoing global growth concerns and rising geopolitical risks between the Middle East and still unresolved U.S.-China trade dispute. A worsening of the economic outlook in the United States or deterioration of financial markets globally going forward would be negative for INFO. We note that in Q4 of 2018 amid extreme market volatility, INFO presented an 18% decline from its then all-time high, highlighting the underlying risk in the stock based on sentiment.The slight revision lower to forward guidance this quarter could be perceived as an early signal for more cautiousness if we take it to mean that management at least views the operational momentum as slowing. Currently the environment can be described as stable, but the stock price will likely anticipate any deterioration (or acceleration) of the economic outlook, given the company's cyclical exposure. Investors should monitor not only the company's growth but the evolution of margins as an indicator to the pricing environment.Current investors should be very happy at the performance INFO has delivered in recent years while recent developments including the dividend initiation are positive for shareholder value. On the other hand, 2019 represents a new phase for the company as it enters a more mature and stable growth stage, and this is evident from the new capital allocation policy.We like the company and think this is a solid stock with steady earnings but rate INFO as a Hold as it lacks a clear catalyst for further upside. With growth already decelerating from the previous high growth phase, and the capital allocation plans already disclosed, we believe this is likely a case where the stock is priced for perfection. We would consider initiating a long position on a material pullback recognizing the leadership position INFO maintains in its core operating segments. Risks for the stock are going to be based on the operating environment for these types of data services with the financial market segment more exposed to global cyclical trends."
4319770,105526,2020-01-29T09:09:59-05:00,"INFO reported strong 4QFY19 numbers – steady growth across business verticals led to an adjusted EPS of $0.65, beating consensus estimates by $0.04.Management reiterated “a conservative” FY20 outlook – INFO should settle into a higher range of the 5%-6% YoY organic growth guidance and inch towards a ~140 bps YoY margin expansion.Upside case rests on INFO’s ability to expand its recurring revenue base – further upside to the current ~85% contribution should drive an improved EPS outlook.","IHS Markit (NYSE:INFO) recently reported a strong set of 4QFY19 numbers - revenue increased 5% YoY (+6% YoY organic growth) to $1.12 billion, driven by strength across its biggest business verticals which grew in the mid-to-high single digits YoY, while adjusted EBITDA margin expanded by 120 bps (normalized for foreign exchange) to 40.4%, leading to an above-consensus adjusted EPS of $0.65.Going forward, despite the perceived cyclicality in the business (the transportation and resources verticals are particularly exposed to the health of their end-markets), I think INFO's strong, durable growth in recurring revenues (now comprising ~85% of total revenues) should help drive further organic growth and margin expansion in FY20 toward the upper-end of the 5%-6% growth guidance range - which I believe may prove a tad conservative. On the back of its pricing power, multiple cross-selling opportunities, and new product innovation, INFO looks set to move higher from here.Strong Revenue Composition: Three of its four business verticals - Financial Services, Transportation, and Resources - reported mid-to-high single-digit growth during 4QFY19, which led to 5% YoY growth (6% organic) in revenue to $1.12 billion. Importantly, both recurring fixed revenue and recurring variable revenue grew 7% organically to $810 million and $148 million, respectively, together representing ~85% of total revenue.Source: Company PresentationStrong Profitability: Stable revenue growth was complemented by strong margin performance, which led to an adjusted EBITDA of $453 million for the quarter, up 9% YoY, representing 120 bps (normalized for foreign exchange) expansion in margins to 40.4%. Financial Services and Transportation verticals saw solid growth in profitability during the quarter, with adjusted EBITDA margin expanding 220 bps YoY to 46.1% and 250 bps YoY to 41.8%, respectively. However, the Resources and CMS verticals saw their adjusted EBITDA margins contract by 220 bps YoY to 42.2% and 100 bps to 24.5%, respectively.Source: Company PresentationOutlook for FY20: Management reaffirmed its previously stated FY20 guidance, which expects revenue of $4.52 billion to $4.59 billion, with organic revenue growth of 5% to 6%, including recurring organic growth of 6% to 7%. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to come in the range of $1.86 billion to $1.89 billion, representing an expansion of 100 bps in adjusted EBITDA margin. Adjusted EPS is guided to be in the range of $2.82 to $2.88 for FY20. Lastly, cash conversion is likely to be in the low 60% range with FY20 free cash flow to be ~$1.15 billion.Source: Company PresentationFinancial Services: Revenue from the vertical grew 5% YoY (6% organic, including 7% recurring organic growth and 13% nonrecurring organic decline; and a flat FX) to $431 million in 4QFY19. Within the vertical, the Information business grew 6% organically, led by strength in pricing and indices; Processing growth declined 1% organically due to lower loan processing revenues; Solutions business saw a moderate 1% organic growth due in part to difficult comp in analytics software business, offset by good growth in enterprise data management and corporate actions businesses; and Ipreo saw good momentum with revenue of $93 million, representing an organic growth of 19% in the quarter.In recent quarters, growth has been marred by market headwinds, however, sparking concerns around the sustainability of the growth outlook. However, the recent momentum and opportunities to cross-sell Ipreo into alternative markets should help drive growth, supporting the organic growth outlook for the business vertical.Source: Company PresentationTransportation: The vertical continued to see strong operational performance, with 9% YoY growth (9% organic comprised of 12% recurring and 4% nonrecurring; and flat FX), leading to $325 million in revenue in 4QFY19. Growth for the segment accelerated from the prior quarter (+7%) and hit the company's target of high-single-digit growth for FY19. Subscription-based revenue grew by an outstanding 12% YoY, while the non-subscription growth was a decent 4%, an improvement from the previous flat quarter. Notably, within automotive, INFO successfully launched the CARFAX for Life product in 2019, which made a slight revenue contribution in 2019 and is expected to be a primary growth driver with a real impact in 2021 and beyond. Management also pointed out that the company is making good progress with the Unity auto forecasting platform, which leverages INFO's data lake and new analytic tools. The Transportation vertical, having consistently delivered high-single-digit growth over the past few quarters, has become an inherent element of the INFO growth story and looks set to continue on its current run rate in the near term.Resources: Revenue within the vertical increased 7% YoY to $238 million, driven by strength in downstream businesses due to healthy end-market demand and new product launches during the year. The Upstream business showed modest growth driven by insights and analytics, and international data, partially offset by North American data.In FY20, management expects organic revenue growth for the vertical to stay within the longer-term 4% to 6% range. INFO's Resources vertical is greatly exposed to the overall health of the energy markets, and the recent volatility in oil prices has made investors more concerned about the health of its end-markets. However, the company's business is more subscription-based and is, thus, shielded from short-term turbulence, which supports a healthy mid-single-digit growth with good visibility, in my view.Consolidated Markets & Solutions: The segment remained challenged during the quarter, and revenue declined 8% YoY (4% organic, including 1% recurring growth and 20% non-recurring organic growth; 11% inorganic decline due to TMT divestiture and flat FX) to $128 million. The Product design business emerged as a bright spot, witnessing 5% YoY recurring organic growth during the quarter amid stabilizing royalty rates. Management expects to deliver low to mid-single-digit organic growth in FY20.Update on Data Lake Commercialization: The data lake allows for the discoverability of 90%-98% of the company's curated data from a single location, which should benefit both internal and external users. However, INFO has opened the data lake only for internal use up to March 2020, after which, the platform will open with a multi-tenant focus, which should allow INFO to collate client or partner data together with its own data with the same level of discoverability, ease of access, and the same API, subject to security constraints.INFO has already begun to leverage the data lake in existing offerings such as Maritime and Trade compliance products, Unity auto forecasting platform, and Energy Studio upstream data delivery platform. Further, the data lake will increase INFO's pace of new product development, improve distribution capabilities of data and products to its customers, and unlock efficiencies around data ingestion. I believe INFO, with all its data assets across verticals migrated into data lake, should help drive incremental revenue benefits from FY20, presenting upside to overall margins.Capital Allocation: In 3QFY19, INFO unveiled a new capital allocation framework to return 50-75% of capital capacity to shareholders through buybacks and a quarterly dividend (starting 1QFY20). To this effect, INFO launched a $500 million share repurchase program on December 1, 2019, which management expects to complete by 1QFY20. With this, along with the planned dividend in 2020, INFO has already committed to returning ~50% of the annual capital capacity. Management plans to increase 2020 capital return to the high end of its capital return target of 75% through additional share buybacks.Regarding M&A, INFO closed the sale of its Aerospace & Defence business for $470 million on December 2 and expects net proceeds from the transaction of ~$440 million. Also, in early December 2019, the company paid $76 million to acquire an additional 14% of the AMM business, now owning 92% of AMM. Given the recent deal activity, I think management will likely hold off on major acquisitions in the near term, opting instead for small bolt-on acquisitions.I believe the INFO bull case lies in its ability to continue building up a resilient and healthy recurring revenue base across its key segments (resources, transportation, and financial services). With its recurring revenue base on an upward trend, further upside to the current contribution at ~85% should drive improved earnings quality, which in turn, will likely drive a further re-rating.Source: Company FilingsOn the back of the strong 4Q19 results and an expanding recurring revenue run rate, I am penciling in an FY22 cash EPS inflection to ~$3.80 (from $2.88 in FY20e). On ~25x forward earnings, I believe INFO stock could trade up to ~$95. Note that the 25x multiple represents a discount to the broader Info Services space, but normalizing for SBC expenses, the target multiple is in line with peers. In sum, I see INFO's accelerating organic revenue growth and margin expansion runway, as supportive of the bull case, with further upside likely if INFO clears a conservative guidance bar."

Its consensus-beating Q2 FY2019 earnings last week helped propel optimism on its stock further, keeping its share price movement firmly within the multi-year uptrend channel. What a remarkable recovery from just half a year ago when the share price broke through the same channel forcefully and pessimism was at its zenith. With such outperformance comes the inevitable question: what's the upside left, if any? To determine the answer, I will review a few key metrics that I deemed to be important in accessing the giant information and analytics company.Source: ALT Perspective (used Yahoo Finance charting tool)As explained in my earlier article on IHS Markit, the Deferred Revenue performance gives a good indication of the business health of the information and analytics company on the organic front. This is due to its subscription model, where revenue is locked in for the next couple of years. There can be plenty of bells and whistles to augment the top line number as that is what the media loves to tout as headlines.As for the deferred revenue, a steady trend provides visibility into the company's future top line reporting. At $939 million, the latest reported quarter had seen yet another stable period for its deferred revenue. While a dip quarter-on-quarter, it was a 7.7 percent increase over the same period last year. Looking on a longer-term basis, the deferred revenue continues to show a growth trend. At this rate, the deferred revenue in a single quarter in the fiscal year 2020 could be more than double that achieved in each quarter of 2015.Source: ALT PerspectiveAnother important financial item to watch for IHS Markit is its free cash flow. The data analytics and consultancy firm has somewhat a roll-up strategy where it has a long string of proven successes of using its strong cash flow generation to engage in synergistic acquisitions. In its SEC filing, the company reiterated the same: ""[the free cash flow] will continue to be a significant source of funding for our business strategy of growth through organic and acquisitive means."" In Q2 FY2019, IHS Markit managed to produce record high net operating cash flow and free cash flow.Source: ALT PerspectiveWhile the management kept its guidance unchanged, perhaps that was already better than what the market was expecting, considering that the crude oil price weakened substantially in the past couple of months. Historically, the movements of crude oil price and IHS Markit share price appeared to reflect a high correlation. The relationship has decoupled somewhat since the fourth quarter of 2018, which is a good development as it is an indication that its traditional reliance on resources-related customers has diminished.Data by YChartsOn IHS Markit's practice to make use of stock-based compensation ('SBC') to reward and retain its employees, it is comforting to know that as a percentage of annual revenue, the SBC now represents only around 6 percent. This is a step down from the more than 7 percent last year and a substantial reduction from the nearly 10 percent in 2014. This demonstrates prudence and financial discipline which is a key positive for shareholders.Data by YChartsOperationally, IHS Markit seemed to tick all my checkboxes. It is time to compare it against its peers. Based on the quant rating provided by Seeking Alpha Essentials, IHS Markit scored only a neutral rating of 3.36, dragged down ostensibly by its D- for 'Value.' In spite of desirable scoring for profitability and momentum, it is worthy of further investigation into whether IHS Markit deserves its low rating for value.Source: Seeking Alpha EssentialThe definition for 'Value' piqued my interest to explore for myself IHS Markit's standing relative to its peers:I compared IHS Markit with Verisk Analytics (VRSK), FactSet Research Systems (FDS), S&P Global (SPGI), and TransUnion PE (TRU). IHS Markit's P/E ratio at 62.2 times does look frightening at first glance, with the peers at 30-50 times, but when we consider the forward basis, IHS Markit now ranks last, with a P/E ratio (forward) at only 24.6 times, lower than peers coming in at 25.0 to 32.4 times.Data by YChartsThe story is similar for the enterprise value to EBITDA on a trailing-twelve-month ('TTM') whereby IHS Markit looks expensive again but on a forward basis, it ranks among the lowest.Data by YChartsFinally, the price-to-book value makes the comparison among the peer companies even starker. Even ignoring the outlier S&P Global with its P/B ratio of 170 times, IHS Markit's 3.0 times is substantially lower than its peers' coming in at between 6.7 times and 18 times.Data by YChartsWhen a stock starts making new highs, especially after just a while ago investors were bearish, one can't help but wonder if the share price appreciation has been too much and that the shareholder should take profit. However, the decision is not easy to make considering the positive developments the company is experiencing and its favorable financial metrics.What complicates the matter is the CEO who reckoned the company is just ""starting to realize the benefits"" of its ""longer-term strategy."" Coupled with the tailwind from the trade war truce, I am keeping my shares unless the price shoots up way above the uptrend price channel shown in the chart at the beginning of this article."
4354418,20715,2020-06-18T00:16:09-04:00,"IHS Markit is set to announce fiscal second-quarter earnings results on Tuesday.Analysts expect the company to report a small decline in earnings compared to 2019.The company has seen solid earnings growth in recent years, and it has beaten estimates in each of the last eight quarters.","Back on March 24, IHS Markit Ltd. (INFO) announced fiscal first-quarter earnings results, and the stock jumped 28% that day. It just so happened that the March low for the S&P was the day before the earnings report, and the entire market jumped on March 24, but not as much as IHS Markit. I wrote a bullish article about the company ahead of that earnings announcement, but I was also cautious because of how sharply the market had been falling in the weeks leading up to March 24.IHS Markit is set to report again on Tuesday, and I expect the company to beat estimates again. I wouldn’t look for the stock to jump by 28% once again, but I am still bullish on the stock. Analysts expect IHS Market to report earnings of $0.67 per share for the fiscal second quarter, and that would be a small decline in earnings compared to the second quarter of 2019. The company reported EPS of $0.71 in the quarter last year.One of the reasons I was bullish on IHS Markit in March and why I am still bullish on the stock is based on earnings growth. Over the last three years, the company has seen earnings grow by 13% per year. Earnings grew by 10% in the first quarter, and they are expected to increase by 5% for 2020 as a whole.Revenue has grown by 12% per year over the last three years and was up 3% in the first quarter. Analysts expect revenue to decline by 7% for the second quarter when compared to the second quarter of 2019. Those same analysts expect revenue to decline by 2.6% for 2020.As for the company’s management efficiency ratings, the return on equity is at 13.1%, and that falls in the average range. The profit margin is 30%, and that is well above average when compared to other companies. The stock is up approximately 40% from the time my first article was published, and that has caused the P/E ratio to move up to 32.1. The forward P/E is at 24.9.Overall, I think the fundamentals for IHS Markit are still better than those for the majority of companies. If the company beats its EPS estimate by 5.9%, it will have beaten estimates for eight straight quarters, and the result would be flat earnings instead of a decline. In the current economic environment, keeping earnings steady rather than falling is somewhat of a victory.As I pointed out earlier, the market was in the midst of a huge decline when IHS Markit reported back in March. The stock itself was tremendously oversold with the 10-week RSI at its lowest level since October 2014, and the weekly stochastic indicators were entering oversold territory as well. And those readings came just after the stock was tremendously overbought in January.Looking at the current chart, we see that the 10-week RSI has moved higher and is now back above the 50 level. The stochastic readings have moved up far more rapidly and have just entered overbought territory. The stochastic readings being in overbought territory isn’t all that concerning considering that the indicators were above 80 for almost an entire year.Because of the huge decline in the first quarter, I find the weekly chart to be distorted and harder to read than it would be under normal circumstances. This led me to look at the weekly chart, and I found it a little easier to read.What stood out to me on the daily chart was how the stock has been trending after the huge one-day jump on March 24. The channel you see is a Raff Regression Channel, with the middle line being the regression line. We see that the trend has been to the upside and in a relatively tight channel over the last three months.The daily overbought/oversold indicators dropped down out of overbought territory last week when the market dropped so sharply. They have turned higher this week, but they have a way to go before hitting overbought territory again.The sentiment toward IHS Markit was skewed slightly to the bearish side in March, but it has shifted to a more neutral stance at this time. The analysts’ ratings haven’t changed much, with 19 analysts covering the stock and 12 giving it a Buy rating. There are six Hold ratings and one Sell rating. This puts the buy percentage at 63.2%, which is slightly below average. The buy percentage was at 65% in March.The short interest ratio is where we saw the biggest change. The current reading is 3.0, and that is down considerably from the 5.5 reading we saw in March. Many companies have seen the short interest ratio drop, as the short-sellers seemed to cover their positions in March and the average daily trading volumes increased in most cases.The put/call ratio was rather bullish in March at 0.64, and it is even more bullish now with a reading of 0.47. There are only 1,509 puts open at this time and 3,208 calls open. Both the put and call open interests are considerably lower than they were in March, and the total number of shares represented is only 471K. That isn’t much open interest for a stock with an average daily trading volume over 2.0 million.I am still bullish on IHS Markit, and the reasoning is similar to what I stated in March. The fundamentals are solid, and I can see them getting stronger going forward. One argument I made back in March was that the company could see an increase in demand for its services.One of the things that helped drive the stock higher in March was an optimistic outlook, and I look for that to be the case again.The stock isn’t oversold like it was in March, but the 10-week RSI isn’t back up to overbought levels either. The daily oscillators show they have room to move higher before they enter overbought territory and there is room for the stock to move up without hitting the upper rail of the Raff Regression Channel.Seeing the sentiment shift away from a slightly bearish stance to a more neutral one doesn’t bother me. Given the company’s fundamental indicators, the sentiment is probably still more pessimistic than it should be.I mentioned earlier that IHS Markit has beaten its earnings estimates in each of the last eight quarters, and I fully expect the company to beat again this quarter. I look for the stock to continue trending higher over the rest of 2020, and I can see it reaching $85 before the end of the year."
4208526,103480,2018-09-27T05:51:05-04:00,"IHS Markit beat Wall Street's expectations yet again in its third-quarter earnings release.Revenues grew by double digits for the third quarter in a row, helped by a particularly strong quarter for the Transportation segment.Free cash flow also jumped 42% y/y.While generally a low-profile stock, IHS Markit remains one of the strongest and most consistent providers of recurring revenue.","In yet another quarter, IHS Markit (INFO) has shown investors the strength of its recurring revenue base and its newfound ability to continue sailing past Wall Street's estimates. The provider of enterprise data and critical industry metrics showed another quarter of double-digit revenue growth, sourced both organically and inorganically, allowing it to produce strong cash flow expansion as well.It's no big secret that Wall Street has gravitated toward subscription-style businesses across all industries. The companies that caught the majority of this tailwind have tended to be SaaS and enterprise software names, plus hot consumer internet companies like Netflix (NFLX). Yet in those spaces, many of the winning companies are actually small, or have plenty of competition. Despite not being a bona fide technology name or SaaS play, IHS Markit is a market heavyweight that deals in incredibly mission-critical data services that has very little competition in its space. Its renewed focus on recurring revenues, in my view, allows us to value the company more highly and much more akin to a SaaS name. It shares all the right characteristics: a scalable business model on top of high gross margins and strong unit economics, a high client retention rate, and a horizontally-focused go-to-market approach that can expand into many industry verticals.Over the past year, IHS Markit has already seen strong performance, up 18% YTD. Yet I believe there is still plenty of upside opportunity in this name, especially given the company's recent trend of strong free cash flow expansion. IHS Markit will never be the kind of stock that can double over several months like a hot new technology IPO, but as can be seen from its YTD chart below, its gains have been pretty steady and are capable of weathering sharp gyrations in the broader market:INFO data by YChartsIHS Markit is very much a ""safe stock"" that shares many of the subscription characteristics that investors value. Its Q3 earnings release offers further proof that its fundamentals are incredibly steady and show quarter after quarter of reliable growth and performance. In my view, this is a strong candidate to hold for the long term.Here's a glance at IHS Markit's third-quarter results:Figure 1. IHS Markit 3Q18 resultsSource: IHS Markit investor relationsTotal revenues grew 11% y/y and cracked the $1 billion mark; Wall Street had penciled in a consensus revenue estimate of just $992 million, or +10% y/y. This marks the third consecutive quarter that IHS Markit has grown revenues at a double-digit pace.Let's look at a few more elements of IHS Markit's revenue growth. First, note that recurring revenues as a whole grew 13% y/y to $842.5 million, faster than non-recurring revenue growth (which was largely flat). This means that recurring revenues are now an even greater portion (85%) of IHS Markit's total revenue base, up 2 points from 83% in the year-ago quarter. Note also that while IHS Markit has certainly folded in accretive acquisitions like financial services firm Ipreo to help its growth rates, it has largely also driven strong organic revenue growth:Figured 2. IHS Markit recurring vs. non-recurring revenuesSource: IHS Markit investor relationsOn a segment basis, this quarter's beat was driven largely by a boost in Transportation revenues, which grew 16% y/y to $297.0 million. Transportation is the second-largest of IHS Markit's vertical divisions, behind Financial Services. As can be seen from the chart below, much of this growth was sourced organically, and handily beat Wall Street's expectations of $293.6 million for the segment this quarter. The largest segment, Financial Services, also saw robust 16% y/y growth to $355.0 million (though a greater portion of this growth was attributed to acquisitions), beating Wall Street expectations of $326.3 million:Figure 3. IHS Markit segment revenuesSource: IHS Markit investor relationsNote also that IHS Markit has also updated its revenue outlook for the year to bake in its acquisition of Ipreo. The company's midpoint revenue range of $4.01 billion falls in line with Wall Street's consensus:Figure 4. IHS Markit guidance updateSource: IHS Markit investor relationsIt's on the profit front, however, that IHS Markit continues to exude quiet strength. Forget the dip in GAAP net income (this was colored by a tax benefit in the year-ago quarter): IHS Markit's pro forma EPS of $0.58 still beat Wall Street's expectations of $0.55 with comfortable upside.The real beat, however, lies in the strength of IHS Markit's free cash flow results. FCF has been a bright spot all year, and continues to do so in Q3:Figure 5. IHS Markit FCFSource: IHS Markit investor relationsFree cash flows grew 42% y/y to $292.6 million. For the year to date so far, IHS Markit has also grown free cash flows by 45% y/y to $763.5 million.It's important to note how much faster free cash flows are growing relative to revenues, once again highlighting the merits of a scalable recurring revenue business where incremental sales don't really produce significant incremental costs. FCF margin this quarter was 29.3%, 650bps stronger than 22.8% in the year-ago quarter; for the nine months year to date, FCF margin was 26.0%, up from 19.8% in the year-ago quarter.At the moment, IHS Markit is trading at a ~$21 billion market cap. If we apply a 26% FCF margin on its new revenue estimate of $4.01 billion, we arrive at an FY18 FCF estimate of $1.04 billion, which puts IHS Markit at a current 20.1x P/FY18 FCF multiple - which I consider to be a bargain, considering the company can produce >40% FCF growth.IHS Markit may not be the most exciting stock to hold in your portfolio, but it certainly offers a right balance of growth and value elements. The company is producing strong expansion on the free cash flow side that is leading to cheap FCF-based valuation multiples, and it's built atop an extremely steady recurring revenue business with low churn. I'm holding on to this name for the long haul and believe it can continue to outperform the markets well into 2019."
4225557,102639,2018-11-29T21:18:51-05:00,"IHS Markit has shown improved resiliency against the crude oil market, with the management confident enough to reaffirm the fiscal year 2018 guidance.IHS Markit's FY2019 guidance appears conservative, but it is important to realize that the company adopts a roll-up strategy, meaning that the eventual revenue could be higher due to acquisitions.The market ought to give due credit to IHS Markit for its revenue predictability.","It has been almost two months since my previous article on IHS Markit (INFO), and the share price is virtually unchanged. While this may seem like the stock has gone nowhere, it bears noting that the S&P 500 has actually declined 5.3 percent during the same period.INFO data by YChartsThe superior performance of IHS Markit is even more impressive when you consider that the crude oil price lost over $20 per barrel, or around 30 percent, in the same time span. Historically, there was a high correlation between the movements of crude oil price and IHS Markit share price.INFO data by YChartsThis is because a substantial number of its clients are in the energy industry, given that one of the main services of the company is providing the analytics and data of the energy markets. A weak crude oil price means that its upstream clients would see their profitability suffer. As a result, they would look into cost reduction and delay CapEx plans. In turn, subscriptions to third parties like IHS Markit could be cut, and with CapEx postponed, consultancy studies would thus be deferred. Although the impact is not immediately felt in reality, investors tend to react more promptly, as the market is forward-looking.Nevertheless, since the merger between IHS and Markit in mid-2016, the dependency of the company on its ""Resources"" segment, where the upstream business comprises 65 percent of its overall Resources business, has been significantly diminished. By the third quarter of 2018, the revenue from Financial Services, essentially the Markit side of the business, was 67 percent more than that from the Resources segment. This was up from 47 percent in 2017.Within the legacy IHS, the Transportation segment has also grown quickly to overshadow the Resources segment. By the third quarter of 2018, the revenue from Transportation was 40 percent more than that from the Resources segment. This was up from 18 percent in 2017. This is happening even as crude oil prices were substantially higher in the first nine months of fiscal year 2018 compared with the year before.The vastly improved resiliency against the crude oil market has been validated by the reaffirmation of the fiscal year 2018 guidance a month and a half later even as the crude oil prices began to plunge. On November 8, IHS Markit announced an unchanged FY2018 guidance, which was last revised on September 25 following its Q3 FY2018 results release.As a reminder, IHS Markit is expecting FY2018 revenue to come in at $4,000-4,020 million, supported by 6 percent organic growth. The revenue includes the recognition of four months of contribution amounting to $100-110 from its newly acquired Ipreo. FY2018 EBITDA on an adjusted basis would come in at $1,550-1,560 million, with the margin at 38.8 percent. Note that Ipreo has a lower standalone margin at 25.0-27.3 percent, diluting the 39.1 percent margin IHS Markit would have achieved before factoring in the acquisition.Management also introduced the FY2019 guidance on November 8. Revenue is expected to show a 5-6 percent organic growth and come in at $4,425-4,500 million. At the midpoint, this would be around 11 percent higher year on year (""yoy""). Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be $1,750-1,780, 13.5 percent higher yoy.Comparing the growth rates from the guidance and the stellar past years' performance, FY2019 might appear to be disappointing. However, it is important to realize that IHS Markit adopts a roll-up strategy. Hence, the eventual revenue achieved is likely to be higher than the guided number. Take FY2018, for instance - the current guidance for FY2018 is 5.5 percent higher than that provided in November 2017.INFO Revenue (Annual YoY Growth) data by YChartsInterestingly, the outlook for the additional financial items mentioned in the guidance is a mixed bag. First, the bad. Net interest expense could amount to $245-250 million, 14 percent higher yoy. However, there are good developments anticipated. Stock-based compensation expense of $215-225 million allocated for FY2019 is actually $10 million lower than the current fiscal year's figure, despite the projected revenue increase. Capital Expenditures could also reduce somewhat to 6.0-6.5 percent of revenue, compared to 6-7 percent of revenue in the current fiscal year.IHS Markit's deferred revenue is showing a steady trend, providing visibility into the company's future top line reporting. The high revenue visibility was one of the factors cited by Deutsche Bank in initiating IHS Markit at Buy. In the Q3 FY2018, IHS Markit recorded a deferred revenue of $897 million, representing yet another yoy increase.Indeed, the market ought to give due credit to IHS Markit for its revenue predictability. 70 percent of the revenue is recurring fixed, and another 15 percent is recurring variable with annual to multi-year contracts with high renewal rates historically. The company also has a strong balance sheet and high free cash flow conversion percentage now ""solidly in the mid-60s,"" as described by Lance Uggla, CEO of IHS Markit.In summary, I feel comfortable holding onto my shares even with crude oil in a bear market. IHS Markit has become a multi-industry business with a blue-chip customer base representing over 80% of the Fortune Global 500 and more than 50,000 customers in total.What's your take?

This is where IHS Markit comes in.","With consistent outperformance, market analysts must have been conditioned to expect more from IHS Markit (INFO). Yet, the consultancy and analytics titan managed to report its eighth consecutive quarter of surpassing the consensus revenue estimates. By EPS, it is also the fifth consecutive quarter that IHS Markit has reported a beat.IHS Markit announced third quarter (three-month period ending August 31, 2018) revenue growing 10.6 percent year on year and 7 percent on an organic basis (excluding the impact from the prior year biennial BPVC revenue). The revenue at $1.001 billion is the second highest IHS Markit has ever achieved and the second time since the $1 billion mark was breached the prior quarter. The EBITDA (adjusted) rose 11 percent over the prior year. As explained in my earlier article on IHS Markit, the Deferred Revenue performance gives a good indication of the business health of the information and analytics company on the organic front. This is due to its subscription model, where revenue is locked in for the next couple of years. There can be plenty of bells and whistles to augment the top line number as that is what the media loves to tout as headlines.As for the deferred revenue, a steady trend provides visibility into the company future top line reporting. The high revenue visibility was one of the factors cited by Deutsche Bank in initiating IHS Markit at Buy early this month. Other drivers include secular tailwinds, economic moat, margin expansion opportunity, and solid FCF conversion, all of which I have mentioned in my prior articles as the reasons for my bullishness regarding the business. At $897 million, the quarter has seen yet another steady period for its deferred revenue. Those familiar with IHS Markit know it has been capable of using its strong cash flow generation to engage in synergistic acquisitions. Despite numerous acquisitions, IHS Markit has managed to keep its cash & cash equivalents quite stable at around $150 million for more than a year. This is facilitated by a rising operating cash flows. This alone, however, is insufficient. The use of debt is rising significantly (see the chart below), particularly in the past quarter due to the acquisition of IPREO.The company had originally intended to sell MarkitSERV to raise cash and reduce the debt component but it has decided to keep the business as it was unable to obtain a satisfactory deal price. Nevertheless, the debt to equity ratio remains low at 0.28 times. In addition, the management has planned to use up to the third quarter of next year to delever before committing to $500 million of share buybacks. The market had responded favorably to IHS Markit's third quarter results with a good bump in its share price. However, despite another price appreciation following Deutsche Bank's initiation at Buy, the stock is back to pre-announcement level. That is likely attributable to the interest rate hike and intensifying trade tensions. What IHS Markit has as a tailwind to its Resources segment is the fact that the crude oil prices have been climbing. Wall Street analysts continue to like the stock. Even the bearish ones have raised their price targets on IHS Markit upwards steadily. The consensus price target is presently at $58.60. While the 9 percent upside isn't much, it is noteworthy that the price target has followed the revenue growth. The price target would have room to grow as long as IHS Markit continues its steady execution. On the hot topic of tariff impact on companies, Lance Uggla replied that he did not ""see impact of tariffs changing our growth on a forward basis"". This makes sense when you understand that IHS Markit is in the business of advisory and consultancy. Executives all over the world are looking for analysis and studies to help them navigate the uncertainty brought about by the various policy changes. This is where IHS Markit comes in.

4251658,103231,2019-03-28T18:55:08-04:00,"IHS Markit continues to show strong results that come from the strengths of its financial services and transportation segments.The expansion in margins, recent acquisitions, reduction of leverage, and the return of a share buyback program are some of the bullish arguments for 2019.It seems that IHS Markit is trading slightly at a discount from the perspective of the EV to EBITDA and EV to FCF ratios.","The price of IHS Markit Ltd. (INFO) fell from its historic high after the company reported results for its first quarter of 2019. The shares, which have not been able to pass the $55 barrier, fell on Tuesday the 26th as a result of revenue that came below expectations, despite an EPS that was better than projected.Revenues continued with their growth of 13%, reaching $1.05 billion during this period, supported mainly by the most significant segment of the company, the financial services segment. The company has seen the analyst consensus improve over the past year as more buy recommendations add up. However, the market seems to disagree with these prospects as the stock price has performed below similar companies.Although the executive guidance suggests revenues between $4.43 billion and $4.5 billion for 2019 or an 11% increase in the mid-point, it seems that investors don't like the recent slowdown of the company. In our opinion, IHS Markit keeps a solid investment thesis based on the strength of its financial services and transportation segments, its recent acquisitions, its reduction in leverage, and the resumption of its stock repurchase program. The first quarter seems to reinforce each of these points, which we expose below.IHS Markit is known for providing data, insight, and software to a wide range of companies and governments around the world. Revenues derive mainly from subscription services through annual contracts, which represent approximately 80% of total revenues. These contracts are renewed automatically, allowing the company to maintain a retention rate of over 90%.IHS Markit's offering serves a wide range of end markets, providing a healthy revenue mix. The company operates in industries as diverse as energy, chemical, transportation, and financial. The most important competitive advantage of the business model comes from its intangible assets and switching costs, which we believe persuades its clients to stay with the company.Source: Data extracted from the SEC.These competitive advantages have resulted in accelerated growth in the top line of the income statement. Looking closely at the company's segments for the first quarter of 2019, the financial services business saw growth of 28% compared to the previous year, delivering about $409 million in revenue. The executives explained that these results were driven by a higher deal flow after the acquisition of Ipreo, in addition to organic growth of 6% from its software, analysis, and EDM businesses.IHS Markit solutions begin to see the results of the new data analysis products for alternative investments. The acquisition of Ipreo generated double-digit growth as the company reports more contracts from this line of business. We expect that this trend will not only continue in the medium term but also generate a margin expansion in the next five years.The transportation segment reported about $288 million in revenue for this period, saw organic growth of 8% thanks to the diversification of its products that cover the entire value chain of the automotive sector. This segment has performed well thanks to the strength of its auto forecasting software Carfax and automotiveMastermind. IHS Markit's approach to building new products around its Carfax offering reinforces the company's competitive position, allowing its customers to take advantage of industry dynamics by grouping historical vehicle data with marketing and sales tools.Source: Data provided by YCharts.Summing up the above, the increases in financial regulation and the compliance needs of the sector seen in recent years have favored the financial services segment of IHS Markit. Its analysis, insight, and software products are integrated into the systems of financial institutions, increasing the switching cost. These qualities make the company's offer particularly relevant to the operations of its customers. In the same way, the transportation segment reinforces the company's competitive position. Its Carfax product is considered a reliable brand in the automotive industry. The customer's systems usually integrate this data since it is available at a relatively small cost, providing a price advantage.With this in mind, we believe that the organic growth of these segments is sustainable in the long term, as the results of this quarter indicate. In addition to this, the acquisition of Ipreo that has begun to boost revenues gives confidence in the company's growth prospects for the long term.On the side of profitability, IHS Markit has shown metrics very similar to that of its peers. The company's executives have managed to identify business lines that generate a consistent profit. Its most lucrative segment continues to be the financial services, which produced an adjusted EBITDA of $183 million with a margin of 45%, a figure that contracted slightly after the acquisition of Ipreo. Likewise, the transportation business that has also been characterized by its profitability reported an adjusted EBITDA of $114 million with a margin of 40%.The business model and the cost structure of IHS Markit have resulted in wide margins that are transferred to all lines of the income statement. Similarly, although the free cash flow for the first quarter was seasonally low, the company made around $125 million in this period, which represented a conversion rate of 65%. Comparatively speaking, we see that both FCF growth and FCF yield of IHS Markit are well above those of similar companies.Source: Data provided by YCharts.This profitability has allowed the company to maintain an acquisition strategy as part of its innovation and improvement of its offer. Although the acquisition of Ipreo for $1.9 billion offers the opportunity for cross-selling, we believe that this purchase significantly increased the company's leverage. The debt at the end of the quarter amounted to $5.6 billion, representing leverage of approximately 4.2 times the EBITDA. As a result of this increase in debt levels, executives chose to temporarily suspend the stock repurchase program to allocate more resources to reduce leverage.We expect the company to turn to its stock repurchase program at the end of the year. This return of capital to investors can be added to the bullish arguments making the company more attractive in the middle term. We think that the IHS Markit strategy of capital allocations is sustainable in the long run as both EBITDA and FCF continue to grow.Regarding the valuation of the shares, we think that IHS Markit is trading slightly at a discount from the perspective of the EV to EBITDA and EV to FCF ratios since these metrics are below their average levels of three years. Looking to the future, it seems that the expansion of margins will quickly compress these ratios, making valuations more attractive.Source: Data provided by YCharts.Despite this, we note that the stock price has had problems to get over the barrier of $55, which makes us believe that the market still does not discount this expansion in margins. We expect that as fundamentals improve during 2019, this differential between future valuations and historical ones will make the company even more attractive compared to its competitors."
4184655,102639,2018-06-29T01:23:21-04:00,"Q2 2018 marks the seventh consecutive quarter that IHS Markit has surpassed the consensus revenue estimates.There has been a strong improvement in the company's net operating cash flow.Two years post-merger, IHS Markit is still seeing revenue synergies across its customer base.","IHS Markit (NYSE:INFO) reported a solid second quarter (three-month period ending May 31, 2018), with revenue growing 11.5 percent year on year and 8 percent on an organic basis. The EBITDA (adjusted) rose 13 percent, while its EPS (adjusted) was even better at 17 percent. The revenue at $1.008 billion is the highest the information and analytics company has ever achieved and the first time the $1 billion mark has been breached. The quarter was even more impressive considering this marks the seventh consecutive quarter that IHS Markit has surpassed the consensus revenue estimates.INFO Revenue (Quarterly) data by YChartsSimilar to the previous quarter, IHS Markit had a broad-based performance. All divisions showed an increase in revenue, with the Transportation segment jumping 14 percent year on year on an organic basis alone. Even the formerly laggard Resources segment saw a 5 percent gain on an organic basis, thanks in part to the bullish crude oil market in recent months.One of the earlier hints of a strong Q2 came from a discussion regarding IHS Markit's mega conference. Liam Denning, a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering energy, mining and commodities, remarked on the success of the CERAWeek this year.IHS Markit has largely reaffirmed its FY2018 (year ending November 30, 2018) guidance. Revenue guidance at $3.85-3.9 billion is an increase of $25 million to reflect the strong Q2 organic revenue performance. It also expects adjusted EBITDA to be at the upper end of the current range of $1.5-1.525 billion. Note that the current guidance does not include Ipreo (its recent acquisition), but company management is expecting it to remain within the current adjusted EPS guidance range post the Ipreo deal close.As explained in my earlier article on IHS Markit, the Deferred Revenue performance gives a good indication of the business health of the information and analytics company on the organic front. This is due to its subscription model, where revenue is locked in for the next couple of years. By the end of the first quarter, the accumulated deferred revenue rose to the highest level at $919.3 million, surpassing the previous peak achieved a year ago. As mentioned in the previous earnings review, I mentioned that the spike is partly a seasonal effect given that companies generally renew their subscriptions or sign up new ones at the beginning of the year after a fresh budget is approved. The reduction in Q2 2018 appears to be in line with last year's trend.(Source: Data from IHS Markit, Chart by ALT Perspective)What caught my eye was the strong improvement in the company's net operating cash flow. This translates to a record high free cash flow as well (see the chart below).(Source: Data from IHS Markit, Chart by ALT Perspective)The word ""synergies"" was mentioned several times during the earnings conference call. IHS Markit is a result of a merger between IHS, which is rich in information and insights across industries, and Markit, a financial services powerhouse. Two years on, the merged company is still seeing revenue synergies across its customer base. This reassures investors of the company's track record in achieving success from its acquisitions.In my March article, the price chart of IHS Markit was showing the shares being hemmed in a triangular formation. I mentioned I was watching for a breakout from this ""ascending triangle"", a bullish pattern, and indeed IHS Markit did not disappoint, with the share price ""breaking out"" in May. As typical of a breakout, there was a backtest to the earlier resistance line. Subsequently, the share price resumed its uptrend. At this point, in the event that there is a pullback, the rising blue line shown in the chart could serve as a support.While IHS Markit has seen its share price run up since February this year, there remains upside if we were to reference the consensus price target currently at $55.54. The low of the price target range has just been raised post Q2 results, indicating that the analysts have finally thrown in the towel and acknowledged the better prospects of this company.INFO data by YChartsConsidering that IHS Markit has delivered a good set of numbers yet again for both the income statement and the cash flow statement, I tend to agree with the consensus that there remains upside to be had for the share price.What's your take? How much more upside is available in IHS Markit?

4184175,103480,2018-06-27T05:36:19-04:00,"IHS Markit continued to excel in its Q2 earnings release, showing its second consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth and accelerating over last year.IHS Markit's CEO declared this quarter as the strongest quarter for organic revenue growth since the merger of IHS and Markit in July 2016.Free cash flow nearly doubled from the prior year, indicating the strength of a business that's almost purely recurring.The company also nudged its revenue and EIBTDA guidance for the year upward.","Most people have likely heard of the name IHS Markit (INFO) as a footnote in a scholarly article or cited as a source in a data-rich news piece, but relatively few have considered this under-the-radar company as a viable investment. Now halfway through its fiscal year, IHS Markit has yet again demonstrated to investors that it has become a much larger and infinitely more successful company since the 2016 merger of its namesakes, one that dominates the business of providing specialized data and industry metrics toward enterprise clients for a subscription fee. Despite being an old-school company that has penetrated deep into its addressable market, IHS Markit still finds opportunity to drive strong organic revenue growth. And though it's not a traditional technology or software company, it has the recurring revenue characteristics that investors prize from SaaS companies.IHS Markit just reported Q2 earnings, continuing its recent streak of outperformance. Here, consistency is key - IHS Markit outshone analyst expectations last quarter, but few were thinking that its 12% y/y revenue growth last quarter could last very long, especially for such a ""dull"" business in an old industry. It proved naysayers wrong this quarter with 11% y/y revenue growth, along with the CEO's affirmation that this quarter was the best quarter for organic revenue growth (aka, revenue growth that was not derived from acquired assets) since the combination of IHS and Markit in 2016.Shares lurched upward ~5% on the earnings news, adding juice to an already-fantastic 16% YTD rally (the recent China trade war has dropped the broader market's gains this year to roughly flat, so IHS Markit's outperformance is quite noticeable). Still, however, I view the company's <16x forward EBITDA multiple and ~6x revenue multiple as laden with opportunity, though it's no longer as cheap of a stock as it was at the beginning of the year.INFO data by YChartsThis is especially true as IHS Markit delivered tremendously strong free cash flow results this quarter. The consistency that the company has been able to deliver on the bottom line, as well as the comfort of having a revenue base that is more recurring than not, highlights the core tenets of IHS Markit's bull thesis. In my view, IHS Markit's rally still has plenty of room for growth, especially as most investors haven't yet fully picked up on the recurring revenue theme.Here's a look at IHS Markit's second-quarter results:Figure 1. IHS Markit Q2 resultsSource: IHS Markit investor relationsJust like last quarter, IHS Markit's growth was broad-based. Total revenues crossed $1.01 billion (+11% y/y) and vastly surpassed analyst expectations of $973 million (+7% y/y), with strong growth across all of IHS Markit's client verticals. Like last quarter, Transportation clients continued to be the largest source of IHS Markit's growth, growing an astounding 24% y/y (12% y/y on an organic basis):Figure 2. IHS Markit revenue breakdownSource: IHS Markit investor relationsKey to note as well is that IHS Markit maintained its large split of recurring versus non-recurring revenues; though the recurring revenue mix did lose 70 bps in Q2 from 2Q17, the company still maintained 81.7% of its revenues as recurring. This trend is key as recurring revenue represents business that the company doesn't have to chase and expend sales dollars on. Over time, recurring revenue is an extremely high-margin source of income.It's also worth noting that, accounting for IHS Markit's strong top-line performance this quarter, the company has increased its full-year revenue outlook by $25 million, from $3.825-$3.875 billion previously to $3.85-$3.90 billion. Instead of a prior organic growth range of 4-5%, this new range implies one additional point of organic growth of 5-6%. The fact that IHS Markit is still capable of driving mid-single-digit organic growth, while using recent acquisitions like Ipreo to pad the total growth number, is a key driver of the bullish traction on this company.The company didn't fail to impress on the profit side, either. Adjusted EBITDA continues to be the company's lead profitability metric, and that leaped ahead by 13% y/y to $398.1 million, and showed a ~50 bps improvement in EBITDA margin.Figure 3. IHS Markit adjusted EBITDASource: IHS Markit investor relationsIt's worth noting, however, that a lot of IHS Markit's bottom-line performance came from one-time tax benefits from the Trump tax reform that were recorded in Q1, according to IHS Markit's CFO on the earnings call. Still, the company's adjusted EPS of $0.61 stripped out the benefit of tax effects and grew 17% y/y, beating analyst expectations of $0.57. And per usual, free cash flow was another source of strength to highlight for IHS Markit, which showed unusually robust >2x growth this quarter to $323.2 million.Figure 4. IHS Markit free cash flowSource: IHS Markit investor relationsThough IHS Markit focuses a lot of its earnings discussions and callouts on organic revenue growth, it certainly has shown that it's not afraid to be aggressive on the M&A front as well. IHS Markit's acquisition of Ipreo for $1.86 billion in cash and debt, previously owned by Blackstone (BX) and Goldman Sachs' (GS) merchant banking division, got plenty of airtime on the Q2 earnings call. Management expects Ipreo to deliver one point of organic revenue growth alone (in future years of course, once the company gets counted in the organic revenue base), noting the following on the earnings call:The underlying point here - a company that is producing annual free cash flow of about $1 billion has the capacity to approach many more companies like Ipreo to stimulate growth. IHS Markit isn't content in staying stagnant in its space; it is aggressively chasing other leading data platforms in its goal to become the dominant provider of highly specialized data.IHS Markit's second-quarter results highlighted yet again all of the positive reasons to invest in the little-known company: strong organic revenue growth combined with sizable acquisition-driven revenue potential, a stable business that is more than 80% recurring, and huge margin and free cash flow expansion. Shares of IHS Markit certainly aren't tremendously cheap, but given the consistency of the company's results and its proven ability to drive growth in a slow market, its recent outperformance is likely to continue."
4233844,103480,2019-01-16T16:26:51-05:00,"Shares of data provider IHS Markit rose ~2% after reporting strong Q4 results, with revenue growth accelerating to 13% y/y (up two points from the prior quarter's revenue growth).Recurring revenues also saw far stronger growth than non-recurring, adding to IHS Markit's overall revenue stability.IHS Markit is an entrenched data provider that is capitalizing on consistent margin performance to deliver strong bottom-line results as well.Free cash flows also saw a healthy 74% y/y bump.","Little is ever said about IHS Markit (INFO), the ubiquitous provider of corporate and institutional data across industries like energy and financial services - yet, the company remains one of the most consistent earnings performers that continues to build out a huge recurring revenue base and improve its margin profile. IHS Markit just closed out its fiscal 2018 with a strong showing in Q4, with accelerating revenue growth roughly in-line with Wall Street's consensus and a beat to EPS estimates. Buoyed by the strong print, investors sent shares of IHS Markit up ~2% in after-hours trading.INFO data by YChartsIHS Markit is hardly an exciting stock. But its fundamental profile, in my view, matches exactly what investors are looking for in a potentially turbulent 2019. Like many software companies, IHS Markit has refined its focus on recurring revenues. Over the past several quarters (and especially in Q4), IHS Markit has seen far stronger revenue growth on the recurring side than on non-recurring, improving its overall recurring mix and contributing to revenue stability. IHS Markit is effectively a subscription business - its enterprise clients pay regular fees for access to its data and benchmarking assets. Building on this recurring revenue base, IHS Markit has also acquired smaller data providers aggressively (allowing it to achieve accelerating revenue growth) and keep a laser focus on costs, which has resulted in significant EPS and cash flow gains.These two themes - revenue stability and rich cash flows - are key elements that can drive a recovery rally for IHS Markit in a market environment that is still shunning riskier, high-loss names. As can be seen in the price chart above, IHS Markit has already seen a nice rebound toward its 2018 highs in the early weeks of 2019 (it's still about ~10% off its all-time high of $56).Yet, the company still has room to the upside. At current prices, IHS Markit has a $20.0 billion market cap. That gives it a fairly reasonable valuation of 18.7x P/FY18 FCF. When factoring in possible FCF growth in FY19 as well, a double-digit percentage rally for IHS Markit doesn't appear out of reach in 2019.Stay long on IHS Markit - this is a relatively little-known, underappreciated stock that has proven itself a consistent performer multiple quarters in a row. It's also a company without significant competition. Though IHS Markit competes with other well-known names like Thomson Reuters (NYSE:TRI) in the financial services space (which comprises approximately 40% of its revenues), the company still remains the dominant force in sectors like natural resources and transportation. With such a large recurring revenue base locked in and non-financial services competition to diminish it, it's difficult to see IHS Markit veering off course and missing expectations anytime soon.Here's a look at IHS Markit's fourth-quarter results:Figure 1. IHS Markit 4Q18 resultsSource: IHS Markit press releaseIt's important to note that IHS Markit consolidated the revenues of recently-acquired subsidiary Ipreo into the fourth-quarter print. IHS Markit closed the $1.9 billion purchase of the financial data provider in August, which contributed to a huge 27% y/y jump in revenues from financial services. Of this growth, just 4% was organic.Total top-line organic growth clocked in at a similar 5% rate, with total revenues up to $1.07 billion (just shy of Wall Street consensus of $1.08 billion). It's important to note, however, that the as-reported growth rate of 13% y/y accelerated two points over last quarter's 11% y/y growth rate. In addition, IHS Markit's recurring revenue picture continues to look healthier and healthier each quarter:Figure 2. IHS Markit recurring revenue splitSource: IHS Markit press releaseWhile non-recurring revenues essentially saw flat y/y growth, recurring fixed revenues grew 15% y/y and recurring variable revenues grew 18% y/y. Recurring revenues overall made up 84.4% of IHS Markit's revenue base, up 170bps from 82.7% in the year-ago quarter.We note one additional point of strength as well: the transportation segment. Transportation revenues saw 10% y/y organic growth, the strongest out of all of IHS Markit's segments:Figure 3. IHS Markit revenue growth by segmentSource: IHS Markit press releaseLance Uggla, IHS Markit's CEO, pointed to further organic growth for Transportation ahead. On the Q4 earnings call, he noted as follows:It's useful to note as well that IHS Markit is still expecting similar levels of organic revenue growth for FY19, with a range of between 4-6% y/y growth. The slide below, taken from IHS Markit's Q4 earnings deck, summarizes the key points of IHS Markit's FY19 forecast:Figure 4. IHS Markit FY19 guidanceSource: IHS Markit Q4 earnings deckAside from top-line strength, IHS Markit also delivered considerable wins on the profitability front. GAAP operating margins ticked up to 14.9%, up from 14.7% in the year-ago quarter, while pro forma EPS of $0.57 edged past Wall Street's consensus of $0.55 (despite the slight revenue miss). Most impressive of all, however, IHS Markit managed to boost free cash flow by 74% y/y to $303.3 million:Figure 5. IHS Markit FCFSource: IHS Markit press releaseYear-to-date, IHS Markit has delivered $1.07 billion of free cash flow, up 52% y/y. The company expects this level of FCF to sustain well into 2019: it has guided to FCF at a mid-sixties percentage of adjusted EBITDA. With the midpoint of EBITDA guidance hovering at $1.765 billion and assuming a midpoint 65% EBITDA conversion to FCF, this implies FCF of $1.15 billion in FY19 or 8% y/y growth relative to FY18.IHS Markit's strong fourth-quarter performance and a robust outlook for the coming year offer continued reassurance for investing in this company. The company is executing well on the growth front from both an organic and inorganic perspective, while also beefing up its mix of recurring revenues. On the profit side, IHS Markit is delivering well over $1 billion in annual FCF - and considering FCF is still primed to grow in the high single digits next year, IHS Markit's current valuation at ~19x forward FCF still seems modest. Remain long on IHS Markit - this is the kind of steady stock that will reward patient investors."
4166776,102639,2018-04-27T02:20:52-04:00,"A reader messaged me regarding her concern over the recent bout of selling at IHS Markit by Lance Uggla, CEO and chairman of the Board, no less.On closer look, all the stake sales by Lance Uggla were part of a systematic trading plan under Rule 10b5-1.The company's stock-based compensation is way ahead of its peers in the information and analytics sector.From my technical charting, IHS Markit could develop into a classic case of a breakout from a multi-month ascending triangle formation.","A reader messaged me regarding her concern over the recent bout of selling at IHS Markit (NYSE:INFO) by Lance Uggla, CEO and chairman of the Board, no less. The stake sales were minuscule relative to the market capitalization of IHS Markit. However, they represented a hefty chunk of Lance Uggla’s total ownership in the company. Lance Uggla started the month of April with 846,023 IHS Markit shares, but is now left with just about half that number at 466,023 shares before the month has ended. Adam Kansler, EVP, and Ruann Ernst, director at IHS Markit, were also selling in April. In the past three months, the number of insider buys (24) is nearly balanced by the number of sells (25). However, in terms of the number of shares traded, there were only 141,620 shares bought by insiders against 734,466 shares sold, giving a net negative 592,846 shares. The imbalance is apparently something to be paying attention to indeed.(Source: Nasdaq.com)On closer look, all the stake sales by Lance Uggla were ""automatic sells"", otherwise known as systematic trading under Rule 10b5-1. According to Investopedia, ""Rule 10b5-1 is established by the Securities Exchange Commission (""SEC"") to allow insiders of publicly traded corporations to set up a trading plan for selling stocks they own. Rule 10b5-1 allows major holders to sell a predetermined number of shares at a predetermined time. Many corporate executives use 10b5-1 plans to avoid accusations of insider trading"".It's understandable why the CEO would want to have a plan to trim his holdings periodically. IHS Markit has historically rewarded its executives generously with stock-based compensation. At 7.28% of its annual revenues, the company's stock-based compensation is way ahead of its peers in the information and analytics sector. With that amount of stocks being granted each year, perhaps it would be prudent to cash in some of that either for spending or diversification into other investments.With all that selling, it's not surprising that the number of shares owned by insiders at IHS Markit is coming down. Nevertheless, the reduction is also attributable to the decline in stock-based compensation since the peak recorded during the merger between IHS and Markit in mid-2016. At 4.2 million shares owned by insiders, it's more than double that pre-merger. Hence, the gradual decline in the insider ownership is, in fact, not that worrying.INFO Shares Owned By Insiders data by YChartsThe shares of IHS Markit have been trading in an ascending triangle formation since January 2018. According to the school of technical analysis, such a trading pattern is a prelude to a bullish outcome if the stock breaks out of the triangle from the resistance line (ceiling). With the stock inching so close to the acute angle of the triangle, chartists must be eagerly anticipating an imminent price direction to materialize. This development is, to me, a more pertinent issue than the programmatic sale by the top executives.(Source: Drawings by ALT Perspective, Chart from Yahoo Finance) Whether the stock develops into a classic case of a breakout from a multi-month ascending triangle formation or not, it is undeniable that fundamentally, IHS Markit is getting stronger. In my recent article, ""Netflix Vs. Disney: An Evaluation"", I stated the importance of tracking the deferred revenue growth to understand where the top line figure in the profit/loss statement is heading for subscription-based businesses. It is the same for IHS Markit, and I explained why, in my prior article, ""IHS Markit: War Chest Is Refilled For Acquisitions"". Based on the most recent quarterly report, it is comforting to know that IHS Markit’s deferred revenue growth is back on track. In fact, its accumulated deferred revenue rose to the highest ever, surpassing the previous peak achieved a year ago.(Source: Data from IHS Markit, Chart by ALT Perspective)The top executives have their reasons for deciding to have in place a plan to regularly trim their holdings in IHS Markit. To me, it is reasonable that they do so in order to diversify their investments, knowing that each year they would be given a fresh batch of shares in the company. It is not something investors need to be worried about.What's your take? Readers who make a comment will have access to the comment thread indefinitely.

4160258,103480,2018-03-31T06:19:26-04:00,"IHS Markit released strong Q1 results, with top-line growth leaping to double digits (an acceleration from 8% growth last quarter).EBITDA and EPS grew 12% and 18%, respectively, beating analyst expectations.The company has more than two-thirds of its business built on recurring revenues.Shares still look modestly valued at about 15x forward EBITDA.","Another quarter, another beat for IHS Markit (INFO), the global provider of business data and benchmarking services. Despite being little-known in the stock market, IHS Markit continues to build a huge subscription business that's deeply rooted in the operations of its clients. With a huge mass of proprietary data in a business environment that increasingly extols the virtue of data-driven decision-making, IHS is well-positioned to continue its widespread dominance.Particularly encouraging this quarter is the fact that IHS Markit delivered double-digit revenue growth - after growing just 8% last quarter and guiding to only single-digit growth for the full year. Add that to the fact that the company has almost entirely recurring revenues, and IHS Markit looks like a formula for long-term success.One other reason to like IHS Markit for 2018 is the fact that the stock hasn't moved much year to date - though the broader market is also flat to slightly down. Since reporting earnings last quarter, shares of IHS Markit are back to the $48 level, still putting the company at a reasonable multiple of its projected earnings.INFO data by YChartsAt IHS Markits' recent closing price of $48.24, the company carries a market cap of $19.19 billion. Being that the company does carry a substantial amount of debt, its enterprise value gives a more realistic picture of its valuation. Netting out IHS Markits' $156 million of cash against its $4.28 billion of debt, the company has a current enterprise value of $23.31 billion.Here's where IHS Markits is guiding FY18 after its most recent quarter:Figure 1. IHS Markits FY18 guidanceSource: IHS Markits investor relationsSome additional context on IHS Markits' robust guidance for the year from CEO Lance Uggla's remarks on the earnings call:The recovery of oil prices, which has led to a revival in the energy sector, lends huge support to one of IHS Markits' largest client verticals, which saw a revenue decline last year as energy companies pulled back on spending. With the energy outlook more supportive this year, IHS Markits is likely to see tailwinds against much easier y/y comps.Against the midpoint of its FY18 revenue of $3.85 billion (in line with analyst consensus of $3.85 billion), IHS Markits has an EV/FY18 revenue multiple of 6.0x. Against adjusted EBITDA, which may be the more appropriate valuation multiple as IHS Markits is a stable, cash-flowing business, the company has an EV/FY18 EBITDA multiple of 15.4x.While neither multiple screams deep value, it must be noted that the majority of high-quality subscription businesses, typically within SaaS, tend to trade at 7-8x revenues and at much higher multiples of earnings, if any exist. While IHS Markits isn't exactly a growth champion, the fact that it has a huge recurring business that can still post solid organic growth, atop the potential for margin expansion and cash flow, the company can rightly be considered a value play.As shown in the price chart above, the stock hasn't moved much yet year to date, allowing investors a reasonable entry point.Underlying the bullish thesis for IHS Markits is the strength of its earnings. Despite the fact that the company has achieved a massive ~$4 billion revenue scale, it managed to see revenue acceleration this quarter and bump its growth up to double digits. See the company's full results below:Figure 2. IHS Markits Q1 resultsSource: IHS Markits investor relationsTotal revenues grew 10.4% y/y to $932.1 million, hugely surpassing analyst estimates of $907.0 million (+7.4% y/y). Note that a three-point beat might be a small upside margin for a growth stock, but for a company that's typically growing only in the high single digits or low double digits, it's a spectacular showing. Of this growth, 6% was organic (due to the core business and not acquisitions).Each of IHS Markits' end markets saw growth in the quarter - most notably Resources, which spent most of last year struggling:Source: IHS Markits investor relationsAlso note in particular the 24% y/y growth in recurring revenues in the Transportation vertical. Even without the company's acquisition of automotiveMastermind, the transportation unit grew 11% organically.Recurring revenues also represented 86% of the company's total business - flat year over year. With such a large percentage of the business locked in, the company's incremental growth continues to build on top of a stable base.On the profit side, GAAP operating profits rose 46% y/y to $139.7 million. This represents a 15.0% operating margin, versus just 11.4% in 1Q17. Pro forma EPS of $0.53 also beat analyst consensus of $0.50 by a respectable margin.The company also grew its adjusted EBITDA - probably the most important marker for its valuation - by 12% y/y, underscoring improved EBITDA margins across all of IHS Markits' client segments:Figure 3. IHS Markits EBITDA growthSource: IHS Markits investor relationsInvestors in the market have had a long love affair with strong subscription/recurring revenue businesses, and for good reason - with revenues more or less locked in annual contracts, these companies produce extremely reliable earnings and grow at dependable rates, as exhibited this quarter. Unfortunately, that usually means paying premium valuations for a high-growth SaaS stock (although the slight correction in tech stocks in the first quarter has made valuations slightly more digestible).In IHS Markits, however, is an opportunity to benefit from the stability of a recurring revenue business without paying too extreme of a price. I view my holding in IHS Markits as a steady, sleep-at-night kind of stock to counterbalance my high-growth plays. Stay long on this name as it continues to produce compelling results at a reasonable price."

If so, the firms doubled their money in approximately four years.Market & CompetitionAccording to a 2017 market research report by McKinsey & Company, the Capital Markets Infrastructure Providers [CMIP] industry’s CAGR is expected to grow 5% between 2015 and 2020.The main drivers for this expected growth are acquisitions and diversification into new businesses, the rise in demand for alternative investment information as well as core trading and facilitation activity.Major competitive vendors in the CMIP industry include:Acquisition Terms and RationaleIHS Markit disclosed the acquisition price as $1.855 billion in cash.IHS said the deal represented a 2019 forward Adjusted EBITDA multiple of 16x and that it expected the deal to be accretive to 2019 Adjust EPS.That management cites “Adjusted” figures is unfortunately typical, as GAAP figures are less generous.In conjunction with the deal, the firm is suspending its share buyback program ‘until leverage returns to its targeted 2 - 3x leverage range.’ The deal is expected to increase its leverage ratio to a high of 3.6x.IHS said it has financing commitments to close the deal. As of the most recent 10-Q filing, IHS had $156 million in cash and equivalents and $6.5 billion in total debt pre-merger.The deal would effectively increase debt to nearly $8 billion.IHS is acquiring Ipreo in conjunction with the sale of its derivatives processing business, MarkitSERV.As IHS CEO Lance Uggla stated in the deal announcement,IHS’ stock has dropped 2.9% after the announcement as the chart below indicates:(Source: SEEKING ALPHA)The firm’s stock has experienced significant volatility in the past twelve months and has underperformed the S&P 500, returning 10.9% vs. 13% for the wider index.The deal for Ipreo promises to propel IHS into the ‘rapidly growing alternatives’ sector. There is so much capital in the world pushing up public market equity prices that investors searching for return have turned to the private, less liquid markets to acquire assets at more attractive valuations and growth trajectories.The concern I have for IHS is that its balance sheet is beginning to look weighed down by debt. While management has rightly suspended the stock buyback program to pay down debt, investors should be wary of high leverage in a rising interest rate environment.IHS says it expects its leverage ratio to be reduced to ‘below 3.0x by third quarter 2019.’ That assumes there are no unexpected events, like a recession.INFO is priced to perfection. I only hope management can deliver on the promise of its pricey combination with Ipreo."

Even the laggard Resources segment managed to eke out a 4 percent gain.Its accumulated deferred revenue rose to the highest level, surpassing the previous peak achieved a year ago.IHS Markit remains a buy in the GARP category in a data-dependent world. Read on to find out why.","IHS Markit (INFO) reported a decent set of results for the first quarter (three-month period ending February 28), with revenue growing 10 percent year-on-year and 6 percent on an organic basis. The EBITDA (adjusted) rose 12 percent while its EPS (adjusted) was even better at 18 percent. The quarter was even more impressive considering that this marks the sixth consecutive quarter that the information and analytics company has surpassed the consensus revenue estimates. It has also not disappointed on the earnings front, with either in-line performance with the consensus estimates or a beat since the company reported results on a combined entity basis in 2016.IHS Markit had an all-round performance. All divisions showed an increase in revenue, with the Transportation segment jumping 20 percent year-on-year. Even the laggard Resources segment managed to eke out a 4 percent gain, in part thanks to the buoyant crude oil market in recent months.IHS Markit is guiding for FY2018 (the year ending November 30, 2018) revenue to be in the range of $3.825 billion to $3.875 billion, including total organic growth of 4 percent to 5 percent. At the midpoint, the guidance is calling for a 7 percent increase year-on-year. Adjusted EPS guidance falls in a range of $2.23 to $2.27 per diluted share. At the midpoint, the guidance is calling for a 8.7 percent increase year-on-year.The top-line could improve further if IHS Markit resumes its acquisitive nature. Its steady cash position, which has maintained the $150 million level in the past six quarters, ensures that IHS Markit is ready for an acquisition when the opportunity arises. Its operating cash flow while cyclical is on an uptrend when viewed from a longer time frame. (Source: Data from IHS Markit, Chart by ALT Perspective)As explained in my earlier article on IHS Markit, the Deferred Revenue performance gives a good indication of the business health of the information and analytics company on the organic front. This is due to its subscription model where the revenue is locked in for the next couple of years. By the end of the first quarter, the accumulated deferred revenue rose to the highest level at $919.3 million, surpassing the previous peak achieved a year ago. This reversed the downtrend in the past quarters. A steadier recurring revenue is preferred as the non-recurring businesses like events tend to be an unpredictable stream of revenue. The spike is partly a seasonal effect given that companies generally renew their subscriptions or sign up new ones at the beginning of the year after a fresh new year budget is approved. Hence, investors would need to monitor if the deferred revenue stays firm in the subsequent quarters. (Source: Data from IHS Markit, Chart by ALT Perspective)Analysts appear to remain confident in IHS Markit. The price targets have been revised upwards through the past one year. The consensus price target is currently $4.16 higher than the last closing price.INFO data by YChartsTechnically, the share price remains stuck in a triangular trading band. More upside can be seen if IHS Markit manages to break out of this band. Downside appears limited to the rising support line currently pointing to $45.I have written in IHS Markit: Positives In The Revised Guidance Underappreciated in reference to the previous quarterly report. The company has since delivered a strong set of results. Longer-term, if an involvement in the blockchain technology is a prerequisite for those in the fintech industry to thrive, investors would be delighted that IHS Markit is at the “forefront” of companies that are studying and implementing Distributed Ledger Technology in wholesale financial services. As part of its endeavor to deploy DLT, IHS Markit is developing a new payments-oriented blockchain platform which it expects to launch sometime this year. Market players have long passed the phase where they would chase up stocks associated with the blockchain technology. Nonetheless, the benefits of mastering the blockchain technology and adopting it in its operations is definitely a positive fundamentally. At a PEG ratio at 0.81, IHS Markit remains a buy in the growth-at-a-reasonable-price (GARP) category in a data-dependent world.What's your take?

4137498,103480,2018-01-15T01:23:30-05:00,"IHS Markit, a leading provider of data and information to corporations and governments, has become even more dominant in the space after its merger.In 2016, the company completed the merger of IHS and Markit, adding Markit's massive and profitable financial data platform to its portfolio of offerings.The company is also still achieving solid organic revenue growth, most of which is recurring revenue.The company's capital-light, high-margin business makes its earnings expansion potential huge.","IHS Markit (NASDAQ: INFO), the London-based global giant in information and analytics, looks to be a solid buy ahead of the Q1 earnings season. As a company with an extremely wide moat, loads of proprietary data and recurring revenues, this is the kind of company that you can safely bet on for the long term. Unlike many other technology and data-focused companies, IHS Markit's price appreciation hasn't gone through the roof in the past year. As a value-conscious investor, I've been wary in recent months of buying into stocks that have seen 1.5-2x appreciation since the start of 2017 (like the FANG stocks); so I've been looking down more unpaved roads to find bargains.INFO data by YChartsIHS was founded in 1959 as Information Handling Services, and according to its website, focused in its early days on providing catalog databases on microfilm for aerospace engineers. As IHS continued to grow, it expanded into a wide array of other industries, providing technical databases and proprietary information for benchmarking and comparison purposes. Its purchase of Markit in 2016 added its giant financial arm, which competes with the likes of Bloomberg. In addition, a well-researched prior article on this site covered IHS Markit's proficiency in distributed ledger technologies (DLT), making it a serious blockchain researcher. As we've seen with companies like Kodak (NASDAQ: KODK), even the slightest whiff of crypto-related news can tend to make a company spike.What is particularly appealing about IHS Markit is its recurring revenue. Though not technically a software company as it provides data and not applications, its revenues stream can be thought of in the same way - clients subscribe to IHS' stream of data for a monthly or annual fee. More than four-fifths of the company's revenue is recurring.Recurring revenue is such an attractive feature because it makes growth relatively easier. Data streams like IHS Markit become deeply embedded into client operations, linking through their web of work streams in a way that makes it difficult or impossible to rip out. Thus, retention rates are extremely high and IHS Markit can begin each fiscal year with a solid foundation for revenue it doesn't have to chase. Its armada of salespeople can then go out and bring in new clients that are all incremental to the top line.Building a business that relies on big-ticket clients but only gets one-time revenues (like, say, IPO underwriting) is like building it on a house of cards. Recurring revenue businesses, however, can sustain their growth for much longer periods of time.I haven't pulled the trigger yet on the stock, as I'm still waiting for a dip in the broader markets to come. (Note that IHS Markit will report Q4 earnings on January 16). At its current market cap of ~$19 billion and enterprise value of ~$23 billion (adding in its ~$4 billion of debt), IHS Markit trades at a fair 15x multiple to its FY18 Adj. EBITDA guidance, which is growing ~10-15% y/y. If the stock pulls back to the ~$44 level, where it was hovering in Q4 of last year, its EBITDA multiple compresses to ~13.5x and becomes an undervalued play.IHS provides research, data, and analytics in the following four segments:As evident from the above revenue splits, IHS is largely diversified across a glut of industries, and the company has no excessive revenue concentration in a single client. As of its 10-K filing, the company counted 50,000 clients, which included an impressive 85% of the Fortune 500.A lot of the data that IHS works with is largely proprietary. In instances where IHS pulls publicly-available data from government or other sources, the company distinguishes itself by curating the information and adding its own analysis.As most already know, modern businesses treat data as a highly valuable business asset - and those without dedicated research departments find it much easier and cost-effective to license third-party research from the likes of IHS Markit. With such a deep-rooted history and expertise in the space, and a powerful brand that exudes high-quality research, it's difficult to imagine IHS Markit being replaced. The types of use cases that IHS Markit can service is also extremely diversified - giving it a strong opportunity to cross-sell.IHS Markit's results in the year-to-date period are slightly noisy due to the impact of the Markit acquisition, but it's important to note that the company has achieved organic growth along with its acquired growth this year. The company's YTD financials are presented below:Figure 1. IHS Markit YTD resultsSource: IHS Markit investor relationsOn a total basis, revenues grew 43% to $2.66 billion, the bulk of which was contributed by acquired assets. The company's detailed revenue schedule, however (shown below), indicates that organic revenues still grew at 4% this year - not entirely bad for an old, deep-rooted company that has had most of its focus this year on completing a merger. In fact, organic revenues grew in every segment except the Resources segment - which is understandable due to the downturn in the Oil & Gas segment that didn't recover until the back of the year:Figure 2. IHS Markit revenue detailsSource: IHS Markit investor relationsGrowth aside, another equally important metric to notice is the recurring revenue mix. Recurring revenues represented $2.22 billion (84%) of the YTD total, up from 81% in the prior year. Recall that investors prize recurring revenues above all else, and IHS Markit's continued push into recurring revenue streams is a valuable support for its valuation growth.Following robust revenue growth, operating income and net income have jumped this year as well, but IHS Markit primarily manages its earnings through an Adjusted EBITDA metric, as many larger companies do. Its adjustments consist largely of standard stock comp expenses and strips out one-time acquisition expenses as well, leading to a fair representation of its earnings capacity. Here's a look at how Adjusted EBITDA has performed this year:Figure 3. IHS Markit Adj. EBITDA walkdownSource: IHS Markit investor relationsIn the year to date, IHS Markit has generated an impressive $1.02 billion in Adj. EBITDA, indicating an EBITDA margin of 39% - a best-in-class margin for any industry. This indicates the company's sheer margin potential, driven by a capital-light business that is built on high (62%) gross margins. With this kind of a model, IHS Markit can deliver double-digit earnings growth for many years in succession.It's also worth mentioning that IHS Markit delivers substantial free cash flow as well: $527 million in the year to date, higher than its net income. This suggests that IHS Markit's high P/E ratio (~50x) may be a bit of a misleading indicator of its valuation, as its GAAP net income doesn't quite capture the full earnings picture of its cash flow and EBITDA.In a recent press release, IHS Markit released preliminary full-year results for 2017 and initial guidance for 2018.For 2017, the company is guiding to:For 2018, the company is guiding to:Right off the bat, it's encouraging to see the revenue acceleration implied in the FY18 guidance. EBITDA growth of 10% is also solid, implying further margin expansion on top of the 4-5 points of revenue growth.Using IHS Markit's current market cap of $19 billion, plus $4 billion of debt, the company's $23 billion enterprise value currently sits at a 6x forward revenue and a 15x forward EBITDA multiple, as shown in the chart below:INFO EV to Revenues (Forward) data by YChartsGiven the company's market-leading position and high margins, coupled with steady organic growth, it's not unreasonable to see IHS Markit growing to an 8x revenue multiple/20x EBITDA multiple, implying a price target of ~$65. With an older, slower-growing business like this, however, IHS Markit isn't going to snap to a higher valuation in an instant, the way something like Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) can. IHS Markit may take awhile in getting its valuation up, so this is a stock you can afford to wait on before taking a position.Watch this one carefully through the Q1 earnings season and wait for a well-timed buying opportunity. This is the kind of safe, solid bet that makes for a good growth investment in a long-term or retirement portfolio."
4138187,103480,2018-01-17T17:50:47-05:00,"IHS Markit surprised to the upside in its Q4 earnings release, with revenue and earnings coming in above consensus.The company also raised its guidance from its prior view.Though the company's impressive y/y metrics are driven by the addition of Markit (an acquisition that closed in mid-2016), organic growth is also present in the quarter.The company's cash flow generation remains robust and provides tremendous support for its valuation.","IHS Markit (NASDAQ: INFO), the UK-based provider of databases and industry-specific information, blew away analyst estimates in its Q4 earnings results. The little-known company (well, in the corporate world it's a big name, seeing as it's got 85% of the Fortune 500 in its client base, but perhaps not so much among investors) outperformed against expectations on just about every metric: revenue, earnings, organic growth, recurring revenue streams, and cash flow.Despite a terrific beat to end fiscal 2017 and an encouraging lift to the company's 2018 forecast (an overall ""beat-and-raise"" quarter), IHS Markits' stock is barely up more than 1% in both regular trading and aftermarket activity post-earnings. The stock still looks undervalued at <15x EV/FY18 Adj. EBITDA and <6x EV/FY18 revenue - especially as a recurring revenue stock with a stable subscription base and a free cash flow margin that stretches toward the high ~30% range.INFO data by YChartsThis article is an update to my prior post on IHS Markit, further reinforcing the bullish thesis on the company after its optimistic outlook for the following year. IHS Markit is attractive because in many characteristics, it almost exactly resembles a SaaS stock on the recurring revenue front - but it also comes at a much lower valuation yet with much more stable earnings and high EBITDA/cash flow margins. Its entrenchment in the corporate research and data space makes it an extremely wide-moated, defensive investment for years to come - while its organic growth fuels earnings expansion to allow for constant above-average market returns.Again, I'm not diving into the stock just yet. The market has seen very few negative trading days thus far in 2018, and I'm waiting for a broad pullback to pick up shares to widen my margin of error. If IHS Markit does pull back to the mid-$40s sometime in the next few weeks, the company becomes a solid long play.IHS Markit generated $944.7 million of revenue in the fourth quarter, up 8% y/y. Analysts in the quarter were only expecting $912.6 million (+4% y/y), making this quarter's results a four-point beat on the top line - quite impressive for a company at IHS Markit's scale. In the company's own guidance, its full-year outlook of $3.49-$3.56 billion implied just $905 million of revenue at the high end of that range.Figure 1. IHS Markit Q4 revenue resultsSource: IHS Markit Q4 earnings releaseFor a mid-cap company or a startup, a revenue beat of this magnitude is almost expected. But for a company of IHS Markit's scale - at a ~$4 billion annual run rate and a 4-5% annual growth rate - this acceleration in growth is a truly welcome sign.Equally impressive is the fact that organic growth drove most of the top line in the quarter. As IHS Markits' y/y comparisons now include the full effect of the Markit acquisition (which closed in summer 2016), the results look a lot less noisy. Of the company's 8% growth in the quarter, as shown above, 6% was driven by organic growth. Despite the fact that IHS Markit has a leading market share in its space, it's still able to manage bringing in new business.The growth was spread across all four of the company's industry segments, as shown below:Figure 2. IHS Markits growth by segmentSource: IHS Markit Q4 earnings releaseThe recurring revenue mix also remained constant at 83% - total recurring revenues were $781.4 million, up 7% from $728.6 million in the prior year.IHS Markits also outperformed on the earnings front - much of which, along with the top-line growth, was driven by a boost in gross margin. Gross margin in Q3 was a top-notch 64.2%, up 370bps from 60.5% in 3Q16.Adjusted EBITDA, which I believe to be the best metric for judging IHS Markits' earnings performance (due to large depreciation and amortization expense, net income is a skewed picture of IHS Markits' true cash generation capacity), grew 8% in the quarter to $366 million:Figure 3. IHS Markits Adj. EBITDA resultsSource: IHS Markits Q4 earnings releasePro forma EPS of $0.52, however, also beat analyst consensus of $0.50 by a reasonable margin. Operating cash flow grew 49% y/y to $242.9 million and free cash flow grew 52% y/y to $174.5 million.Equally important to the company's Q4 release was its updated 2018 guidance - which, as with any good quarter, got a slight lift.Figure 4. IHS Markits updated FY18 guidanceSource: IHS Markits investor relationsAs seen in the chart above, IHS Markits is raising its FY18 revenue view by $25 million at the midpoint - yes, it's a small bump, but one the company should easily be able to surpass. Adjusted EPS guidance is up by $0.05 (2%) at the midpoint, while Adjusted EBITDA remained unchanged - suggesting that the company could outperform the latter metric, as the two generally present the same addbacks and move in tandem.The company is also pointing to free cash flow to be in the ""mid-60s"" as a percentage of Adj. EBITDA - implying a robust $908 million of free cash flow in FY18 at the midpoint of Adj. EBITDA (which, as previously mentioned, may be understated). This is a solid FCF picture (also implying a ~24% FCF margin as a percentage of revenues) for a company currently valued at an enterprise value of $23 billion. Using the company's equity only, IHS Markits' market cap of $19 billion sits at a fairly cheap multiple of 21x FY18 free cash flow guidance.The major sound bites from this quarter: despite IHS Markits' leading market share, the company has still managed to grow organically at a steady rate. Meanwhile, improvements in gross margins and further merger synergies in opex have powered the company's expansion in EBITDA and free cash flow.For a company that offers investors this much safety (nearly all recurring revenues and a 24% FCF margin is, in my opinion, the epitome of safety), IHS Markits' stock hasn't seen the kind of appreciation it deserves after its string of good results. All the better for investors who are patient and willing to wait for a well-timed entry point: keep a close eye on price movements in the next few weeks and buy on significant dips."
4146490,102639,2018-02-14T08:09:30-05:00,"The shares of IHS Markit managed to hit a record high last month, but it was not spared from the global market slump and eventually lost the gains from December.This provides an opportunity for investors to potentially ride a rebound in the share price like in July and November last year.The upwards revision in the earnings guidance has not been appreciated by the market, judging from the retreat in the share price even before the broader market sell-off.","The shares of IHS Markit (INFO) managed to hit a record high last month. Unfortunately, it was not spared from the global market slump and the share price lost all its gains from December. This provides an opportunity for investors to potentially ride a rebound in the share price like in July and November last year. In this article, I review its Q4 2017 results and discuss the FY 2018 outlook.INFO data by YChartsWhile I have exalted the acquisitive nature of IHS Markit in previous articles, I have also emphasized the importance of tracking its organic growth. After all, a roll-up strategy can only be sustainable if the acquired units continue to perform satisfactorily and contribute to the “organic” growth eventually. Hence, it is comforting to know that IHS Markit’s organic growth in 2017 was 4 percent, while in 2016, it was flat. Both recurring (up 3 percent y-o-y in 2017 versus 1 percent in 2016) and non-recurring (up 9 percent y-o-y in 2017 versus -3 percent in 2016) show positive organic growth.However, on the balance sheet, the item which provides an indication of its subscription-based (recurring) revenue - deferred revenue – has shown the third consecutive decline. The accumulated deferred revenue at $790.8 million at the end of FY 2017 was back to the level in Q2-Q3 FY 2016. Hence, the earlier optimism over a possible breakthrough in its deferred revenue has now been fully deflated. A steadier recurring revenue is preferred as the non-recurring businesses like events tend to be an unpredictable stream of revenue. Hence, while the overall revenue growth remained better than consensus estimates due to a stronger non-recurring performance, it was not the most desirable outcome.(Source: Data from IHS Markit, Chart by ALT Perspective)Its cash & cash equivalents have dipped along with its net operating cash flow and free cash flow on a quarterly basis. Nevertheless, on a year-on-year basis, IHS Markit has managed to show a marked improvement in its cash flows.(Source: Data from IHS Markit, Chart by ALT Perspective)IHS Markit revised its adjusted EPS guidance upwards from $2.17-$2.23 to $2.23-2.27. The reduction in its expected adjusted effective tax rate from 20%-23% to 18%-20% has helped, but the anticipated improvement in EPS is also attributed to a better-than-expected revenue growth. Its revenue guidance has been upgraded from $3.77-3.83 billion to $3.80-$3.85 billion, factoring a total organic growth of 4 percent to 5 percent.Another major positive in the guidance is the notable reduction in the share-based compensation (“SBC”). IHS Markit has traditionally relied on SBC to reward and retain its employees. SBC has gained attention recently with a well-followed blogger raising the concern over the high level of SBC at Alibaba (BABA). Among its peers, IHS Markit has offers the highest SBC as a percent of its annual revenues (7.3 percent). Its SBC as a percent of the annual asset is lower than that of FactSet Research Systems (FDS). However, comparing the SBC to the cash from operations is more instructive and the said ratio at IHS Markit is almost three times that at FactSet (0.272 versus 0.107). Thus, it is comforting to note that its SBC would reduce from $240-$250 million in 2017 to an expected $200-$220 million in 2018.While it was disappointing that the accumulated deferred revenue continued to show a decline, IHS Markit was able to more than compensate for the shortfall through a stronger non-recurring performance. The upward revision in the earnings guidance has not been appreciated by the market, judging from the retreat in the share price following the results announcement, even before the broader market sell-off. Longer term, IHS Markit’s adoption of the blockchain technology in its business bodes well for its future, as it demonstrates the company’s ability to stay at the forefront of industry developments.What's your take?

4110202,102639,2017-09-28T10:52:55-04:00,"IHS Markit 3Q2017 results showed a decline in its deferred revenue for the second consecutive quarter, contributing to a disappointment that led to an 8% fall in its share price.The company beat consensus EPS estimates by 7.5% but I will explain why the market did not buy into this.It also announced an acquisition which appears to be overpriced in my opinion but the leadership team believes in its strong growth potential and the synergies it would bring.","IHS Markit (INFO) released its third quarter 2017 results yesterday. In my write-up on the previous quarter results, I mentioned that it would not be pretty if the deferred revenue declined again in the third quarter. It did fall again and the share price closed 8% lower. As time passes, the deferred revenue should get registered as sales revenue. Inevitably, when there is no new subscription signed, the deferred revenue will eventually run empty.Of course, this scenario is just a demonstration of what could happen but the possibility of it actually happening is extremely remote at the moment. However, for the valuation multiples (P/E of 92x on a trailing twelve-month basis) that the market has accorded IHS Markit, it is only fair that the company delivers on the deferred revenue growth as an early indication of the future revenue potential. Failure to do so results in a prompt punishment on the stock like it did yesterday.(Source: Chart by ALT Perspective, data from company)The company beat consensus EPS estimates by 7.5% but the revenue beat was a modest 1.5%. I suspect that the analysts covering IHS Markit did not anticipate the company aggressively buying back its shares in the quarter even as the share price hit new highs. The company bought back $324 million worth of shares during the quarter, bringing the total year-to-date share repurchases to $1.4 billion of which $1.1 billion was part of its $1.2 billion 2017 buyback commitment and $300 million was from the stock options proceeds.I doubt analysts had foreseen the pace of the share repurchases in the third quarter, with the company leaving just $0.1 billion shy of its full-year buyback commitment. As a result, while the revenue beat was inconsequential, the larger EPS beat was achieved on the back of an around 1.5% share count reduction.Todd Hyatt, executive vice president and chief financial officer of IHS Markit, explained during the earnings call that the quarterly results were impacted by higher expenses from several non-recurring expense items, including negative mark-to-market forex expense of $6 million and the frontloading of IT-related spend from the continued migration to the cloud.Unfortunately, there are some negative developments, which were not explicitly stated. Full year interest expense is now expected to ""trend towards the high end"" of the $145-$150 million range guided in Q2 2017. While still within the guidance, the allusion to an increase is not pleasant given the already 9% increase in Q2. This is something I mentioned to watch out previously:Following the 3Q 2017 results announcement, IHS Markit announced the acquisition of automotiveMastermind, which it described as “a market leader providing auto dealers in the U.S. with online tools, predictive analytics and marketing services to help drive new sales.” Mastermind will plug the gap between the coverage of the traditional IHS Automotive/Polk (strategy and product planning stage at parts suppliers, OEMs – production, and OEMs – sales) and Carfax (managing the used vehicle market).Its analytics engine predicts automotive buying behavior while its marketing platform automates the “creation of one-to-one messaging and targeted offers, leading to proven higher sales and more consistent customer retention.” In essence, IHS Markit is adding yet another capability that utilizes big data to help its clients target specific households offering higher ROI on their marketing spend.The business is acquired at a pricey 8.7 times' price-to-sales based on 2017 estimated revenue of $50 million. Nevertheless, with a more than doubling revenue expected by 2019, the ratio will come down to 3.5 times. The fantastic growth hinges on the ability of IHS Markit to leverage on its broad existing automotive clients as well as on its global footprint to expand beyond the U.S. market. At the projected 25% adjusted EBITDA margin in 2019, that would be significantly lower than the company average at 38.8% as of the latest reported quarter (3Q 2017).Todd Hyatt said during the earnings call that the margin should continue to improve. Nevertheless, the large gap even two years from now would mean that the business would be a drag on the overall margins for many years to come.Looking on the bright side, as the business model is one with predominantly recurring revenue, that would help improve the predictability of IHS Markit’s income. Furthermore, the filling of the business gap with this acquisition would lead to synergies that bring about higher margins in the other parts of the company. Finally, note that this is the last acquisition by Jerre Stead, the outgoing CEO. He reiterated his confidence on this acquisition during the earnings call:In the third quarter, 5.8 million shares were repurchased at an average share price of $45.25. This is now underwater, after the share price plunge yesterday. However, considering the strong execution in all the segments, IHS Markit should continue to deliver over the next few quarters. Barring a correction in the broader market, the share price should recover and head towards $50 shortly.IHS Markit has committed to buying back another $1 billion worth of shares in 2018. Year-to-date, the 33.2 million shares bought by the company were done at a low price of $40.33. Unless IHS Markit can find another accretive or complementary acquisition, the ongoing share repurchase program should prove to be a good use of its cash flow.The crude oil price forecast has been revised downwards as the year progresses. Despite this, IHS Markit has continued to perform and produce consensus-beating revenue growth. The eventual business recovery of the oil-related companies would provide the boost sorely needed to impress the market again.The organic growth remains healthy at 5% for the second consecutive quarter and that is expected to continue for some time as the company's integration progresses. Another positive for the future is the strong operating cash flow, which has kept the cash position steady in spite of the aggressive share buybacks and acquisitions.There have been some negatives gleaned from the latest reported quarter. In addition, while the management kept its full-year outlook unchanged, that was insufficient for market participants. Nevertheless, I believe those have been more than ""priced in"" considering the 8% fall in the share price.The decline could also be attributed to profit-taking following the stellar price climb. With ongoing strong execution, earnings should continue to rise and eventually, that would be reflected in the share price barring a broader market downturn. Market players might also buy into the counter if the company manages to make a major accretive or complementary acquisition.Author's Note: Thank you for reading.

4106935,102639,2017-09-14T11:05:53-04:00,IHS Markit announced sequentially better second-quarter results driven by both the legacy IHS side of the business and also the legacy Markit side.Investors need to watch if the deferred revenue returns to an uptrend in the Q3 results.The interest expense should also stay under control after a 9% upwards revision in the previous quarter.Investors might still want to ride on this analytics giant a while longer given the continued strong growth particularly from the legacy Markit business that has yet to disappoint thus far.,"IHS Markit (INFO) announced sequentially better second-quarter results. This is true for both the legacy IHS side of the business and also the legacy Markit side. For the legacy IHS side, from a negative 2% organic growth in Q3 2016, the organic growth turned positive (1%) in Q4 2016 and increased to 3% in the quarter ending May. Note that the comparisons are made on an adjusted basis as events production, which is one of the company key sources of revenue, has fluctuations in timing from year to year. As for Markit, the trend is the same with organic growth increasing steadily from just 2% in Q1 2016 to 8% in Q2 2017. The strong organic growth at Markit is especially beneficial for the company as the division has the highest EBITDA margin at 44.9% as of 2Q 2017, compared to just 24.3% at CMS under the legacy IHS. As such, the overall company EBITDA margin rose to 38.9% in Q2 2017 from just 32.8% in Q1 2016.(Source: IHS Markit Q2 2017 Presentation)As with other metrics, IHS Markit will eventually face the law of diminishing returns on its margin improvement efforts. It would be unrealistic to expect the company to keep showing margin expansions. Furthermore, the upcoming third-quarter results would be the first quarter that is compared against one incorporating the results of Markit (Q3 2016). Hence, the strong margin lift from the consolidation of legacy Markit that was reflected in the Q3 2016 results would not be repeated this year.As explained in my earlier article on IHS Markit, the Deferred Revenue performance gives a good indication of the company's business health on the organic front. This is due to its subscription model where the company has already locked in the future income for the next couple of years. A single quarter dip should not be of concern as several factors could come into play. A few key customers could have postponed their decisions to renew on budget issues due to temporal business difficulties. Several others could be in the process of negotiating for a better pricing as they intend to take on more services, i.e. they are prepared to pay more but would like to leverage on that to secure some discounts for the overall expanded package. The incremental effort to service a new customer is very little. IHS Markit can afford to provide some level of discount to customers looking to add-on to their subscriptions but it cannot appear to give in readily. Hence, sometimes the renewal process might be prolonged but eventually, the transaction will show up in the financial statement. That said, we should be expecting the accumulated deferred revenue to show a rebound in the 3Q 2017 results. Otherwise, it could indicate some challenges in growing the organic growth.Despite spending $484 million on share repurchases in Q2 2017, IHS Markit still managed to grow its cash & cash equivalents to $162.5 million by the end of the quarter. It is also noteworthy that the increase happened amid a lower net operating cash flow and free cash flow on a sequential basis. With the share price of IHS Markit hovering near record highs, those share buybacks in the quarter with an average price of $41.71 per share are now sitting pretty on gains. For that matter, all the prior share repurchases are done at prices below the prevailing market level.The inclusion of IHS Markit into the S&P 500 index (SPY) effective at the open of trading on June 2, 2017, was a strong driver in the share price appreciation as index players rebalance their portfolio. The Q2 2017 results were a mixed bag as organic growth was strongest in a year and EBITDA margin growth was solid but accumulative deferred revenue was down sequentially.Investors need to watch if the deferred revenue returns to an uptrend in the Q3 results. In the second-quarter results announcement, IHS Markit revised up its interest expense estimates for the year 2017 by around 9%. Its estimation of the stock-based compensation expense also rose around 17% due to the continued uptrend in its stock price. These are significant increases in just a span of three months. In the Q3 results announcement, it would be inevitable that stock-based compensation expense is revised upwards again given the steady rise in the share price. Nevertheless, the interest expense should now be under control. If it doesn't, that would be a red flag. At this point, with the solid gains in the share price, it is tempting to take profit. However, investors might still want to ride on this analytics giant a while longer given the continued strong growth particularly from the legacy Markit business that has yet to disappoint thus far.Note from author: Thank you for reading.

4136732,102639,2018-01-10T16:08:57-05:00,"IHS Markit deems itself to be at the “forefront” of companies that are studying and implementing Distributed Ledger Technology in wholesale financial services.As part of its endeavor to deploy DLT, IHS Markit is developing a new payments-oriented blockchain platform which it expects to launch sometime this year.The market could reward the company once it is given due recognition for its involvement in blockchain.In addition, the strong crude oil prices would benefit its customers in the energy and chemicals industry, which should in turn boost IHS Markit's revenue and subsequently its share price.","IHS Markit (INFO) is a leading global information and analytics service provider. It deems itself to be at the “forefront” of companies that are studying and implementing Distributed Ledger Technology (“DLT”) in wholesale financial services. It is investing significant resources in seeking potential solutions, participating in Proofs of Concept and successfully experimenting with applications of DLT. More concretely, IHS Markit has been creating a distributed financial network built on DLT infrastructure, offering a series of transaction management and asset servicing applications for firms to “manage trade lifecycles more efficiently and with less operational risk.”While some companies could barely hide their eagerness in associating themselves with cryptocurrencies and blockchain, IHS Markit has been rather under the radar despite its concerted effort to employ the technology. Hence, with this article, I hope the company’s effort in blockchain would be duly recognized. Readers who wish to know more about IHS Markit are welcome to check out my initiation article on the company.As part of its endeavor to deploy DLT, IHS Markit is developing a new payments-oriented blockchain platform which it expects to launch sometime this year. The platform would be integrated with its existing products – ClearPar and Notice Manager. ClearPar is a middle-office platform for trade settlement in the syndicated loan market and was acquired from FIS’s Advanced Commercial Banking Solutions division in 2009. International Business Times described John Olesky, the managing director at IHS Markit for loan platforms who is leading the effort, as a “first class domain expertise combined with a deep understanding of technology”. Olesky graduated with a masters in computer engineering. In an interview, Olesky mentioned the use of “tokenized cash” among the parties using its platform. It is unknown if IHS Markit would come out with its own cryptocurrency. It would be a huge bonus if it indeed does, given how the share prices of companies which announced they would be doing so had jumped. The name Markitcoin, in the like of Bitcoin, would be apt.The payments platform is actually not the first time that IHS Markit has been involved in the blockchain technology. IHS Markit was part of an eleven-firm consortium that announced the successful conclusion of a pilot to manage equity swap transactions and related post-trade lifecycle events. JPMorgan (JPM) was another participant.IHS Markit’s SwapOne platform was leveraged as an option to manage post-trade calculations, including accruals, resets, and payment schedules. SwapOne was dubbed as a “Complete Synthetic Prime Brokerage Solution” when it was marketed under PrimeOne Solutions which was owned by New York-based CoreOne Technologies. In 2015, then-Markit acquired CoreOne Technologies from Symphony Technology Group for $200 million.Under the larger Markit umbrella, SwapOne offers a multi-asset, multi-currency, multi-country synthetics solution. The platform enables prime finance businesses to offer a full swap lifecycle for portfolio swaps, total return swaps, contracts for difference and pay-to-holds. IHS Markit’s participation in the pilot ensures that SwapOne proves its compatibility as the industry moves to using an optimized data structure in a distributed, peer-to-peer network to ensure perpetual reconciliation and employs blockchain smart contracts. IHS Markit would thus be able to stay in the game and capture future opportunities.Even without adopting the blockchain technology itself, IHS Markit has a revenue stream from it. Its pool of experts in the respective fields is knowledgeable in how blockchain can benefit the various industries. As such, the company has already come out with subscription reports (see first snapshot below) to help its customers understand the technology. It also sells publications from third-party in its online store (see second snapshot below).(Source: Screenshots from IHS Markit's website)From my research prior to my write-up on China’s potential Bitcoin mining ban (COIN), I delved deeper into cryptocurrencies and the blockchain technology. In turn, I discovered that IHS Markit, a company that I have covered several times last year, is itself involved in the hotly discussed field. While I don’t think IHS Markit fundamentally deserves a doubling in share price (like what happened to Kodak (KODK) today) just because of its involvement in blockchain, still, the market doesn’t seem to give the company any credit for its “forefront” effort in DLT. The investment community appears to have neglected the potential of the world’s leading information and analytics company to profit from the opportunities opened to it, despite its strength in financial services and its pool of expertise knowledgeable in DLT’s impact on the various industries. Companies have been rewarded by the market simply for accepting cryptocurrencies as payment. For instance, the share price of LightInTheBox (LITB) soared after the China-based online retailer announced it had started to accept Bitcoin payment. IHS Markit deserves better.In addition, the strong crude oil prices in recent months have not provided the share price of IHS Markit a booster, unlike in the past. With the correction in November following a disappointing third-quarter result announcement, the current price offers investors a discount off the peak to ride the crude oil price recovery. IHS Markit is a beneficiary of the rising crude oil price as it derives much revenue from customers in the energy and chemicals industry. A strong catalyst would come from investors’ realization of its success in deploying the blockchain technology for its business.Please vote in the poll below and voice out your choice in the comments section for a sentiment gauge.

4029344,72585,2016-12-10T05:00:00-05:00,Merger of IHS and Markit created a data & analytics conglomerate with significantly improved distribution capacity.Multiple merger synergies would deliver $225 million worth of cost and revenue savings over the next 2-3 years.Resilient business model with great entry barriers and close to 85% revenues being recurring.Energy sector recovery and CMS sector transformation create the case for revenue and margin expansion.,"OverviewIHS Markit (INFO) was formed by a merger of equals between two data companies in March 2016, where shareholders in US-based IHS own 57% of the combined company, while investors in London-headquartered Markit hold the remainder.(click to enlarge)Markit's part of the entity is essentially a conglomerate of companies around credit market data. It grew from a start-up, formed by a group of credit derivatives traders in 2001, and into a key data powerhouse via effective penetration in new adjacent markets combined and the continuous acquisition of various credit data-related companies and combining those under a single roof. As a result, its revenue base is highly diversified and not tied up to any single product since it offers broad range of service which includes: data, analytics, outsourcing and derivatives trade processing in off-exchange markets. Markit is perfect match for IHS since it's not anchored to a specific desktop product in the way that Bloomberg or Reuters are, so it won't be hit by the cost cuts taking place at banks.Information division provides enriched content including pricing and reference data, indices, and valuation and trading services. Processing division offers trade processing solutions for OTC derivatives, FX and syndicated loans, including connectivity, infrastructure and post trade support. Solutions division provides products and services that help customers capture, process and analyze information as well as manage risk and meet regulatory requirements.In turn, IHS's core competency is sourcing data and transforming it into critical information and insight, which customers across multiple industries use to make key operational, strategic and capital allocation decisions. IHS possesses a non-replicable historic as well as proprietary data, combined with the know-how and unique expertise of handling multi-billion dollar projects, reputation built over many decades and ability to market to world's largest organizations - all those create an extremely strong barrier for other companies.The merger created a leader in critical information, analytics and solutions, and the combined IHS Markit has a non-overlapping customers and products, and a world-class management team, resulting in improved opportunities for cost savings and revenue growth via synergies.IHS Markit opportunityThe opportunity is created since most investors are not sufficiently forward looking and the market did not appropriately price future synergies, share buyback program and under-appreciated growth in cash flows over the next two years. I expect the execution risk for synergy realization at IHS Markit much lower than most other companies given the management team and its historic track record.Market participants are excessively focused on the short-term headwinds around weakness in top line revenue growth related to Resource segment revenue decline and lack of growth in the CMS segment. First signs of recovery in the former remained largely unnoticed because improved oil capex (main driver) would get reflected in the segment's revenues only next year plus there is a sizable pent-up maintenance demand from the clients which would boost earnings from 2017. For instance, based on the 2016 data, McKinsey forecast ~25% improvement in global oil capex in 2017. In turn, temporary nature of the softness in the CMS seems not well understood because majority of investors focus on the top level figures and beneficial transformation seems as segment's weakness if not digging deeper into the details.Furthermore, at the moment, the market is not giving company sufficient credit for being a high growth acquisition platform with outstanding management, where both IHS and Markit delivered double-digit earnings and revenue growth over the last 5 years. The merged entity can effectively grow via acquisitions even in case of weak organic growth and deserves premium valuation to its peers, where market underestimates longer-term revenue and earnings growth potential.Highly attractive business modelIHS Markit is operating one of the best business models since the costs are predominantly fixed and the main expenses which increase with revenue are the sales and customer support. This is particularly well illustrated with the Resources segment which maintained 45% adj. EBITDA margin and being up 300bps despite 10% revenue decline on the back of weakness in energy offering. This occurs because the marginal cost of delivering extra data or analytics to the customers is extremely low.In case of Markit's business, it is deeply embedded in the systems and workflows of its customers. For instance, it owns pricing data, the reference data and the index data, which combined allowed it creating the valuations data business. In case of IHS, it is the sheer size, scope and breadth of data & analytics combined with the embedded market expertise, which create a very strong barrier since assembling the similar quality data and team as well as effectively sell to enterprises becomes an almost impossible task. Lack of strong direct competition for IHS is reflected in the segment margins where Transportation has 39% adj. EBITDA, Resources - 44.9%, and CMS - 25.6%.Management announced that combined IHS Markit's subscription-based model will generate around 85% in recurring revenues, which makes the business highly stable and predictable. For legacy IHS subscription agreements represent approximately 80% of total revenue, and are typically annual and non-cancelable for the term of the subscription. For Markit, the recurring fee-based revenue is even higher at 93%.Barriers in the data businessFurthermore, the data businesses traditionally have a huge moat and there is very limited direct competition. For instance, on the outside, it looks like there is quite a few data companies, but they hardly ever compete in the same data product. There is traditionally a single data provider who delivers key benchmark and reference data, which is used by the whole market as a single source of truth for pricing and settlements, which essentially creates ""winner takes all"" market in each of the individual data products.E.g. Markit sells the CDS pricing data and owns benchmark assessments. So if one wants to trade CDSs and be able to assess the value of its CDS portfolio - then it has no option other than to buy subscription from Markit. Furthermore, it is really easy to upsell those contracts for Markit - pricing is traditionally non-transparent and clients do not have real alternatives - i.e. in case one refuses to buy from Markit at a higher price, a company would not know the value of its CDS portfolio and have no visibility of settlement prices.IHS Markit - high growth acquisition platformBoth IHS and Markit have a proven ability to acquire and grow complementary businesses, where the acquisition focus is on companies that allow to consolidate existing businesses and diversify into related markets. The benefits are derived from the ability to greatly cut fixed costs for the newly acquired companies, consolidating operations and exploiting the strong distribution and reach. Markit grew from $762 million in revenues in 2012 to $1113 million in 2015, which is equivalent to 9.9% CAGR. IHS in turn delivered 15.6% CAGR, increasing its revenues from $1403 million in 2012 to $2184 million in 2015. For example, to achieve such growth IHS spent ~$370 million for acquisitions in 2015, ~$210 million in 2014 and paid $1.6 billion for acquisitions over 2013. Hence traditionally, further 5%+ p.a. revenue growth was derived from acquisitions at both IHS and Markit, the point which is not reflected by prevailing stock's valuations vs. peers.It should be noted that IHS and Markit have capacity to get rid of potential smaller competitors in various segments by simply acquiring those. This in turn bodes well for the acquired firms since they get high valuation multiple on the takeover. The high multiples are justified by IHS Markit's ability to greatly boost revenues of the newly acquired firm by providing its mighty distribution capabilities. Additionally, IHS Markit can boast a proven track record of successfully integrating acquisitions into the business, including global sales network, technology infrastructure and operational delivery.Multiple synergies from IHS-Markit merger3Q 2016 adj. EBITDA margins increased by 490 bps YoY, where 380 bps came from legacy IHS and 110 bps from legacy Markit. The margin improvement within the legacy IHS segment took place due to further structure simplification and reduction in central costs like marketing and sales support expenses, which further proves management's effectiveness.Additional major synergies would be derived from the merger, and I believe the market is not pricing in those benefits sufficiently by placing a high risk premium on their execution. But given the company's top class expertise in business combinations, it would be reasonable to expect cost and revenue synergies above the announced targets.Recovery of IHS's legacy Energy segment in 2017Resources segment of the combined IHS Markit accounts for ~32% of total revenue, where approximately 90% of resources segment revenue comes from IHS's Energy offerings, which in turn is heavily linked to US market (~70% of revenue). The sharp decline in US oil capex led to 12% QoQ decline in IHS revenues in Resources segment in Q2 2016. The decline has come primarily from customers reducing their geographic coverage, the Americas' smaller independent producers experiencing a higher-than-normal cancellation rate and customers deferring the renewal of software maintenance.Energy content and analytics ""provide worldwide information and analysis on millions of wells, pipeline miles, and regulatory and mineral rights documents, as well as global information on oil and gas fields, basins, and operating assets and thousands of power and industrial plants."" In short, this means it has oil & gas E&P as the main revenue driver - i.e. higher capital spending would lead to more demand for Energy's data, which in turn is linked to oil price and its market expectations. IHS's data helps answering such questions as the optimal oil production location, most efficient distribution and marketing method, and competition in the specific basin.Firstly, the major short-term boost to Energy revenues would come from the fact that some of the smaller customers have cancelled the annual maintenance fees. Those companies would eventually come back over 2017-2018 period assuming the oil prices are steady or higher. And once they come back, they will end up picking a couple of years of the maintenance fees because otherwise they would not be able to operate.Secondly, there is already hard evidence for upcoming rebound in this segment from US public oil companies. Capital expenditures at these companies rose in the 2nd quarter 2016 vs. the 1st quarter, which is the only quarter-over-quarter increase since 2014. Oil prices were stable over the last 6 months with Brent consistently trading around $45-50. Such price levels combined with reduced volatility confirm that oil companies are becoming more willing to commit to longer-term capex projects and hence will be boosting demand for IHS's Energy services from 2017.Cash flow and capex by 46 public US oil companies:Source: EIATMT product transformation temporary depressed CMS segment growthYTD Q3 2016 revenues for Consolidated Markets & Solutions (CMS) were flat compared to the prior year, at $399 million. This may look bad on the outside but the company is undergoing TMT offering transformation, which involves going from 1200 products to 300 products and moving from about 35% subscription based offering to about 65%. This follows the company-wide approach of shifting all business towards recurring revenues. CMS historically has been a 5% organic revenue growth type of business, even during downturn periods. For example, YTD Q3 2016 adjusted EBITDA for CMS increased $19 million (or 26%) to $92 million, despite the flat revenue performance. This implies that CMS would deliver much strong revenue growth and much improved EBITDA starting from 2017 once the transformation is complete, the aspect which is not well understood and creates an extra uncertainty for the investors. Recovery of CMS to its growth path should act as a catalyst for stock appreciation as it would signal further business de-risking.Continued growth in the Automotive segment on the back of industry tailwindsIHS Markit experiences strong organic growth in Automotive offering due to continued penetration, pricing, and new products within used car product offerings. New car product offerings in turn are expanding on the back of new automotive technologies, global regulatory pressure to reduce fuel consumption and emissions, and higher use of digital marketing. Automotive offering represents 75% of the Transportation segment and its strong organic growth and high margins are expected for the foreseeable future, particularly in light of recent Transportation's 10% YoY revenue increase.ManagementCurrently, Jerre Stead is the CEO of IHS Markit, but from 2018, Lance Uggla will take over as chief executive when the 74-year-old Stead retires. Stead was executive chairman since 2000, took over as CEO since 2006 (with a 2-year break starting 2013) and successfully took the company to an IPO, delivering 28% CAGR to shareholders during his tenure. Uggla is the original founder of Markit who managed to grow the company from a 10 man startup into a global multi-billion dollar enterprise with the eventual IPO via outstanding strategic growth execution and smart capital deployment. The company possesses top class management, where both current and upcoming CEOs have proven themselves to be savvy capital allocators and experts on operating a data & analytics businesses. Given the management's outstanding track record, I believe they are capable to produce further substantial value to the shareholders of the combined company.ValuationBetween 2011 and 2015, IHS and Markit delivered grew revenues at CAGR of 15.6% and 9.9% respectively. For valuation purposes, assume that the company would reach guidance revenue figure for 2017 at $3525 million and assume that the merged entity would achieve 6% CAGR in revenues in 2018, given the possible softness in the Financial segment.Adjusted EBITDA is a better way to value INFO stock as we need normalized levels since non-adj. EBITDA for this company experiences temporary skews due to one-off business integration expenses, merger-related fees and performance-based compensation. Adj. EBITDA margin for 2016 is projected at 36%. Assume the margin would increase to 38% by 2018 on the back of Energy segment recovery, CMS segment transformation and the company leveraging its fixed cost base. This would yield IHS Markit EBITDA at $1420 million for 2018. Furthermore, the company is expected to generate $225 million worth of synergies over the next few years, which should lead to EBITDA expansion to $1620 million in 2018.IHS Markit projections:Source: Author's estimatesAdditionally, there would be a sizeable shareholder benefit from capital structure optimization. The company announced intention to return cash to shareholders and execute $1 billion stock buyback in both 2017 and 2018 ($2 billion total). Based on management's estimates of free cash flow conversion at 58% of adj. EBITDA, ~$1.7 billion of the buyback program should be financed with cash from operations plus option proceeds can contribute a further $100 million to the program (as announced by management). The combined company will have a capital policy with a target leverage ratio of 2.0 to 3.0 times and would need just $200 million of further borrowing for buybacks; it should remain comfortably within those limits given its strong cash generation with adj. EBITDA 2017E at $1400 million.Additionally, given the current availability of cheap funding and prudent leverage ratio, it would be reasonable to assume that the cost of debt would remain unchanged so that the company would deserve EV/EBITDA in line with peers at minimum. Management announced 200 million option compensation for 2016, on the basis of which I would assume $600 million dilution by 2018, which needs to be incorporated in forward EV estimate.Comparable stocks' valuation:Incorporating intended share buybacks, synergies, further dilution from option issuance and above growth projections, we arrive with 2018E EV/EBITDA multiple of 10.2x. The median EV/EBITDA ratio for similar companies is at 15.2x and applying it as a target multiple we would arrive with 48% upside for INFO stock over the next 24-30 months.Catalysts:Risks:Overall risks are muted by the great business diversification and resilience to downturns and I see the main ones to be:I view downside limited due to the very sticky nature of the business and strong barriers to entry, which should ensure consistent premium valuation to IHS Markit even during the periods of downturn. Furthermore, business model is such that company can deliver growth even during periods of economic downturn.In the poor case scenario, where revenues for 2017 and 2018 FY grow only 2% in each of the periods, resource and CMS segments provide no margin improvement and synergies fail to materialize completely so that overall EBITDA margin remains at 36%, we still arrive with 16% upside for the INFO stock.ConclusionIHS Markit is a highly cash generative business with strong barriers to entry and resilient margins due to predominantly recurring subscription-based revenues. Further margin improvement would be taking place on the back of continued legacy IHS's structure streamlining, revenue and cost synergies following the merger with potential margin benefits coming from rebound in energy sector E&P and TMT transformation. Further upside for INFO shareholders is created by a sizable announced buyback program and acquisition-led growth via new data/analytics company acquisitions. The patient shareholders are provided with the opportunity to profit from the time arbitrage situation where stock appreciates as the multiple above-mentioned catalysts get materialized in the bottom line over the next 2 years and the skilled management continues to deliver growing cash flows."
4037578,102639,2017-01-18T08:55:43-05:00,IHS Markit is seeing improvement in each of the legacy segments.Higher free cash flow is expected for 2017 without the one-off items.Guidance for 2% to 4% organic revenue growth is achievable and I outlined my belief.,"BackgroundIHS Markit (NYSE:INFO) announced 2016 Q4 results today and the stock closed 3.5% higher. However, it gave up some gains in after-hours trading, losing 0.88%. As the company is underfollowed, I would begin with some introduction. Post-merger in the middle of last year, the company simply adopted the combination of the names of the two constituents, IHS and Markit. As the ticker symbol for Markit, INFO, was used by the merged entity, you might be looking at incomplete historical data on certain platforms. IHS Markit claims to serve 85% of the Fortune Global 500 companies and 94 of the 100 largest U.S. corporations. Separately, IHS is in the intelligence business and predominantly provides information and analyses to industrial customers while Markit primary targets are financial institutions. As the merger is still rather fresh, the 2016 fourth-quarter results still include a breakdown by the three legacy IHS segments and Financial Services, which essentially refers to contributions by Markit. Resources encompass the Energy and Chemicals businesses, while Transportation includes the automotive revenue including CARFAX, as well as maritime and trade, and aerospace. Defense, which is also categorized into Transportation, includes the acclaimed Jane's magazine. The third and final category, Consolidated Markets & Solutions, or CMS, house the other products and services like Economic and Country Risks. Chairman and CEO Jerre Stead is no new face to the M&A scene. There were no less than four acquisitions per year since 2004, the year before Jerre led the IPO of IHS in November 2005. Along the years, Jerre and his executive team have honed their skills in integrating acquired companies into the fold. The acquisition of Markit, or rather, merger, as the management prefer, was the largest ever orchestrated by IHS. Lance Uggla, President of IHS Markit, is himself a master in integration, growing Markit through various acquisitions. The experience of the team from both constituent companies provides confidence that the merger would escape the perils of mergers and acquisitions.Discussion of Q4 2016 Revenue by Segment and OutlookThe Q4 results already show signs of merger-related benefits such as cost savings from eliminating duplication and economy of scale, with legacy IHS margin expansion of 300 basis points year-over-year. Due to the acquisitive nature of IHS, one has to look at the organic growth data to determine the health of the existing business, rather than just looking at absolute revenue gains.In Resources, the energy side of the business continues to experience declining annual contract value as expected with ongoing cost-cutting moves especially by customers within the upstream energy sector. The 9% drop in Q4 is an improvement over Q2 and Q3 where the declines were in double digits (13% and 12% respectively). This is a positive indication that the recovery in the energy sector is translating into higher spending into market intelligence. The Chemicals division proved to be resilient amid strong industry margins. The plunge in crude oil prices brought down feedstock costs for the petrochemical producers, but product prices were relatively unscathed. With good profitability enjoyed by the customers of the Chemicals division, there is relatively less pressure than the energy counterparts to drop services, particularly when many of the services are essential for day-to-day operations and specialized market updates not available in the public domain. Planned investments into chemical projects both in the US and globally are still healthy and would mean continued active consulting business.The Transportation segment produced an impressive organic growth of 11% for the quarter, continuing the strong momentum from previous quarters. Jerre attributed the good showing to innovation-driven offerings through up-selling and cross-selling to customers in areas such as recall solutions, digital marketing, vehicle compliance and performance, and technology and components analytics. Note that IHS in recent years acquired numerous companies holding large databases of used cars. The full potential for cross-selling most probably has not been reached given the time required for assimilation. The company is also benefiting from higher incidents of recalls as you would also be familiar either through personal experience or through the news.The Consolidated Markets and Solutions segment continues to be weak and the company seems to be able to work on customer satisfaction through platform enhancements and creating larger recurring revenue product bundles, rather than coming up with new offerings like it did for the Transportation business. Nevertheless, heightened uncertainties leading to increased volatility could translate into more decision makers signing up for insights by IHS Markit.On the legacy Markit side, organic growth has been improving steadily, with the latest quarter showing a 4% year-on-year increase, compared with almost flat growth for combined legacy IHS businesses. In the earnings call, Jerre cited the strengthening of the indices franchise with key wins within the index administration business and ETF AUMs. The bond pricing business also completed major wins with the world's largest asset managers and distribution platforms.Source: IHS Markit Q4 2016 slidesLooking at organic growth within a segment, it is important to track the trend for the recurring portion, which is essentially the subscription business. Due to the strategy of securing multi-year contracts for subscriptions, a slowdown in a customer's business might not immediately affect IHS since the customer might wait until the expiry of the subscription since the cost was already budgeted for. On the other hand, when the business environment improves, we would expect higher capital spending and that entails engaging consultants for project evaluation. Thus, an improvement in non-recurring growth (consulting projects) alongside an improving business climate is a good indication that the positive momentum would translate into recurring growth. The Q4 results is an example of this scenario possibly being played out, as the oil prices for 2017 extend the uptrend from mid-2016 (see chart below). The decline in non-recurring organic growth of the Resources segment has slowed considerably to -3%, compared with -21% in Q3 and -36% in Q2. The recurring organic growth for Resources is not showing an improvement yet, due to the lagging effect discussed earlier.Source: IHS Markit Q4 2016 slidesDiscussion of Q4 2016 Cash Flow and OutlookIHS historically generated strong cash flow due to the stable and low CapEx nature of its information-based businesses. With the solid balance sheet, IHS could rely on acquiring companies to support growth. The additional beauty of acquisition for IHS was the fact that the P/E of IHS had been very high in the range 40-60. Currently, the trailing-twelve-months P/E is 59. Since most, if not all (details of some transactions were not publicly announced), of the acquisitions were likely to be accretive, the deals were immediately helpful in lowering the P/E and increasing the attractiveness of the company as an investment.Despite the cash flow for the year negatively impacted by restructuring and acquisition-related costs paid (approximately $140 million), the company still managed to achieve a trailing 12-month free cash flow of $491 million, representing a conversion rate of 50%. Excluding these costs, the conversion would have been approximately 64%, in line with the long-term objective in the mid-60s. Q4 free cash flow rose an impressive 27% to $115 million. Hence, we would expect higher free cash flow for 2017 after the passing of one-off items.ConclusionIHS Markit has guided for 2% to 4% organic revenue growth. This compares with just a 1% increase in organic revenue growth in 2016 on a combined basis (accounting for the full-year results of legacy Markit). I believe the outlook is realistic and achievable, given the improved business environment across all the segments, synergies yet-to-be-unlocked from the merger (as well as prior smaller acquisitions e.g. OPIS) both from the cross-selling front as well as cost-savings from the ongoing integration. In an era of fake news, IHS Markit is all the more critical to company executives. IHS Markit is well-positioned to ride on the thirst for credible information and analyses.VariantThe company is not immune to any possible economic slowdown in the year. The positive oil price forecasts might also not materialize. If the oil market reverses its uptrend and falls back below the mid-$40s, capital spending would be curtailed once again and that would inevitably badly impact the revenue of the Resources segment."
3960233,91045,2016-03-22T12:55:14-04:00,Informations Service industry is a high-growth industry.The new company will cater to a diversified set of industries.IHS' prior M&A experience provides the right traction to get this merger off the ground.,"OverviewOn Monday, tech data suppliers IHS (NYSE: IHS) and Markit Ltd. (NASDAQ: MRKT) agreed to merge in a deal in which IHS will own 57% of the new expanded company. Upon news of this deal, MRKT shares peaked nearly 10% along with IHS shares which shot up 6.4%.Strategic DealThis deal brings together two large data analytics companies together that provide their services to different industries. IHS serves energy and auto companies while Markit serves the financial services industry. Such a deal is very strategic as now the new company can provide its array of data and information services to a diversified set of industries. This deal will allow the new company to increase its exposure to a variety of clearly diversified industries.As IHS serves energy companies, the global drop in crude oil demand has notably been reflected in IHS' slightly declined revenue over the past quarter. The volatile energy market and uncertainty about whether oil has bottomed out or not is a major concern presented when analyzing this deal.A strong point for IHS, though, is its sensible allocation and use of its FCF. IHS has shifted its focus to spending its cash on M&A activity and buybacks, one which is planned for 2017.(Source: Bloomberg)IHS is by no means new to making acquisitions either. Many of their deals have been strategic acquisitions that were valued under $500M:(Source: Bloomberg).With decent experience by IHS dipping their toes in the M&A pond, the IHS-Markit deal has the traction to deliver strong synergies.For Markit, it is seemingly a different story. Because Markit provides services to the financial services industry, of which many firms had to cut costs and limit certain trading activities, this is a huge risk for Markit. Markit, though, has introduced a plan to expand its data solutions to provide new data solutions for compliance, etc., due to the new regulation landscape in the financial services industry.The Data Information IndustryThe industry as a whole performed very well over the past year, well above the S&P 500:(Source: Bloomberg)Success in this industry can largely be attributed to increased M&A activity in 2015, which in turn drove up valuations. This is a high-growth industry as data analytics are increasingly important, especially for compliance purposes. This growth factor ensures the success of this new company.OutlookThis deal brings together two solid companies. The key positive takeaway from an analysis of this deal is that the new company will be able to offer an even more diversified set of solutions across multiple divisions. Markit has been able to release solutions to cater to the changing regulatory landscape. While IHS has made prior acquisitions, this single deal is much larger than the majority of their completed and in-progress deals. The above described factors set this new company up for success.Author's Note: All data is pulled from Bloomberg."
3960208,25120,2016-03-22T12:10:08-04:00,"IHS is acquiring Markit in what is called a merger-of-equals.The combination will expand its scale, improve diversification and can benefit from synergies.While everything looks good on paper and non-GAAP multiples seem reasonable, GAAP earnings are lagging.A successful integration and repricing of the stock is needed before I see real appeal for the shares.","IHS (IHS) and Markit (MRKT) announced a so-called merger-of-equals in which IHS will be the surviving partner. The deal will create a huge player in terms of business information, analytics and related solutions.While both firms have good experiences with dealmaking, and this deal makes sense from a strategic point of view, I see little appeal for shareholders. Even as synergies and share buybacks can lift earnings per share in the years ahead, shares trade at high multiples based on GAAP accounting. The focus on non-GAAP earnings and EBITDA metrics provide too much of a distraction in my eyes, as the discrepancy with GAAP earnings is too large and very consistent.While the deal is presented to the investment community as a strategic tie-up in order to create a larger and more diverse player, the reality is that other motives might be at work as well. The combination will be headquartered in London. This results in significant tax synergies which are key to drive the value being created in this deal.The DealUS-based IHS and UK-based Markit are set to create a global giant for information and business intelligence. Investors in Markit will receive 3.5566 shares in IHS for each share which they own in Markit. Combined, the current shareholders in Markit will own a 43% stake in the newly formed combination.The $13 billion deal (in terms of equity valuation), does not include any cash component. This makes that the leverage position of the combination will be similar to the combined leverage ratio of both companies at this moment in time. The deal will therefore not put additional leverage pressure on the balance sheet, as IHS has recently announced two smaller deals as well.Given that IHS's shares closed at $110.71 per share on Friday, investors in Markit will receive a $31.12 stake in IHS for each Markit share. This represents a modest 5.5% premium for their shares.Markit's Contribution To IHSMarkit has only been founded in 2003, but it has gown quickly as a provider of financial information offering information, processing and solution services. The main focus of Markit has been the wider financial industry.The company grew its revenues by 4.5% to $1.11 billion in 2015. Providing information to financial services companies has been very lucrative as Market reported non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA of $488.2 million and actual operating earnings of $243.4 million.The 190 million outstanding shares value equity in Markit at $5.9 billion based on the deal price of $31 per share. It should be said that the company has $700 million in net debt as well, for an enterprise valuation of $6.6 billion. This is equivalent to 5 times sales and 13-14 times adjusted EBITDA.IHS itself if much bigger, as it reported sales from existing operations of $2.18 billion for the year 2015. Adjusted EBITDA amounted to $696 million last year. This translates into margins of 32% of sales, and wile this is still very impressive, they trail the 44% margin being reported by Markit.Unlike Markit, IHS has no real presence in the financial industry, as it mostly focuses on information and market research services for energy, industrial and technological industry cohorts. It should be said that IHS has been very active in terms of M&A. It announced the $460 million purchase of CarProof and the $650 million acquisition of OPIS in recent months.Ahead of the IHS merger, and before taking into account the closure of the purchase of CarProof and OPIS, IHS reported a net debt load of $1.8 billion. This number will increase to $2.9 billion if I take into account these two purchases.The 69 million outstanding shares were valued at $7.6 billion based on the closing price of $110 per share on the day before the deal has been announced. Based on the ""old"" net debt load of $1.8 billion, IHS was valued at $9.4 billion which amounts to 4.3 times sales and 13-14 times EBITDA. These multiples are fairly similar compared to the value at which Markit is being valued in the latest deal.The Pro-Forma BusinessThe combination of IHS and Markit will post sales of $3.3 billion, not taking into account the recent acquisitions being made by IHS. The combined EBITDA amounts to $1.18 billion, which translates into a 2.1 times leverage ratio given the combined debt load of $2.5 billion. Again, this leverage position does not take into account the combined $1.1 billion purchase of CarProof and OPIS, both being announced in recent months. After accounting for these two deals, the leverage ratio will come in close to 3 times.The new giant, which is valued at $16 billion, will reinforce its position versus the likes of other (business) information providers. The $16 billion valuation amounts to roughly 13.5 times adjusted EBITDA, but this analysis is severely flawed. IHS only reported GAAP earnings of $240 million on the back of $696 million in adjusted EBITDA in 2015. Similarly, Markit reported a GAAP profit of $152 million on the back of $497 million in adjusted EBITDA. If I simply add up the GAAP profits of both firms, they do not even amount to $400 million per year. With a $13 billion valuation for the equity of the new combination, the new company trades at 33-34 times GAAP earnings.This is a fairly expensive multiple in my eyes as both companies have quite a large integration task ahead. The pro-forma leverage ratio is fairly high as well at roughly 3 times EBITDA as organic growth rates are not that great, in order to justify a +30 times earnings multiple.The good news is that the tie-up should reduce annual costs by at least $125 million per year by 2019. It should be stressed that an important part of this is driven by a lower effective tax rate, as the company will move towards the UK. Management furthermore believes that cross-selling opportunities could increase revenues by +$100 million per year. Combined, cost and revenue synergies should be able to improve the bottom line by roughly $150 million by 2019. In that case the GAAP earnings could improve towards $550 million.IHS furthermore comforted investors by announcing a $1 billion share buyback program for both 2017 and 2018. At a current price of $122 per share, after taking into account the 10% jump in the share price of IHS, these buybacks could reduce the float from 117 million shares towards 101 million shares by 2019. That suggests that after taking into account synergies and cost savings, IHS now trades at roughly 22 times the GAAP earnings which are projected for the year of 2019, still three years ahead in time.Final ThoughtsInformation providers have traditionally traded at rich multiples. While I understand that the EBITDA multiples for the new combination can somehow be justified, I would like to point towards the huge discrepancy between this kind of earnings and the GAAP results. That being said, both IHS and Markit have seen a strong operational performance over the past decade, in part because of continued bolt-on acquisitions.The latest deal is sizable and improves the diversification of the combination as the potential for synergies and cost savings will be a net positive given the fact that this is an all-stock deal. The absence of cash financing makes that the synergies should be accretive and the market seems to agree. Shares of IHS jumped 10% in response to the news. Including the to be issued shares for Markit, this represents a $1.4 billion increase in value in response to the anticipated synergies resulting from the deal. This suggests that the market is fairly aggressive with regards to pricing in the benefits of the deal.While the long-term track record and fundamentals of both businesses appear fine, I am put off by the GAAP valuations. Given the fact that leverage levels are already somewhat elevated, and organic growth rates are not that impressive, I fail to see the real margin of safety at current prices.While information providers generally deliver on very consistent cash flows, which makes them desirable for investors, I can only be induced to buy these kind of businesses at market-equivalent valuation multiples. An 18x valuation multiple, which is more or less in line with the rest of the market, still amounts to a $100 entry target based on 2019 earnings projections."
3837436,54942,2016-01-28T06:15:00-05:00,Markit continues to trade based on the current (historical) results while investors are missing the growth in their core business and the Solutions segment.Processing segment headwinds are likely to subside as much was due to pricing declines. But acquisitions should help offset this headwind.The company has significant capacity on their balance sheet to deploy capital at favorable returns for M&A activity or to buy back their own shares.,"Markit (NASDAQ:MRKT) shares are up slightly since we first wrote about the company in late April last year, despite a negative tape. We feel investors are still not fully valuing the high-quality business and strong barriers to entry that creates a very sticky and high return on invested capital franchise. The high recurring revenue stream which accounts for over 93% of their revenue (57.4% of which is fixed and 36.5% is variable), dampens volatility. We think once the Processing headwinds are over that the true organic value of the business will start to shine through. The Solutions business is likely to be the key organic driver for the company over the next few years.The recent acquisitions made and underlying volumes trends within Processing are creating our bullish stance. We think they have the ability to utilize their strong balance sheet, recurring cash flows, and strong free cash flow generation to deploy capital at very favorable return profiles given the volatility in the markets today. Most sell-side models do not incorporate the benefit from future acquisitions given how unknowable they are to investors. However, given M&A is a central part of their growth strategy we think they should be making assumptions for future accretive acquisitions and that any announcements of new acquisitions will see the shares move positively.Processing Is Being Overtaken By SolutionsReported revenue in Processing decreased 15.1% with organic revenue down 13.6%. The drop was largely a result of pricing changes implemented in the second quarter which more than offset the strong underlying rates of processing volumes which were up low double-digits. In addition, FX headwinds also contributed to the decline, which combined with the pricing meant that the overall revenue growth was negative. Lastly, in the credit derivatives portion of the segment, they continue to see weaker volumes compared to last year as the market continues to consolidate.The new regulations that require trade reporting and clearing of derivatives to be completely electronic within the next two years have been a significant headwind. The company has chosen to protect their market share by charging a much lower fee rate for a completely electronic trade. This is simply due to the variable costs associated with the electronic trade processing compared to a manual trade. We think the total revenue impact will eventually be between $60 and $70 million. However, some of this revenue decline will be offset by increased margins as electronic trading costs less once the platform is fully established.The Processing segment continues to decline as the shift to electronic trading and clearing, as well as price cuts in derivative processing coupled with lower volumes in the primary loan market cut organic revenue by 14% YoY. We think the decline in the segment could be arrested shortly as the company closed on the DealHub acquisition in September which adds highly complementary FX processing to their current Processing business. The acquisition gains them access to offer a comprehensive solution for FX including venue and clearing connectivity, trade confirmation, trade management, and regulatory reporting. We think the deal is a smart move as it will make it easier for their customers to transact and we believe ultimately will fuel long-term growth in the Processing segment.In the third quarter, variable recurring revenue fell to 36% largely due to lower revenue in Processing, YoY. We would expect the fixed portion of their revenue streams to increase further in the fourth quarter, offsetting some of the variable declines. The increase will be driven by the DealHub and CoreOne acquisitions as well as strong renewal rates on fixed recurring contracts at 90% or above. DealHub will add approximately $12 million in revenue on the ~$250 million base within the Processing business. EBITDA margins at DealHub are in the mid-30% which should drag down the overall EBITDA margin of the business. However, we believe it positions them to experience growth in the segment going forward and without that drag on results, the growth trajectory of the firm will expand significantly.Solutions Business Will Be The Core BusinessSolutions revenue increased by 21.3% on an absolute basis and 13.1% in organic terms to $90 million. The segment is now significantly larger than the Processing business (compared to a year ago when Processing was slightly larger) and growing rapidly. The organic growth is the result of their largest managed services products including On Demand and WSO. As the website describes it, On Demand is dedicated to the delivery and presentation of financial data, transforming complex information into elegant user experiences. With the RIA channel experiencing significant growth as well as within larger enterprises, customers are increasingly looking for them to provide a better user experience and greater tools for their clients.As we noted in our prior write-up, the thinkFolio acquisition was a transformative deal giving them access to a full-complement of order management and portfolio rebalancing and monitoring tools. We highlighted the deal as moving them beyond the backoffice and into faster-growing markets. The acquisition was augmented by additional purchases of Information Mosaic and Tax Solutions which when integrated we think will combine to sustain organic growth at the current rate. Looking at Wall Street Office, an acquisition from seven years ago, the business is still contributing significantly to growth as customers grow assets under management.We believe that the company is building a unique compilation of assets that will combine to offer something that no one else in the industry boasts. The now very wide span of their offerings across multiple channels is expanding them beyond being the gold standard of credit data. While pricing power remains elusive, we do think it will begin to form over time as they create a very sticky customer base, similar to what Bloomberg has done over the past two decades, creating some separation between themselves and other players. As the company is able to scale and cross-sell their offerings, we think they will also be able to invest in pricing to capture larger market share while expanding margins.Settling Of Class Action SuitIn September, a dozen large banks, Markit, and the International Swaps and Derivatives Association agreed to settle a lawsuit with plaintiffs in a civil action suit for $1.87 billion. For Markit, the settlement was relating to CDS pricing and will cost the company $45 million which was already provisioned for by the company so it will result in no additional effect on their financial condition or liquidity. Management continues to believe that they acted in accordance with all laws but that due to the time and legal cost involved in the protracted litigation, that a settlement was in their best interests.We think the settlement removes a key overhang to the shares. But there remains an outstanding case that is still open with the Department of Justice. However, management noted that they have had no contact with the DOJ since 2012. Thus, officially the case is open but it appears to us that no one is likely working on it unless more information comes out. They also have an open EU Commission case which is being worked on but without any contact in the last year. We think there is a possibility that they may come back and it will require a settlement but that chances of which are slim at this point given the class action closure.M&A Pipeline Looks Strong While Capital Structure Allows FlexibilityThe pace of acquisitions has picked up in the last couple of quarters we think due to the capital market volatility allowing for purchases at value prices. The CoreOne deal was one of their largest in recent years at $50 million in annual revenues and an estimated $20 million in EBITDA. The company is effectively split 50/50 between information and solutions augmenting both of those divisions. The company continues to find highly accretive acquisition targets in order to achieve their strategy of 10%+ earnings growth over the long term. In the past ten years, they have conducted over 20 acquisitions worth over $2 billion, all the while maintaining their leverage at minimal levels. We think they will ultimately be able to consolidate the index space to just a handful of large players creating solid pricing power and barriers to entry.One of the prior overhangs was the effect of these acquisitions on shares outstanding via stock options to employees. There are currently 53.7 million stock options outstanding on a share base of ~180 million. This remains a major overhang as ~24 million of those options are in-the-money with the majority of which vesting on the IPO date. The majority of the options at or above the current share price vest over a 5-year period from the IPO date of January 2014. The table below shows how the share price increasing will also increase the dilutive average number of shares outstanding.We expect the company to earn $200 million in the current fiscal year. At a $24 share price, EPS generation for the year would be $1.10 but at $33, EPS would only be $1.04, a 6% variance.As the optionholders exercise their positions, it will result in significant cash flows to the company. Today, the company is offsetting issuance with a share buyback program which we think mitigates this risk overhang. In the most recent quarter, they spent $150 million in buying back shares reducing the share count by 1.3%. Management indicated that they will complete the program by year end resulting in another $150 million in share repurchases. The company has significant financial flexibility despite the increase in M&A activity with net leverage at 0.74x after completing a $500 million private placement of debt in November at very favorable rates.ValuationThe company has the stated goal of growing earnings at 10%+ per year on organic revenue growth of 5 to 7%. Margins should remain in the 40s with management guiding towards a low 40% long-term rate. We think this is conservative and based on potential headwinds from the Processing division and the Solutions divisions fast-growth which carries margins in the low-30% range. But over time, we think the Solutions business should grow margins from operating leverage and close in on the 40% range helping consolidated results. At 13.3x ttm EV/EBITDA, we think the shares are a compelling value.Our forecast calls for EBITDA to reach $550 million in fiscal 2017 which we think could prove conservative should they find other attractive M&A deals in the current volatile environment. The current low leverage levels are likely to create an opportunity to deploy cash at a very favorable ROI rate. We figure that they can achieve hurdle rates in excess of 10% on that deployed capital in the current environment, which when increasing net leverage to approximately 1.5x, could push up EPS to $1.75-$2.00 by 2017. The increased debt would be used in a combination of M&A activity and share buybacks depending on the opportunities presented to them at the time.At current multiples, the shares would be worth approximately $36 by year end on the high end ($2.00) and $29.75 on the low end ($1.75). On EBITDA, we think the $550 million, again a likely conservative estimate, and a $1 billion in net debt (up from the current $370 million), shares are worth $34 using a 13x multiple. Our base case is below and again, is based on very conservative estimates.ConclusionWe think the market is currently mispricing Markit based on the headwinds within the Processing division. Those headwinds are not likely to persist for much longer as much of it was managed through price declines. In the interim, strong M&A activity is likely to bolster the segment's competitive position over the next two years which we think will help them achieve their 10% long-term EPS growth goals. Given the volatility in the markets today, we think they should be able to deploy their strong balance sheet capital into highly accretive M&A deals that generate strong returns on invested capital. We think the shares are worth at least $34 based on this balance sheet capacity and growth within the Solutions segment. Should the company undertake a much stronger share buyback program, we think that estimate will prove to be too low."
3810326,46261,2016-01-15T10:46:06-05:00,"The stock is trading more than 20% off its peak.While organic revenue is more or less flat, recurring revenue keeps increasing.Negative forex impact could weaken while continued commodity weakness could keep dragging sales down.Recent smart acquisitions will boost sales and their impact on debt ratings is manageable.Buy some IHS now and keep adding on any potential weakness for the long run.","Investment thesis16 months ago, I wrote that IHS Inc. (NYSE:IHS) deserves a hefty price tag due to its wide moat, 75% of recurring revenues and many other reasons. These arguments are still valid today, so this is a positive for the stock. I also wrote that the ""downside should be protected"" because ""high growth is priced in"" and the ""market is fully valued and the economic cycle seems to be maturing."" This turned out to be a very useful advice in terms of the stock as well as the broad market.I further wrote that ""Over the long run, IHS will need to boost its faltering organic growth, or investor growth expectations may have to adjust downward"" and that the ""acquisition speed may hit a speed bump in a few years due to high debt, high stock market prices and acquisition risks."" I believe the faltering organic growth and high debt combined with a valuation multiple that is still pricing in future growth is why the market has soured on IHS stock and shed more than 20% from the peak of its price (more than the broad stock market).But since the stock is now more than 20% cheaper than a year ago, it is worth revisiting the thesis and updating my outlook for IHS. I believe the stock is an attractive long-term buy at current prices and worth averaging into. Here is why.My outlook: Mixed impact on IHS's top line from the current strong macro crosscurrentsThe company's major verticals are energy and natural resources, aerospace and defense, maritime, automotive, technology and chemical industries. We all know how the oil and gas and other natural resources are doing. Maritime and chemical industries are not faring much better. Automotive seems to be doing great but I believe the industry is close to its cyclical high, so its growth will either moderate or reverse. Subprime car loans are rising, there is some evidence of channel stuffing. The only industries relevant to IHS that will probably remain strong are technology and aerospace and defense, evidenced for example by another recent cooperation with Airbus Group (OTCPK:EADSY). So while there is some balance and the overall macroeconomic picture is mixed for IHS in my opinion, this means the current mediocre organic top line growth, which is basically close to zero, is likely to continue.And that includes a slew of 2013 acquisitions, which rolled into organic sales throughout 2015 after one year of being treated as acquisition-driven sales. So the ""core"" core sales are definitely falling. This is a natural churn evidenced in almost any recurring revenue service, so the company has to keep acquiring new customers either in-house or through acquisitions.But the recurring revenue keeps growing, which is the most important indicator for me. Other non-commodity segments are positive YoY as well.More acquisitions to supplement the lack of organic growthIHS has not been sitting idle watching its growth falter. The company has just recently made two relatively large and smart acquisitions. The first one, announced in December, is the acquisition of the Canadian company called CARPROOF. This is a smart move because it boosts IHS's offering in the relatively strong automotive industry.Moreover, CARPROOF focuses more on the resale market which should remain somewhat resilient even during a downturn when cash or credit for an outright new car purchase is lacking or hard to get. Given the strong new car sales cycle in the recent years, there will be lots of used cars on the market in the upcoming couple of years, generating demand for CARPROOF's services. Another benefit of this acquisition is that it was purchased in Canadian dollars. The CAD has cratered against the dollar amid weak commodity markets, so this was a very opportune time. I definitely like the strategic thinking of IHS's management on this one.The second acquisition was announced just a couple of days ago; IHS acquired the Oil Price Information Service, a pricing reporting agency for the oil, natural gas and biofuels industries, for $650M. OPIS primarily serves the downstream energy market, so this expands IHS's offering in the ailing oil and gas industry. The acquisition completes IHS's offering in the oil and gas segment to now cover the entire value chain form wellhead to consumer. Again, the company is acting like a smart value investor, buying when others are panic-selling in oil and gas and when oil and gas prices are at historically low levels.The impact of these two acquisitions on credit rating and debt ratiosMoody's wrote that the recent acquisitions were credit negative but their rating and ""stable"" outlook were not affected. Following these two acquisitions, the debt/EBITDA will jump from ~3.6 times to 4.7 times. This is probably very close to the limit of what would have triggered a credit downgrade warning or ""negative"" outlook. However, given the company's $0.5B FCF generation in 2015 and a slightly higher figure I expect it to generate in 2016, other things being equal, IHS can decrease its debt/EBITDA back to ~4 times by the end of 2016. So while there remains a long-term risk to the acquisition-driven strategy as I mentioned in my previous article, I see no immediate credit downgrade risks and the financial leverage still remains a positive factor boosting future returns for shareholders. Given the stock price is more than 20% lower than at the peak, some of the risks or lower forward growth are getting priced in which decreases the potential downside risk a bit if the acquisition/leverage strategy backfires.ValuationIHS generated ~$0.5B in FCF in 2015, so it currently trades at roughly 14.50 times P/FCF, implying a ~6.8% FCF yield. This is a very reasonable valuation for a company with a very strong moat and 75% of revenues coming from subscriptions.The major risk comes from continued weakness in the oil and gas industry, which together with other resource industries accounts for ~40% of revenues. This was the only segment that saw revenues down (by 5%) for the full year.For 2016, the company guided for sales to reach $2.34B (mid-guidance), implying a zero to 3% organic top line growth. EBITDA is expected to reach $785M (mid-guidance) with the EPS of $6.15 (mid-guidance).At these 2016 expected numbers, the company now trades at forward (2016) EV/EBITDA of ~13.50 times and ~13 times forward P/FCF, implying a ~7.7% FCF yield.Given that forex (strengthening U.S. dollar) had a ~2% negative impact on sales overall, this factor should be weaker going forward and could even reverse once the U.S. dollar peaks and starts descending.All in all, IHS is not cheap but given its quality, moat and recurring FCF streams, the ratios are justified.RisksAcquisition-driven growth remains a long-term concern when connected with valuation that implies future growth while organic growth is near zero (including sales from acquisitions that are a year or older). If the company cannot generate enough FCF to quickly repay its debt, the acquisitions will not be able to generate enough growth to justify the current valuation. On the other hand, the current stock market weakness enables IHS to find more and cheaper potential acquisition targets, counterbalancing the weaker FCF with lower price paid for each dollar of sales and FCF streams acquired.The oil and gas industry remains the major drag on IHS's revenues but lots of the weakness has already been reflected in its sales. The automotive (transportation) industry is a major revenue contributor. Should the situation there weaken (as I mentioned, I see some risks of this happening or at least the growth slowing), this could become another strong revenue drag which would force the company to speed up its acquisition growth and that could threaten its credit rating outlook. Alternatively, the company's sales growth would fall, which would most probably compress the multiples which investors are now willing to pay.A general global recession would naturally hurt the company's valuation so I still advocate to hedge the downside, preferably by shorting another stock or the index, or buying some cheap puts.ConclusionIHS is definitely not the cheapest stock on Earth. However, it is one of the highest quality stocks with a strong moat, 75% of recurring (and growing) revenues and smart acquisition policy supported by a reasonable financial leverage ratio. Moreover, the management is making smart, accretive acquisitions in industry segments, currencies and markets that have weakened significantly in the past year, demonstrating a smart long-term value investing approach.I think buying the current dip and adding more over time is a smart long-term move that should deliver above market returns in the long run."
3100196,54942,2015-04-25T12:45:47-04:00,"The market is currently anticipating a strong headwind within their Processing division driven by the move to swap execution facilities eliminating their trade matching business.
        The growth of the Information segment, namely their Indices business which constitutes approximately 10% of total revenues, has been strong.
        The company has engaged in 26 acquisitions since its founding with the recent ThinkFolio buy a differentiator moving them into much faster growing front-office functions.","Those investors who follow economic data very closely recognize the company, Markit (MRKT). Markit is a financial information services company providing pricing and reference data, indices, valuation and trading services, trade processing, enterprise software and managed services. The company serves over 3,000 institutional customers around the globe working mostly with banks, asset managers, hedge funds, accounting firms, central banks and other corporate entities.The business operates through three segments: Information, Processing and Solutions. Information is their largest segment accounting for 45.7% of revenue. This is their pricing and reference data business. Trade Processing is 26.7% of revenue and Solutions (Enterprise Software) are 27.6%.Our contrarian nature suggests that the market is already discounting the headwinds within Processing- more than is warranted given first quarter results- while ignoring the strength in the Solutions and Information businesses. Meanwhile, the recent ThinkFolio is likely to be largely accretive and moves them into the fast growing front-office and outside their traditional middle office space.Competitive Advantage In Differentiated FranchiseWe have been bearish on some other providers of financial information as we believe the proliferation of new technology and tools has disrupted what was once an oligopoly industry. The business is a differentiated provider of financial data and related services in several underserved asset classes and geographies. The company only went public last July and has only existed since 2003. The competitive advantage of the business rests on the relationship with a consortium of banks that own a significant amount of shares and supply the firm with vital data points in addition to customers.The company's products are entrenched within the industry with their Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) one of the most followed non-public sources of financial news. Indices overall represent 17% of the Information division's revenues. Lesser known indices are well-known to the Bond world including fixed-income derivative indices. The company monetizes its index products by charging fees to banks and asset managers who use the indices as benchmarks for financial products it develops.We see this as a strong growth driver for the company as the demand for many indices are growing at a prolific rate. The driver of this demand is the growth of ETFs and other passive strategies which utilize these indices. Markit is in a niche spot with its fixed-income and derivatives-based indices which are growing very rapidly in the ETF space as the asset class ""catches up"" to equity-based ETFs. We think the iBoxx is the best asset in the division but believe that company will be actively acquiring new indices as investment banks continue to unload them and exit the business.Another advantage the company holds is that they are one of the few providers who does not distribute its products through a proprietary solution- i.e. Bloomberg Terminal, Factset, etc. We think this is an advantage as it means they are not reliant on increased license 'seats' (headcount) at their customers' banks or asset management firms. Thus, Markit's business model works to reduce customer costs through the data distribution feed and its outsourced products, a rarity in the industry.Regulation Headwinds Are More Than Priced InThe market has been expecting a decline in the Processing business as new trading regulations and compliance rules have increased the costs and operation of the business, in conjunction with curtailing trading volumes. One of the components of Dodd-Frank was to bring more transparency and regulation to the trading of credit default swaps. The SEC and CFTC created swap execution facilities (SEFs), a required execution mechanism for swaps to transact among pre-qualified participants and then which are centrally cleared.As the market shifts to over-the-counter electronic trading and away from the dealer model, the pricing and regulatory headwinds should materialize. The Processing division is 27% of total revenues and the new rules will no doubt create an performance drag on the segment. This is well-known by the market with management commenting on it frequently. These rules are going into effect in all the major markets with the EU Commission implementing similar laws. The goal is to make the pricing more transparent and public.Markit currently provides this function as a 'matching service', pairing up trades for OTC derivatives. As we noted, this will largely be replaced by the SEFs. We think the market has already priced this in for a total loss of the business, outside of the syndicate loan processing business which is exempted from the rules. However, we think the loss of revenue is overstated as Markit will likely still be providing connectivity to the SEFs and other entities which will generate fees. While the fees generated are not going to come close to what they produced for their matching services, it should help cushion the blow.We think management is taking their bleeding a little earlier noting a $30 to $50 million hit over a three-year period but at a $5 million quarterly clip. From our sources within the industry, the migration to electronic trading is likely to take significantly longer than the three-year target. By starting early, we think they have moved passed the expected decline. In addition, we think they will make a strategic move to reduce their low-margin US processing business re-characterizing the growth profile of the firm towards Solutions and Information.Solutions Business Quietly Builds MomentumSince 2011, revenue in the Solutions division has more than doubled to $294 million. However, as they've invested heavily into the growth of their enterprise software platform including their EDM product (purchased from Cadis in 2012) in order to offer a hybrid solution, margins have declined from 35.5% in 2012 to 33.5% in 2014. The solution is a central hub to manage the acquisition, validation, mastering, storage and distribution of data in an audited environment.The company recently acquired ThinkFolio, a portfolio management solution for asset managers which provides order management, portfolio rebalancing and monitoring, compliance functions, and cash management. The acquisition is the latest sign that the company is expanding beyond their traditional middle-office product portfolio and into the front-office, where the strongest growth is currently found. With risk analytics and enterprise data management, the firm is attempting to get into more sourcing of order management and portfolio management software where there lies substantially more growth.One of ThinkFolio's strengths compared to the competition is that it can trade cross-asset classes and their derivatives, one of the first in the industry. By catering to a niche area of complex fixed-income and derivatives, they are playing into their broader business model strategy. We believe the company has a large cross-selling opportunity by adding 'Information' segment customers as 'Solutions' customers. Right now, just 15% of the data customers are also customers of the Solutions division. This could add several percentage points of organic growth tailwind as management is intent on increasing that figure.As they integrate these businesses, we think EBITDA margin in the Solutions business will bottom in 2014 around 34% and will climb steadily towards 40% over the next three to four years. With our revenue CAGR for Solutions at nearly 15% for the next two years hitting $385 million, at 37.5% EBITDA margin, this business will contribute substantially to growth. We see a clear bridge for 2018 figures of $485 million with EBITDA margins of 39.6% through both organic and inorganic. This business is their growth driver with a strong combination of recurring fixed fee revenue.Valuation BridgeTrading at 17.5x forward earnings, the shares trade much lower than many other recent IPOs. Even more interesting is the shares trading at less than 11.0x ntm EV/EBITDA, a massive discount to the peer group of 13.5x. Close competitors like MSCI (NYSE:MSCI), FactSet Research (NYSE:FDS), Verisk (NASDAQ:VRSK), trade at 15.7x, 16.6x, and 13.9x their ntm EV/EBITDA.We think the market is underestimated their growth potential, especially when it comes to acquisitions. Since 2003, they have engaged in over two dozen acquisitions broadening their product portfolio and moving into adjacent markets. Their history of strategically acquiring products to enhance its competitive advantage and stay ahead of the needs of their customers is unprecedented. This is evident with their move into some key growth markets like syndicate loan processing which has helped them achieve very strong organic growth, even though the industry itself is mature.(Source: Investor Presentation)The total market opportunity for the areas they compete is truly massive, estimated between $20 and $40 billion. We think their largest opportunity in terms of market penetration potential is in domain software, namely risk management software and reporting and compliance. This is a fragmented- and fairly new- industry with several players vying for market share. If the company can leverage their existing product portfolio, we think they can achieve strong organic and inorganic growth in the space.While we think EBITDA growth will slow this year on an organic basis lending to the Processing business headwinds, we do think low-to-mid single-digit EBITDA growth will be augmented by margin expansion. EBITDA margins of 44.5%, driven by 46% margins in the Information segment, should inch higher to 48%, ex-equity comp, over the next three years as they integrate recent acquisitions while leveraging existing platforms.With over half of their revenues coming from sticky, recurring non-variable sources, the risk of the business is fairly low. The risk for us is to the upside, likely through an accretive acquisition whereby they can leverage their existing infrastructure boosting EBITDA and margins. Our conservative estimates point to a $34 share price 18-months out from now for upside of nearly one-third. We think that price can be realized quicker through a large acquisition.(Source: Fourth Quarter 2014 Earnings Presentation)Our base case for EBITDA and intrinsic value is below:(Source: Author's Calculation)We think there is a small possibility that the company exits the Processing business altogether- although recent outperformance puts that into question. Meanwhile, we think the company's net debt position declines rapidly in the next two years as they pay down their existing revolver using their burgeoning cash flow. The business is a cash machine with little capex growth necessary to expand- lending to its strong scalability. While top line growth may be muted for the next two years, free cash flow growth should inflect strongly higher which should be enough to propel the shares.ConclusionOur contrarian bent led us to Markit, one of the premier names in the financial information services industry, with the lowest valuation of the peer group. The market is anticipating a headwind within Processing from electronic trading impact. But the first quarter results showed that it hasn't materialized, yet. While we do think it materializes, we think it will be partially offset by fees generated from connectivity to the new platform while the three-year target decline will be extended out. The company has a history of strong and strategic acquisitions and you need to have a forecast that they cease this successful and long-running strategy to come to a value close to the current trading price. We think fair value is closer to $30 in the near-term and $34 over the next 18 months. Demand for their Solutions and Information business, with the Indices business a potential upside surprise, are going to offset the Processing business. We think investors would be wiser to focus on their growing businesses rather than transitory headwinds."
4065634,102639,2017-04-26T15:11:00-04:00,"Cash and cash equivalents have halted their decline in Q1 2017 while both the net operating cash flow and free cash flow have been rising since Q3 2016.The steady rise in net operating cash flow has been supported by an uptrend in deferred revenue which provides visibility in IHS Markit's future income recognition.IHS Markit expects to continue seeing cost savings/synergies in its integration efforts, freeing up more cash for more fulfilling initiatives or acquisitions.From the technical charting point of view, the share price of IHS Markit has broken out of a triangular channel convincingly and is establishing a new uptrend.It is a matter of time before IHS Markit returns to the M&A scene to accelerate its revenue growth and subsequently boost the share price further.","IHS Markit (NASDAQ:INFO) is a company well poised for the Big Data era. The merger last year between IHS and Markit brought together a company strong in resources and automotive insights, and another a leader in financial information. Both were companies that high-growth or growth-at-a-reasonable-price (GARP) investors clamor for. The premise remains valid after the merger of the two companies. As you would see from the chart below, the share price of IHS Markit tends to move in tandem with the revenue.INFO data by YChartsAcquisition-Driven GrowthFor those familiar with the legacy IHS and Markit, you would know of their respective acquisitive streaks when they were on their own before their merger. There was the perennial concern that the companies were turning too gigantic for a data company to continue their well-run nature. In addition, the ongoing consolidation brought about by their acquisition also could lead to cannibalization of revenues. However, using the enterprise value as a proxy for a company size and complexity, you would find that IHS Markit, even after the merger of the two, remains smaller by a distance to its peers, RELX PLC (NYSE:RELX) and Thomson Reuters (NYSE:TRI). It would take a doubling of the enterprise value of IHS Markit to reach the levels of RELX and Thomson Reuters. If the two are not considered to be unwieldy, then IHS Markit being the smaller player should still have some way to go before it faces the challenges of saturated growth.INFO Enterprise Value data by YChartsWar Chest RefilledThe steep reduction in cash in 2016 has been explained by management as attributable primarily to the acquisitions of CARPROOF and OPIS in the first quarter of 2016. In the latest quarter (Q1 2017), cash and cash equivalents have halted the decline. On the other hand, both the net operating cash flow and free cash flow have been rising since Q3 2016. This means that cash and cash equivalents have the potential to increase further, enlarging the war chest of IHS Markit for acquisitions.(Source: Charts by ALT Perspective, data from company filings)The steady rise in net operating cash flow has been supported by an uptrend in deferred revenue. As IHS Markit seeks to lock-in clients on a longer-term basis, the tactic is to sell them multi-year packages rather than subscriptions that expire after a year. It is also cost-efficient as the marketing staff does not need to follow up with clients annually to secure renewals. The company also gains revenue visibility over a longer term as deferred revenue eventually get recognized as income. Most importantly, the advanced receipts help cash flow which the company could use for acquisitions or pay down debt. In return, the company entices clients with savings over the annual subscription format and reduced renewal administrative hassle.(Source: Charts by ALT Perspective, data from company filings)With all that cash, what could IHS Markit be eyeing? During the Investor Day webcast, management provided a succinct table showcasing their strengths versus analytics start-ups and big technology companies. Interestingly, it acknowledges its deficiency in analytics compared with the latter. Analytics start-ups are certainly more palatable to IHS Markit as big tech companies would be too big to swallow. It is, therefore, an area which the company could be targeting to raise its competitiveness and complete its suite of services.(Source: IHS Markit Investor Day 2017)Ongoing Cost Savings/Synergies From Integration Post-MergerIHS Markit expects to continue seeing cost savings/synergies in integration efforts. In my initial write-up on the company, I noted that the Q4 2016 results have already shown signs that the merger is bearing fruits. From more than $50 million this year, the figure is forecasted to rise to more than $125 million. The workforce is undergoing right sizing given the inevitable duplication post-merger. Consolidation of offices under one roof appears to still see room for ""optimization."" IT infrastructure is in the process of rationalization. All these positive developments meant more cash would be freed up for more fulfilling initiatives or acquisitions.(Source: IHS Markit Investor Day 2017)Technical Analysis and ConclusionFrom the technical charting point of view, the share price of IHS Markit has broken out of a triangular channel convincingly and is establishing a new uptrend. Any downside appears to be well supported by the rising 200-day moving average which is now around $38. Investors are expected to pile into the company shares as long as management continues to grow its top line. Besides using the growing cash pile for acquisitions, the company also has set aside cash for share repurchases. $2.2 billion worth of shares is targeted for repurchase in 2017-2018. Thereafter, around $500 million is allocated for share repurchasing annually. Given the sustained rise in the share price, the past repurchasing exercises proved to be well spent. With the acquisitive nature of the legacy IHS and Markit, and the swelling war chest, it is a matter of time when IHS Markit returns to the M&A scene to accelerate its revenue growth and subsequently boost the share price further.INFO data by YChartsNote from author: Thank you for reading.

3037216,75715,2015-03-30T04:06:54-04:00,"On March 24th, IHS announce Q1 earnings.While the numbers themselves were fine, investors were disappointed, resulting in a drop of almost $9 in stock price.After further investigating the report, I have determined that investors have overreacted, and that the stock should rise to new 52 week highs in the future.","IHS Inc. (IHS) closed trading at a price of $118.99 on March 23rd. The following morning, the stock price opened up at $110.03. This is a drop-off of $8.96, or a 7.5% fall. Did the stock really deserve that type of bearish attitude after reporting earnings? Well, in short, no. Earnings per share of $1.36 was in-line with estimates, and revenue of $546 million missed the mark by $6.68 million, a meager 1% under estimates. IHS is a company that provides analytical and informational products and services to a wide array of sectors and professions. They have a diverse clientele, and have seen progress in revenue and earnings compared to last year. Revenue represented more than a 4% increase when compared to the same period last year, and earnings per share for this quarter showed a 6% increase over the same period last year. These increases do not paint the full picture of this company's growth and potential, so a further investigation into the earnings report is necessary to verify the potential I see in this company.First, let's check out the attention investors gave IHS before and after earnings:(Google Finance)Notice the 4,000,000 shares traded over the span of 2 days, a major increase from the average daily trading volume of 453,582. It is not uncommon for a stock to have a drastic increase in volume after a big event such as earnings. For IHS, investors oversold the stock, and have now created a buying opportunity for investors clever enough to take action.Organic revenue growth was 2% across the three business segments (Americas, Europe, and Asia Pacific). Subscription based revenue, a key component of the IHS business model, grew a total 7% YoY, a great increase. An important metric to study is the free cash flow that IHS possesses. They grew free cash flow 15% YoY to a new total of $149 million. With this cash, IHS wields the power to entertain the option to acquire a smaller company that would boost its products and services. For the quarter, growth in total assets far outpaced growth in long term debt, a sign that the company has the ability to grow without taking on an incredible amount of debt. IHS has shown that they are a company on the rise that shows all the characteristics of a company that can make a push toward its 52 week high. IHS finished trading on September 2nd, 2014 with a stock price of $143.92, a figure that currently stands as its 52 week high. That was in the middle of the 3rd quarter, one in which IHS had a higher operating expense and a significantly smaller total assets figure. Right now, IHS is running with a P/E ratio of 38.13, well below the industry average of 168.49. This signals sufficient undervaluation in the information services industry that IHS finds itself in.Guidance for the 2015 year has been revised by IHS. Revenue for the year is expected to fall in the range between $2.27 billion and $2.31 billion. This shows confidence in revenue growth in subsequent quarters, as the $546 million figure for the Q1 revenue represents less than a quarter for the $2.27-$2.31 billion estimation figure. In addition, they predict a 5-6 percent subscription organic growth, a figure that is supported by the solid performance in subscription revenue in Q1. The company simply has services for nearly every business profession, and have expanded internationally to Asia and Europe.ConclusionIHS has performed up to par for the first quarter in 2015, and investors have oversold the stock. As I have sufficiently shown in the article, IHS is performing at levels similar if not better than when it was trading at its 52 week high of $143.92. I recommend a buy on this stock before it starts creating new 52 week highs."
2817026,47561,2015-01-13T10:51:10-05:00,"Q4 2014 earnings were released on January 13.Earnings per share beat expectations, but revenue fell short.Organic sales increased 4%.The company's stock has reacted by rising over 6%.","IHS Inc. (NYSE: IHS), a leading source of information, insight, and analytics to governments and businesses in more than 165 countries throughout the world, released fourth quarter earnings before the market opened this morning and its stock has responded by rallying over 6%; let's take a closer look at the results and the company's outlook going forward to determine if we should consider buying into this rally or if we should wait for it to subside.Breaking Down The Mixed ResultsHere's a summary of IHS's fourth quarter earnings compared to what analysts had anticipated and its results in the year ago period:IHS's earnings per share increased 15.1% and its revenue increased 4% compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013; these results were driven by net income increasing 47.3% to $60.12 million and subscription revenues increasing 6.1% to $443.77 million, but were held back by non-subscription revenues decreasing 2% to $138.55 million. Here's a breakdown of the company's revenues and revenue growth by product category (in thousands):IHS's adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) increased 10% to $186.46 million and its operating profit increased 43.7% to $87.39 million in the fourth quarter, as its EBITDA margin expanded 170 basis points to 32% and its operating margin expanded 410 basis points to 15%; these very strong results can be attributed to costs of sales increasing just 2.1% and selling, general, and administrative expenses decreasing 0.1% during the quarter, both of which were outpaced by the company's 4% increase in revenue.For the quarter, IHS generated $85.65 million in net cash provided by operating activities and invested $31.14 million in capital expenditures, resulting in $54.51 million of free cash flow, which it utilized to repurchase approximately $8.65 million worth of its common stock. The company ended the quarter with $153.16 million in cash and cash equivalents, so it could easily accelerate repurchases in fiscal 2015.Lastly, IHS provided its outlook for fiscal 2015, calling for the following performance:Is IHS Still A Buy?IHS Inc. is one of the world's leading providers of information, insight, and analytics, and increased demand for its services led it to a very strong fourth quarter performance; the company reported year-over-year growth in earnings per share, revenue, EBITDA, and operating profit, while expanding its margins, generating $54.51 million in free cash flow, and providing solid outlook on fiscal 2015, and its stock has responded accordingly by rising over 6%.Even after the large post-earnings pop in IHS's stock, I think it represents a great long-term investment opportunity today, because it trades at very inexpensive forward valuations; take a look at this chart of the company's earnings per share outlook for fiscal 2015 and analysts' earnings per share estimate for fiscal 2016, and the stock's current price-to-earnings multiple based on these estimates:As the chart above shows, IHS's stock trades at just 19.2 times fiscal 2015's earnings per share estimates and less than 17 times fiscal 2016's estimates, and these multiples are very inexpensive compared to the industry average multiple of 27.4 and the company's long-term growth rate. With these valuations in mind, I think long-term investors could consider buying into the rally in IHS's shares, with the intention of adding to the positions on any weakness provided by the market."

It reached a low of $21.04 on October 7, yet the share price has recovered to currently trade at $25.31 (12.7.2014).(Nasdaq.com)Conclusion: Short OpportunityGiven MRKT's solid market performance, and particularly promising Q3 results, the firm's major pre-IPO shareholders including Bank of America Corporation, Deutsche Bank, Esta Investments, General Atlantic Partners Tango, The Goldman Sachs Group JPMorgan Chase and additional individuals could take this first chance to cash out.The trend of price declines in the days leading up to and following a firm's lockup expiration has been supported by our own firm's research, as well as additional academic studies. With just ~53 million shares sold at the firm's IPO, the unlocking of well over double that amount could effect a significant supply shock.We suggest investors take a look at this likely impending decline for MRKT."
3278985,75715,2015-06-23T16:01:15-04:00,"Last quarter, I wrote an Earnings Reporter piece on IHS.My report anticipated a rebound, which occurred over the past three months.Once again, IHS has beaten on earnings and deserves your investment.","Last time I wrote about IHS (IHS), I recommended a buy after earnings. The company was oversold after a decent report, and I believed that the stock would adequately recover, at least to where it was before the report. The stock has risen from around $110 to it's current standing at around $129. This is not to toot my horn; it is to explain the near-term implications of my ""Earnings Reporter"" articles. The stocks I'm writing about will doubtlessly experience and increased trading volume and immediate volatility post-earnings release. My segment will help you make quick day trades that will give you solid returns. Most companies I write about, unless I mention otherwise, are also set up nicely from a fundamental standpoint. These are not just ""invest today, sell tomorrow"" stocks. This is why ""The Earnings Reporter"" is so essential; it gives advice to both long-term and short-term investors. Let's take a look at how IHS has delivered yet again, and how the market is dragging in assessing proper valuation for the company.Tuesday's Report And Consistent GrowthAs of this writing, IHS is trading at $129.74. It's 52-week high is $143.92, and the stock is currently positioned to overtake that high over the next few weeks. After analyzing the earnings report, I have recognized that IHS is standing EVEN BETTER than it was when it was trading at it's high. Let's check out the 52-week chart:The stock has decreased slightly over 6% for the year, but this is about to change. Both earnings for FQ2 and guidance for 2015 represent steady and rising growth.Before the market opened, IHS released its FQ2 report. Earnings Per Share came in at $1.50, beating estimates. Revenue also beat estimates, coming in at a figure of $591 million. This revenue number is up 4% Y/Y. Revenue is coming in stronger than it was when IHS was trading upwards of $140 per share. Another very important factor to take away from the report was the 5% increase in subscription growth. A leader in information and insight analytics, and has a diverse clientèle. With its wide-array of clients, IHS has been successful in achieving organic growth for the quarter. Despite currency fluctuations and the energy debacle, IHS has contained its clients and has expanded itself.Free cash flow has decreased from 2014 to $116 million. This number should not be scrutinized because it tells a story. IHS is committed to helping out its shareholders, and they do this in the form of stock buybacks. They completed a $100 million repurchase program, and if that isn't enough, today they announced ANOTHER repurchase. The IHS board of directors have approved a $500 million repurchase program. Clearly, management is a big believer in the direction of the company, and are rewarding shareholders who share the same vision.IHS achieved a 7% increase in revenue from its Americas segment. This increase is essential to IHS, as its EMEA segment posted a marginal decrease in revenue (due to currency issues, economic regression). The APAC segment is smaller than the other two, but still had an increase of 4% in organic growth for the subscription base. IHS has increased revenue from FQ2 2014 in subscription based revenue by around $33 million (or 8%), while non-subscription revenue slightly decreased. IHS has recognized that it makes its money primarily from its subscription business, and has clearly succeeded in expanding revenue in the segment across all locations.The final piece of the report that I would like to bring to your attention is the guidance for 2015. IHS predicts to have revenue between $2.3-$2.34 billion. This means that IHS anticipates similar revenue to this quarter, which is a great outlook. Furthermore, IHS predicts EPS between $5.80-$6 per share. To achieve this, IHS will have to deliver stronger EPS numbers than this FQ2 figure of $1.50. This is great news for shareholders, who can now take a sigh of relief that IHS has maintained (and predicts to continue maintaining) solid growth, despite cutbacks in the energy industry and economic issues overseas.ConclusionOnce again, IHS has delivered. These figures show the strength and fortitude of IHS during rapidly shifting economic times. Subscription growth has pushed this company higher, and will help IHS exceed its 52-week high in the near future. The stock is undervalued, and it is my recommendation to take advantage of this opportunity."
2522905,46261,2014-09-27T08:50:00-04:00,"The hefty price tag is well warranted due to strong economic moat, 75% recurring revenues, strong free cash flow leverage and more.
        Thanks to the dip, IHS offers a roughly 20% upside within the next two years and a ~$149.88 target price, but high growth is priced in. Downside should be protected.
        Recent quarterly results were not as rosy as they seemed on the surface and they reveal concerns for the longer term.
        Over the long run, IHS will need to boost its faltering organic growth, or investor growth expectations may have to adjust downward.
        Acquisition speed may hit a speed bump in a few years due to high debt, high stock market prices and acquisition risks.","IHS, Inc. (IHS) provides industry information, analysis and software, mostly on a subscription basis, to commercial and institutional customers as well as to roughly 170 governments around the world. The company strives to provide an integrated and complete ecosystem based on the subscription revenue model, which accounts for ~75% of revenue. The major industry verticals in which IHS provides expertise are energy and natural resources, aerospace and defense, maritime, automotive, technology and chemical industries. The company won the award for the best overall forecaster in the U.S. for 2013. From my personal experience with IHS as an end-user of the data for the automotive industry and general macroeconomic analysis, I can safely say that the company is the best source for very accurate predictions, estimates and market data.Investment thesisIHS has a history of stellar top line growth (18% CAGR in the past ten years) and FCF growth (31% CAGR during the same period.) However, what concerns investors and me is the current 4% and slowing organic top line growth, which even partly includes the past year's acquisition revenue for the most recent quarter. Without this acquisition, the organic growth would have been even flatter, if not falling. IHS has been boosting organic growth by acquisitions throughout its history. The company acquired seven companies in 2013 alone, and the management specifically mentioned further acquisitions as part of its 2015 strategic plan.However, they also mentioned development of additional organic growth opportunities, which should result in gradual rise of organic growth to 8% or 10% in 2016, so growth should be less dependent on acquisitions if things work out as planned for the company. In any case, for the next two to three years, IHS should be able to grow at high rates either through organic means, as new services are integrated to existing products and customers, or through acquisitions.Given the continued positive industry outlook and strong current performance, IHS is a very solid investment for the next two years despite seemingly lofty valuation. While trailing and forward P/E and most other ratios look very lofty (57x TTM P/E, 20x forward P/E, 4x P/S), the company is a great cash flow generator with a 17x trailing P/FCF, which completely changes the valuation picture, especially when combined with the high 15% FCF growth rates expected for the next several years.As a result of these factors and very strong economic moat, IHS has a roughly 20% upside within the next two years with a target price of ~$149.88 per share thanks to the recent price drop, which coincided with the broad market sell-off and post-earnings sell-off as the company did not over-deliver as much as expected and disappointed on the organic growth side.IHS uses a very smart business model that features low capital intensity and high operational leverage of the fixed costs. The company basically sells information, and it can often resell the same information or analysis to multiple clients. This effect is further leveraged through acquisitions. IHS focuses on the subscription pricing model with approximately three quarters of all revenues come from subscriptions. This is beneficial to the stability of future revenue. But what is even better, part of the subscription payments is first booked as deferred revenue before the services are actually provided. This prepaid cash is used for partly financing the company's capital requirements, and thanks to this phenomenon, IHS is able to run large negative working capital. This subscription cash flow is somewhat similar to the ""float"" principle that insurance companies benefit from, including Warren Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.B).In sum of my thesis for the next few years, the near-term outlook looks positive for the company, barring a steep global economic decline. IHS has a ~20% upside and a target price of ~$149.88 per share. However, due to a mature bull market and perhaps mature economic cycle, investors should use downside protection, for example, through put options 10% below the purchase price.Future growth will be more challenging to achieve profitablyNevertheless, over the long run, with investment horizon of ten years and more, I see many strong risk factors to the current stock price, which will need to be solved. I expect IHS to remain a very good company with strong moat and rising FCF. However, the boost to annual growth that has been supplied by acquisitions in the past years may not be so easy to achieve beyond the next several years, and investors should prepare for a risk of a lower total growth beyond 2017.While IHS has strong cash flows and free cash flows, the P/S ratio is high at 4x sales and net profit margin is below 10%. Given these numbers, it is likely that the company will only be able to finance 2% to 3% growth from internally generated free cash flow as the price for the acquired companies is likely to be high given the current frothy general market valuations and the industry's high P/S ratios, which IHS's own 4x P/S ratio confirms.The most recent significant acquisition of R.L. Polk & Co. in 2013 carried a P/S ratio of roughly 4x, similar to IHS itself. However, thanks to excellent free cash flow generation, the company was quickly able to delever from 3.9x long-term debt/EBITDA to 2.9x and was ready to perform another two acquisitions in 2014, although small ones. But they were strategically important, nonetheless. The latest acquisition of Global Trade Information Services, Inc. greatly helped expansion of maritime expertise and trade leadership globally, and the acquisition of PCI Acrylonitrile helped in the chemical industry vertical.The current organic sales growth rates are around 3% to 4% annually. The current stock prices in roughly 15% annual EPS growth. Adjusted EBITDA margin has been almost flat in the past four years and shows signs of topping out as it has been impacted by lower margin acquisitions and one-time related costs. But these will be part of the future acquisition-boosted growth and will keep negatively influencing the margin, so the EBITDA margin is unlikely to grow much in the future unless organic growth accelerates.My estimate is that even with slight margin expansion, IHS will need to deliver ~8% sales growth annually from acquisitions. Part of the finances will have to come from external sources. The company's debt levels are still quite high despite deleveraging. While there is room for debt expansion for several years, the trajectory looks fragile in the long run if more debt needs to be added overall, especially in the face of less appetite for the riskier debt and the expected rise in interest rates, which would make debt servicing more expensive for IHS. As a result, annual growth rates are likely to come down to ~10% per year from the current 15% growth expectations within a few years. Such reset of expectations would probably be accompanied by a drop in IHS's P/E multiple that markets are willing to assign to it from the current 57.23 TTM P/E and 19.54 forward P/E - which itself is based on very rosy analysts' expectations - down to probably around 10x forward P/E, which would mean a stock price ~50% lower than current levels. In the next several years, though, IHS is likely to add EPS close to the 15% annual growth rate. So, all in all, the stock could probably trade slightly up from the current levels but may not rise as much annually in the far future as we were used to.To sum up my overall view on IHS, within the next two years, the stock has plenty of room to run with ~20% upside thanks to the recent dip. In the longer term beyond 2017, the company will need to find new sources of growth or investors will need to readjust their EPS and FCF growth rate expectations that are baked in the current IHS price.What spooked investors in the seemingly very solid quarterly numbers?For the most recent quarter ended August 31, 2014, IHS reported revenue of $556M, up 16% Y/Y. Adjusted EBITDA was $174M, up 21%, while adjusted EPS was $1.49, an increase of 17%. GAAP EPS was 0.68, almost double Y/Y, and free cash flow was $135M, an increase of 124%. The company also raised its full-year guidance.These numbers look great. So, what's the problem? Well, the organic growth reached only 3% Y/Y and only the subscription segment grew meaningfully by 6% Y/Y, while the non-subscription sales fell 5%. The 3% organic growth was boosted by 1% currency exchange rate tailwinds and 11% of acquisition-driven growth. Moreover, roughly half of the quarter already included numbers of the past year's large acquisition as organic growth already. Judging from the organic numbers, sales of the acquired business are not adding to the overall organic growth.While the subscription services are more important to focus on increasing and more efficient from the cost of sales point-of-view, the current overall 3% to 4% pure organic growth rate spells trouble for the longer-term future, as the company will have to boost this growth more by acquisitions. Acquisitions carry many risks and unexpected costs such as restructuring and goodwill write-offs.For the less bumpy time frame of the trailing nine months, organic growth was ~4% with non-subscription business roughly flat and subscription business rising nicely. However, IHS will run into some high comparable numbers from last year, which will make it hard to deliver good-looking numbers in the upcoming quarter.In terms of verticals, the business is very balanced, with most sectors growing organically. However the aerospace and defense sectors continue to be pressured by lower U.S. government spending, partially offset by rising APAC and EMEA sales.Valuation based on DFCF shows more upsideWith expectations for total FCF growth including acquisitions to reach 15% in 2015 and 2016, followed by 10% annual growth for the rest of the decade and flat FCF afterward, my fair value estimate for IHS is ~$149.88 per share, offering a roughly 20% upside. This expects flat FCF margins.Source: author calculationsPeer valuation reveals IHS trades at the lower end of the groupRelative valuation doesn't raise any concerns. While not all of the following companies are pure, direct competitors as some focus primarily on financial services, marketing data or other areas, their business models and capital structure are often similar. IHS trades at a 17.5x forward P/E. Markit (MRKT), the newcomer from this year's IPO, trades at about 17x forward P/E; Fact Set (NYSE:FDS) at about 20x; MSCI at 21x; Verisk Analytics at 22.7x; Dun & Bradstreet (NYSE:DNB) at 15x; and Nielsen (NYSE:NLSN) at 16x forward P/E.RisksMajor risks have been thoroughly described throughout the article, and they include the low organic growth, which results in over-reliance on acquisitions and periodic debt ramp-up and pay-down periods. Also related to the acquisitions, the company has very high goodwill and intangible assets, resulting nasty financial indicators, such as negative tangible book value and the risk of surprise goodwill or intangible write-offs.High goodwill and intangiblesThanks to many acquisitions throughout the company's history, total goodwill and intangibles amount to ~$4B, which is roughly double the amount of total stockholders' equity at just below $2B. Tangible equity is just over $1B while total long-term debt stands at over $2B.I understand that IHS is a company based on high quality know-how and human capital, so it is not surprising to see a low share of tangible assets. However, this may pose a problem for the long-term future, as IHS plans to grow through acquisitions in 2015 and also needs to grow through acquisitions in order to deliver the high growth expectations baked in the current price. The company may either have trouble borrowing enough beyond the next two to three years or the cost of borrowing will rise, depressing margins.High debtTogether with short-term debt, total debt is ~$3B. This represents ~1.5x book value, 1.5x sales and 6x EBITDA. Net debt to adjusted EBITDA is ~2.8x, though at the moment the company has shown that in order to make a strategic acquisition, it is willing to increase it to 3.7x net debt/adjusted EBITDA and quickly pay it down to more safe levels. However, there is a risk that if an acquisition turns out to be a loser, debt repayment will be slow and future growth will be at risk.Working capital dropped to ~negative $300M as the company has roughly $600M worth of deferred revenue, which provides an excellent source of cash flow before costs and services are provided, serving as a very smart financing mechanism which lowers the company's borrowing costs.However, the securitization of part of the subscription payments (deferred revenue) is largely a one-off financial engineering improvement to the company's financials, and the long-term growth rate will be largely unaffected by this improvement.Acquisition-driven growth can be risky and harder to achieveIn total, IHS completed seven acquisitions in 2013. The company usually realizes synergies within two years from the acquisition but also incurs additional one-time costs during this time frame. This is another reason why investors are now hesitant to buy IHS. There are risks that these acquisitions will not deliver the expected synergies in 2015 or that one-time costs will be larger than expected. For example, top line growth in this and the upcoming quarter will be affected by the elimination of certain product overlaps resulting from the acquisitions.ConclusionIHS has incredible economic moat and an excellent business model with high operational leverage, high FCF generation and roughly three-quarters of sales are subscription-based. I can also personally attest that IHS's services are probably the best in the industries they cover. The recent dip caused mainly by IHS's not over-delivering enough and low organic growth created an attractive, near-term opportunity with 20% upside within two years with a target price of ~$149.88. Downside should be protected because the market is fully valued and the economic cycle seems to be maturing. Moreover, in the very long run, IHS remains an excellent business but it will need to either come up with more organic growth or investor expectations for future growth rate will have to reset downward as acquisition growth may become less easy to achieve."
2429425,25120,2014-08-17T01:41:27-04:00,"Markit posted solid results in its first quarterly earnings release as a publicly traded company.I like the growth, diversification and high profit margins of the business.As such, shares deserve a modest premium valuation versus the wider market, making me a patient buyer at levels just below $25 per share.","Markit (MRKT) reported its first set of quarterly results as a publicly traded company this week. While net profits were largely down due to one-time costs related to its IPO, adjusted for this net earnings were largely flat compared to last year.I like the very fat margins, organic growth trajectory and diversification of the business. As such, shares might fetch a premium valuation despite sluggish conditions in the financial industry, making me a patient buyer at slightly lower levels.Highlights For The QuarterMarkit posted second quarter sales of $264.6 million, an 11.0% increase compared to the same period last year. Revenues beat consensus estimates at $256.3 million.Reported earnings dropped by 45% to $29.4 million with diluted earnings being cut nearly in half as well at $0.16 per share. Of course, the company incurred a lot of one-time costs related to its public offering.Excluding these costs, earnings would have been roughly flat compared to last year. Adjusted earnings, which are a non-GAAP earnings metric, came in at $0.37 per share, thereby beating consensus estimates by four cents.Looking Into The PerformanceThe 11% topline growth seems very appealing, yet part of this was aided by non-structural items. Organic growth explained 4.3% of the reported growth, acquisitions another 2.8% while favorable FX rates added another 3.9% to reported topline sales growth.The company's largest information business posted sales of $122.2 million, a 5.7% improvement compared to last year on positive FX movements and new customer wins.Growth at the processing business was just 1.9% with revenues advancing to $72.1 million as weaker derivative processing performance hurt sales, offset by foreign exchange movements.The smaller solutions business is ready to overtake the company's processing business. Its sales rose by 35.7% to $70.3 million driven by new customer wins, fees being based on assets under management and acquisitions.The company is very profitable, with operating earnings still totaling $42.9 million, or 16.2% of sales. Adding back the $31.3 million in net expenses which were largely related to public offering related costs, operating earnings were $74 million which was in line with last year.ValuationMarkit ended the quarter with about $97.5 million in cash and equivalents. Total debt of $583 million was rather sizable, resulting in a net debt position of about $485 million.With 182.7 million shares outstanding following the public offering, and those shares exchanging hands at $25.50 per share, equity is valued at $4.6 billion. Given the low seasonality of the business, an extrapolation of the past quarter's results makes a billion in revenues quite easily attainable with adjusted earnings of over $200 million being very likely.I like the forward valuation if shares see a further correction. Shares trade at 4.6 times sales and 23 times annual earnings based on the simple projections above.Final RecommendationBack in June, when the company was sold to the general public, I had a look at the company's prospects. I concluded that I liked shares at the offer price, with shares being offered at $24 per share at the time, as shares jumped towards $27 on their opening day.I liked the growth of the firm, as well as the diversification in terms of business disciplines and geographical areas. I was impressed with organic growth rates of the business, despite a financial industry still being very much in cost-cutting mode. Of course, the strong multi-year momentum across major asset classes has been very helpful.This relative strong performance, the very profitable margins and rapid built-up of a dominant name in the industry were main attractions for me at the time of the offering.I am willing to pay 20 times earnings, a 10-15% premium versus the market valuation given the growth and higher valuation for information providers in general like names as FactSet Research (NYSE:FDS) and Morningstar (NASDAQ:MORN), among others. Combined with $200-$250 million in potential annual earnings, this translates into a $24 price target in my eyes.I continue to like shares very much at those levels. A slightly bigger correction provides me with the opportunity to pick up some high-quality shares at a fair price.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2279303,25120,2014-06-20T14:05:42-04:00,Markit sees a successful public debut.Shares rise on their opening day as the company increased its offering size.I am a buyer at levels around the offer price in this quality growth stock.,"Markit (MRKT) provides financial information services to enhance transparency, reduce risk and improve efficiency of financial markets.The company has a solid growth and profitable track record, accompanied by a strong competitive position. At levels around the public offer price, I am a buyer in this quality name.The Public OfferingMarkit was founded back in 2003 and has quickly become embedded in the systems of many financial participants. Leading technologies and expertise has created innovative products in many asset classes. Key offerings include pricing, reference data, valuation and trading services used by back-office, traders, portfolio managers as well as all other financial professionals.Markit aimed to sell 45.7 million shares for $24 apiece, thereby raising $1.1 billion in gross proceeds. Strong demand pushed up the size of the offering to 53.5 million shares, allowing the firm to raise $1.28 billion. As a matter of fact, all the shares were offered by selling shareholders which include banks like Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and J.P. Morgan Chase (NYSE:JPM). No proceeds of the offering will benefit the firm.While the size of the offering was increased, pricing took place right in the middle of the preliminary offering range of $23 to $25 per share, set by the firm and its bankers.Shares of the company jumped on its opening day to close the first day of trading at $26.70. At these levels the firm is valued around $4.7 billion.A whole list of banks aided in the public offering including some of the previous shareholders like Bank of America, Barclays, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, HSBC and J.P. Morgan, among many others. To avoid conflicts between selling shareholders and underwriters, Jefferies was hired as the leading independent underwriter of the deal.ValuationDespite being around for little more than a decade, Markit has over 3,000 customers across the world already. The firm generates roughly half of its revenues in the U.S., 40% in Europe and the remainder in the rest of the world.The company has three main divisions being the information, processing and its solutions business. Information makes up nearly half of revenues and includes pricing, reference and valuation data. Processing makes up 28% of revenues derived from the processing of OTC derivatives, FX and syndicated loans. Solutions make up little less than a quarter of total revenues and is aimed at the organization, display and analysis of information.For the year of 2013, Markit generated revenues of $947.9 million which was up by 10.2% on the year before. Earnings attributable to shareholders rose by 11.5% to $139.4 million, as operating earnings were down slightly compared to the year before.First quarter sales for 2014 were up by 14.1% to $259.4 million. Earnings attributable to shareholders fell from $50.7 million to $39.8 million.Markit operates with roughly $38 million in cash and equivalents while it operates with a sizable $617 million in total debt. This results in a rather steep net debt position of roughly $580 million.A $4.7 billion valuation values the company at 5.0 times sales and 33-34 times earnings as reported last year.Investment ThesisAs noted above, the public offering of Markit has been a success. While shares were offered at the midpoint of the preliminary offering range, Markit did increase the size of the offering substantially. Shares saw a healthy gain on their opening day.A strong sign is that while banks are exiting their stakes, other key shareholders are maintaining their stake while the Canada Pension Investment Board aimed to purchase a 10% stake for $450 million in the offering.The company behind the well known Market CDX and iTraxx indices has become a dominant player in a rather short time, creating real economic moat, competing with the likes of Bloomberg, Reuters and Factset. Besides competition there are other real risks like the reliance on OTC trading which could suffer from increased regulation. Pressure on the financial industry which is in cost cutting mode, reliance on third parties for information and the continued requirements to develop new products are key risks as well.Note that organic growth was a solid 8.3% in the first quarter, as reported revenue growth of 14.1% was aided by acquisitions. First quarter earnings were impacted by an $11.1 million in IPO preparation charges. Total exceptional charges totaled $60 million, or roughly $40 million on a after tax-basis in 2013. Adjusting for that, earnings would have come in around $180 million last year, valuing Markit at a more acceptable 26 times earnings. Given the continued growth, adjusting earnings could increase in 2014, pushing the earnings multiple to their low twenties.As such, Markit could be an interesting investment. The company has a good track record, is profitable and has long term investors. I could imagine myself paying 20-22 times earnings for this industry leader, which based upon earnings of $200 million would translate into a $22-$25 price range at which I would be interested in this play.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Management specifically referenced the company's commercial expansion initiatives in their earnings press release, and IHS President & CEO Scott Key presented on the earnings conference call this morning with analysts and investors after the market had a small period to digest the earnings information and react to the news.

The company also has over $260 million in cash and equivalents on its balance sheet and should be in a strong position to generate free cash flows going forward.The company's 60% gross margin and less-than-20 price to free cash flow metrics should give bulls some confidence, while critics could easily point to IHS's lofty 62 P/E and recent earnings volatility as reasons for pause. Still, on today's post-earnings pullback, this remains a company to keep an eye on going forward. Good luck."

2387265,70035,2014-06-21T06:56:00-04:00,"Markit's successful IPO on Wall Street has raised a larger-than-expected $1.3bn, securing its growth in the lucrative financial data-crunching sector.Markit has capitalized on the rapid growth in trusted third-party arbiters of financial information - a key sector following the 2008 financial meltdown.Its $23-25 share price values it at 25-times its 2014 profits pace: growth investors will likely view it as quite attractive given Markit's expansion and high-margin business model.","Originally published on Jun 21, 2014.UK-based financial information and research firm Markit (MRKT) had a larger-than-expected initial public offering on Nasdaq, Thursday, as the company sold 53.47 million shares at a price that's hovering around $24 a share. and shares began trading at $26.15, up more than 10%.On the face of it, this is obviously good news for Markit as it looks to consolidate the ballooning market for centralized data crunchers that help value and process complex financial instruments. However, all the shares that were sold, were sold on behalf of selling shareholders: Markit won't receive any proceeds from the IPO.The shareholders, mostly banks including: Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan, raised $1.3 billion in gross proceeds after raising the number of shares from the originally planned offering of 45.7 million to 53.7 million.A Return for ShareholdersFor Markit, this is still important as its shareholders are getting a big return on investment, and, indeed, they still retain between 3%-6% ownership of the company. This keeps them on the books to participate in further upsides as well as fund acquisitions that challenge larger rivals such as Bloomberg, Thomson Reuters and IBM Analytics.Canadian Lance Uggla, a trader working in London, created Markit in 2003 as a central repository of data on non-listed assets and derivatives collected from financial market participants. Its initial product was a daily pricing product for credit default swaps, an opaque category of derivatives valued independently by dealers and funds.The so-called ""ABX"" index, famously became a way for banks and their clients to wager on the subprime-mortgage market ahead of and during the financial crisis. Since then, the company has expanded to offer data and analytical information about markets, process trades for clients and design technologies to analyze trading and risk.It now boasts more than 3,000 employees in more than 10 countries.""This was the culmination of many months of hard work,"" Uggla told the New York Times' Deal Book blog. ""I think the result is some great brand recognition.""Uncertain watersThere are some ongoing concerns for shareholders, however. The company came under intense Congressional scrutiny over its ABX index and its IPO prospectus, acknowledged risks including litigation and the possibility of paying fines. In 2009, for instance, the US Justice Department confirmed it had launched a probe into possible antitrust violations in the credit-default-swaps market. Markit, along with several banks, was targeted for allegedly controlling prices.The company maintain it acted properly at all times and no penalties are planned in the probe. However, The Wall Street Journal reported last year that it was subject to a parallel probe by European authorities into possible anticompetitive behavior in CDS markets.Uggla Eyeing AcquisitionsMarkit's revenue grew 24% between 2011 and 2013, and its cash flow surged 38% over that time. In the first quarter of this year, its annual run rate of revenue surpassed $1 billion. Much of the firm's revenue comes as annually recurring fees, lending stability to the business in a volatile market.Indeed it's a relatively ""sticky"" business as Markit is relied upon to perform core analytical and pricing work. With the successful IPO, Uggla is already confident that acquisitions will follow.""Markit has always grown organically and enhanced that through acquisition,"" he told Financial News. ""Most of these have been bolt-on acquisitions where we can grow the acquisition and find additional growth. This is a core part of our ethos and the company's vision for the future.""Uggla did stress that any ""potential acquisitions would focus across its three main business lines of information, processing and solutions."" But in its short history it has already bought a total of 25 companies, amounting to $1.8 billion. You should expect, with the extra-currency brought to its investors, more acquisitions will follow.ConclusionThere are countless growth opportunities for Markit as it continues to push-up against the big financial information providers like Bloomberg and Reuters. What gives me confidence that it will continue to compete against those giants is the billions in revenue it continues to draw and the confidence it has brought its investors.Its listing on Nasdaq entrenches the company, headquartered in London, as a largely transatlantic business, making net profits of $139m on revenues of $948m last year. Much of that growth has come by acquiring other financial technology companies.These acquisitions have helped it push into forecasting risk and processing over-the-counter derivatives-areas that have assumed greater importance for regulators following the financial crisis.I believe those who bought the stock at the $24 share price will get a great long-term return on investment. The stock will likely rise in the short term too, especially as the company's path to expansion becomes clearer.However, there will be a period of uncertainty as EU anti-trust investigations windup, likely to complete in 2015. Until then, I would caution against investing at anything over $30 a share.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

2269313,20324,2014-06-15T08:10:51-04:00,"Markit's IPO is set for Wednesday, June 18th. It is a buy. Its core product are prices and indices that facilitate the buying and selling of credit default swaps.Its biggest threat is its own Board of Directors - a bank cartel which wears multiple hats as supplier, customer, dominant shareholder, and underwriter.We use a game theoretic approach to analyze Markit's prospects, suggesting that this moat's moat is a doomsday machine defense.Even at our estimated trailing P/E ratio of 30, it is a buy.In doing so, you will be able to brag that you outdid Buffett because you are buying the moat instead of a company with a moat.","Markit's (MRKT) core product are prices that facilitate the buying and selling of credit default swaps (CDS) - insurance on complex heterogeneous debt called asset-backed securities (NYSE:ABS) and collateralized debt obligations (CDO).They also have created a series of branded indices, representing particular classes of ABSs and CDOs, much like the S&P index, that are traded. This includes the well- known brands Markit CDX™, iTraxx®, and iBoxx®Their business is impenetrable, with both definitions of this adjective applicable: (1) impossible to enter; (2) impossible to understand.So, don't spend too much time trying to figure out what Markit does or poring over their financials, which I will summarize below. Just buy it. (Swoosh)For those financial wonks that want a deeper dive, I recommend a paper by Robert E. Litan called ""Derivatives Dealers Club"" published by The Brookings Institute. Needless to say of a Brookings-sponsored publication, the conclusions are anti-laissez faire.By adding Markit to your portfolio, you will be able to tell friends you outdid Warren Buffett's mantra of buying companies with moats, because you just bought the moat.Indeed you will be buying the mother of all moats, as Markit protects a cartel of the most powerful banks in the world who make lucrative commissions brokering over-the-counter [OTC] two party trades with an estimated yearly value of $57 TRILLION DOLLARS in 2011.Markit acts as a moat for the bank cartel by refusing to sell its data to entities who wish to start up a CDS exchange as an alternative to the banks' less transparent, more lucrative OTC way of doing business. The reason Markit refuses is…guess?The bank cartel owns a dominant share of Markit's stock and sits on its Board of Directors.Another reason to add Markit to your portfolio is that you will be adding a rare buy-and-hold stock that will around three decades from now and still be appreciating.You can have confidence in a buy-and-hold strategy for Markit that you can't have for tech stocks with alleged moats as evidenced by the performance of the likes of Intel, Microsoft, Cisco, and Oracle.In some ways, Markit is similar to bond rating companies. A 30 year buy-and-hold strategy seems reasonable given these founding dates: Standard & Poor's (1860), Moody's (1909) and Fitch (1913). CDS will last as long as bonds and so too will the data analytics companies that first rate these financial instruments.We wish to address now the threats to Markit's financials. In other words, what is this moat's moat? We think the primary threat is not the government, or potential competitors, but its own Board of Directors.As we will summarize below, Markit is profitable with the latest FY2013 GAAP profit margin of 15.5% and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 44.4% (See F-1 filed with the SEC in conjunction with its IPO).But, we ask ourselves, given its critical role in the smooth functioning of a $57+ Trillion market, why is Markit not more profitable?The answer starts with the fact that a dominant share of Markit's stock is owned by the largest banks in the world who both broker CDS trades and supply Markit with ongoing trade data.Markit's financial engineers then slice and dice this data creating synthetic prices and indices, whose value is in reducing the price discovery costs of those who buy and sell CDS. Markit then licenses its products back to banks and other financial institutions including hedge funds.The banks wear an unprecedented 4 different hats when relating to Markit: Supplier / Customer / Stockholder and Board Member / Underwriter.From Markit's F-1 on reducing the banks' rights to sit on its Board:From Markit's F-1 on customers as shareholders as underwriters:There are 3 groups who are a threat to Markit: (1) its own Board of Directors; (2) government antitrust regulators; and (3) data analytics competitors. We have no real insight into Markit's strategy for (3).But, Markit's defense for threat (1) and (2) comes straight out of game-theory whose foundation is based on the work of John von Neumann and John F. Nash (A Beautiful Mind).In other words, the primary threat to the moat is the castle, and the primary threat to the castle is the moat. This a two-person game.The defense is known as ""the doomsday machine"" defense, a form of Nash equilibrium in which neither side, once armed, has any incentive to initiate a conflict or to disarm.What Markit can do is let potential threats know that if attacked, Markit will trigger a ""doomsday machine"" with mutual assured destruction [MAD], an acronym first coined by the great John von Neumann and made popular by the movie Dr. Strangelove.We have become familiar with a particular application of this defense called the ""too big to fail"" defense that these same banks used to persuade the Federal Reserve Bank to buy its distressed ABSs and CDOs back in 2008.Markit can turn the tables this time and use this defense against its Board of Directors.For example, in response to a Board (bank cartel) refusal to approve a large price increase to customers (same bank cartel), Markit CEO could respond by having its systems engineers delay transmission of data, halting multi-billions of dollars of CDS trades.The same doomsday defense is available both to Markit and its Board should governments try open up CDS trades to any newly formed, more transparent exchange as an alternative to the opaque, more lucrative, OTC trading favored by the banks.The threat comes as a suggestion that, while imperfect, OTC trading is a known quantity. Moving CDS trading to a transparent exchange might wreak havoc on world financial markets with resulting MAD.While OTC trading might seem archaic and inefficient, it might be less vulnerable to highly leveraged ""Flash Boys"" -- high-frequency traders -- who prefer automated electronic exchanges.Also, while clearinghouse exchanges are an improvement over OTC trading as far as diffusing counterparty risk, the trade-off might be heightened ""moral hazard"" on the part of these exchanges due to insufficient ""skin in the game"" and a sense that they are ""too big to fail"".Compared to a game-theoretic approach to Markit's prospects, a financial analysis of its IPO is downright dull.Markit is very profitable, but not insanely so given its ""mother of all moats"" position. Its top line growth has slowed since the crisis of 2008. But, as a believer in the Minsky theory of the inherent instability of finance capitalism, I am confident that Markit can look forward to a ""Minsky moment"" every 10 years or so.Some analysts have said that Markit's profit levels and margins are in decline. But they are looking at GAAP figures, not EBITDA, which is on the rise.Markit has been doing a lot of investing lately in businesses outside its core. This has resulted in poor cash flow and substantial amortization that cut GAAP numbers. Markit explicitly states that it does not intend to pay a dividend in the foreseeable future.There is also the question of its incorporation in Bermuda, but the implications of this are beyond our expertise.This IPO consists of stock of existing shareholders so it will not bring in any fresh cash. But, if successful, it sets the stage for follow-on offerings that will bring in fresh cash to continue Markit's efforts to diversify through more acquisitions.It could also be part of its doomsday machine defense as by expanding its shareholder base, it can point to more innocent bystanders that will be destroyed if attacked.For example, it has been reported that the Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board plans to invest up to $450M in this IPO. Markit could use more civic-minded stockholders like this as they could rally them in defense should anti-trust regulators encroach.The IPO is slated for Wednesday, June 18, 2014 and is expected to be priced between $23 and $25 a share. At the mid-point price of $24, we have estimated that Markit's trailing price-earnings ratio will be 30. The IPO price is not cheap.But, how often do you get an opportunity to one-up Buffett by buying a moat instead of a company with a moat?The following graphs based on data provided by its F-1 statement summarize Markit's financials for the last five years.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Polk, a recognized leader in providing automotive information and analytics solutions. The $1.4 billion transaction will be funded with 10 percent equity and the remainder with cash on hand, cash from an existing revolver and a new bank term loan. This acquisition will give access to R.L. Polk's more than 30,000 customers worldwide.IHS President and Chief Executive Officer Scott Key said in a statement that the acquisition will bring extensive and complementary information and analytical solutions, which will position IHS as a vital strategic partner of the global automotive value chain.

This division is the primary source of vehicle history information for cars operating in the US and Canada.Fundamental AnalysisRevenues growth:(Click to enlarge)The company provides a comprehensive collection of essential technical information to capital-intensive industries, which is very difficult to replicate. This gives the company strong pricing power that has contributed to organic sales growth. This is the reason the company managed to generate higher revenues over the period of five years, with a CAGR of 16.03 percent. A slight drop in operating margins was due to the distressed economic conditions in the United States.Consistent growth in Profits:(Click to enlarge)The chart above shows the company's net income and its earnings per share over the period of five years. The company was able to generate consistent growth in net income, represented by the linear trend line, with a CAGR of 12.4 percent. The decline in net income in2011 was due to U.S. economic conditions. The company posted earnings per share of 2.37 in 2012, compared to 1.57 in 2008, at a CAGR of approximately 11 percent, respectively.Strong Assets growth:(Click to enlarge)This graph indicates growth of the company's total assets over the five-year period. Since 2008 you can see a consistent growth in total assets, with a CAGR of 25.38 percent, due to its series of acquisitions.

So the company adds value to its shareholders through organic growth and acquisitions. The acquisition of R.L. Polk will help the company to build its stake in the automotive industry by complementing its existing automotive products, which will open up large adjacent markets for the company. Most importantly, the continued growth and transformation of the automotive industry through the next decade, led by global growth in light vehicle demand, technological changes and the transformation of the OEM supply chain, will generate strong growth in demand for data, research and analytics to support investment decisions.

The whisper number is $1.21, ten cents ahead of the analysts estimate. IHS has a 70% positive surprise history (having topped the whisper in 14 of the 20 earnings reports for which we have data).The average price movement (starting at next market open) within ten trading days of all earnings reports is -0.5%. The strongest price movement of -0.7% comes within ten trading days when the company reports earnings that beat the whisper number, and -1.7% within twenty trading days when the company reports earnings that miss the whisper number (negative reactor).Earnings history:- Beat whisper: 14 qtrs - Met whisper: 1 qtrs - Missed whisper: 5 qtrsIn the comparable quarter last year the company reported earnings three cents ahead of the whisper number. Following that report the stock realized a 7.7% gain in five trading days. Enter your expectation and view more earnings information here.Knowing how likely a stock's price will move following an earnings report will help you make better trades. Many investors believe that beating or missing the whisper number has the greatest impact on stock movement. If the number is exceeded, the stock is rewarded and prices move higher.

Unlike the analysts estimate, the 'whisper number' from WhisperNumber.com has actually been proven to have a greater impact on stock movement.************************************Since 1998, WhisperNumber.com has been tracking and publishing 'crowd sourced estimates' for earnings.

We also have two independent academic studies supporting the premise that investor expectations for quarterly earnings (our whisper numbers) provide greater returns when used as an investment vehicle, and have a greater impact on stock movement than analysts consensus estimates.A company's 'price reaction' to the whisper number expectation is the key - on average companies that exceed the whisper are 'rewarded', while companies that miss are 'punished' following an earnings report.According to the Wall Street Journal, ""positive surprises are becoming so common they are nearly universal. They are predetermined in a cynical tango-clinch between companies and the analysts who cover them. All the numbers are gamed at this point"".

881201,25791,2012-09-21T14:06:01-04:00,,"IHS Inc. Cl A (IHS) reports preliminary financial results for the quarter ended 2012-08-31.IHS Inc. Cl A recently reported its preliminary financial results based on which we provide a unique peer-based analysis of the company. CapitalCube's analysis is based on the company's performance over the last twelve months (unless stated otherwise).IHS Inc. Cl A's analysis versus peers uses the following peer-set: Thomson Reuters Corporation (NYSE:TRI), McGraw-Hill Cos. (MHP), Reed Elsevier N.V. ADS (NYSE:ENL), MSCI Inc. (NYSE:MSCI), Gannett Co. Inc. (NYSE:GCI) and Morningstar Inc. (NASDAQ:MORN). The table below shows the preliminary results along with the recent trend for revenues, net income and returns.Valuation DriversIHS Inc. Cl A's current Price/Book of 4.8 is about median in its peer group. The market expects IHS Inc. to grow faster than the median of its chosen peers (PE of 55.8 compared to peer median of 22.0) and to improve its current ROE of 9.4% which is below its peer median of 13.4%. Thus, the market seems to expect a turnaround in IHS Inc.'s current performance.The company's asset efficiency (asset turns of 0.5x) and net profit margins of 9.3% are both median for its peer group. IHS Inc.'s net margin is its lowest relative to the last five years and compares to a high of 14.0% in 2009.Economic MoatThe company has achieved better revenues growth than its chosen peers (year-on-year change in revenues of 23.3%) but its earnings growth performance has been below the median (change in annual reported earnings of -4.3% compared to the peer median of 0.8%). This suggests that, compared to its peers, the company is focused more on top-line revenues. IHS Inc. is currently converting every 1% of change in revenue into -0.2% change in annual reported earnings.IHS Inc.'s return on assets is now less than its peer median (4.3% vs. peer median 6.2%) in contrast to its returns over the past five years which were around the peer median (7.1% vs. peer median 7.2%). Recent performance suggests that the company's historical competitive advantage is slipping away.The company's gross margin of 58.5% is around peer median suggesting that IHS Inc.'s operations do not benefit from any differentiating pricing advantage. In addition, IHS Inc.'s pre-tax margin is less than the peer median (11.1% compared to 16.4%) suggesting relatively high operating costs.Growth & Investment StrategyIHS Inc. has grown its revenues faster than its peers (16.2% vs. 6.8% respectively for the past three years). The market also sees relatively higher long-term growth prospects for the company, giving it a better than peer median PE ratio of 55.8. Overall, we classify the company's growth prospects as superior relative to its peers.IHS Inc.'s annualized rate of change in capital of 34.6% over the past three years is greater than the peer median of 16.9%. However, this investment level has only generated a peer median return on capital of 10.6% averaged over the same three years. This median return on an above median capital investment suggests the company is over-investing.Earnings QualityIHS Inc.'s net income margin for the last twelve months is around the peer median (9.3% vs. peer median of 11.3%). This average margin combined with a level of accruals that is around peer median (13.3% vs. peer median of 11.4%) suggests there possibly isn't too much accrual movement flowing into the company's reported earnings.IHS Inc.'s accruals over the last twelve months are positive suggesting a buildup of reserves. However, this level of accruals is also around the peer median and suggests the company is recording a proper level of reserves compared to its peers.Trend ChartsCompany ProfileIHS, Inc. provides information and insight in critical areas that shape business landscape, including energy and power; design and supply chain; defense, risk, and security; environment, health, and safety; sustainability; country and industry forecasting; and commodities, pricing, and cost.

(IHS) reported adjusted earnings after the bell today of $0.97 per share beating estimates of $0.94 by three cents, revenue was up 20% year-over-year to $387 million, slightly above estimates. Description of IHS business from the company:The company slightly raised EPS guidance of $3.88 to $4.01 for the full year, on revenue of $1.53 to $1.58 billion, this compares to current analyst estimates of $3.97 on revenue of $1.55 billion. The stock is selling off about 5.5% in after hours going into the conference call, I believe because of guidance being a little light compared to estimates. However the company said it would have raised guidance further if not for headwinds the company is facing in foreign exchange rates and after the call the stock had recoved some down only 4.1%. IHS had traded up 1.4% to $105.84 per share on almost twice average volume during the day today. The company also announced that Conscientia Investment Limited will be selling 8 million shares, more than half their stake in a secondary offering. The company will not raise any money in this sale, and the sale is so Conscientia can raise money. The company believes this will improve liquidity in the stock.The stock has been a winner, up about 50% from the lows late last summer, and is fully valued trading at 22 times forward earnings with long-term growth estimates of 17%. At $106 the stock has reached analyst price targets; however it is still rated as a buy.IHS believes that global economy will continue to face challenges and uncertainty over the remainder of this year and into 2013. However the company's products are in demand as its customers attempt to navigate this uncertainty and its products are a very small part of its customer's total expediters. The fact that EMEA revenue increased 19% in the quarter and EBITDA was up 26% was positive given the difficulties in Europe.The chart of IHS has looked exceptional over the past 9 months and the 50DMA has provided key support on this uptrend. Today the 50 day is at $99.25 and if the move down after this earnings release comes down to test that level that could prove to be a jumping point for the next move higher.Data sourced from: Company filings, and Yahoo!Finance.

1493062,25120,2013-06-11T03:59:00-04:00,,"Shares of IHS jumped up in Monday's trading session following the announcement that it will acquire R.L. Polk & Co.Investors react favorably to the highly strategic acquisition which IHS made at a favorable price, even when one excludes the sizable synergy estimates. Despite the excellent deal, shares of IHS offer not enough appeal to my taste on the back of premium valuation multiples.The DealIHS announced that it has signed a definitive agreement under which it will acquire R.L. Polk, a leader in providing automotive information and analytics solutions.IHS will pay $1.4 billion for the company of which 10 percent will be financed with new equity. The remainder will be financed with cash on hand, revolving facilities or new bank loans.Combined, IHS is better positioned to provide its services to the automotive industry, establishing its position as a vital strategic partner for the worldwide automotive industry.R.L. Pork is generating annual revenues of around $400 million, while growing at a rate in the mid to high single digits. Attractive is highly recurring nature of its revenue streams and high renewal rates of around 90%. Adjusted EBITDA margins for the company are in their mid-twenties, creating solid free cash flows.As such the deal values IHS at around 3.5 times annual revenues and roughly 14 times adjusted EBITDA.The deal will be significantly accretive to 2014's earnings per share and the transaction is subject to customary closing conditionsValuationIHS ended its first quarter of its fiscal 2013 with $318.7 million in cash and equivalents. The company operates with $1.05 billion in short and long term debt, for a net debt position of just above $700 million. Following the closure of the deal, the net debt position is expected to approach the $2 billion mark.IHS has guided for full year revenues of $1.66-$1.73 billion, driven by a 5-7% increase in organic sales. Adjusted EBITDA are expected to come in between $540 and $582 million, with adjusted earnings per share expected to come in between $4.23 and $4.43 per share.The market currently values IHS at around $7.1 billion. This values the company at around 4.2 times annual revenues and roughly 25 times adjusted earnings. GAAP earnings are expected to come in a bit lower.IHS does currently not pay a dividend.Some Historical PerspectiveThe growth strategy of IHS is largely dependent on strategic acquisitions, which has created a lot of value for shareholders in recent times. Shares rose from levels around $20 in 2006 to highs of $70 in 2008. After correcting to their low thirties during the crisis shares have steadily risen to highs of $120 in 2012. Shares are currently exchanging hands at $110 per share.Between 2009 and 2012, IHS has grown its annual revenues by a cumulative 60% to $1.53 billion. Net earnings have risen some 25% in the meantime to $158 million over the past year.Investment ThesisThe acquisition of R.L. Polk marks the latest in a string of over 50 acquisitions in recent years. The most interesting asset of Polk is its Carfax service, which compiles vehicle history reports and made up roughly 60% of Polk's annual revenues.The deal multiples seem rather favorable. IHS is able to buy Polk's business at 3.5 times annual revenues which is roughly a 15% discount from its own valuation at 4.2 times annual revenues.Note that adjusted earnings reported by IHS come in around 33% of total revenues, compared to a level in the mid-twenties for Polk. IHS is confident that it can boost margins to similar levels in the near future. Interesting as well is that IHS will only dilute its shareholder base by 2% by financing the majority of the deal with debt. Solid operating cash flows should bring its debt levels to more acceptable levels shortly.While executed at a fair price, the deal is of a highly strategic nature. IHS hopes to replicate Carfax's business model in other countries and take advantage of the expanding used car markets around the world. Besides the revenue and strategic synergies the financial details are sound as well.Within six quarters, IHS could generate free cash flows exceeding $500 million per annum, or little over three times the price tag of the deal. The fixed cost base of Carfax allows IHS to achieve significant operating leverage and achieve mid-thirties operating margins going forwards. A roughly 10% improvement in margins implies annual synergies of around $40 million, justifying the price tag to a great extent.Despite the excellent deal, shares are still valued at premium valuation multiples. Following the deal, IHS is valued at little over 3.5 times annual revenues and roughly 35 times GAAP earnings. While the deal itself is excellent and will most likely create a lot of value, the stand-alone valuation of IHS was too high to begin with to initiate a long position.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

663791,23502,2012-06-17T03:41:57-04:00,,"by Michael Corty, CFAWe believe IHS (IHS) has a wide economic moat as the company faces minimal direct competition and has pricing power based on its must-have information to locked-in customers. We think IHS is one of the most intriguing growth stories in our coverage universe, as it has continuously increased wallet share from its existing capital-intensive clients, especially those in the energy industry. Energy and natural resources firms account for about half of total sales and the information and analysis (especially proprietary databases) provided to these customers represent the widest portion of the economic moat. With the shares sitting just above our $100 fair value estimate, we view IHS as a great growth company to keep on the radar screen, but not cheap enough to put new money to work.IHS provides information and insight to a diverse customer base. The firm has more than 5,500 employees, including 1,400 researchers and 1,400 data transformation specialists, serving tens of thousands of customers and hundreds of thousands of end users in more than 165 countries. We estimate that customers in the energy and natural resources industry contribute about 50% of overall sales. The company focuses on six capital-intensive industries: energy and natural resources; government, defense, and security; chemicals; transportation; manufacturing; and technology, media, and telecom.The company's information and services are used to facilitate decision-making, support key processes, and improve productivity. IHS adds value by aggregating, managing, updating, and packaging the information specifically to meet the demands of its clients. The company pulls together data from hundreds of private industry and government sources with the help of an informal global network. IHS' industry experts continuously update and verify the accuracy of data.IHS Has Carved a Wide Economic Moat We view switching costs as high for IHS customers. The company provides a comprehensive collection of vital technical information, which is very difficult--and with some products, impossible--to replicate. This gives the company strong pricing power that has helped contribute to average organic sales growth of about 10% during the past decade, according to management (as the period predates its 2005 initial public offering).About 77% of sales are generated through annual subscriptions. IHS has long-standing relationships with its clients and achieves a nearly 100% renewal rate with its top 1,000 customers. Renewal rates are high, as IHS' software, data, and analytics are often embedded in the customers' work flow. Moreover, the firm does not have a substantial competitor that can offer a similar breadth of services. It surveys hundreds of thousands of users of its products, and 49% of those customers say IHS has no competitors, while the other 51% list 1,100 competitors in total, with no competitor named more than four times.A single competitor would be hard-pressed to match the breadth and depth of IHS' information. IHS is not the only energy information provider, but it is generally the only company offering the specific information and analytics that it specializes in, which happens to be crucial for everyday decision-making.We estimate that customers in the energy and natural resources industries account for roughly 50% of total company sales, and we think the information and analysis (especially the proprietary databases) provided to these customers represent the widest portion of the economic moat. The firm's energy products and services encompass exploration and production of hydrocarbons, from distribution to power generation to consumption. IHS owns production information on more than 90% of the world's oil and gas wells (which dates back to the 1800s) and continuously adds current, real-time data. The oil and gas well data include comprehensive geological information on more than 4 million current and historical wells around the world. Additionally, IHS maintains energy activity data that include comprehensive current and future seismic, drilling, and development activities in more than 180 countries.While data aggregation, creation, and collection are the core of IHS' value proposition, analytical tools and consulting services are an expanding part of the mix. For the major oil companies with resources to try to capture global energy info outside their own assets, the relatively small amount they pay IHS does not make it worth the hassle to do it themselves.Energy Information and Analytics Are IHS' Crown Jewels IHS' data are virtually impossible to replicate, and the value of IHS' energy information and analysis is increasing. Historical oil and gas production data help geologists with clues about current projects. Understanding the historical production of an oil well helps in solving the puzzle of how much oil might still be left in the ground in a specific target area. IHS is tracking about 90% of the world's oil production across 4.6 million wells in more than 100 countries and has production data going back to the mid-1800s.The firm's oil and gas well data include as many as 20,000 elements, including geological information, permit and drilling activity, and completion records. An infrastructure database provides location, capacity, and ownership on oil and gas facilities. Decision and support tools integrate all of these databases onto customer workstations, allowing the end user to model potential drilling costs, project economics, and potential transportation issues.IHS also has long-standing client relationships in other capital-intensive industries like aerospace and defense, construction, electronics, and automotive. We believe IHS has carved out unique niches in these categories, mostly through acquisitions that its energy customers initially suggested. Customers subscribe to IHS' products and services across categories, as they prefer to deal with as few vendors as possible.CEO Plays a Major Role in the Success of IHSWe think Jerre Stead has played a key role in transforming IHS during the past decade. He was invited to join IHS' board in 2001 when the foreign-based private company was in bad shape; it was generating negative cash flow and was grossly inefficient despite its valuable set of assets. Stead eventually became chairman, fired the entire management team except the CFO, and put a new team in place, drawing from a wide network of people he had mentored in past leadership roles.We credit Stead with the firm's disciplined acquisition strategy as well as getting IHS started on improving its infrastructure and customer-facing platforms more than six years ago. Stead put IHS on the path to having world-class systems, infrastructure, and customer interfaces and believes the firm has reached about 80% of its goal. IHS made efforts to improve the systems, as before the 2005 IPO it had never spent much on infrastructure. The company has put in place a common salesforce automation system; at one point, it had 63 billing systems around the world and 21 general ledger systems. Additionally, the company is almost done merging 34 customer-care centers into 3 global centers. By 2013, IHS will complete its goal of combining 69 datacenters into just 3.Improving the Customer Experience Bolsters IHS' Entrenchment IHS' information and analytics are extremely difficult to replicate, but IHS has further separated itself from potential competitors by investing in better customer interfaces. A recent and important example is IHS Connect, a dashboard that allows customers to access databases and analytics with a single login. IHS Connect also has a version that works on the iPad. Aside from creating a better customer experience, it should drive more upsell in future years as most users subscribe to only one third of available products and previously never had an integrated way of seeing the full product menu. Before IHS Connect, customers accessing different information would have to navigate through distinct applications. IHS Connect is open-source, which allows customers to pull in other non-IHS data; this is an example of how IHS is ingrained as a part of a client's work flow. The company will roll out versions for other categories like chemicals and automotive within the next year.Acquisitions Enhance Competitive Position Buying growth usually destroys shareholder value, and most companies are not good at it. However, IHS is an exception to the rule based on its record of the past six years. The company has walked away from deals because the price was too high, and in some instances it pulled the trigger on deals several years later when the price was more reasonable. According to management, more than 80% of acquisitions closed in the past five years have been customer-driven, in which customers wanted information not already in IHS' portfolio. We view the firm's acquisitions as a form of capital expenditure or reinvesting for growth.The company has a small merger and acquisition group that handles all aspects of deals, from due diligence through integration. Several baseline criteria must be met for IHS to take serious interest in a business. The deal has to build on IHS' existing offerings and have a simple business model, but most important, the culture has to fit. For IHS, culture means no sense of entitlement among management or key personnel running the target business. It typically buys smaller companies that have a particular product or service that fills a gap. We like the fact that IHS does not use bankers and does not participate in auctions.IHS Can Continue Its Run of Strong Organic Revenue Growth Seventy-five percent of IHS' revenue comes from its 1,000 largest accounts, and the company estimates that it is about 20%-30% penetrated in those accounts today. We think the company can achieve 8%-10% organic revenue growth over the next five years, even without the help of a robust macroeconomic backdrop. At first glance, our forecast may seem aggressive given that the company claims to have already generated 10% organic sales growth on average during the past 10 years. However, we believe IHS will be able to pull on several levers to retain its strong growth. The company should be able to attain a few percentage points from wallet share, getting existing clients to buy more of its current offerings. We think it has 3%-5% worth of pricing power and can gain another few percentage points of growth from rolling out new products.IHS Is on Our Short List in the Event of a Price Pullback Our discounted cash flow-based fair value estimate of $100 implies forward fiscal-year price/earnings of 25 times, enterprise value/EBITDA of 18 times, and a free cash flow yield of 3.3%. We expect acquisitions to help the firm achieve 17% sales growth in fiscal 2012, and we forecast sales to increase at a 10% average annual clip through fiscal 2016. We think the premium relative multiples for IHS are justified based on the company's dominant competitive position and strong growth prospects.Our five-year organic growth projection sits at the low end of management's long-term goal of 9%-15%, as we assume some economic slowdown occurring over the next five years and we view the nonsubscription portion of sales (23% of total) as somewhat cyclical. Still, IHS' organic revenue growth has proved to be recession-resistant in the past, driven by organic subscription growth. We believe IHS' energy domain (about half of sales) will be the major driver of organic sales dollar growth as customers--which include major global energy producers--spend more on exploration and production information as well as tangent services over time. However, we think some of its much smaller offerings, such as those in environmental sustainability, are likely to grow at faster clip than the overall business.We expect margins on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (which includes stock compensation expense) to reach 28.8% by 2016 and average about 27% through 2016, higher than the 23% EBITDA margin posted in the fiscal year ended November 2011. We're confident IHS can achieve 120 basis points of margin expansion, on average, through 2016. Management's baseline margin expansion goal is 100-150 basis points per year. The company talks about profitability in terms of adjusted EBITDA, which among other minor items does not include stock compensation expense, which historically has hovered around 6.5% of sales. If we assume stock comp expense stays at 6.5% of sales, our 2016 EBITDA margin forecast excluding stock comp expense is 35.3%.Disclosure: Morningstar licenses its indexes to certain  ETF and ETN providers, including BlackRock, Invesco, Merrill Lynch,  Northern Trust, and Scottrade for use in exchange-traded funds and  notes.

LLC; RBS Securities Inc; RBC Capital Markets, LLC; TD Securities LLC; and UBS Investment Bank will attempt to reinvigorate the stock through the release of positive research beginning with expiration of the quiet period.Several academic studies support the above hypothesis.The Journal of Finance (VOL. LVIII, NO. 1; 2003) describes how purchases made by experienced investors in anticipation of positive analyst reports can lead to rising share prices days before the quiet period has expired.Lead author Dan Bradley, PhD, CFA, affiliated with the University of South Florida, and colleagues explain that analysts immediately initiate coverage for 76% of firms at the conclusion of the quiet period, nearly always with a ""Buy"" or ""Strong Buy"" rating. Firms with coverage initiated enjoy abnormal positive returns of 4.1% two days before and two days after initiation.The work of Carter, Piwowar, and Strader (2001) supports Bradley's conclusions, finding that the mean analyst rating at the expiration of the quiet period is a ""Buy,"" with higher returns correlated to higher ratings. Returns have also been found to increase significantly when coverage is initiated by more than one analyst-to 6.4%.The early purchases create a perception of increasing demand, leading share prices to rise ahead of the expiration of the quiet period and providing a short-term buying opportunity.Bradley et al also note a significant correlation between the reputation and number of IPO underwriters and a rise in share prices with the conclusion of the quiet period.The data generated over our past three years of research align with these academic publications.The Market For MRKT: An Overview of The Financial Information IndustryMRKT provides financial information services and products like trading and valuation services, pricing and reference data, indices, enterprise software, and trade referencing.

210801,20568,2010-06-18T13:58:02-04:00,,"IHS Inc. (IHS) recently posted fiscal 2010 second-quarter earnings of $38.5 million, a growth of 20.4% from $32.0 million recorded in the year-ago period, primarily driven by higher revenues and improved margins. Earnings per share came in at 60 cents, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 57 cents.IHS is one of the leading global providers of critical technical information, decision-support tools and related services to customers in a number of industries including energy, defense, aerospace, construction, electronics, and automotive. The company operates through three geographical segments: Americas, EMEA (Europe, the Middle East, Africa and India) and Asia Pacific (APAC).During the quarter, IHS recorded a 13.3% growth in revenues to $266.5 million from $235.3 million in the prior year quarter. The increase was primarily driven by organic growth, acquisitions, CERAWeek executive conference and favorable currency translations. In terms of divisions, Americas and EMEA grew 13% year-over-year each to $168.1 million and $76.4 million, respectively, while APAC segment rose by 16% to $22.0 million.Operating income in the quarter expanded 16.5% to $49.3 million from $42.3 million in the prior year quarter, while operating margin improved 50 basis points to 18.5%. IHS recorded a 17% year-over-year growth in operating income in the Americas, while EMEA and APAC segments posted an increase of 41% and 10%, respectively.At quarter-end, IHS had cash and cash equivalents of $202.8 million, compared to $172.3 million in the year-ago period.

48018,20370,2007-09-24T06:27:56-04:00,,"IHS, Inc. (IHS) handles the hottest commodity around: information. A publisher of technical documents for clients in the energy, defense, aerospace, construction, electronics, and automotive industries, the company distributes its data in several electronic formats (Internet, intranet, extranet, CD-ROM). Products such as collections of technical specifications and standards, regulations, parts data, and design guides are sold through its IHS Engineering unit. IHS also has an Energy segment that develops and delivers oil and gas industry data on exploration, development, production, and transportation activities. Here's an interesting fact about IHS: There are 58.4 million shares outstanding, and the Thyssen-Bornemisza family controls about 80% of them. Usually, when concentration is that heavy in one family, the company is in good hands because the owners are very few, and they want a good return on their investment. Having said that, look what happened to Ford. Here's another one. The company has over 55,000 customers in more than 100 countries. 75% of those customers buy only one product from IHS. There's plenty of room for cross selling here, especially since the company has many products for sale and a salesforce in place. The opportunity for revenue growth is strong. In fact, management recently changed the sales strategy from a focus on renewals to selling new products. Initially some of the sales force quit. That seems to be over now with more new and talented salespeople remaining. Back at headquarters, management is working on better efficiencies by consolidating back-office functions like information technology, human resources, and marketing. It's also looking to remove operating distinctions between the energy and engineering segments. Furthermore, it's cutting the number of data centers from 11 to 5 initially, then to 3. The big new push for the company is Asia, in particular China and India with both enjoying economic boom times. For companies looking to be part of the U.S. economy, and particularly any that would like to tap into the U.S. capital markets, IHS will be there to help with the process. Part of the increase in recent earnings has been from price bumps. IHS has seen sales increase by 35 - 40% by passing along price hikes to customers. The company will no doubt continue to do so but runs the risk of clients seeking alternatives at a lower price unless those hikes come with some additional services. IHS is fully valued, sporting a P/E of 38. It also carries a Price to Sales Ratio of more than 4. Those are high numbers, meaning investors love this stock. Maybe a little too much. With expectations priced this high, if there are any shortfalls, for whatever reason, look for this stock to pullback."

Many investors believe that beating or missing the whisper number has the greatest impact on stock movement. If the number is exceeded, the stock is rewarded and prices move higher. If the number is missed, the stock is punished and prices move lower. Unlike the analysts estimate, the ""whisper number"" from WhisperNumber.com has actually been proven to have a greater impact on stock movement.IHS Inc. (IHS): The whisper number is $0.77, four cents behind the analysts estimate. IHS has a 76% positive surprise history (having topped the whisper in 13 of the 17 earnings reports for which we have data). The average price movement (starting at next market open) within 10 trading days of these 17 earnings reports is -0.8%. The strongest price movement of -1.5% comes within 10 trading days when the company reports earnings that beat the whisper number, and -3.7% within 10 trading days when the company reports earnings that miss the whisper number (negative reactor). Last quarter the company did not have a whisper number. More earnings information can be found here.When analyzing the data collected by WhisperNumber.com, the most important aspects are how a company reacts to beating or missing the whisper number, the average post earnings price movement, and in what time frame (see link in profile to receive alerts). Since 1998, WhisperNumber.com has been tracking and publishing ""crowd sourced estimates"" for earnings. Keep in mind that trading on whispers is a technical play on market psychology, rather than a bet on a company's fundamental strengths.A company's ""reaction"" to the whisper number expectation is the key - on average companies that exceed the whisper are ""rewarded,"" while companies that miss are ""punished"" following an earnings report.All trading involves risk and the information presented is not intended to be a recommendation of any kind.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

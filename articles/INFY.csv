4381266,105526,2020-10-26T05:15:27-04:00,"Infosys posts another strong quarter featuring broad-based outperformance across the top and bottom lines.With a record deal pipeline in place, the near-term growth outlook appears bright.A strong balance sheet allows the company to weather the cycles and support the dividend.Clearing of the governance overhang should refocus investors toward the strong fundamentals.","Infosys (INFY) has run up significantly this year, but I still like the shares going forward. INFY remains a high-quality large-cap offering investors diversified exposure to the IT outsourcing space. Following a strong quarter, which saw record margins despite the COVID-19-led uncertainties, the company should continue to post steady organic growth in the upcoming quarters on the back of a record pipeline. Now that the growth gap with TCS (TTNQY) has narrowed, I see room for a re-rating as the valuation gap narrows as well.INFY posted revenue growth of 4% Q/Q on a constant currency basis, matching its closest peer TCS (4.8% Q/Q) on the back of strong traction in Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance (BFSI), Retail, and Hi-tech. The major surprise, however, was EBIT margins, which improved c. 270bps Q/Q, on higher revenue productivity, utilization, and offshoring.(Source: FQ2 ’21 Fact Sheet)The near-term outlook also looks strong, with deal wins at a historically high $3.1 billion, and with an impressive c. 86% net new contribution. The company also guided for c. 2-3% growth Y/Y (raised from the c. 0-2% Y/Y prior) in fiscal 2021 and raised EBIT margin guidance to 23-24% (up from the 21-23% prior). However, with wage hikes effective as of the start of the year, one-time incentives for junior employees in FQ3, and the reversal of temporary cost cuts, the company pointed out that 23-24% margins might not be sustainable as Infosys starts with its hike and promotion cycle.As a result, I expect INFY to revise its margin band slightly lower to c. 22% after fiscal 2021, while retaining partial cost benefits from lower travel expenses and an increasing shift toward work-from-home. However, I see steady revenue growth ahead, with EBIT margins set to return to c. 23% in fiscal 2022/2023.INFY sees strong demand ahead across digital transformation (especially cloud migration and software-as-a-service) and productivity (automation and IT infrastructure modernization). With the pace of modernization set to accelerate in the coming quarters as clients increasingly invest in technology, the ongoing vendor consolidation (as highlighted by INFY management) plays right into the hands of INFY and large-cap peers such as TCS.Notably, INFY has also recently launched Cobalt, a product that brings together its capabilities in cloud with c. 14k cloud assets and c. 200 industry cloud solutions, while also leveraging partnerships with leading SaaS, IaaS, and PaaS companies. Although management did not provide guidance on the potential revenue contribution, I do expect the product to emerge as an incremental top line driver in the upcoming quarters.At present, INFY does not expect a material shift offshore, even over the longer term, as demand is expected to increase for onsite resources (in-line with easing travel restrictions). However, COVID-19 has helped showcase INFY’s ability to implement a digital transformation, even from offshore locations, and I expect INFY to continue leveraging its flexibility in addressing client needs.On a positive note, INFY is looking to reduce its exposure to regulatory changes overseas. INFY plans to add c. 12k employees in the US over the next two years, taking the total number of domestic hires to 25k, which should help offset any impact from changes in visa rules. As c. 37% of its employees in the US are currently on visas, this would imply a significant shift in the labor composition and potential margin implications.As of quarter end, INFY had a total contract value (TCV) of c. $3.15 billion - the highest ever for the company. INFY announced 16 deal wins in FQ2, of which 11 were in the US, 4 in Europe, and 1 in the rest of the world. By vertical, six deals were in BFSI, 3 in Retail, two each in Telecom and Hi-Tech, and one each in Energy, Manufacturing, and Others.On balance, I think the strong contribution of net new deal wins in FQ2 at c. 86% (led by the Vanguard deal) is a major positive, as a higher % of net new should translate into improved revenue trends for the upcoming quarters.On the back of resilient working capital trends, operating cash flow was c. $793 million in FQ2, a c. 52% increase Y/Y. FCF of c. $674 million also grew by 70% Y/Y, reaching a record high, supported by robust collections.(Source: FQ2 ’21 Fact Sheet)Relative to net profit, this implies a c. 103% conversion, supporting a strong, cash-rich balance sheet with no debt. Not only does the balance sheet allow INFY to navigate the cycles unscathed, but it also ensures a sustainable dividend payout.Following the controversy around the whistleblower issue, INFY has suffered from a governance overhang. As a result, the company’s sustained growth relative to its peers over the previous quarters has been underappreciated. As investors shift their focus back to the fundamentals, I think there is a compelling case for the INFY valuation gap to TCS to narrow from current levels (TCS trades at c. 31x P/E vs. INFY's c. 26x P/E).Data by YCharts"

The stock shortly tumbled below 7$ a share, and it is now still around 20% short from its pre-COVID-19 levels. Infosys has a strong balance sheet, it's achieving high revenue growth, and the company is paying a small but constant dividend. I believe the risk/reward ratio is not balanced, with potential rewards slightly outweighing the low risk.SourceNote: The financial year ended on March 31st, 2020.Infosys closed the year with an extremely strong balance sheet. Cash at the end of the year was $3.6 billion and the company has practically no debt. Moreover, the company recently launched a program to be more conscious of costs and conserve cash.Despite the big cash pile, the company is not shying away from strategic acquisition opportunities. Last year, the company spent around $130 million to acquire Stater and its technology platform, while another $200 million acquisition was announced for US-based Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) partner Simplus. The latter will help to create a strategic combination set to accelerate Infosys's growth in becoming the strongest partner in the Salesforce ecosystem.Over the last year, despite the slowdown due to COVID-19 in March, revenue grew 9.8% on a constant currency basis. Particular growth was achieved in five business segments, communication, energy, utility, resources and services, manufacturing, high-tech and life sciences, which achieved recorded double-digit growth in FY20.Source: Infosys annual reportOver the last 5 years, Infosys has managed to achieve a constant YoY ~8% increase in revenue, while maintaining net profit above $2 billion for the whole period.Source: Infosys annual reportPromising signals of accelerating growth also come from the increase in the number of customers. In FY20, the number of clients increased by 10% YoY. Considering the average over the previous three years was slightly more than 5% YoY, the growth rate has almost doubled.Infosys's clients range across multiple industries and sectors. Many clients could be severely affected by the COVID-19 and this could result in an increased focus on reducing expenses and conserving cash. Companies could pause, delay or cancel some projects or reduce volumes and therefore require less assistance. For these reasons, Infosys could experience near term weakness especially in the area of discretionary spending.However, Infosys is reacting to the crisis in a proactive way. Recently, the company announced its enterprise-grade ""Return to Workplace"" solutions to help clients offer safe workplaces to employees amid the COVID-19 pandemic.Infosys will be offering a comprehensive framework based on several technologies such as cloud technology and edge computing solutions, but also contactless biometrics, screen body temperature, trace virus contraction, check for mask compliance, all to enable organizations to ensure the safety and wellness of staff are preserved.Many companies could also choose to switch their fixed costs for variable costs, laying off permanent employees while hiring large contractors such as Infosys for critical projects.Overall, Infosys could use this opportunity to capture additional growth due to the increased need for digitalization and the change in consumer behavior caused by the pandemic. Over the past 3 years, Infosys has been focused on growing the digital side of the business.Source: Infosys annual reportThis digital and core transformation could present a long-term opportunity for the company.With a P/E of 18, Infosys valuation is very reasonable. Looking at the options market, Infosys's option implied market price is slightly skewed upwards, especially in the short term, indicating that the markets are predicting slightly higher prices.Source: Optionssay.comInfosys stock price is still 20% lower than the pre-COVID-19 levels. Despite the short-term challenges, the company's balance sheet is healthy and the core business is still growing. This shift to digitalization could present a long-term opportunity for the company.

4347038,105417,2020-05-13T08:30:44-04:00,"During the quarter, revenue growth was strongly driven by digital business.
        Life Sciences vertical came in the strongest with 11.9% Y/Y revenue growth.
        There were margin pressures during the quarter and we see them continuing throughout 2020.","In this note, we provide an update on Infosys (INFY), in the aftermath of the company's earnings, as well as earnings of its core competitors, such as Cognizant (CTSH) and Epam Systems (EPAM). We were pleased that the latest earnings information continues to support our thesis, as digital strength, BPO and pricing continue to differentiate Infosys, particularly in this increasingly challenging environment. We would like to highlight the following incremental points:Revenue growth strongly driven by digital business: When we say ""strongly"" - it would be an understatement. Please consider the following figures for the most recent quarter. On a constant currency growth basis, revenue grew 6.4% Y/Y. If we stratify this growth further, we get one of the most divergent results in the history of Infosys. Digital business grew 31.7% Y/Y, while non-digital core business declined 6.6% Y/Y. Whereas digital side of things has been increasingly stronger in the last few years, we see it becoming particularly important in the stay-at-home / remote coronavirus era.Same digital reads from other firms: In fact, having recently reviewed earnings from INFY's competitors we mentioned in the introduction, we see the digital trend to be broad and established. These reads from competitors are crucial, since a lot of them work with the same clients, particularly in Financial Services, technology, and healthcare segments - those who are doing the best in the COVID era. (Recall, than a typical Fortune 500 company can be working with as many as six-eight vendors). We believe that this industry can benefit from at least 5%-10% Y/Y revenue growth rate in the digital space during 2020, but in many cases, like those of Infosys, the benefits can be much richer.Life Sciences vertical leads the way: We were pleased that the highest revenue growth among Infosys' diversified verticals came from Life Science (i.e., healthcare), at 11.9% (note, when we discuss verticals, they incorporate both digital and non-digital businesses). This performance tells us that, amidst the outbreak, leading healthcare companies, who happen to be INFY's clients, will continue to generously spend on IT Services, possibly channeling more resources than they planned initially. Hi-Tech, Manufacturing, and Utilities all north of 7% Y/Y growth: These sector are the runners up, and we believe that it's not only the digital but the cloud that is doing the trick. While SMAC is mostly Cognizant's nomenclature, standing for Social, Mobile, Analytics, and Cloud - we see precisely SMAC initiatives driving much of the demand for these three verticals. We note that 7% is a much higher average run rate for all three, so overall we see the company well positioned going into what could be a perilous year for the IT Services space. Retail weaker but still positive: At 4.2% Y/Y growth rate, we believe that the Retail business has further pressures to absorb throughout 2020. We are not talking about companies downsizing their business - we mean bankruptcies. While we have always maintained that IT Services industries are among the last ones to go, retailers are currently at the frontline of coronavirus battles, some fighting for their very existence. It is difficult to predict which ones will survive and which ones will file for Chapter 11, but it is a fair assessment that INFY is likely to lose clients on the retail side. Mild margin pressures, albeit for 2020 they may continue: During the quarter, we have seen operating margin contract by 40 bps Y/Y to 21.1% (and as much as 80 bps Q/Q). Most of this is SG&A-driven, and while these trends tend to reverse during the year, 2020 may not be one of those years. We are modeling approximately 20 bps of margin contraction on a quarterly basis for the rest of the year, projecting that INFY will end 2020 with operating margin of 20.5%.BPO remains strong: As we argued before, economic pressures (a recession or worse) will likely trigger greater need for BPO (business process outsourcing). Demand for these initiatives would likely be driven by 1) cost savings; 2) more extensive tech support; 3) easier access to cloud workstreams.We reiterate that pricing remains low: Finally, INFY continues to benefit from below-average pricing. It is true that INFY cannot compete with Epam Systems (EPAM) and Globant (GLOB) on pricing; yet, it has historically been able to offer 10-15% discounts relative to Cognizant (CTSH) and Accenture (ACN). During these times of troubles, this pricing structure should be able to preserve most of INFY's revenue base.We believe that INFY shares merit a ~17x P/E multiple on 2020 shares, which, when applied to our revised EPS estimate of $0.63 (up from $0.57), merits the new target price of $11 (up from $10). In our view, this multiple remains fairly conservative, and it is only the coronavirus uncertainty that is holding us back from assigning an 18x multiple.Infosys is the Indian company that focuses on business consulting, information technology and outsourcing services. It is the second largest Indian company in this space, after Tata Consultancy. Its main competitors are Cognizant, Accenture, and IBM (consulting and outsourcing arms) in the US, and Capgemini in Europe. The company has a wide outreach across major industry verticals, which we discuss above.Cyber risks: We cannot overemphasize the danger of cyber risks, particularly for non-US players, such as INFY, where security systems are often exposed. In our view, this is the number one threat, even beyond macro concerns.Macro risks: Consulting business is almost entirely dependent on strong economy, which makes the risk of economic downturn especially relevant. However, the upside is that during rough economic times there are better outsourcing opportunities."
4323661,101421,2020-02-12T19:54:17-05:00,"Infosys said it will acquire Simplus for an undisclosed sum.Simplus has developed a Salesforce platform consulting practice with special expertise in serving quote-to-cash software engagements.The deal provides INFY with additional capacity in the growing area of quote-to-cash software consulting.However, INFY's stock appears fully valued so my bias is Neutral.","Infosys (INFY) has announced the proposed acquisition of Simplus for an undisclosed amount.Simplus has developed a cloud software consulting practice for companies in the U.S. and Australia.With the deal, INFY is moving to add capabilities in the hot quote-to-cash software consulting space, but INFY stock appears fully valued and the firm faces economic headwinds in its host country of India, so my bias on the stock is Neutral.Salt Lake City, Utah-based Simplus was founded to provide digital transformation consulting services to companies on the Salesforce platform. The firm has special expertise in the areas of Quote-to-Cash applications.Management is headed by co-founder and CEO Ryan Westwood, who was previously CEO at PcCareSupport and a Director at Workfront.Below is an overview video of the firm's Salesforce practice:Source: SimplusSimplus’s primary offerings include:The firm counts more than 2,000 clients across a range of technology-enabled industries.Investors have invested at least $49.3 million and include Kensington Capital Ventures, University Growth Fund, Salesforce Ventures, Savano Capital Partners, EPIC Ventures, and Cross Creek.According to a 2019 market research report by Zion Market Research, the global market for subscription and billing management will reach an estimated $10.5 billion by 2025.This represents a forecast CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) of 15.5% from 2019 to 2025.The main drivers for this expected growth are the increasing adoption by enterprises of subscription, billing and quote-to-cash software systems in order to maximize efficiencies and keep up with demand from e-commerce-based systems.Infosys didn’t disclose the acquisition price and terms and didn’t file a Form 8-K, so the deal was likely for a financially non-material amount.Management also didn’t provide a change in financial guidance as a result of the proposed transaction.A review of the firm’s most recent published financial results indicate that as of December 31, 2019, Infosys had $2.85 billion in cash and trading asset securities and $3.5 billion in total liabilities and no long-term debt.Free cash flow for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, was $1.9 billion.In the past 12 months, Infosys’s stock price has risen 1.7% vs. the U.S. IT industry’s rise of 35.6% and the U.S. overall market index’ growth of 20.3%, as the INFY chart indicates below:Source: Simply Wall St.Earnings surprises versus analyst consensus estimates have been positive in eight of the last twelve quarters, as the chart shows below. Notably, the four negative surprises have occurred since Q4 2018:Source: Seeking AlphaBelow is a table of relevant capitalization and valuation figures for the company:Source: Company FinancialsBelow is an estimated DCF (Discounted Cash Flow) analysis of the firm’s projected growth and earnings:Assuming the above generous DCF parameters, the firm’s shares would be valued at approximately $10.90 versus the current price of $11.19, indicating they are potentially currently fully valued, with the given earnings, growth and discount rate assumptions of the DCF.INFY is acquiring Simplus to add its quote-to-cash Salesforce consulting expertise and focus to its capabilities.As Infosys COO Pravin Rao stated in the deal announcement,The deal by itself won’t move INFY’s stock price, but the quote-to-cash sector is a hot area of focus for technology consulting firms, as clients want to gain cloud efficiencies to automate and improve their sales to collection processes across the enterprise.The quote-to-cash software industry is growing from a confluence of factors such as the continued transition of businesses to the cloud and increasing reliance on e-commerce channels for generating revenue.Assuming INFY didn’t overpay for Simplus, the deal makes strategic sense.However, INFY’s stock price appears to be fully valued based on generous assumptions in the DCF analysis above.The firm faces a difficult economic environment in India as the country’s growth has dropped recently.Absent significant revenue or earnings growth, my bias on INFY is Neutral."
4316534,105417,2020-01-13T13:52:10-05:00,"There were mixed quarter results, but overall investors chose to focus on the positives.
        Digital came in particularly strong and there are solid prospect for consulting and outsourcing segments.
        The investigation overhang has been somewhat mitigated, but we expect more noise to continue.","In this article, we review INFY's latest earnings, commenting on the company's recent improvements, as well as the steps forward for 2020. Recall, INFY is the Indian company that focuses on business consulting, information technology and outsourcing services. Infosys competes with Wipro, Tata, Cognizant, and Accenture, among other players. IT Services is a very fragmented space, which makes it very difficult to analyze. Therefore, any data points that emerge after earnings results are helpful to gain further insights about the company and the industry as a whole. Please see our most recent Article on INFY. In the present article, we are upping our price target and reaffirming our Bullish thesis. We value Infosys in the peer group that includes many players from the fragment IT services space (which specifically focuses on outsourcing and consulting): Accenture, Cognizant, Sapient, IBM, Capgemini, Globant, EPAM, Wipro, and Tata Consultancy, among others. We find that on 2020 earnings the PE multiple of 18x remains appropriate and fairly conservative. When applied against our 2020 EPS estimate of $0.65 (up from $0.62), we get the target price of $12 (up from $11). We maintain our Bullish thesis.Positive spin on the ongoing controversy: We will start with non-financial matters, since this is the most obvious elephant in the room. The company resolutely stated that they have conducted an internal audit-related investigation that found no improprieties in their financial statements. It is unclear to us, if this overhang will go away, since there are still many questions unanswered about the financials; furthermore, the methodology of the investigation itself could be called into question since the company had a say in selecting the actual audit committee and the period they studied was largely limited to 2018-19. At present, it appears to us that INFY has scored a win in this controversy, but we don't know if more information/investigative materials will emerge in the near future. We also haven't heard much from the SEC. Hence, the company is not out of the woods just yet.Mixed quarter results: The company delivered an EPS of 15 cents, beating the Street by a penny. The revenue grew 8.4% Y/Y to $3.24 billion, beating consensus by $20 MM. While on the surface we see mixed results, neither the top line beat, nor the bottom line miss were truly meaningful. Hence, investors zoomed right past them, focusing instead on positive color of the investigation.Strong digital performance: Digital segment grew 40% Y/Y during the quarter, with the annual run rate now at $5 billion. Further, it is our understanding that going forward, the company will target 40-45% of total revenues toward the digital segment. The strong digital trend is in line with the focus of both consulting and outsourcing companies, albeit Infosys is a clear leader when it comes to the Indian competition.Consulting expectations remain solid, in line with the overall Indian demand: We are estimating 9.5% Y/Y growth for Infosys during calendar 2020, driven mainly by the European clients. We are cognizant of the fact that there were pockets of softness coming out of Europe in 2019, mainly around financial services clients. However, as the economic outlook improves and with Great Britain and Germany narrowly missing two quarters of negative GDP growth in 2019, which officially define recession, we believe that economic sentiment has improved for many large-cap companies. Outsourcing softer, but may see further tailwinds in late 2020: It is true that demand for outsourcing, especially BPO (business process outsourcing) is on a secular decline. However, we also believe that some pickup in non-BPO outsourcing is likely by August-September of this year.Dividend remains strong: We believe that the company may further up its dividend in 2020, which would take the yield closer to 2.5%, a very high bar for the IT Services companies. Cyber risks: We cannot overemphasize the danger of cyber risks, particularly for non-US players, such as INFY, where security systems are often exposed. In our view, this is the number one threat, even beyond macro concerns.Macro risks: Consulting business is almost entirely dependent on strong economy, which makes the risk of economic downturn especially relevant. However, the upside is that during rough economic times there are better outsourcing opportunities."
4313096,105417,2019-12-18T08:37:52-05:00,"Market share gains have been driving the company's revenue growth in recent quarters.
        Margin stabilization and focus on business process outsourcing should be key to delivering a solid 2020 performance.
        We see the company on track to beat its current top-line guidance.","Infosys (INFY) is the Indian company that focuses on business consulting, information technology and outsourcing services. It is the second largest Indian company in this space, after Tata Consultancy. Its main competitors are Cognizant, Accenture, and IBM (consulting and outsourcing arms) in the US, and Capgemini in Europe. The company has a wide outreach across all major verticals.We value Infosys in the peer group that includes many players from the fragment IT services space (which specifically focuses on outsourcing and consulting): Accenture, Cognizant, Sapient, IBM, Capgemini, Globant, EPAM, Wipro, and Tata Consultancy, among others. We find that on 2020 earnings the PE multiple of 18x remains appropriate and fairly conservative. When applied against our 2020 EPS estimate of $0.62, we get the target price of $11.With the company reporting earnings in early January, we share the following takeaways, based on our channel checks and reads from other IT Services companies:Market share gains: We see Infosys finally staunching its own market share bleeding and actually beginning to take market share from Wipro and Tata Consultancy. While we are unaware of specific revenue streams where these gains are taking place at present, we do believe that it is most likely focused on cloud and mobile infrastructure, where INFY has a pricing advantage. There may also be some improvements in consulting, which has been notoriously soft over the years. Margin stabilization is the key show-me-the-money story: As we maintained before, Infosys has gradually transitioned from a top-line story into a margin story. An incremental 50 bps revenue growth acceleration is arguably less important today than a similar 50 bps margin expansion. Our model calls for the EBITDA margin of 2.75% in 2020, with approximately 17-22 bps expansion on a quarterly basis (this is a 2 bps improvement since our last update). As we said before, a lot will depend on S&GA performance of the consulting business, which is always a wild card, albeit we do expect some stabilization throughout 2020.Update on the whistleblower complaint: The market took this complaint about unethical senior management practices fairly seriously and used it as a reason to sell, albeit we are still far from knowing all the details. In our view, these topics die away quickly and management would be wise to ""come clean"" and address the issue during the next earnings call in order to dissipate further uncertainty. New clients in financial services: We expect the company to be potentially targeting new European clients in banks and insurance segments, though also possibly in technology/telecom. INFY has not been aggressively targeting new European companies in 2017-2019, more relying on existing business. We see this pattern changing in the near term, as it could become a major source of revenue acceleration.Business process outsourcing is often overlooked: We see the BPO as an important revenue driver for Infosys - one that is frequently overlooked, as companies often dismiss it as a legacy offering, being more in favor of advanced SMAC solutions. However, for INFY this is actually a very strong fit, given the focus of its engineers and at least 5% Y/Y growth this segment generates. In fact - and here we go back to the market share discussion - we could see INFY potentially taking more market share from Wipro, Tata, and even Cognizant. On track to outperform 2020 guidance: We continue to view the company’s 8.5%-10% Y/Y constant currency revenue growth guidance as conservative, with our own model calling for 10.6% Y/Y revenue growth. We believe that both consulting and outsourcing will remain strong, albeit they should be growing at different rates during different quarters. However, we should reiterate our view that INFY is more of a margin story these days. We see the following business risks for Infosys:Legislative Uncertainty: Like all Indian firms with presence in the United States, Infosys heavily relies on H1-B and L-1 visas; over the last several years Congress attempted to heavily regulate the number of visa workers each company can hire.Pricing Wars: Infosys is positioned fairly well from the pricing perspective, relative to the US players, such as Cognizant and Accenture. However, within its domestic market, both Tata and Wipro are waging a pricing war on INFY, which may undercut Infosys’ business in the future.Macro Pressures: With the world economy slowing down, India is usually one of the first ones to be affected, which may in turn slow down demand for the consulting revenue (outsourcing revenue does well during downturns).Technology Risks: Like other global companies, Infosys is facing potential cyber attack risks."
4277652,105265,2019-07-25T14:24:40-04:00,"Infosys’ FY Q1 was impressive.All the right parts of the business are growing, and the company is modifying its capital allocation to the benefit of the shareholders.Margin erosion is a problem, but we believe that the management is on top of the issue.Despite the price being at an all-time high, the valuation is still attractive. It is an average price for an above-average company.","We are buyers of Infosys (INFY) at current prices. We like the operations as reflected in the impressive FY20 Q1 results. We like the healthy margin profile, high returns, impressive cash generation, and the pristine balance sheet. We are not worried about the margin erosion like the market is and believe that this is what will catalyze the price. The management is focusing on the issue and has a solid plan in place to address it. We like the generous capital allocation strategy based off of a solid pile of cash. We view the all-time high price as a market multiple for a better-than-market operation.On 7/12, Infosys announced  its Q1 FY20 earnings, and it was impressive. The company managed 12.4% constant currency (CC) YoY growth. Almost all verticals saw double-digit CC YoY growth as well as its core markets of US and Europe. EBIT margins were 20.5% as expected. The company raised its growth guidance for FY20 to 8.5-10% from the earlier 7.5-9.5% CC while maintaining its margins guidance. The results are particularly impressive, considering the global macro environment.Infosys also adjusted its capital allocation. They will now return (dividends + buybacks) 85% of annual free cash flow to shareholders cumulatively for a five-year period, up from 70% previously.The company announced $2.7 bn in large deal signings, which was a record. One must consider, however, that this number was probably largely helped by the company’s recently acquired 75% stake in Stater from ABN AMRO (OTCPK:ABNRY).The Digital segment was the highlight of the quarter, growing at 42% YoY in CC and now makes up ~36% of all revenues. This is impressive growth, considering that it's off of a sizeable base.Before diving into the valuation, let’s assess what we’re paying for. Thanks to the Digital segment, one can consider Infosys a growth company. It has achieved +7% growth every year for the last 3 years. With healthy margins of ~34% gross, ~25% EBITDA, and ~19% net, Infosys is very profitable. Returns are also stellar with its 26% ROE and 36% ROIC. The company has never been cash flow negative and generated ~$2bn in free cash flow in FY2019. The company is extremely cash generative. Cash conversion (defined as operating cash flow/EBITDA) is high and steady with it coming in at 76%, 77%, and 76% for the past 3 years. This is reflected in the balance sheet with a ~$3.8 bn net cash position, providing the source for the shareholder friendliness.It is psychologically difficult to buy at an all-time high. But the valuation is reasonable, particularly considering the dynamics above. The company is trading at 22.3x TTM P/E vs. 24.5x for its sector and 22.4x for the market, and 15.6x TTM EV/EBITDA vs. 13.9x for its sector. We find here, a quality growth company trading near market multiples. We are happy to pay an average price for an above-average company and urge investors to do so as well.One major issue that Infosys needs to address going forward is its declining margins. The company has historically not managed to grow well and increase profitability simultaneously. In the recent years, it traded the former for the latter. In the past 3 years, its gross and EBITDA margins fell ~3%, and its net margin fell ~2%. The company needs to halt the bleeding.Management commentary on the earnings call showed that they were in control of the situation. Infosys management stated that its investments in sales, localization, and digital, among other things, are mostly behind it and that the company will begin to collect the fruits of the investments going forward. Management also drags attention to its growth flagship Digital segment and the segment's healthy margin profile. Management assures that the Digital segment will stabilize company margins with its large size and rapid growth. The management also highlighted its clear focus on operational efficiency and cost management. We believe that the growth of Digital, combined with cost-control efforts, will stabilize margin erosion in the near term and that Digital growth will bring margin expansion the longer term.Infosys is using its massive pile of cash to the shareholders' benefit. The company has purchased ~2.5% of its stock annually over the past years and has a steady dividend. With the newly allocated 85% of free cash flow going to investors, one can expect the already healthy distribution to grow. Infosys has a solid 2.18% dividend yield at a healthy 47% payout ratio with a 5-year annual dividend growth rate above 20%. One should expect a larger part of the returns to go to dividends going forward and be more efficient as equity prices broadly are quite high.The street isn’t buying what Infosys is selling, and this is an opportunity. Currently, analysts have a hold rating on the company most likely due to margin erosion issues. As many investors decide by reading analyst reports, many investors are probably market weight Infosys. If the company executes well in terms of margin protection/growth via its digital segment and its cost-control efforts, analysts should begin to turn thus pulling in new capital. The trend has already begun with consensus rating score rising to 2 from 1.87 in the past month.Source: MarketbeatThe demand environment plays a critical role as is the case in all advisory business. In times of trouble, Infosys can see slowing demand for its consulting units. It can also see sporadic bursts in discretionary projects creating upside potential.Margins are a hot topic as mentioned above. Lowering in the margin profile of the digital segment or new projects with poor margins could hurt the overall margins and scare investors. The margin story can boost both ways as better-than-expected margins would remove the main investor worry regarding Infosys and cause a re-rating of the stock. This is one area to watch.Infosys utilizes foreign consultants in developed markets. An adverse legal ruling for foreign workers would significantly disrupt its consulting business.Infosys’ operations are short INR vs. USD. Historically, this has benefited it, with the Rupee continuously depreciating vs. the USD. Going forward, this FX exposure could benefit or harm Infosys’ financials."

Looking at the fundamental and the technical picture, I believe it is better to wait for undemanding entry points in this stock.Source: Business StandardThe company is attempting to stage a turnaround by investing in digital services and is making efforts to arrest the high attrition rate of 20.4 percent (annualized consolidated) by increasing salaries to retain talent and do more local hiring in its biggest market, the U.S.I believe that after the latest earnings, some price target cuts will be announced by analysts and moderate the valuations which currently seem high to me. At a PE (TTM) of 21.10, the stock is overpriced and does not offer the margin of safety which an investor should seek in a long-term story.Some of the fundamental charts, available here on SA, indicate that the company's business metrics have been on a downhill for the last five years. The gross margin, EBIT margin and Net Income margin have been on decline since 2015. Any intelligent investor would want to wait for these core numbers to start stabilizing before he puts his money to work, even if it means waiting for a couple of quarters or more. That the company is facing growth challenges can be gauged from the fact that it cut FY19 EBIT margin guidance a year ago and slashed FY18 revenue growth guidance in October 2017. They are highly uninspiring events.Source: Seeking AlphaThe spreadsheet below clearly illustrates that the last 3-5 years have been slow growth years with an EPS CAGR of 4.33% over 3 years and 5.98% over 5 years. Net income over the last 3 years has grown at a compounded rate of just 2.77 percent annually. The revenue growth rate has remained in single digits and is always susceptible to cuts.Source: Seeking AlphaFor a company that has been struggling to expand its margins while its closest competitor Tata Consultancy Services (OTCPK:TTNQY) continues to outperform Street expectations, the PE ratio of 21 seems lofty. The current PE is closer to the 5-year highs and the normalized PE ratio (TTM) chart below indicates that it has never been a good buy zone.Data by YChartsThe multi-year Infosys monthly price chart below indicates that we are trading close to the dot-com highs. In the face of weaker growth in FY20, I would not recommend buying Infy at these levels. The run-up in Infy in the last year or so occurred partly due to the Indian Rupee depreciating against the U.S. dollar which led market participants to believe that the company would post better numbers with the currency tailwind. The company's performance has been muted thus far.However, the upward trendline connecting the panic bottom of 2009 with the subsequent panic bottoms reveals that the region of $8.00-$8.50 would be a good starting point.Source: TradingViewI missed out on the last panic bottom which occurred because of the tussle between the then CEO Vishal Sikka and the founding father N.R. Narayana Murthy over corporate governance issues. At that time, the stock traded at just $7 and ran up almost 60 percent since then. I was waiting for more clarity and missed the bus. I won't miss if it comes to my buy zone this time. After a 20 percent drop, I believe most of the negatives will be priced into the stock and valuations will have sobered enough for me to hold on for the long term.Hope it helps!"
4317580,105526,2020-01-17T11:12:43-05:00,"Infosys reported a largely in-line set of 3Q FY20 results but upped full-year guidance is a key positive.A major near-term overhang was cleared following the conclusion of the audit committee’s investigation into a whistle-blower complaint.The stock is trading at a governance-driven discount to peers, presenting an opportunity for long-term investors to buy into the Infosys story at a very reasonable price.","Infosys Limited (INFY) recently reported a decent set of 3Q FY20 earnings numbers - revenues grew 9.5% YoY on a constant currency basis to $3,243 million driven by robust growth in the Digital business and a robust deal pipeline at $1.8bn (+ 16% YoY). While Infosys underwhelmed on margins (EBIT margins came in at 21.9%, down 105 bps YoY), the raised top line guidance for FY20 to 10%-10.5% (vs. the prior 9-10%) makes this the fastest organically growing large-cap IT company in India, along with HCL (OTCPK:HCTHY).Crucially, the positive outcome of the audit committee’s inquiry into the whistle-blower allegations made against the company in October 2019 should remove a major overhang on the stock. Although the outcome of the SEC investigation is still pending, the positive findings from the audit committee review is a step in the right direction. As the overhang begins to subside, I believe Infosys is a bargain. The stock currently trades at a significant discount to its bigger competitor Tata Consulting Services (OTCPK:TTNQY) (23x FY21 PE), leaving plenty of room for further upside from multiple expansion, in addition to organic growth.INFY’s revenue for the quarter increased by 9.5% YoY on a constant currency basis to $3,243 million. While there was a robust growth of 40.8% YoY in the Digital business, where the company seems to be gaining market share, INFY’s core business continues to underperform, as revenues declined 5% YoY on a constant currency basis to $1,925 million. Organically (excluding the Stater acquisition), the company’s revenue grew at the slowest in six quarters at ~7.8% YoY, representing a material 300 bps decline from the 10.8% rate in 1H FY20.Source: Quarterly FactsheetAmong its business verticals, growth in Financial Services remained subdued at 6.2% YoY on a constant currency basis primarily due to the impact of furloughs in Europe and the rest of the world. North America, though saw sequential growth, aided by stable customer spend and new deal wins. The Financial Services vertical outlook remains bleak near term owing to macro uncertainties.The Retail vertical growth continues to be muted as well. The vertical grew 2.5% YoY and is guided to remain volatile, given its susceptibility to changes in consumer sentiments and the impact of ongoing store closures as customers shift from physical to digital commerce. Both the Financial Services and Retail make up for over 45% of INFY’s revenues; thus, the sluggish growth raises some concern about FY21 prospects.The Communication vertical continues to be a bright spot, growing at over 20% YoY due to the large deal wins by the company in the past. A sharp moderation is expected in 4Q FY20, though this is largely due to the one-off impact from the Verizon deal accounting. Additionally, despite the global weakness, the performance of INFY’s Manufacturing vertical has been commendable, rising 11.8% YoY. All the other smaller verticals also did well during the quarter with YoY growth in decent double digits, offsetting weakness in the rest of the portfolio.Source: Quarterly FactsheetDespite the favorable cross-currency impact from the 1% INR depreciation in the quarter, INFY was able to expand its EBIT margin by a lowly 20 bps QoQ to 21.9% (down 105bps YoY), raising a few concerns on the business’s underlying profitability. Positive contributors include a 10 bps gain on account of the favorable currency impact, while cost optimization measures drove an additional 50 bps gain in margins, though lower utilization detracted by ~40 bps.Utilization, excluding trainees, declined 50 bps QoQ to 84.4%, reflecting seasonal weakness, which was offset by a favorable onsite effort mix, which declined 50 bps to 27.7%. Sub-contracting costs continued to stabilize and were 7.4% in 3Q FY20, in-line with the average of the previous five quarters.Source: Quarterly FactsheetEmployee attrition remains a key concern –while attrition did decline by ~1.8% sequentially to 17.6%, with voluntary attrition even lower at 15.6%, overall attrition levels remain high at 19.6%, marginally down 30 bps YoY.Source: Quarterly FactsheetINFY’s days sales outstanding (DSOs) continued to trend higher this quarter and now stands at the highest levels in over a decade. Much of this is attributable to unbilled revenues as clients are increasingly pushing for more headroom.Source: Quarterly FactsheetThe DSO weakness comes amid weakness in pricing, which continued to remain under pressure at -0.4% for the quarter.Encouragingly, the deal pipeline remains healthy, with 14 large deals worth a combined TCV of $1.8 billion (up 16% YoY). The share of new deals increased to 32% from 10% in the previous quarter. Of the large deals in the pipeline, the majority (7) were in the Financial Services vertical, with 2 deals each in the Communication and Manufacturing verticals, as well as 1 deal each in the Retail and Utilities vertical. Geographically, 8 new deal wins were in the US, 5 in Europe, and 1 in the rest of the world. The deal outlook is strong, with a good share of large deals and new account openings across geographies, indicating little in the way of decision-making delays in the US as we near the elections.Source: Company Data and Source: Quarterly FactsheetThe results of the investigations by the audit committee (comprising independent legal counsel, Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas & Co. and PricewaterhouseCoopers) found no wrongdoings, which should begin to reverse the prevailing investor perception of INFY’s corporate governance. That said, the investigation by the SEC is still in process, though the outcome is unlikely to be much different from the findings of the audit committee. In the meantime, it has been business as usual throughout the period of investigation, and management’s business objectives remain unchanged.INFY’s cost out initiatives has seen strong progress as management remains focused on initiatives such as streamlining the onshore and offshore pyramids, improving onsite/offshore mix, driving lean and automation, among others, in an effort to achieve its target of $150 million in cost reduction for FY20.A key initiative to monitor will be the ongoing rationalization of pyramids, which should make the offshore pyramid more efficient and help reduce onshore costs (which remain a major headwind at ~45% of revenues). Notably, the current ratio of trainees at INFY is low, and higher graduate hiring in India should help rationalize the pyramid and improve margins.Additionally, the lean and automation strategy, along with efforts for a better pricing mix in the expanding digital business, should help stabilize the company’s margin profile. Notably, in the past one year, the company has automated 30-40% of delivery efforts and created over 250 automation tools, driving 22% efficiency gains in certain projects and reallocating 17% of its employees within onsite locations.Source: Analyst Meet 2019 PresentationWith regards to its other cost optimization measures, INFY’s employee engagement, employee productivity, and training platforms have helped to automate its own enterprise, while also offering them to its clients. These include “Infosys Launchpad” - onboarding new employees, “INFY ME” - personal productivity, “INFY Work” - employee productivity, and “LEX” - employee training.Source: Analyst Meet 2019 PresentationAll of these efforts have led to greater operating efficiencies, which I believe should give the company some room to increase its sales & marketing spend while achieving the mid-to-upper point of its operating margin target for FY20 of 21%-23%.The clean chit from the audit committee investigation, along with a strong FY20 outlook, should drive a gradual shift in sentiment on the stock, in my view. There are some drawbacks, for instance, the weakness in the Financial Services and Retail verticals will likely weigh on growth near term. However, the HSD growth path, coupled with the valuation discount relative to Tata Consulting Services, which has reached ~25%, makes Infosys a compelling buy, in my view. Historically, as Infosys’ growth gap vs. TCS narrowed, its discount to TCS has narrowed to less than 10%.Source: Bloomberg DataAssuming Infosys moves closer to a 20x earnings multiple – a narrower discount to TCS (~23x), Infosys stock could re-rate up ~22% higher on FY22 consensus EPS."
4185576,102683,2018-07-05T13:06:15-04:00,INFY is breaking out higher.Its operations continue to expand at an impressive pace.I am buying stock in the name.,"Infosys (INFY) is trading higher as its operations continue to expand at a healthy pace. Over the last decade, the company quickly increased both its top- and bottom-line results due to continued innovation and expansion of its digital capabilities. Its share price has similarly traded higher on the operational growth. I am buying stock in this name as its fundamental growth continues to fuel increasing investor sentiment.INFY looks attractively valued at current levels as the company further enhances its digital operations while improving productivity to meet customer demand in the current market environment.The company provides consulting, technology, and outsourcing services in North America, Europe, India, and internationally. It provides business information technology services, including application development and maintenance, independent validation, infrastructure management, and business process management services, as well as engineering services, such as engineering and life cycle solutions, and consulting and systems integration services comprising consulting, enterprise solutions, systems integration, and advanced technologies.In the most recent quarter, the company saw strong revenue growth of 9.2% year-on-year, with its financial services business growing 7.2% year-on-year. Volumes grew 1.1% while attrition increased slightly to 16.6% as compared to 15.8% in productivity. However, its high-performer attrition is significantly lower at 9.4% compared to 14.1% last quarter, signaling strong demand for its product offerings.Demand in financial services is strong in new services like digital, cloud, RPA, AI and automation, according to management. Variant budgets are being diverted from the bank and regulatory spending within bank initiatives. Banks are thus engaging with INFY strategically in digital transformation and new services, which is helping the company increase its wallet share. The company also has strong franchisees in Investment Management, Cards & Payments, and Mortgage services. INFY won several large vendor consolidation deals in Europe, with its margin pipeline healthy and pipelines for new deals showing a steady increase, according to its earnings call.In insurance, INFY has seen a tremendous growth last year. The insurance industry continues to be impacted by changing technologies and consumer behavior, with insurance companies coming under pressure to innovate fast. However, its service combination of design technology with implementation expertise meets critical needs of the insurers to modernize their digital experience. Management expects growth in the vertical driven by log-ins, new account openings, and its offerings around McCamish and NIA.Management has been focused on its digital services business, of which it already has $2.8 billion in its current portfolio, representing 25% of revenue for fiscal 2018, growing at a strong pace. This is an area management plans to invest in further. Additionally, management is applying automation and artificial intelligence to improve productivity in this area. Moreover, the company is expanding the localization in its market, especially in the U.S., building delivery centers, training centers, and hiring locals, according to its earnings call.Management is planning for further investment towards cloud adoption, infrastructure outsourcing, and transformation around digital and omni-channel. Growth in source vertical was led by ramp-up in large deal wins over last few quarters coupled with a fraction in TFM. Demand continues to be strong on the back of opportunities in newer areas like analytics and energy, IoT and communication, cybersecurity in telcos, and smart meter opportunities in utilities, according to its earnings call.The digital transformation is one of the top agenda for all clients which increases focus on customer centricity, higher satisfaction, increased loyalty, and lower cost of service, according to its earnings call. Clients are in mutual transformation to create more relevant and durable solutions in the complex world. Therefore, INFY is making significant investments in new services scaling its digital capabilities to support extreme automation and processes, organization and infrastructure modernization, enterprise agility, cybersecurity and digital experience.Below is a chart of the company's revenue and earnings per share. Over the last decade, both revenue and EPS increases have been strong due to management's continued evolution of its offerings. Due to its evolving offerings, its customers continue to return for solutions, as is highlighted by its low attrition levels. Investor sentiment should remain elevated as its top- and bottom-line growth continues to expand.INFY is nearing an upside breakout following strong earnings results. As its operations continue to expand, its share price is similarly trading up near record levels. Although its share price remains below its technology bubble highs in the early 2000s, continued expansion in its underlying operations is spurring further upside momentum. The sustainable cycle of top- and bottom-line growth fueling share price gains should push the company above $20 in the coming quarters."
4299108,105417,2019-10-25T11:22:21-04:00,"We expect Infosys to outperform the upper end of its revenue guidance in 2020.
        EBITDA margin should stabilize by the latter part of 2020.
        Solid capital return story to continue in the form of buy.","Infosys (INFY) is the Indian company that focuses on business consulting, information technology and outsourcing services. It is the second largest Indian company in this space, after Tata Consultancy. Its main competitors are Cognizant, Accenture, and IBM (consulting and outsourcing arms) in the US, and Capgemini in Europe. The company has a wide outreach across all major verticals. We value Infosys in the peer group that includes many players from the fragment IT services space (which specifically focuses on outsourcing and consulting): Accenture, Cognizant, Sapient, IBM, Capgemini, Globant, EPAM, Wipro, and Tata Consultancy, among others. We find that on 2020 earnings the PE multiple of 18x remains appropriate and fairly conservative. When applied against our 2020 EPS estimate of $0.62, we get the target price of $11.We see the following tailwinds for the INFY story:Expect INFY to outperform 2020 Guidance: In our view, the company’s 8.5%-10% Y/Y constant currency revenue growth is overly conservative, since only within outsourcing our estimate yields 14%-15% growth. While consulting may be softer in upper single digits, there should clearly be enough traction to deliver revenues north of 10%. Our current model calls for 10.6% Y/Y revenue growth and the most recent earnings call didn’t give us reasons to soften our model.See Margins Stabilizing in 2020: We estimate that by the latter half of 2020 (approximately two-three quarters out) EBITDA margin will stabilize around 2.7%, with approximately 15-20 bps expansion on a quarterly basis. A lot of it will depend on S&GA performance of the consulting business, which is always a wild card, albeit we do expect some stabilization throughout 2020.Expect Cloud To Catch-Up: Recall that Infosys has been behind the curve in terms of cloud tailwinds both relative to its US and particularly Indian competitors. We estimate that cloud did not contribute more than 3% of annual revenue between 2016-2019. At present, we expect this percentage to start aggressively growing and reaching as much as 4.5%-5% by 2020. We believe that cloud-related work should grow as much 30% Y/Y going forward.More US Exposure: The company has been channeling most of its marketing efforts toward Europe in recent years. We believe that over the next 1-2 years we may see a greater shift toward winning some US contracts, particularly on the technology and financial services side. In other words, we will likely see more direct competition vis-à-vis Cognizant. Recall that US margins are higher, so this assumption goes in line with our margin expectations. Capital Return to Continue: We anticipate more share repurchases in the next 12 months, as the company remains very generous and commits more than half of its free cash flows toward buybacks. While critics point out that this was more of a push to prop up the EPS at the time when the company’s shares were under pressure, we note that share repurchases has been a consistent policy over the last several years. Furthermore, dividend remains very generous, currently standing at 2.9%.Recent Whistleblower Complaint: While complaints of unethical practices related to the company and its senior management have recently exerted significant pressures on the share price, we believe that more information is needed before we revise down our numbers or the multiple, if at all. When events of this nature happen, we believe that the best course of action is to stand ready for additional information, and as soon as the impact on the actual business become evident, it is then prudent to make changes to the model. We will put out a separate report when/if this happens. We see the following business risks for Infosys:Legislative Uncertainty:Like all Indian firms with presence in the United States, Infosys heavily relies on H1-B and L-1 visas; over the last several years Congress attempted to heavily regulate the number of visa workers each company can hire.Pricing Wars: Infosys is positioned fairly well from the pricing perspective, relative to the US players, such as Cognizant and Accenture. However, within its domestic market, both Tata and Wipro are waging a pricing war on INFY, which may undercut Infosys’ business in the future.Macro Pressures: With the world economy slowing down, India is usually one of the first ones to be affected, which may in turn slow down demand for the consulting revenue (outsourcing revenue does well during downturns).Technology Risks: Like other global companies, Infosys is facing potential cyber attack risks."

        Infosys’ increasing interest in Asia points towards the management focus on diversifying the company’s revenue concentration.
        The company’s willingness to invest and turn around deals gone sour further points towards depth in management ability.
        Leveraging the momentum in digital, Infosys appears on track for a re-rating in P/E.
        If the company can sustain its growth trajectory, over the next 12-18 months, the stock can return ~40%.","Infosys (INFY) has been climbing out of a chasm of investor perception. Over the last 18 months, the company has been making significant strides in getting back to its ways of beating guidance. The results of the last few quarters and momentum in deals won point towards INFY on a sustainable growth trajectory. Absent management issues, the company’s stock looks undervalued.Other than the usual suspects (European weakness in financial services, weakness in communication and life sciences), INFY’s 3Q19 results were quite strong. The company’s ability to capture an increasing proportion of client budgets on digital spending appears to have helped.Source: INFY Financial Model. Note: The INFY Financial Model has been developed by the author using SEC filings, the company's investor disclosures and competitor analysis. On the back of the momentum seen, the company also increased its revenue guidance from 6-8% growth in constant currency to 8.5-9% growth in constant currency while maintaining its operating margin guidance of 22% to 24% for the full year.The intriguing part about INFY’s guidance was the company maintaining the operating margin guidance despite Digital seems to be driving growth (+5% q/q, 33% y/y) – Digital is known to have gross margins a couple of points higher than the rest of the business.Source: 3Q19 Earnings Call Evidently, the market senses INFY’s conservativism despite things starting to look up. While for most companies, this kind of conservativism can be construed as an indication of a lack of financial control or worse, mismanagement. However, for INFY, this is actually good news – the company seems to be going back to its ways of under-promising while aiming towards outdoing market expectations.Although the issues of the last few years had taken the edge out of INFY’s guidance beating ways, the company’s three-year plan instituted last year seems to be nicely taking shape.Japanese entryIn December 2018, INFY announced the acquisition of 81% stake in Hitachi Procurement Service (NYSE:HPS). HPS is the global procurement arm of the Hitachi Group. The balance of the 19% will be jointly held by Hitachi, Panasonic and Pasona (a local Japanese staffing firm). As the management noted:Source: 3Q19 Earnings CallThe Japanese deal comes on heels of the deal with Temasek in September and more importantly can help INFY consolidate its position in Asia. Since Japan is the largest IT market outside of the US, not only does a presence in Japan help diversify INFY’s dependence on US revenues but also further growth in its digital business with a focus on procurement.Skava & PanayaINFY reported that the company could no longer sell off these assets by end of March 2019. Additionally, the company plans “to repurpose Skava’s business and refocus Panaya’s suite of products”.INFY had acquired Skava and Panaya in 2015, for an aggregate value of $320 million. While Skava was acquired to leverage its digital experience solutions for the retail industry, Panaya’s automation technology for large scale enterprise software management was aimed at building further differentiation in INFY’s service lines.In 2018, INFY had set out to sell Skava and Panaya due to lack of meaningful contributions from the two companies. While these assets were on the block for a while, INFY taking them back in the company’s fold signals that the management has a plan to make them work despite them not meaningfully contributing to the financials. Furthermore, despite the effort and money involved in the financing of these turnarounds the company has been able to raise revenue guidance and hold the expectations steady on the margin front.In the past, these assets had created a major upheaval for the company. If the management has finally decided to digest them, it would be reasonable to assume that a company of INFY’s reputation will not be taking on any further risks.Growth in DigitalINFY’s digital offerings seem to have helped grow the company’s deal size with the momentum in large deal TCV sustainably picking up.Source: INFY Financial ModelEvidently, INFY seems to have got the pulse of digital right and seems to be intensely focused on executing it right:Additionally, INFY has been expanding sales capacity and re-skilling employees to deliver greater value.Source: 3Q19 Earnings CallSource: INFY Financial ModelThe management’s insistence on Digital generating higher margins than the core IT business clearly demonstrates that INFY’s digital go-to-market strategy seems to be resonating with customers.The company seems to be following up on its three-year plan rigorously, with 9M19 revenues up 7.4% and an upward revision to the revenue guidance.Source: INFY Financial ModelAs per the company’s 3-year plan, F2019 was expected to be the year of stabilization followed by incremental momentum and acceleration in F2020 and F2021, respectively.Source: INFY AGMIn the context of the company’s performance this year across revenues and deal wins, it appears that INFY seems to be on track if not ahead of schedule.

4138746,98236,2018-01-19T13:54:51-05:00,"Infosys reported the results of it fiscal Q3 last week.The results, while not spectacular, were better than feared and featured reasonable revenue growth and better margins than some had expected.Guidance was unchanged, again, better than feared.The shares have reacted positively both to the earnings release and to a subsequent upgrade by Morgan Stanley.The company has a new leader, and will present a strategic review in April. I think the new leader will be able to present a strategy to revive growth and to go after market share.","It seems like eons ago, but once upon a time, Infosys (INFY) was a growth leader. The company was one of the pioneers in the IT outsourcing space and vied for the top position amongst Indian vendors who had seized the opportunity to provide application maintenance, application installation and application development at rates significantly below those charged by the large American consultancies. Reprising the history of INFY's fall would, perhaps, make for an interesting case study but would probably not prove useful in figuring out whether this company has now become investment worthy.I think Infosys now is investment-worthy, although much of the reason for my change in opinion, reflects the overall demand environment more than any other specific improvements in internal strategy and processes that INFY has undertaken. There are several indications that demand for outsourced services is starting to rise in the areas that have been demand drags for years now. The outsourcing competitors, have begun to realize some traction from their initiatives around designing what they call ""digital transformation"" offerings. There is more packaged software being bought, in general, and it needs to be deployed. On both an economic basis, and because many enterprises simply do not have adequate staffing potential for large new projects, large customers are more disposed to go with an outsourced solution than has been the case in the recent past. Infosys can and probably will benefit significantly from those trends. While risk remain with regards to the future of the H1B visa program, Infosys has pivoted substantially and a much higher percentage of its work is being staffed in India. In fact, this past quarter had the smallest percentage of on-site staffing for INFY in the past 11 quarters. In addition, the company is hiring thousands of US based employees (citizens and green card holders) in multiple centers that it has created in this country.Further, Infosys has a new leader and perhaps some of the boardroom turmoil that has plagued and distracted the company will be coming to an end. The new leader has an impressive resume, with significant achievement in the space.It is noteworthy to appreciate that Infosys will have to deal with the fluctuations of the exchange rates. Most of its revenues are generated in USD and most of its costs are in INR. That makes forecasting a multi-dimensional exercise. The factors that control the INR/USD pair include exchange rates, inflation expectations and the other normal governors of FX. After the appreciation of the INR over the past 12 months, I think the currency impacts will begin to abate going forward.Some of the comments during the course of the conference call reflected to a more favorable demand environment. Of course Infosys management has made similar comments during the course of the past 12 months without much in the way of tangible revenue growth trends. The green shoots company management has described were offset by withering demand in other business segments. But at the moment, it appears as though the stars are aligning for this company and that it will be able to return to growth at perhaps a double-digit cadence in some future time period. Given the rather modest valuation of the shares, which do not really reflect any pervasive sense of faster growth ahead, and the overall underappreciation of the shares by the preponderance of covering analysts, I think INFY could be an interesting bet over the coming year or two.Last week Infosys reported the results of its fiscal Q3. The results were less than stirring although better than feared by some. Constant currency top-line growth was a bit under 6% with sequential quarterly growth of 0.8%. The company reported a large earnings increase due to an Advance Pricing Agreement with the IRS. This is really an agreement to allocate revenues and to compute the taxable income of the operations of INFY in the US. The agreement allowed INFY to reverse about $225 million (about $.10 share) in terms of tax accruals and that amount was reported on an IFRS basis in the just past quarter. Absent the impact of that settlement, operating profits as reported in USD showed a modest improvement both year on year and sequentially.The company announced another new CEO, Salil Prakeh, during the quarter, and this earnings release event was a bit of a public unveiling for the man. Mr. Prakeh has a substantial task ahead of him. His background at Capgemini, where he was deputy CEO, and responsible for revenues in the US, the UK and Asia/Pac as well as for the financial services vertical, has been one of consistent achievement. Overall, the parts of Capgemini for which Mr. Prakeh had responsibility had been showing mid-teens growth, substantially greater than the overall market.The company's guidance was also quite modest. Management is anticipating constant currency growth of around 6% for the quarter that ends on 3/31. Management did not change its outlook for the full year and the quarter that end on 3/31 in terms of either revenues or operating margins. The new CEO commented that in the past several years, fiscal Q4 had been challenging for the company in terms of achieving expectations. On the other hand, the tax provision is likely to be 100 bps lower than otherwise thanks to the impact of the new tax agreement, with non-IFRS tax provisions forecast to be in the range of 28%-29% compared to 30% reported in this past quarter. Management believes, based on a preliminary assessment, that the effect of the new tax rates in the US is likely to be neutral for INFYThe outsourcing space has been plagued in terms of growth for the last several years. Part of that has been a function of the adoption of the cloud for many workloads. The way the cloud is implemented has simply decreased the demand for implementation and maintenance services which are often part of the overall service agreement provided by SaaS vendors. In addition, as SaaS has become the standard for most new applications, it has lead, as well to a decline in the revenues that INFY, and its peers have been able to generate from application maintenance, a highly lucrative undertaking In the past.The days when large ERP deals were followed by large implementation deals are gone for INFY and all the other companies in this space and that will not be changing. The new CEO is undertaking a thorough strategy review that is focused on the market opportunities that are available to INFY. Almost inevitably, the review is going to reach conclusions that support INFY trying to expand its offerings in a space that is called digital transformation. Digital transformation projects are ubiquitous these days. One sees them in the insurance space where I have written about Guidewire's newest offering. They are seen in many other areas as well, including financial services, historically a mainstay of the outsourcing space. While digital transformation sounds like another marketing buzz-phrase, and to some extent it probably is, the fact is that almost all companies are attempting to introduce services delivered digitally that enhance customer experiences. It is a way of differentiating offerings that is generating lots of additional application development projects which cannot be staffed, for the most part, by internal sources.INFY is going to release the results of its latest strategy review when it holds an analyst day and discusses some more quantification regarding its outlook. I suspect that the company, at that time, will announce another phase of stock-repurchase and increased dividends as part of a capital allocation strategy. And I would also imagine it will announce an aspirational goal of double digit revenue growth based on its new offerings and its digital transformation projects.As INFY defines the term, revenues from digital services has reached 25% of total revenues and the company plans to publish this metric going forward. Some of the company's newer competencies such as cybersecurity, cloud, big data and IoT are growing at quite rapid rates, looked as a whole. Overall these newer service offering, now just shy of 10% of revenue, are growing at more than a 30% annual rate.The company saw a bit stronger demand from new customers. In all, INFY closed 79 new name accounts and most important, the share of new services and software from those sources rose from 11% to 11.6% of revenues sequentially. The company is seeing increased customer budgets. In financial services, the spending is from discretionary projects. In hi-tech and insurance, optimization projects, essentially a function of the adoption of AI, are showing increasing growth.The company tracks its mega deals. The TCV of these engagements rose from $731 million to $779 million sequentially. A substantial proportion of the mega-deals are renewals of longer-term relationships.The IT outsourcing space is a crowded field and Infosys, while a large company certainly is by no means the dominant player. Infosys ranks as a leader in the Gartner leader's quadrant for most of the specific workloads in which it is a competitor. I have linked with a few of those studies for the convenience of readers. According to some studies, while INFY has lost its position of #2 vendor in Indian outsourcing to Cognizant (CTSH) a couple of years ago, its current 6% growth is more or less in line with the market growth rate. I have linked with a couple of studies that validate the 6%-7% CAGR for the long-term growth of the market.While pricing and sales execution are obviously important components of market share gains and losses-in the IT outsourcing space, the real issue is whether a vendor's revenue is coming from the right areas. It would take a braver commentator than this writer to say that users, looked at holistically, are achieving better results with the service offering of INFY compared to those of Wipro (WIT) or CTSH or Tata (TCS). One of the principle components of a positive evaluation of INFY shares is the uptick that the company has seen it its financial services vertical. Financial Services (FS) is now and has been the single largest vehicle for INFY, representing a bit more than 25% of revenues. One of the obvious growth issues for this company is that FS is not growing and hasn't been growing. The problem, is not that INFY has a week suite of FS offerings, particularly but that large banks have never chosen to launch new IT projects as had been the case before 2008/9. It isn't necessarily the profitability of financial institutions that has been a limiting factor, but over-regulation and concerns about the overall regulatory environment that have weighed on IT investment in FS. The less malign regulatory environment of this current administration is probably one factor that is leading financial institutions to embark on projects; the concept of digital transformation is another major factor, and the newest applications such as the use of AI technology to analyze and decide on loan apps is another factor driving demand.The story of INFY's market share is that it hasn't had a market share strategy. The best of the buckets in which INFY reports revenue is more or less a catchall called Energy, Utilities, Communications and Services. It is this rather amorphous assemblage of different verticals that has been responsible for almost all of the growth, such as it has been, that INFY has been able to achieve this current fiscal year.I will foreshadow the conclusions of the strategic review now underway by saying that besides increasing focus on digital transformation and the other newer technologies on which users are spending, the company will have to focus on a couple of promising verticals and make the requisite investments to deepen its domain expertise. The most likely space for concentration would be FS, and if demand for new FS projects takes off in any fashion at all, it will add meaningfully to INFY's growth and allow it to regain some of its lost market share. Given the rise of newer fintech giants such as PayPal (PYPL) and Square (SQ), I think the competitive pressure on banks and other financial services providers, to augment their digital capabilities is likely to prove overwhelming.While management did not make any quantitative projections regarding the new fiscal year, in response to several questions, the company had very positive things to say about their outlook for growth in the banking sector of their business. Currently, expectations for revenue growth in fiscal 2019 in USD terms are for 7%, consistent with expectations for percentage growth this current fiscal year. That just doesn't seem likely at this point, simply based on a recovery in the banking sector.Infosys already has a substantial offering in the global retail banking sector called EdgeVerve/Finacle. It is listed by Gartner as the leader in its space-for the tenth year running. Its major competition is a Swiss based company called Temenos (TEMN.SW) which, while quite small relative to the revenues of the Infosys FI sector, has seen sustained double-digit growth. I think it is fair to say that Infosys already has relationships with most large banks around the world. So, there is probably a significant opportunity for INFY to step up its game in the FI, with an already extant platform and already extant customer relationships.In addition to FI, INFY has a major vertical in what it describes as Life-Sciences, Healthcare and Insurance (HILIFE-that is the INFY abbreviation, not mine.) HILFE is currently responsible for about 13% of INFY's revenues and it has been one of the better performing verticals for INFY so far this year with growth of almost 9%. The need for the insurance industry to rapidly embrace digital transformations is self-evident. The new technology offered by Guidewire (GWRE) is simply an example of the kinds of solutions towards which most larger insurance vendors, whether property/casualty or health, or even life companies are rapidly moving. GWRE in particular, is looking for 3rd party implementation partners with experience in digital transformation activities. It would seem natural for INFY to deepen its relation, both with Guidewire, and with many other insurance companies who are moving to match the kinds of offerings that have been recently introduced by GWRE and other insurance vendors. As can be seen, Infosys is actively recruiting for GWRE competent consultants.Can INFY achieve growth reacceleration and market share gains? I think the opportunities are there to accomplish both of those tasks and that is quite clearly what the hire of the new CEO is meant to accomplish. Unless through acquisition, reaccelerating growth will not be a speedy process, and it usually takes a long time to see considerable progress in market share metrics. But fortunately for investors, INFY has a relatively modest valuation, and some level of dividend income. At this point, without seeing what the company's strategic review will actually determine and what its specific quantitative goals might be, it is obviously infeasible to make any kind of informed judgement relative to its probability of success.Infosys has been reporting operating margins in a relatively narrow band for some time now. To some, this may be a surprise given the many margin headwinds faced by the Indian outsourcing companies. There are many puts and takes and levers that this company has been able to use to keep its margins levels. Most particularly, the company has been able to reduce it on-site mix by about 100 bps. The company has been able to offset several margin headwinds with rather substantial improvements in productivity. The most illustrative metric in that regard is that INFY has been able to increase its revenue per employee almost 5% year on year and 1.9% in its last reported quarter. Part of that improvement stems from greater levels of utilization which rose to 85% last quarter, a 300-bps improvement compared to a year earlier. And this improvement did not come because of increasing sub-contractor expenses which fell from 6.2% to 5.9% of total revenues year on year. Improvements in productivity were able to offset higher compensation and a modest decrease in pricing realizations. In addition, the company has been able to bring its turnover ratios down noticeably and ultimately, this too, helps in stabilizing margins. Last quarter, attrition declined from 17.2% to 15.8%Given the current level of utilization, I think it is reasonable to assume that there is basically no further runway to be had from that metric. Some observers have been concerned about price erosion in the overall outsourcing space. And other commentators have been concerned about the level of wage hikes in India. There are offsets to these headwinds.Management pointed out during the course of the call that the newer services, such as those connected with digital transformation are at higher price points compared to the company's legacy assignments. In addition, the company's other new services mentioned earlier, are also more profitable and have reached 10% of revenue and will grow several times more rapidly than the older, more traditional assignments. Simply put, as an example, implementing a broad-based AI project requires a significant level of domain expertise which comes at a higher price point. So, while there are, and probably will continue to be some noticeable headline issues regarding gross margins at a macro level for outsourcing vendors, there are specific offsets and levers that will probably maintain gross margins for Infosys at consistent levels going forward.Currently, the First Call consensus EPS for fiscal 2019 calls for very little EPS growth. In order for that to happen, given the level of revenue growth projected, the decline in tax rates and the continued share buybacks, it would be necessary to postulate a noticeable decline in margins from current levels. I think that is quite unlikely, and indeed I think margins are likely to be at least stable over the coming year.Infosys has certainly not been a terribly attractive investment until recently. It has spent a year with its share price stuck in neutral until the end of November. On a 12-month basis, the shares have appreciated by 24%, far below the appreciation of the IGV, up 45% over the same span or even peer/competitor Cognizant, up 34% over the same period. This relative underperformance has left INFY with decent upside if it can manage to fix the problems that have plagued it for some time at this point.At this point, INFY has 2.3 billion shares outstanding, after its latest share buyback. Based on the current share price, this yields a market capitalization of about $40.7 billion. After the cash expenditures of the buyback, the company has a cash balance of $3.6 billion and thus has an enterprise value of around $37 billion. The current First Call consensus revenue over the next 12 months is about $11.6 billion and this yields an EV/S of 3.2X. While not quite an outlier, it is at the least in line given consensus revenue growth expectations of 7%.The current First Call consensus earnings forecast for the upcoming fiscal year is for EPS of $1.07. As mentioned, this seems like a terribly unlikely forecast given the decline in average shares, 7% top line growth, a lower tax rate and a strong record in maintaining operation margins. I think in terms of a valuation analysis, it is reasonable to use an expected forward 12-month EPS of $1.20-$1.25. That yields a P/E of less than 15X. 15X is a noticeably less than the forward P/E for CTSH-around 17X.The company has been able to achieve a substantial increase in cash flow from operations thus far in the fiscal year. Much of that relates to the large income tax adjustment that it received last quarter. Overall, cash flow for this company is almost entirely a function of its after-tax profits + a small amount of depreciation and amortization. The company should be able, therefore, to generate about $2.7 billion in CFFO in this current fiscal year. Capex of about $450 million, would produce free cash flow of $2.25 billion, or a free cash flow yield of 6%. Again, that is a reasonable level for that metric, although not something that is a far outlier.INFY shares have risen about 18% in the last 6 weeks. Some of that was catch-up, some of was the specific reaction to a positive earnings release, and more of it was the impact of a rating upgrade by Morgan Stanley. So, in the short-term, it is possible that INFY shares have limited further upside. That said,, I expect that the analyst day and the earnings release in April coupled with the release of the strategic review to be the next real catalyst for the shares. The company has a respectable dividend yield of 2.3% and I do expect that part of the next earnings release will feature both a dividend increases and the announcement of another share buyback.I do not imagine that Infosys shares will appeal to momentum growth buyers. Raising the growth rate to double digits will be a credible attainment that is not a certainty. But in a stock market that features many valuations that seem extended to more than a few investors, this company offers a very reasonable GARP profile with the potential that it can return to moderate growth status over the next couple of years. With a relatively low beta and a strong balance sheet, I think the shares are appropriate for investors looking for a more conservative exposure to the technology space."
4298380,102612,2019-10-23T18:46:19-04:00,"Two whistleblowers filed complaints with the board of Infosys alleging two different unethical practices.News of the complaints was released this past Monday and the stock price suffered an initial drop of more than 16%.In this article, I examined the scores from four top forensic algorithms that check for earnings manipulation, financial irregularities, and bankruptcy risks.In the period examined from 2013 to 2019 there were no strong initial indicators of any earnings manipulation or material financial irregularities in any of the tests.The forensic tables of Altman, Beneish, Ohlson, and Montier are displayed below along with value/growth algorithm of Piotroski.","In an ongoing look at some major whistleblower accusations recently, I took a look to see if the claims against Infosys (INFY) showed any irregularities in the top forensic algorithms commonly used by certified fraud examiners. As part of my regular stock analysis and selections, I routinely publish screens of the most positive and negative forensic stocks in the market. Most recently, I examined whistleblower claims against Disney (DIS):Top Forensic Algorithms Check Whistleblower's $6B Claims Against DisneyI also took a look at Harry Markopolos' accusations that ""General Electric (GE) has engaged in fraud larger than Enron or Worldcom"" in my article:Running Top Forensic Algorithms On 2012-2019 GE FinancialsIn another series of articles, I look at certain combinations of these forensic and value scores to predict stock price performance like Tesla's (TSLA) recent 40% decline:The 3 Largest Stocks for October Scoring Worse Than Tesla Before Its 40% DeclineThese models are designed to flag certain elements where examiners could look deeper to assess conditions of a company.The magnitude of the allegations are not known publicly nor are the time periods directly impacted by these claims.Significant claims of earnings manipulation in a multi-billion corporation should become evident in at least one of the top forensic algorithms assessing more than 22 different ratios across different quarterly periods spanning seven years of data. There are ways to hide material breaches, but the application of multiple models reduces the chances for significant irregularities to go completely undetected. It's unlikely the CEO's international travel will turn up as an issue on the forensic and valuation models as an irregularity as these type of expenses would typically remain within sustainable operational parameters. Of greater concern are the claims of inflated profits, hidden ""critical information,"" and under-reporting costs which can be detected depending on the relative magnitude of these irregularities. On the first pass, not only are all the forensic and value algorithms not adverse at the top level, but they are in highly favorable conditions for low risk of manipulation, bankruptcy, and financial irregularities. Analyzing these Infosys accusations over the time period from 2013 to 2019 using the Altman Z-score, Beneish M-score, Ohlson O-score probability and the Montier C-score reveal the following:(UncleStock.com)First, looking at the Beneish model that uses eight variables to assess whether any earnings manipulation has occurred we see that none of the scores over the past seven years are adverse. Second, applying the Altman Z-score for assessing bankruptcy risk along five financial ratios reveals steadily improving scores with very low risk of insolvency. Third the Ohlson probability score of bankruptcy risk over the next two years is at an extremely low percentage below 1% over the analyzed time period. Fourth, the Montier C-score using six criteria to assess the likelihood that a company is cooking their books currently shows the highest positive (lowest chance) score possible for this risk. The score has been improving steadily and may have had some risk in 2014 to examine more closely. Lastly, the Piotroski value score remains a steady positive value for good expected returns at current price levels. The time period evaluation of these forensic and value algorithms does not show significant or prolonged risks of financial irregularities that may relate to the whistleblowers' complaints. A deeper dive into the forensic factors for any irregularitiesThe tables below break down each of the factors and allow us to take a closer look for any financial criteria within each of the forensic and value models that may show some irregularity or distress. Beneish M-Score factorsThe Asset Quality Index factor shows three years of adverse scoring based on the ratios of market cap to revenue relative to prior year ratios in these earnings periods. The most recent three years show a return to high quality asset levels according to the models measures. There's no other pervasive multi-year irregularity or current financial factor that is outside of expected parameters.Altman Z-score factors The individual Altman Z-score bankruptcy risk factors show a very positive and healthy balance sheet with very low risk of solvency concerns. Ohlson O-score factors The individual Ohlson O-score distress factors also show very positive scores and low risk of bankruptcy. The only adverse scores over the past seven years are in the Income After Tax one-year relative difference criteria. These two recent year scores highlight a decline in the yearly differences in income after taxes that might actually be inconsistent with any fraud complaints alleging the inflating of profits. The risk here is again very minimal. Montier C-score factors Examining the Montier C-score factors for earnings and financial statement manipulations we find several areas highlighted for closer analysis. While the current year received the best overall possible score on the Montier model, some prior years had some red flags despite scoring in the low risk levels over the past seven years. In particular the total assets fluctuation of one-year growth levels is consistently high over this evaluated time period and could be an area for further evaluation to understand the significant variation. Related to this factor are the Depreciation rates and the Days Inventory Outstanding that have fluctuated significantly but consistent with the unusual asset growth measures. The Days Sales Outstanding one-year growth measure shows a very significant reduction in this metric for 2019 relative to all the prior years to 2013. The sudden improvement in 2019 across most of the manipulation factors to very high positive levels seemingly inconsistent with all the prior year trends may be an indicator of unusual positive enhancements or change in the business. It may be worthwhile as an investigator to look at why many of these factors moved so much higher positive year-to-date 2019 than in all the prior years' trends. It also would be critical to know the time period of the alleged unethical manipulations in the whistleblowers' complaints to see how this matches with any unusual factor changes above. Piotroski F-score factorsFinally, looking at the value categories of the Piotroski F-score may give us some additional insight to what is considered a fairly positive valued stock at these price levels. Debt and buyback ratios are low and favorable, while return on assets and current ratios are not particularly strong. This does not validate any forensic concerns but may give a positive picture for the price value of this stock especially after the selloff reaction to the disclosure of the complaints. According to all the forensic models applied, there's no indication of alleged rampant financial irregularities spanning from 2013 to today in the Infosys financials. The three-year period of adverse scoring in the Beneish M-score factor for asset quality does not appear to be consistent with what little we know about the whistleblower claims. Much more information from the claims is necessary to match the time periods and the financial categories materially affected. The significant change in 2019 Montier C-scores with substantial improvements over all prior years is another area to look at more closely.These models are certainly not foolproof and were designed by academic researchers to improve the chance of detection of irregularities leading to bankruptcy, earnings manipulation, or flag the presence of financial distress.At the same time, these models are among the best peer-reviewed forensic models in the financial literature and have some significant documented value.I trust the insight from these different forensic and value algorithms will give you added value to your investment goals and objectives in the days ahead.JD Henning, PhD, MBA, CFE, CAMSAltman, E.

4046722,102646,2017-02-16T12:24:43-05:00,"Infosys and other Indian IT consulting firms are worried about how Trump's policies will impact growth.In this article, I explain why I believe the whole issue is overblown.Trump has signaled that he will be a pro-business president, surrounding himself with business leaders who are beneficiaries of the program.","Last month, I wrote an article explaining my bullish case for Infosys (NYSE: INFY). Since then, a lot has happened. The company's revenues of $2.5 billion missed the analysts' consensus by $20 million. Then, management issued a warning of challenging times ahead as a result of Trump's American First policy on jobs.Trump has promised to review the H1-B visa program to limit the level of outsourcing currently going on. Infosys is a major beneficiary of the program. Then, there were problems at the board after the company's founders questioned the payments of top executives. The board battle has already ended without drama with one of the founders calling the chairman a 'man of the highest integrity'.The shares, which slightly fell in January are now recovering.YTD Chart for INFY and WIT. Source, YChartsThe ProblemThe H1-B visa program allows American companies to hire professionals from the United States or overseas. The program's goal is to enable companies to find talent that would otherwise be impossible to get in the United States. As I will highlight below, American universities do not produce enough graduates in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics to satisfy the demand. This program gives companies an opportunity to hire foreigners to take these jobs. For instance, when you call your cable company, chances are that the customer service agent that serves you is in India.While the program has merit, labor unions and politicians accuse companies of misusing the program and undercutting American workers. A 2015 report by New York Times detailed how companies such as INFY were gaming the visa system. In the program, companies such as Infosys, Wipro (NYSE: WIT), and Cognizant Technologies (NASDAQ:CTSH) aided American companies in obtaining qualified foreign employees. The chart below shows the distribution of the H1-B program among different companies in 2014.Source. NYTIn his campaign, Donald Trump promised to bring jobs back to Americans. His America First policy aims to repeal the program and incentivize companies to give back the same jobs to Americans. A repeal of this program would pose a major challenge to the companies mentioned above. First, their current projects would be interrupted. Second, they would have to find Americans to replace the foreign workers. Finally, they may be forced to pay more money to American employees.H1-B Visa Issue is OverblownThe president of the United States has powers to stop the visa program especially since he has the backing of congress and the senate. However, Trump is also a successful entrepreneur who has used the visa program in his own projects. He understands the importance of the visa program. In a presidential debate, he explained why his hotels brought in foreign employees at the expense of Americans. He responded saying that 'Americans didn't want temporary jobs'.In addition, Trump has surrounded himself with highly successful entrepreneurs. His trade secretary, Wilbur Ross is a respected entrepreneur who has helped restructure many companies, which use these programs. His informal advisor, Peter Thiel serves on the board of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), which also enjoys the opportunities provided by the program. His economic council is made up of managers and entrepreneurs such as Steve Shwarzman and Mary Barra who lead big organizations that take advantage of the visa program.Trump has signaled that he is flexible in some of his policies. This past weekend, Stephen Miller, the senior policy advisor said this about the program.In terms of merit, a complete overhaul of the H1-B would lead to crisis in the United States. The bioscience industry employs 1.7 million people in the U.S. with fewer than half of the scientists being native-born citizens. Scrapping the program would lead to a crisis in the bioscience industry. The same is true in most of the high-tech industry especially those using huge STEM skills. A recent report by Bloomberg claimed that employers in the technology and agricultural sector claimed that American universities were not producing enough people to take the jobs.The report stated that universities were not producing enough scientists and mathematicians to take the 150,000 jobs created every year. Therefore, while Trump has the power to issue an executive order repealing the program, I believe that doing so would do Americans more harm than good.The chart below shows the number of skilled visas which were granted by occupation in the US in 2014.Source. BloombergThere is consensus that the H1-B program has been misused by American companies. The impacts to this has been improved profits at the expense of American workers. Since America does not produce enough skills to take all the jobs, a complete repeal of the program will not be viable. Instead, it will create chaos in corporate America that Trump wants to avoid. He has credited the market rally to his policies. Repealing the visa program would cause disruptions to the economy, which Trump wants to avoid in his tenure.In addition, a thorough reform to the program to reduce cheating will be beneficial to American citizens and the companies involved. This is because only people who bring in skills will be granted the visa privileges. They will also be admitted to work meaning they will be earning and staying away from welfare services.Finally, these companies are already increasing the hiring of local American talent. In the last quarter's conference call, the CEO of Infosys said this:Other Indian companies have also been preparing for a time when the visa program is reformed. Recently, N Chandrasekaran, the CEO of Tata Consultancy (OTCPK:TTNQY), said the following about the program.In hiring local American citizens, INFY's margins will be hurt. There have also been proposals for a wage increase. In a report by Indian paper, Live Mint, Apurva Prasad, a research analyst at HDFC securities estimated that if the minimum (H1-B) wage is fixed at $100K, operating margins of companies such as INFY would be affected from anywhere between 150 and 300 bps. In the same report, Investec Securities estimated that an increase in minimum wage for H1-B visa recipients to $110k, Infosys's margins would be affected by around 170 bps.However, the company has slightly higher margins than its American competitors such as Accenture (NYSE: ACN) and Cognizant Technologies which would partly offset these impacts. The table below compares INFY's margins with that of its closest competitors.Source. YChartsFinal Thoughts - Short-term concernsWhile I'm long INFY, I expect that the company will be a bit volatile until it sees a clear path forward. INFY serves some of the largest companies in the United States such as Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Nike (NYSE:NKE), and Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO). While I expect the company to keep these customers and the existing deals, it will face a challenge attracting new customers and new deals this quarter. This is because potential customers might be worried about the future of the new projects and the potential cost increments if the visas are revoked.In the long term, however, as a new normal is reached, the company will be able to negotiate deals and get new customers. As I mentioned in my previous article on the company, the IT consulting industry is expected to grow as companies enjoy a low tax and a low regulated environment."

Our analysis suggests this is due to an overreaction to recent headwinds, which has resulted in a good buying opportunity. The average annual sales and EPS growth over the last five years were phenomenal, coming in at 150.1% and 142.4%, respectively. While it is obvious that this type of growth cannot continue, the company should easily be able to achieve a growth rate that supports substantial appreciation from the current level.In recent years Infosys has faced challenges associated with lower differentiation and slower growth than some peers. As a result, the company started focusing on a new strategy and is making an effort to transition into higher-value work that leverages automation. In its 2017 annual report, the company says it is starting to see the benefits of this strategy play out. Infosys highlighted rapid momentum among clients with its new services such as mainframe modernization, cloud applications, IoT, cyber-security, digital experiences, and complex analytics.A key example of their software offerings is their AI platform, Infosys Nia. Infosys Nia uses big data analytics, machine learning, optical character recognition, natural language processing capabilities and several other tools developed or acquired by Infosys:Several other software offerings that should be mentioned are Skava, EdgeVerve, and Panaya, which the company said are seeing good traction in the Q1 2018 earnings call. Skava is an e-commerce platform which has an impressive list of customers including Kohl’s, Adidas, Kraft Heinz and Macy’s to name a few. EdgeVerve offers enterprise software products such as a banking suite, process automation, and mobile payment solutions. Other EdgeVerve software products are focused on distributive trade, credit servicing, customer service, and enterprise buying. Through Panaya, the company offers solutions for end-to-end testing, application lifecycle management, and impact analysis and risk mitigation. The intent of these solutions is to allow clients to make changes to their applications at a much faster rate while reducing the risk of something going wrong. Panaya’s solutions are used by some well known companies including Eaton (NYSE:ETN), Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Verizon (NYSE:VZ).The company also continues to fuel growth via acquisitions in startup companies. Six new investments were made in 2017 in startups working in AI, autonomous unmanned vehicles, data insights, cloud, and other high potential areas. These investments show the ambitions of Infosys to move from simply taking orders to innovating themselves.We like that the company is focusing more on providing their own solutions. We agree with the view presented in the annual report that to not move in this direction would leave Infosys as a previous-generation company and much less attractive from an investment standpoint. The goal of the company is to become the next-generation software and services provider and partner to its clients. In fiscal 2017, the company crossed $10 billion in revenue and grew revenue by 8.3% which was in-line with industry peers. The company won $3.5 billion in large deals and added five more $100 million clients bringing the total to 19.One competitive concern or risk is wage increases. Wages did increase in 2017 and despite this the company posted impressive operating margins of around 24%. The strategic shift into higher valued areas, as mentioned previously, should help fight the impacts associated with higher wages. Revenue per full time employee actually increased by 1.2% in the fiscal year. The company attributed this to automation, utilization, and productivity improvements. One recent change or initiative mentioned in the 2018 Q1 call is that Infosys has started hiring locally. For example, in May of this year the company announced plans to hire 10,000 American technology professionals. This is part of a plan to get closer to clients and leverage global talent.Infosys is one company where customer concentration is not an issue. The company already had 798 clients in 2013 and has grown the list at an impressive rate since then. The company had 1,162 clients in fiscal 2017. The company operates in basically every industry and allocates revenue to the following different segments in their reporting. We view the diversity and the fact that no single sector plays an outsized role as a big positive for Infosys.Source: 2017 Annual Report (Numbers in INR)The company is also diversified from a geography standpoint with revenues for reporting split between North America, Europe, India, and the rest of the world for reporting purposes. Source: 2017 Annual Report (Numbers in INR)Current headwinds for the company include the June 2017 forecast by the National Association of Software and Services companies which suggested growth for the company would slow down. This is expected, partially, as a result of tightening immigration rules in the U.S and Britain’s exit from the Euro.Additionally, the share price was impacted and has not recovered since August when the former CEO, Vishal Sikka, resigned after a prolonged period of disagreement between the board directors and the company’s founders. One of the founders and former CEO, Nandan Nilekani, was named as the non-executive chairman of the company after Sikka resigned. Chairman Nilekani said the next CEO would be selected from internal and external candidates.The stock is more than 13% below its 52-week high which we feel is an overreaction to these recent headwinds. Goldman recently upgraded the stock indicating that they felt the risks were already priced in.Source: Former Infosys chief executive officer and managing director Vishal SikkaInfosys has done a good job controlling costs, which is what has kept ROE at a nice level despite the lack of debt. In fiscal 2017 selling and marketing expenses were 5.2% of total revenues compared to 5.5% the previous year. The company splits this from general and administration expenses which amounted to 6.9% of total revenue which is unchanged from fiscal 2016.One question an investor may have for this Indian company is the impact of currency movements. The impact on operating margins is 0.50% for every point depreciation/appreciation in the exchange rate between the Indian rupee and US dollar. We do not think the currency concern should play much of a factor in making a longer term investment decision so the graph below is provided more out of curiosity to show the fluctuations over the years.INR data by YChartsCash flow has been quite impressive for Infosys for years now. The table below shows that there has been plenty of cash to support the dividend, fund acquisitions, and grow retained earnings at a steady rate. The balance sheet is solid. No long term debt and a current ratio of 3.40 mean the company has the financial stability that should make investors feel safe. The 3+% dividend yield comes with a fairly comfortable payout ratio currently standing at about 41.Source: barchartNow let’s discuss our discounted cash flow model. Reuters provides long term EPS growth estimates from three analysts with the mean coming in at a fairly optimistic 10.67. We say ""fairly optimistic"" because we are talking about a company with a market cap of $31 billion and sales that exceeded $10 billion. Keep in mind that historical growth rates are phenomenal. Average annual EPS growth was over 140% over the last five years. Of course, that cannot happen again. EPS growth on a quarter over quarter basis was a much more muted 1.30% which may explain why the stock movement has stalled recently. The DCF model inputs are summarized below. We adjusted the growth until the current price was equal to our target buy price. This allows us to see the growth that would be required for investors to receive an acceptable return on their investment.Discounted Cash Flow Model Inputs:The model above looked at a five year time frame. It assumes that the dividend will increase at the same rate as earnings. We did not assume any share buybacks, which seems reasonable for now given that the total common shares outstanding has remained almost unchanged for at least the last four years. However, the company did approve its first buyback in August of up to $2 billion, so the model may be somewhat conservative, which we prefer anyway. Notice that the required growth rate to consider the company a buy at current levels is much lower than the analyst estimates and the historical growth rates. If we were to consider a 10 year time period in which the growth rate slows down by one percent a year after year five, the growth rate for the first five years would need to average slightly more than 8%. Overall, we believe the DCF model aligns with our view that shares are currently trading at an attractive valuation.To add to the valuation model, the table below provides some comparisons of various valuation and performance metrics compared to the sector averages.Source: Reuters for Sector Numbers & finviz for INFY numbersThe key highlights from the table above include the high return on equity number combined with no debt. Of course, if a company has a lot of debt, the return on equity number will be inflated which is why these numbers need to be looked at together. Finally, Infosys also looks cheap based on the price to sales and price to cash flow numbers compared to the sector averages.We like the strategic shift the company is making in which it is moving from mainly just completing contracts for clients to becoming a true innovator in cutting edge fields and technologies. This shift to higher profit margin work is expanding the company’s horizons and allows Infosys to rebrand itself as a real technology innovator. If the company can leverage its diverse client list to market its new solutions and services, further growth is not only possible but could really surprise the market considering the current valuation. The growth estimates required by our DCF model are achievable and conservative compared to even the lowest reported analyst estimate. Of course, there is also the three plus percent dividend yield which can easily be supported by this cash cow.Options also provide another means to enhance investor returns in Infosys. We recommend selling a covered call option. The option expiring on January 19 with a strike price of $16 pays $0.20 or $20 per contract sold. This equates to an annualized yield boost of about 2.8%. The seller of this call would only need to sell his or her shares if the price increases by over 10% in the next three and a half months.Whether or not options are used, we think the 9% drop over the last 12 months provides investors with a good opportunity to initiate a position in the company. We rate this software powerhouse a buy at current levels."
4086364,22742,2017-07-07T15:20:27-04:00,"Company overview.Comparing past results in U.S. dollars versus Indian Rupee investment.Fundamentals, past and future.","Company OverviewInfosys Limited (INFY) (INFY.NS) is a global technology, consulting, and outsourcing leader employing over 200,000 people in 50 countries in Asia/Pacific, the Americas, and Europe. Just over 61 percent of revenue is derived from its U.S. operations, 25 percent from Europe, 2.5 percent from India, and the remaining 11.9 percent from the rest of the world. We expect the revenue from India to increase substantially this year and next and will explain why a little later.The company's revenue stream is diversified further across multiple services and sectors. INFY provides business information technology services in application management, business applications, the Cloud, IT engineering, Infrastructure management, business process outsourcing, management consulting, and enterprise mobility. It services the following sectors: financial services (33.5 percent), manufacturing (22.4 percent), retail (14.1 percent), telecom (9.9 percent), energy and utilities (5 percent), life sciences (4.6 percent), healthcare (2 percent), transportation and logistics (2 percent), and all others (6.4 percent).It is also well diversified across its broad client base with only 21 percent of revenue derived from its top ten clients and has over 1,160 active clients. It is important to note that its client retention rate is over 97 percent making the business very sticky in terms of recurring business revenues.Prior-year financial statements show revenue increasing at a compound annual rate of 12.7 percent over the past four years and 11 percent for profit after taxes over the same period. The company has zero long-term debt and strong free cash flow. The stock currently trades at $14.94 per share and a P/E (price to earnings) ratio of 15.9 which compares favorably to the historical average of 19.3. The dividend is $0.46 per share for a yield of 3.1 percent. India does not withhold taxes on dividends paid to U.S. citizens.Investment results in USD (U.S. dollars) vs. INR (Indian Rupees)The first chart below depicts an investment (excluding dividends) in USD. Over the past 10 years, one would have notched a gain of 51.9 percent holding INFY shares. However, an investor from India would have fared much better as shown in the next chart.Source: Yahoo FinanceHere, we look at an INFY investment made in Rupees. Over the same 10-year holding period, the gain would have been 257.6 percent (excluding dividends). An investor from the U.S. would not have achieved any different result by investing in INR as opposed to USD. The difference is the result of a strengthening USD relative to the INR over this period.Source: Yahoo FinanceHow much of a difference can currency fluctuations make? Huge! Look at the chart below comparing USD to INR over the last 10 years. Looking at a 10-year period shows that prior to 2012 the relationship was significantly different. The USD rose relative to the INR by about 63 percent the last 10 years. INFY traded at about 250 INR at the beginning of the period, which would translate to about $6.25 in USD terms, assuming an (FX) exchange rate of 40:1. Today, INFY trades at 947 INR, which at the current FX of about 65 translates into $14.57 USD. The prices on the two exchanges will not match since one is open while the other is closed, so trading is not simultaneous. Plus, there is always the potential for temporary differences in pricing, until the arbitrage crowd notices, when either the U.S. or Indian investors become more excited about a stock than the other group. The size of the difference at the beginning of the time period cannot be explained without digging into more specific FX rates and existing regulatory climates that may have existed at the time. Suffice it to say that the results of this general analysis and explanation do not hinge on those specifics.In the end, nearly all (if not all) of the difference in returns is the result of currency fluctuations over the period. The point of this exercise to show how important it is to identify trends in currency relationships when investing in foreign stock, even if (or especially if) one buys ADRs. Being on the wrong side of a currency trend can rob an investor of a significant portion of the potential total return s/he could have accumulated. Just picking a great company is not enough, especially over the short- to intermediate term.Take another look at the above chart and notice that the trend line defining the bottom of the bullish USD trend has been broken to the downside. The U.S. economy is sluggish, having difficulty growing above 2 percent, while the Indian economy is growing at over 7 percent. The central bank of India continues to support much higher interest rates relative to the U.S. Federal Reserve. Inflation is higher in India but not unreasonably so. These and other economic factors are creating an environment which we believe favors the INR relative to the USD for the foreseeable future. If the trend continues, the INR will regain much of its PPP (purchasing power parity) losses of the last six years, and that would be extremely beneficial to U.S. owners of INFY shares. It will, of course, make little difference to Indian investors since for them, a Rupee is a Rupee, and its value is determined mainly by domestic inflation.Fundamentals past and futureUsing the Friedrich algorithm, we can see the fundamental ratios for INFY both in INR and in USD. It relies heavily on analysis of the FCF (free cash flow) generated by the company because cash does not lie (while earnings can be manipulated). The first table below shows the results in INR. Since INFY has a fiscal year end of March 31st, there is no TTM (trailing twelve-month) column shown. Detailed explanations and formulas for the ratios listed are provided at this link. If you prefer to read the information in another language just scroll down to the top of the text and click on the drop down menu (Language) at the left and pick your language to translate.Source: Friedrich Global ResearchI generally look at the Main Street Price (estimated fair value) first, then I check the FROIC (free cash flow return on invested capital) the Friedrich Cash Machine (free cash flow as a percent of revenue) and then skip down to the Price to Bernhard FCF ratio (Price to FCF).Following this path, we see that the current price of 974 INR is below the Main Street Price. We interpret this to mean that, from our point of view, the stock is priced below fair value. Moving down to the FROIC, please notice that this ratio is consistently above 20 percent. That is relatively rare in today’s environment of overvalued equity markets. Next, if we look at the Friedrich Cash Machine, we see that it is consistently at or above 20 percent also. This is also a relative rare occurrence today as most companies fall in the 5 to 15 percent range for this ratio. Now, we look at the Price to Bernhard FCF to determine, once again, if this stock is priced advantageously. At 14.8, this ratio looks enticing.This is very important because, based upon a study conducted by Mycroft Research of a 60-year back test period, we find that companies priced at 15 times FCF or less significantly outperform market averages. In the study, the Dow Jones Industrial Average held over the full 60 years turned $10,000 into $511,470 for a compound annual rate of return equal to 6.77 percent. That sounds okay, but when investing only in those DJIA component companies priced at 15 times FCF or less, rebalancing annually, the same investment produced a compound annual rate of return equal to 21.08 percent, or $965,011,511. The difference is staggering. And, that is what prompted the creation of the Friedrich algorithm. We apply the algorithm to more than 17,000 stocks from 36 countries around the globe to identify great investment opportunities. INFY is one of the few that caught our attention.Now, we will take a look at the INFY ratios calculated in USD in the following table. Why is this important? Here, we include a TTM column that also includes a more recent share price. The earlier table was all based upon year-end data and price. The only problem is that when the year-end is the same as TTM, it produces a zero for revenue growth. Ignore the zero. Ideally, we would like to buy this great company at under $10 USD.Source: Friedrich Global ResearchUnfortunately, we do not expect that to occur unless something terrible happens like a deep global recession similar to the financial crisis of 2008-09. It could happen, but we are confident that INFY will be able to bounce back strongly just as it did in 2009. Remember, at that time, the USD was trading much closer to parity relative to the INR while now it trades at a premium of over 70 percent on a PPP basis. In other words, this time around, we would have a cushion that did not exist the last time to help reduce the size of any potential downside risk.Looking at the Friedrich charts below, first in INR and then in USD, we see that at 974 INR, it is more favorably priced than it has been in the last five years.Source: Friedrich Global ResearchThe USD chart tells a similar story. Note that the Wall Street Price (white) is the market price, the Main Street Price (yellow) is our estimated fair value, the overbought (red) is 66 percent above fair value and the oversold (green) is 33 percent below fair value.Source: Friedrich Global ResearchThe USD chart has 10 years of history, and as you can see, the Wall Street Price only dipped below the Oversold level once in the last 10 years. For the reasons mentioned above, it is unlikely to revisit that level again in the next few years regardless of the economic environment. If it does, we will be backing up the truck, so to speak.We mentioned earlier that we expect that the percentage of revenue derived from India to grow substantially over the next two years. Our reasoning is based upon two pieces of intelligence we came across. The first is from story we found in the Financial Times.The second is the revolution in digital payments technology from Quartz. You can read the full article here.We do not think that the H1B visa dispute will have a lasting or meaningful effect on INFY. The company will adjust its business model to fit the outcome. The new business in India and elsewhere outside the U.S. should be more than enough to offset any temporary slowdown in its U.S. market operations.The consistency of results reported by this outstanding company point to a strong probability of continuation. While there is no such thing as a sure thing in investing, we think this one stands head and shoulders above the majority of investing alternative available in today's market.ConclusionINFY is a buy at the current price. It does not trade this cheaply very often. The 3 percent dividend yield just adds icing to the cake.If you have any questions, please feel free to ask them in the comment section below, and don't forget to hit the ""Follow"" button next to my name at the top of this article.

The Company operates with ZERO debt on its book. INFY has shown consistent growth over the last ten years (i.e. 2007-08 to 2016-17). Its net revenue from operations over this period grew at an impressive CAGR of 17.96%.For FY 2017, income from operations increased by 10% to Rs. 684,840 million from Rs. 624,410 million and PAT increased by 6% to Rs. 143,530 million from Rs. 134,910 million. INFY has reserves in excess of Rs. 650,560 million.Based on the above Price/Earnings (P/E) multiple averages for the past 10 years, INFY is available at a cheap valuation and is currently trading at ~24% discount. The other way to look at this would be to calculate the fair price of the stock based on its historic P/E multiple.In other words if INFY's fair P/E multiple is seen at 19.34, what should be its price right now? This is an easy calculation to do:Price/EPS = 19.34Price = (19.34 * EPS) = (19.34 * 62.77) [this is INFY's EPS for FY 2017]Price = Rs. 1,213.97Based on a 10-year average P/E ratio, INFY's fair price is Rs. 1,296.01. Of course, many will argue that attributing past valuations may not be right since the industry will not expand at the same rate in the future.High Dividend Yield StockINFY has consistently been among the top dividend-paying companies. The Company has been consistently paying dividends for more than 10 years.The current dividend yield for INFY is 2.63% (based on a closing price of 27 April 2017).New Capital Allocation PolicyINFY has revised the capital allocation policy after taking into consideration the strategic and operational cash requirements in the medium term. The Company plans to pay Rs.130,000 million via dividend/share buybacks to shareholders in FY 2018.Additionally, effective from FY 2018, INFY revised its payout policy to 70% of free cash flow from ~50% of PAT earlier. The revised capital allocation policy seems to be a positive step in shareholder value creation.Growing Client Relationships And Increasing Client BaseINFY's client-centric approach and high level of execution excellence continues to provide a high level of client satisfaction. This is clearly visible from its repeat business, which is generating ~97% of its revenue. INFY has added 321 new clients in FY 2017, taking the total client base to 1,162.INFY continues to expand existing client relationships by providing them with a broad set of end-to-end service offerings and increasing the size, nature and number of projects that can be done with them. Further, the Company's specific industry, domain, process and technology expertise allow INFY to enable its clients in transforming their businesses with innovative strategies and solutions.Increased Focus On Digital SpaceINFY has made strong developments in Social, Mobility, Analytics and Cloud (SMAC) and digital transformation through an inorganic route. According to Nasscom's 2016 report, SMAC revenue will account for ~20% of the total revenue of Indian IT companies in 2020, from the current levels of less than 5%.In FY 2016, INFY acquired Kallidus Inc. Currently, it is doing business as 'Skava', which provides digital experience solutions, including mobile commerce and an in store shopping experience to large retail clients. In FY 2015, INFY acquired Panaya Inc., which enabled the Company to provide higher-margin automation solutions to its clients.On the domestic market front, India's government focus on the digital India initiative throws a rich opportunity for the IT players. As INFY is building strong capabilities in the digital technology space across industries, we believe this move would augur well for the Company.Conservative Management Guidance And H1-B Visa Concerns For FY 2018Past Management Revenue Guidance Vs. Actual GrowthLower IT Sector Growth RateEverything bad that could happen to IT stocks happened in FY 2017. Here's a post explaining all the negative events and its impact on IT stocks. Keeping all this in mind, for FY 2018, Nasscom has deferred to give its estimated growth projection but many brokerage houses are expecting the growth projection in the range of 6-8% lower than the previous year's projection (8-10%) due to global macro uncertainty, cross-currency fluctuations, structural shift in the industry and political uncertainties.VIEWI believe that most negative news has been factored in and that the stock has corrected much more than it should have. Any positive triggers could result in a sharp recovery in the stock price. Given its strong fundamentals and healthy balance sheet, INFY will continue to pay out higher dividends and makes for a compelling buy at the current price."

4036427,102646,2017-01-12T13:28:02-05:00,Infosys is undervalued compared to its peers.Growth to come from the emerging markets.Trump's policy could help improve its performance.,"At the beginning of every year, I go for bargain hunting. In this, I screen companies that underperformed their peers in the previous calendar year. Then, I look at the reasons why the companies underperformed and come up with a short or long thesis. This year, my focus turned to Infosys (NYSE:INFY), an Indian conglomerate that provides IT services to corporations. Amongst the global peers, INFY was one of the worst performing companies as you can see below:As seen, INFY underperformed its peers in the year except for WIT which had its challenges of missing estimates and a decelerating growth in seven years.Why INFY UnderperformedTwo reasons contributed to the underperformance. First, the company suffered from the loss of the $300m contract with the Royal Bank of Scotland (NYSE:RBS) after the bank dropped an earlier plan to launch Williams & Glyn as a standalone bank. 3,000 people lost their jobs as a result. The dropped guidance was a key factor for the underperformance. Second, the company missed on revenue in Q1 and Q2, and reduced its FY17 guidance.Infosys Client BaseInfosys serves global companies and governments. According to the company, at the end of 2016, it had 1,092 clients, which was a slightly higher number compared to the previous year. The clients are distributed in terms of revenue as shown below:Source: Infosys Annual ReportGeographically, the following table shows the change in the distribution of clients around the globe. In the table, it is clear that North American and Indian revenues increased marginally while those from Europe and Rest of the World (ROW) decreased.Source: InfosysInfosys serves four main industries with Financial Services and Insurance (FSI) having the largest share. The FSI and the Retail, CPG, and Logistics (RCL) seeing marginal increase in revenues, and Energy, Utilities, Communications, and Services (ECS), and Manufacturing and Hi-Tech lagging as shown below:Source: InfosysThe IT Consulting MarketThe IT consulting market growth depends to a large extent on the performance of the economy. In a flourishing economy, companies tend to invest more in IT services. According to a report by IDC, the IT consulting industry will grow by 4.1% through 2017. It attributed this to a number of factors such as a rebounding European Union economy and corporations' shift to the cloud.In its 2017 technology market outlook, Deloitte noted that companies will accelerate their IT investments in the year with machine learning taking the lead. Strategically, machine learning allows organizations to reduce capex and increase efficiency. Additionally, companies are investing in the digitization of the workplace, cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, and cloud adoption. The manufacturing industry is forecasted to increase, with companies investing heavily on automation. The energy market is also anticipated to grow as oil prices rebound. This will depend on whether oil producers will be faithful in their oil freeze pledge. According to Deloitte, projects worth $620 billion have been deferred through 2020 because of the decline in oil prices. In case of a sustained rebound in oil prices, some of these funds will get to the IT consulting firms. In addition, the World Bank expects the world economy will grow from 2.3% in 2016 to 2.7% in 2017. Most of this growth will come from the emerging and developing markets.In the United States, investors and most managers have taken the Trump victory positively, with the financial sector having the biggest gain. Investors are pleased with the proposed infrastructure spending, reduction in corporate taxes, and the removal or easing of regulations. Analysts at the World Bank believe that the suggestions by Trump will create a boom in the economy if trade restrictions won't be implemented.In Europe, the second largest market for Infosys, Brexit was a major issue in 2016. The challenge was how companies would adopt to the ""new normal"" in Europe. The management said the following about Brexit and its implications on its business:The main challenge was in terms of currency volatility, the future growth of the continent, and the future performance of companies in a ""broken"" Europe. Recent economic data show that the United Kingdom economy is doing well in Europe after the vote. The EU economy has equally been doing well after the vote. I therefore believe companies like Infosys will weather the Brexit storm successfully. In fact, Bloomberg reported that most CEOs would consider moving after Brexit, which would require services of IT consulting firms.FundamentalsInfosys has increased its quarterly diluted EPS, revenue, and cash and short-term investments despite the challenges it has faced.Source: YChartsHowever, the firm has substantially slowed down the profit margin from 26.25% in 2012 to the current 20.83%. However, the current profit margin is higher compared to its comparable peers except for Oracle which has a profit margin of 22.49%. The same is true with its trailing 12-month gross profit margin, EBITDA margin, and operating margin. The company also has a better return on equity than most of its comparable peers.ValuationA look at the company's valuation shows that it is relatively undervalued compared to its peers. I have compiled a few metrics that show the company is currently undervalued and has a potential to grow:Source: AuthorConclusionInfosys stock has been affected by the lowering of guidance by the management and the recent misses in revenues. The company has also been affected by the increased competition from its larger peers. Indirectly, INFY has been affected by the sluggish growth in the FSE sector because of increased regulations (read Dodd-Frank), low interest rates, and the emerging technologies like peer-to-peer lenders. I believe that these challenges will change in this year as the new administration removes regulations and as the interest rates rise. In addition, the company's services will come to focus as oil prices rise and deferred projects start to be implemented. Finally, the company has the potential to grow in the developing markets. In Kenya, for instance, the company provides banking solutions to Equity Bank, which is the largest bank by customer numbers in the market. The product enables the bank to reach many unbanked people. This is an area where INFY can reciprocate to other banks in the developing world.As demonstrated in the table above, the company lags behind its peers. Not shown in the table, it trades at a smaller multiple compared to the industry average of 17.9. All eyes will be on the company on Friday when it reports. Wall Street and the Estimize community expect an EPS of $0.23, and revenues of $2,584M and $2,583M, respectively. I believe the company's share price has the potential to go up this year. A DCF calculation places its fair value at $21.08."

But as earning season continues to gather steam, nearly 40% of the tech stocks we tracked ended this past week in the red.Infosys Limited (NYSE:INFY), down 10.1% for the week, continues to fall (see below for additional analysis), featuring yet again within the top three tech losers. Softbank (OTCPK:SFTBY) was down 11.4% this past week on continued concerns over the pending ARM acquisition. Wipro (NYSE:WIT) was down 8.9% on earnings and revenue misses announced this week.Diving deeper into the dataThe top 20 tech losers of the week have a median 2017 forward P/E of 17.6x, compared to the S&P 500's median trailing P/E of 14.6x and the overall tech sector's 25.9x. This week's top 20 group is expected to grow EPS in 2017 by 12.7%, and the companies generate median dividend yield of 1.5% (13 of the 20 companies are dividend-payers).The table below highlights, in green font, the three best-positioned tech companies in each of the following categories: projected EPS growth, dividend yield, forward P/E and forward PEG (P/E divided by percentage-point EPS growth).Source: DM Martins Research, using data compiled from Yahoo Finance and Market WatchIs Infosys a bargain?With Infosys down big for another week, we will take a closer look as to whether this might be the right buying opportunity for this stock. Down 24% off of its 52 week high in April, Infosys still trades above the median trailing P/E of the S&P. Infosys has a 12.5% growth estimate with a moderate dividend yield and PEG ratio.Infosys continued to slide after missing on revenue and earnings due to lower than expected growth rates in services.- The bull case: SA author Chanchal Beriwala published an article in early June with a potential buy target of $17, when the stock was trading around $19, citing the company's automation and AI strategy to combat shrinking industry margins. Infosys reported signing three new $100 million+ clients in their most recent press release.- The bear case: Although still expected to reach double-digit growth and high operating margins, the company has revised both metrics down. Although Infosys has shifted its strategy to accommodate the rapidly changing demands of clients, the company is also at the mercy of the economic conditions facing their clients, along with currency risk due to much of its revenue being derived from overseas.Right time for Symantec (SYMC)?If you are looking for growth, how does 30.6% sound? Down 2.2% this week, Symantec has the lowest PEG of this week's losers (0.6x), with a 2017 Forward P/E of 14.5x that falls below the median trailing P/E of the S&P. After the stock took some big hits in 2016, Symantec has continued to recover and is hovering around the trading price at the beginning of the year, which is still 13% off the 52-week high.- The bull case: After getting beaten up for most of the year through early June, the announcement of the acquisition of Blue Coat helped pick Symantec's shares back up. The acquisition is projected to have significant cost synergies as well as expand Symantec's market into the rapidly growing enterprise security segment. SA author Bert Hochfield argues how the new management coming over from Blue Coat, which was previously owned by Bain Capital, along with a potential low ball on the revenue synergies, might mean good things are in store for Symantec.- The bear case: Although the market has reacted well to the deal, SA author The Value Investor contests that the price for Blue Coat was steep and will force Symantec to operate under high debt levels, while the synergies from the deal may be overhyped.Research report authored by third-party contributor and edited by Daniel Martins"

However, FY17 revenue guidance remains intact.Infosys’ strategy to focus on automation and artificial intelligence; improve its utilisation levels, gaining higher win rates and reducing its attrition rates will benefit the company.I would recommend to buy around $17±$17.5 for good capital appreciation.","Infosys (NYSE:INFY) chief operating officer (NYSE:COO) UB Pravin Rao lowered its Q1 margin guidance by 200 bps mainly on the back of higher visa and compensation costs. However, the COO said he was confident of meeting its FY2017 revenue growth guidance of 11.5%-13.5%. He Rao told investors that overall demand remains ""volatile"" and weaker spending in the energy and insurance sector will weigh on the company's performance over the next few quarters. He also highlighted on the ongoing slowdown of its enterprise resource planning (ERP) and business process outsourcing (BPO) businesses, and said that the company was working to turn around those businesses. The retail sector performance also remained soft last few quarters especially across the US and Europe.Mr Rao says commoditisation has taken place in the industry; the management is betting on automation and artificial intelligence platform to counter balance this commoditization. According to NASSCOM, the industry growth this year is expected to grow between 12%-14% driven by softness in some sectors. Infosys also expects FY17 revenue growth to be around 11.5%-13.5%, almost in line with the industry average. However, the management expects the ongoing heavy investments in automation and artificial intelligence to pay off significantly over the coming years.Q4FY16 performance highlights- healthy numbers were recorded- Infosys posted revenues of US$2,454mn, up 1.6% qoq. In constant currency terms, the growth is of ~1.9%. Volume growth during the period is of 2.4% qoq. EBIT margin improved to 25.5% vs. 24.9% in 3QFY2016, an expansion of 60bps qoq. The company posted a net profit of $3,597cr up 3.8% qoq.The utilization levels (including trainees) improved to 74.7% versus 74.2% in 3QFY2016, while the attrition rate was also better at 17.3% versus 18.1% in 3QFY2016. For FY2017, the company has given a revenue guidance at 11.5%-13.5% in constant currency terms and 11.8%-13.8% in US$ terms at March 31, 2016 exchange rates.In terms of geography, North America grew 0.6%, Europe grew 3.6%, India grew 11.1%, while RoW grew by 3.2% sequentially in constant currency terms.Infosys added 89 new clients (gross additions) this quarter, taking its total active client base to 1092.The company added 8 clients in the US$100-200mn bracket. Infosys bagged new deals with TCV of US$757mn this quarter. New deals with TCV for FY2016 stood at US$2.8bn, 42% higher than in FY2015.Infosys' 2020 vision: Infosys aims to achieve a goal of $20 billion revenues, EBIT margin of 30% and per capita revenues of $80,000 FY2020. Although the goal is ambitious it would help in keeping the ongoing performance intact.Infosys' strategy to focus on automation and artificial intelligence; improve its utilisation levels, gaining higher win rates and reducing its attrition rates will benefit the company. However, the company needs to be cautious of the small players (like EPAM/Luxoft) who are gaining market share in the growing trend of analytics and digital spending. The IT industry is evolving and so is the business model and client spending. The client spending has been increasing more in the digital space and the companies which are able to capture this demand would benefit the most. I think Infosys is a good buy on dips. The recent ongoing stock price correction on earnings' warning gives a good entry point to the investors. But I would recommend to wait and buy around $17-$17.5 for good capital appreciation as the company is expected to grow in line with the industry's average and not does not deserve a significant premium. The recent softening of dollar would also weigh on the company's performance. However, Infosys has been a promising story until now and will continue to remain so"
3866016,39791,2016-02-04T15:12:13-05:00,Infosys has shown sharp increase in top line growth outperforming its peers.Major organization changes under the new CEO have started to show both qualitative and quantitative results.Stock is cheap compared to peers with improving growth trajectory and management planning a 150% growth in revenue over the next five years.,"Infosys (NYSE:INFY) was among the first to take advantage of India's IT outsourcing growth story. The company was run by a great management and clocked high double digit growth rates with fat operating margins prior to 2011. Infosys was a pioneer in establishing India as a hub of IT services outsourcing and was followed by a number of other home grown companies such as Wipro (NYSE:WIT), TCS, Cognizant (NASDAQ:CTSH) and others. The Indian IT industry is now worth more than $150 billion, most of which comes from exports to USA and Europe. However in the last few years, Infosys's growth rate has faltered as other companies such as TCS and CTSH have outpaced its performance. The retirement of top management such as Narayan Murthy in 2011 was a key reason behind the lackadaisical performance of Infosys. It was only after Narayan Murthy returned to the helm in 2013 that a radical restructuring took place in Infosys. A number of top executives were asked to leave, as they were apparently not adding much value to the organization.Though a deviation from the usual organization policy, a CEO was brought from outside to bring in new thinking. Vishal Sikka, who was a top executive in SAP, was made the CEO of Infosys in 2014. In the last couple of years, Infosys has shown a tremendous turnaround and has also beaten analyst expectation on growth in the last few quarters. Infosys also showed better competitiveness, by beating top competitors such as Wipro and TCS in the growth rates. Cognizant is another one of the best technology stocks in the USA listed markets. Given the new management and higher growth rates, I think Infosys should also be a part of an IT investors' portfolio.Why Infosys is a buy again1) Great Management under CEO Vishal Sikka - Vishal Sikka has been a great CEO for Infosys, taking the company to higher-than-industry growth rates. The company under his leadership has started to show increased revenues and net profits, driven by its focus on automation and operational efficiency. The company has also started focusing on artificial intelligence and other digital technology under Sikka's leadership. The CEO has also curbed high attrition rates in the company by taking various steps to make the company a more desirable place to work in.2) Better Employee Morale - The attrition rates have started to improve. It decreased from 21.3% in December 2014 to 13.4% in the most recent quarter. Sikka undertook various measures to improve the attrition, such as giving 5000 promotions within the first week at his job and increasing employee engagement. The company also executed ten out of more than 2500 ideas generated by employees, under a crowd sourcing program. Many internal processes related to employees have also been made simple. This has made the employees more confident and innovative. The employee utilization levels have improved from 74% in March 2013, to more than 80% in December 2015.3) Cutting through Red tape and focusing on digital services - At Infosys, employees from anywhere across the globe can chat with their fellow employees whenever they want, without the need of blocking calendars or scheduling meetings. The company is working on a new project called ""Zero Distance"", which will make communication more easy and convenient, breaking the five layered organizational structure into a two-tiered one. Infosys digital services aim at improving the way customers interact with enterprises. The company was named a brand for digital services in USA, in a report.Infosys4) Faster growth rate than competitors - INFY continued on its growth track, at a time when peers like TCS have been a bit sluggish. Infosys was successful in retaining 3% sequential business volume growth in the December 2015 quarter, compared to TCS which remained flat. INFY's dollar denominated revenue posted higher growth on a quarterly basis, when compared to TCS. The company showed a revenue increase of 15.2% on a y/y basis and increased FY16 guidance to 16.2%-16.6%. This is faster than guidance given by major Indian outsourcers such as Wipro, TCS and HCL Technologies. Infosys is targeting a $20 billion annual revenue target by 2020, which means a growth of 150% from the current revenue run rate. Given the recent results and strong management focus, this target does not look outlandish.Data from Infosys PRRisksa) Slowdown of the global economy - The weakness in the Chinese economy has already slowed down the entire commodity market. There is a big secondary effect on other economies too, which depend heavily on China for their exports. Infosys has not been adversely affected till now as most of its export earnings come from USA and UK, which have been relatively resilient. However if the global economy slows down further, then growth from USA and UK will also fall.b) Threat from cloud computing - All IT service companies are facing threat from cloud computing, in which software is delivered through the Internet. This frees up companys' resources, as they do not have to maintain expensive hardware and software in-house. It is thus a big threat to IT servicing companies, which depend on software and hardware maintenance revenues.Valuation is not expensive given its better growth prospectsThe stock is currently trading at more than $17 and has returned ~6% YTD (Feb 2016), which has been better than peers. The company has a market capitalization of ~$40 billion, with a P/E of ~21x. In contrast, Cognizant has a P/E of more than 23x.Source: Google FinanceConclusionInfosys was a bad stock to own in the last few years, as other competitors such as TCS, HCL Technologies and Cognizant outperformed it both operationally and financially. Their stock returns had also been much better than Infosys. The main factor behind the lagging performance in the past was its top management, which was not dynamic enough. However, the new CEO has infused new dynamism into the company and results are already showing up. Infosys has again become a good IT stock to keep in one's portfolio, in my view. The valuations are not challenging, given the high growth trajectory being projected."
4040437,102669,2017-01-29T09:46:39-05:00,"The recent pullback in price presents investors a great entry point.
        10+ years of consistent growth in sales, profits, free cash flow and dividends.
        Favorable valuation relative to peers and historic multiples.","With the market indices trading at or near all-time highs, it is unusual to find a steady performing, large cap stock trading near its historic low multiples and paying a respectable dividend. Infosys Ltd (NYSE:INFY), however, is such a stock. INFY is based in Bangalore, Karnataka, India, and is one of several India-based information technology consulting and outsourcing companies. INFY shares are actually American Depository Receipts, which trade on the NYSE on a 1:1 basis with the underlying Indian shares. The company has been around since 1981, and the company has a long history of steady and consistent growth and performance as shown in the chart below. INFY has posted an increase in sales in each of the past ten years, generates substantial profits and free cash flow every year, and has paid a dividend each year for at least the past decade, has no debt and ample liquidity.Source: Author Chart - data from INFY Forms 20-F and 6-KWhile INFY's financial reporting can be a bit intimidating (the annual report form 20-F is over 130 pages), the company publishes timely financial reports in both Indian rupees and in US dollars, and the business model is relatively simple to understand.INFY provides project based consulting and outsourcing services. Most of its employees are based in India, and the vast majority are software professionals. INFY employs over 194,000 people (more than Microsoft and Google combined) and 94% of the employee base is comprised of software professionals. Most of INFY's project engagements are contracted on a fixed-price, fixed-timeframe basis. Margins are generally steady and resilient if management is diligent about managing the staffing of the projects. Staffing costs are almost 80% of cost of sales, so staff ""utilization"" rates are a key metric in driving operating profits. INFY's reported ""utilization"" rate has exceeded 80% for the past seven consecutive quarters, and was 81.9% in the quarter ended December 31, 2016 (Source: INFY Conference Call). Sales and administrative costs are a meager 10% of revenues.INFY's business mix is relatively steady. Approximately 70% of sales coming from North America. About 27% of revenues are generated from the financial services industry, 22% from energy and utility companies, and 16% from retail, consumer products, and logistics companies. This mix has remained relatively consistent for the past several years. Days sales outstanding are typically 60-65 days, but did bump up a bit to 69 days in the most recent quarter - this is something to watch going forward.INFY is often compared to Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp (NASDAQ:CTSH) and Wipro Ltd (NYSE:WIT) as CTSH is comparable in market cap and service offering and WIT is another India-based IT firm. INFY's current valuation metrics compare favorably to these companies, as well as a number of other publicly traded IT consulting and outsourcing firms.Source: Author Chart - Data from Yahoo! Finance as of January 27, 2017INFY generates higher operating and EBITDA margins than most of its peers, offers a higher yield, and generates a higher ROE (with no debt), yet trades at a lower P/E and EV/EBITDA. Why?INFY shares tumbled from about $15.25 to under $14 after releasing its December (9mo) results. While it was a solid quarter, INFY reported that third quarter revenue declined 1.4% from the second quarter, largely as a result of lower revenues on projects with Royal Bank of Scotland (NYSE:RBS). Management noted that revenue for the nine months was still up 8.3% from a year ago (all comparisons in $US) and emphasized that the impact of the RBS project was largely behind them. Management also reaffirmed margin guidance for the full year.The potential impact of the Trump administration's promise to tighten immigration requirements is also a concern, as a number of INFY's employees work in the US on H-1B or L-1 visas. Management acknowledged this issue on the recent conference call, but also indicated it was too early to tell what the new administration will do with regard to visa requirements, and stated the INFY was actively seeking to add appropriately skilled employees in the US where possible.Currency risk is always an issue with international companies. INFY generates most of its revenues in US dollars and British pounds, but pays most of its expenses, and maintains most of its cash and investments in Indian rupees. INFY actively hedges its currency risk and reports that a 1% change in the value of the rupee versus its currency benchmark results in about a 0.50% change in INFY's operating margin. INFY also maintains significant investment balances in Indian rupees which are earning in excess of 7%.Most of INFY's assets walk out the door each day, as they are largely a ""people"" operation, with modest capital investment requirements. INFY has grown its business both organically and through acquisitions, but less than 10% of its stated equity is in goodwill and intangibles. Still, tangible book value is less than $4/shr which may turn away some investors.Finally, the ADRs may trade at a discount or premium to the underlying shares trading on the Indian exchange. Dividends on the ADRs (and the underlying shares) are declared and paid two times a year - typically paid in June (about 60% of the total) and October (about 40%). Management has indicated that the dividend will be ""up to 50%"" of the prior year after tax income (up from ""up to 40%""). The dividends paid in calendar 2016 totaled just over $0.375/shr, so a modest bump is possible later this summer. The current yield in about 2.7%, which is slightly better than the current rate on a ten year US Treasury.Only the ""known unknown"" surrounding the incoming Trump administration and the impact on potential H-1B and L-1 visas seems to be an issue unique to INFY that would warrant a discount in valuation to its peers.INFY is also trading at or near historic lows relative to its own past valuation. The chart below shows INFY's trading range and valuation over the past ten years using a number of financial metrics. For each metric used, INFY shares are trading at or below the median low valuation metric.Source: Author chart. Underlying data obtained from INFY Forms 20-F and adjusted for stock splits.I believe the current pullback in price presents a great buying opportunity for investors seeking to invest in a quality company at a valuation below its peers, the general market, and its own historic trading multiples.For those interested in an option strategy, INFY shares can be purchased at $14, and the July $16 call sold for $0.25. If the shares are below $16 at the July expiration, the option premium and the June dividend payment should produce a ""yield"" of about 3.7% for the six month holding period. If called, the $2 stock gain and $0.25 premium would produce a 16% gain (before transaction costs and without assuming collection of the expected June dividend)."
3365275,89516,2015-07-28T15:01:31-04:00,"The market is growing, fundamentals are strong but all seems to be already priced in.Investors should be aware of the usually stronger Q1 results followed by deteriorating growth in Q3 and Q4.The conservative long term return on an investment in INFY is about 6% that is not enough to cover for the unknown risks.","The IT market is growing and INFY is fairly positioned to grasp the opportunitiesAccording to Gartner Worldwide IT spending is going to grow at about 2.5% a year for the next 5 years in constant-currency terms (Figure 1). Dollar value IT spending is going to fall by 5.5% in 2015 due to the strong dollar. As we cannot predict currency swings we should stick to the knowledge that the industry is going to grow and as we will see later Infosys (NYSE:INFY) is in a great position to grasp the benefits of market growth.Figure 1. Dollar value IT spending forecastInorganic and organic growthINFY has various strategies for growth. The $4.75 billion cash position allows INFY to grow through acquisitions. One of the examples is investing through the Infosys Innovation fund where just last week they invested in ANSR consulting. An example of a bigger acquisition is the $120 million acquisition of Kallidus.Combining market growth with M&A growth INFY targets $20 billion in revenues for 2020. No long term debt should also help in acquiring bigger companies. But at the current growth rate INFY will not reach the revenue target, thus more growth and more acquisitions should follow and this adds some risks because management might overpay acquisitions.One of the main issues with INFY is the high staff turnover rate which has been brought down from 23.4% in Q1 2015 to 13.4% in Q4 2015 and remains at 14.1% in Q1 2016 despite the 8% offshore and 2.5% onsite wage increase. But the 9% turnover decrease is remarkable and must be a result of hiring last year Vishal Sikka as CEO who was previously an executive board member at SAP (NYSE:SAP).Fundamental analysisA great sign for any investor is when a company has no long term debt and it gets even better when the company is a growing one. INFY has strong operating margins in the range of 25%. The cash flow is strongly positive year on year. The book value is low ($3.7) but this is normal for an IT company. What should be liked by dividend investors is the policy to payout 50% of after tax earnings that brings to a current 2.7% yield which is not bad for a growth company. Revenues are growing constantly, by 5.5% in 2015 and 11% in 2014. With the strong 2016 Q1 revenue growth of 4.5% quarter to quarter equal rates could be expected in 2016. A warning should be issued here because INFY in the last years always had great Q1 results but also usually failed to continue with the same tempo. In Q3 and Q4 the growth has been tapering off for the last four to five years. As this is a main focus of the new CEO investors should be very happy if he achieves the same improvement as with the employee turnover issue but as he puts it he is ""cautiously optimistic"" in relation to the growth deterioration in Q3 and Q4.A rule of thumb forecastThe current EPS is $0.88. If we take a conservative yearly growth rate of 8% in 2020 the EPS should be $1.29. Combining that with a conservative PE ratio of 15 we get a price of 19.39 thus a 3% yearly return. If we add the current 2.7% dividend yield that should grow to about 4% based on the current price and the expected earnings growth the investment return on INFY is not that high (about 6%) even if it is a great company. The current 2.7% dividend yield is expected to grow and the policy of paying out 50% of after tax earnings should make INFY interesting for dividend reinvestment portfolios where price dips due to weaker quarters would enable good entry points and higher yields.ConclusionINFY looks like a great company but it lacks the potential to become a great investment. All the potential upside seems to be already priced in thus leaving the downside open to negative news. Investors willing to make INFY part of their portfolio should keep an eye on it and buy after bad news, especially after the weaker end year quarters."

While the result analysis has already been done here at Seeking Alpha, this article discusses the reasons for preferring Infosys over Wipro considering a 2-3 year time horizon.The first reason to believe that Infosys will outperform Wipro in terms of stock upside is the current cash position for Infosys as compared to Wipro. As of December 2014, Infosys had a cash position of $5.5 billion as compared to Wipro's cash position of $3.2 billion.The cash position is very relevant in the discussion as cash will be the biggest growth driver for Infosys in the next 2-3 years. In order to elaborate my point, below are excerpts from Infosys CEO Vishal Sikka's comments -Before discussing the implications, I would like to add some more recent comments from Vishal Sikka -There are several important points to note here -With these points, I am certainly not suggesting that the story for Wipro is over. The company has strong fundamentals and I continue to believe that Wipro will deliver consistent growth in the coming years.However, on a relative basis, Infosys will beat Wipro in terms of revenue growth, margin expansion, innovation driven growth and inorganic growth. These factors will translate into greater stock upside for Infosys as compared to Wipro.Therefore, my view is that investors considering exposure to the Indian IT sector have Infosys as the best investment choice with a 2-3 year investment perspective. In my view, investors who have exposure to Wipro can consider switching from Wipro to Infosys in the coming months."
3390985,23164,2015-08-04T13:34:49-04:00,I remain bullish on Infosys as the company focuses on innovation for client value creation and new client acquisition.Infosys still has a cash position of $4.8 billion that is likely to be used for inorganic growth in technologies such as design thinking and artificial intelligence.The acquisition of Panaya in 2015 is already yielding results and is likely to aid robust client addition in the coming quarters.,"On July 24, 2015, Infosys (NYSE:INFY) was upgraded by Macquarie from neutral to outperform. I share similar bullish views on Infosys from a medium to long-term perspective and this article discusses some key factors that can trigger strong stock upside for Infosys.I must mention at the onset that Infosys reported strong first quarter results on July 21, 2015 and the stock surged on results announcement. However, I will not focus on any headline result numbers in this article. Instead, this article will discuss the finer points that make Infosys an attractive investment to consider.The first revenue growth and stock upside trigger for Infosys is inorganic growth. Infosys is already aggressive in terms of acquisition and I believe that there are many more acquisitions to come in the foreseeable future. In February 2015, Infosys acquired New Jersey-based automation technology firm Panaya for $200 million. In April 2015, Infosys acquired Kallidus for $120 million. The following points are worth noting related to these acquisitions and potential acquisitions -First, the acquisitions are targeted at innovative technology and I believe that new technology will be the game changer for Infosys in the coming years. Acquisition of new technology will also give Infosys an edge over peers such as Wipro (NYSE:WIT).Second, the impact of innovative technology and its impact on business are already evident. In the last quarter, Infosys won 15 new deals that are joint offerings with Panaya. I expect these innovation driven acquisitions to bring bigger business for Infosys.Third, Infosys still has $4.8 billion in cash that will be utilized for acquisition in the space of field of design thinking and artificial intelligence. These potential acquisitions will have an incremental impact on revenue and EPS without any dilutive effect.Fourth, Infosys has launched a $500 million innovation fund for investment in disruptive new technologies. I believe this can be a long-term game changer. More importantly, the acquisitions coupled with the innovation fund points to a new growth approach for Infosys that is largely innovation driven than process driven.It is important to mention here that NASSCOM expects India's IT growth at 12% to 14% for FY15 and Infosys has guided for revenue growth of 10% to 12% (in constant currency) for FY16. Therefore, Infosys is gradually catching up with the industry growth rate and I believe that recent acquisitions and potential acquisitions in the coming quarters will help Infosys grow in line with the industry. In other words, the company's revival is strong after new CEO Vishal Sikka assumed office over a year ago.It is also important to mention here that for an IT organization, employees are the core asset and I see several positive developments on that front -First, quarterly annualized attrition for 1Q16 was 14.2% as compared to 23.4% in 1Q15. Infosys has therefore done well on employee retention front and I attribute this to good bonus for employees, promotions and the change in the organization towards aggressive innovation driven growth.Second, Infosys is increasing its capabilities in Design Thinking across the organization with the company having trained more than 39,000 employees to date. I believe that scaling up of employees to the next level of work from core process driven work will enable Infosys to attract more clients and retain existing clients.Coming to a long-term view, Infosys management has indicated that it targets revenue of $20 billion by 2020. Considering current revenue of $8.7 billion, Infosys is likely to grow at a CAGR of 14% until 2020. As I mentioned above, the management also expects to lead industry growth by 2017. Therefore, the growth trajectory in the coming years will be robust and it will be backed by inorganic growth as well as innovation driven organic growth.On the organic growth front, it is important to mention that in 1Q16, Infosys signed six large deals with a TCV of $688 million and the client addition in the quarter was the second highest since FY01. This is a clear indication of strong traction in business as the company focuses on higher client value creation. In the coming quarters, I expect new client addition to remain robust aided by the acquisition of Panaya and Kallidus. This will serve as a strong catalyst for organic growth.In my view, the company's operating margin might remain range bound during this period as relatively higher margin orders are likely to be offset by higher spend on employee retention and training.In conclusion, Infosys is at an early stage of transformation from core process driven company to a company that adds significant value to all processes through innovation. As this transformation progresses, I expect robust client addition and strong revenue growth. Current levels are therefore attractive for investment from a medium to long-term perspective."

(NYSE:INFY) is a consulting, technology and outsourcing company with a market cap of $38.64B. The company's solutions include application development and maintenance, independent validation services, infrastructure management, engineering services comprising product engineering and life cycle solutions and business process management. In the past Fiscal year, Infosys has focused on improving its operational efficiency which is evident from its strong profit margins in FY15. This is also validated from its Q2'16 results highlighting better operational efficiency of the company. Like the other big IT giants, Infosys too continued pursuing its strategy of acquisitions and investments and its latest acquisition of Panaya significantly enhances its automation capabilities in its packaged software offerings. Other latest acquisitions include acquisition of Kallidus Inc., a leading provider of digital experience solutions. Besides acquisitions, Infosys also invested in Nova, which is a venture between Infosys and DreamWorks animation; a leader in animation technology and animation films. Infosys is focused on simplifying and improving its processes to become a highly connected and innovative organisation and is actively pursuing its strategies to achieve its goals and targets. Please find below the data of Infosys Peers:.Source: Morning Star.comEarnings outlook:Now let's have a close look at the Infosys's Q2'16 results, which has its share of both good and bad. Q2'16 reported better than consensus expectations results, with revenue up by 5.9% and net profit up by 7% (compared to a consensus forecast). Clearly, Infosys reported a robust growth in its revenue and profit margins. The dollar revenue rose 6%, the steepest in the last 16 quarters to $2.392B. Post Q2'16 results, brokerage house JP Morgan retained its ""Overweight"" rating on the stock as it believed Infosys continued showing consistency in operating performance with the second consecutive quarter comprising a strong earnings growth. However, Infosys CFO Rajiv Bansal resigned and the company has also lowered its dollar revenue guidance for the full year to 6.9%-8.4% from7.2% - 9.2% earlier, owing to the dollar depreciation. Since over 60% of Infosys revenue comes from the US, a currency fluctuation can have a big impact on the revenue. The other areas of concern were a decline in volume growth, a slight uptick in attrition rate and an ESOP that could lead to a 2% equity dilution going forward. Despite a few roadblocks, the IT giant continued growing its clients base in Q2'16 with an addition of 82 more clients during the quarter, taking total number to 1011. Besides growing its client base, Infosys also signed 5 big deals worth $983M with TCV during the quarter. The picture below shows the historical robust growth of Infosys from FY11 to FY15:Source: Infosys Annual report 2015Infosys has 6 diversified business segments namely, Financial services and insurance , Manufacturing, Energy and utilities, communication and services, Retail, consumer packaged goods and logistics ,Life sciences and health care and growth markets. The revenue composition of the business segments in FY15 is as follows:Source: Infosys Annual report 2015The growth in revenue is dependent on many factors such as the volume growth and a number of projects executed for clients. Though Infosys Q2'16 results had shown a dip in volume growth, the IT giant continued building a strong client base till H1'16 and the same is expected in the coming fiscal year as well. However, the challenges faced by Infosys are pricing pressures, currency fluctuations and attrition. The technology services market is highly competitive and caused a tremendous pricing pressure on the IT giant. However on attrition front, a bigger concern could be for the senior management. Currently, under the leadership of Dr Vishal Sikka, Infosys is doing the right thing to invest in the digital space (both organic and inorganic), and improving client engagements through design thinking, automation and innovation.Based on the above facts, the management guidance and my own analysis, I estimate FY16 sales at $9234M (FY15:$8711M) and the operating profit at $2355M (FY15:$2258M). However, with Infosys entering a soft phase of growth in H2'16, I maintain a cautious stand and have estimated a 6% YOY growth in sales, assuming EBIT margin at 26%.Valuation:Valuation based on Enterprise value:Between FY13 and FY15, Infosys has traded on an average EV/EBIT multiple of 19. Based on this multiple and FY16E EBIT, I have calculated the price of $23. My estimates and calculations are based on my analysis and the management's guidance. The calculations are explained in the matrix below:All the figures above are in $M, except target priceSource: Contributor's own calculationsValuation based on P/EBetween FY13 and FY15, Infosys has traded on an average P/E multiple of 23. Based on this multiple and FY16EPS, I have arrived at a target price of $22. My estimates and calculations are based on my analysis and the management guidance. The calculations are explained in the matrix below:Source: Contributor's own calculationsHowever, the most interesting thing to note about Infosys is that it is a zero debt company with no financial leverage. Infosys is a cash rich company and had a cash equivalent of $4.859B in FY15. With its strong cash inflows, the company has done significant acquisitions lately and has continued its inorganic growth. Also, the company ROE and ROI have been consistent around 23% and 32% respectively in FY15 (compared to historical years) and the same is expected in the coming fiscal years as well on account of improving profit margins and robust growth in revenue. Therefore, Infosys has been consistently rewarding its investors with lucrative returns and Infosys's focus to improve its operational efficiency promises the same in the future as well.Source: Contributor's own calculationsIf I analyze the above table, I clearly see a significant improvement in profit margins in FY15, compared to FY14. This validates Infosys's successful strategy of improving its operational efficiency, suggesting an improvement in the profit margins is visible in the coming fiscal years. Infosys is currently trading at FY16 estimated P/E of 19 and is inexpensive compared to its peers with Cognizant (NASDAQ:CTSH) and Wipro (NYSE:WIT) trading at a P/E multiple of 26 and 23 respectively. However, based on the other valuation multiples like P/BV, P/S and EV/EBITDA, which are calculated based on the current price of Infosys i.e. $18, it is clear that the recent correction in its stock price makes it an attractive buy for both small term and long term investors. Despite the minor headwinds like the attrition and a dip in the volume growth, one should not ignore strong fundamentals of a cash cow like Infosys and its growing inorganic growth. Also, please have a look at a table below, which speaks volumes about Infosys's attractive valuation compared to its peers.Source: Google Finance.comStrong Catalysts1.A well established leader among Indian Offshore companies.2.Strong Relationship with Clients: Almost 98% of its business comes from existing customers.3.New and emerging market in China as the country undergoes a huge industrial revolution.4.Strategic alliance between Infosys and Schlumberger gives the IT company access to lucrative business in the gas and oil industries.5.Strategic Acquisition: Infosys will continue to acquire firms which can add to its top lineTechnical analysisNow what I really can't ignore is a strong technical chart of Infosys! Post Q2'16 results, Infosys corrected almost 10% but again in the last 2 trading sessions, the stock has clearly bounced back. The latest correction in the stock prices is a clear opportunity for the investors to buy Infosys at the current level. Technically, in the last 2 trading sessions, the stock has formed two bullish candles i.e., ""Hanging man"" and ""Green marubozu"" and managed to close at the day's high. Given the stock trading above the upward trend line, one should expect a quick recovery to around $19, a tad below the resistance formed around $19.46. Currently, the stock has a 52 week high of 19.46. However, based on the strong technical indicators and fundamentals, I clearly see Infosys making new highs in the near future.Source: 4-traders.comBased on both fundamental and technical analysis, I set the 'Buy' recommendation with a 6M -12M target price of $23."
2915836,27231,2015-02-13T11:27:10-05:00,"Infosys's business presents low-to-moderate risks to the investor, with future prospects as the main point of interest.The market sells INFY at a high 64% premium for its future growth, but this is appropriate given outstanding fundamentals and extremely fast historical growth.The 31% margin of safety is more than adequate for INFY's risks.Expectations implied by the market and Wall Street consensus are very pessimistic relative to the historical record.However, foreign exchange plays a very prominent role in the market value of INFY's stock, especially any further depreciation in the Indian rupee.","Overview:Infosys Limited (NYSE:INFY) is a business IT consulting firm that provides consulting, technology, outsourcing, and engineering services to clients in over 30 countries. An efficient company, Infosys takes pride in its ability to divide projects into minute components, execute them all simultaneously around the clock, around the world, and optimize both cost structure and lead times. Its clientele spans a multitude of industries, as a variety of businesses turn to technology as a driver of enterprise value, smooth operations, and continued innovation. (Source: 2014 Annual Report)In this article, we briefly discuss Infosys as a solid opportunity in the business IT space. The company enjoys superior fundamental performance, presenting a low-to-moderate risk to the long-term value investor. Although the market is selling INFY's stock at a high premium for the company's future, we think it is appropriate given its past record.However, foreign exchange rates play a prominent role in the market value of INFY's stock just as much as the underlying business's ability to repeat its extremely fast growth over the decade to come. Expectations embedded in the market price and in Wall Street's consensus opinions - most of which are neutral - diverge significantly from Infosys's business history, but after some scrutiny, we believe this is greatly driven by FX uncertainty.Nonetheless, the 31% margin of safety currently embedded in the market price is more than adequate for the risks being taken.Risk Assessment:We refer to a risk assessment performed by Obsido Analytics to evaluate Infosys Limited. It is a balanced scorecard that evaluates the past performance, historical volatility, and underlying trend of over 40 different risk factors in multiple factor groups and utilizes proprietary standards to systematically score these risk factors across five levels. We believe the work performed by Obsido Analytics adds value for the reader, as it adequately defines the major risks in any business, accurately measures them, and succinctly describes them in an easily comprehensible format.Source: Obsido AnalyticsLooking at this table, we can see Infosys Limited poses low-to-moderate risks to the long-term investor, overall. Creditworthiness is impeccable, with very little leverage. Working capital management is very strong, asset turnovers are decent, and profitability and competitiveness are not major wellsprings of concern. However, future prospects are notable, and this is the only factor group that was rated a moderate risk.We consider ""future prospects"" from two perspectives. First, we consider the possibility the company may surprise Wall Street's expectations for cash flow per share, returns on assets, and returns on equity over the next three fiscal years. Second, we contrast Wall Street's forward 10Y EPS growth projections against the market-implied expectation of same, if the data is available.Although this cannot completely substitute for true industry research, which relay the qualitative trends and developments noted by technical and economic experts in an industry, and a thorough, qualitative perusal of the firm's strategic focus and adherence to its organizational values, appraising the detailed expectations set by Wall Street's sell-side research allows us to grasp the future prospect of the company by proxy.The table below details Reuters' ""smart"" compilation of analyst estimates (which already adjusts for the analysts' track record and level of experience) for Infosys's financial performance, looking ahead over the next three fiscal years.Source: Thomson Reuters. Analyst estimates for revenues and degree of profitability were also included for clarity behind the three major metrics used for appraising Wall Street's expectations.Infosys's cash flow per share is expected to grow at a compounded rate of 10.4% a year towards FY2017. This would be supported by the 11.4% forward 3Y CAGR in sales revenues, better profitability, and better turnover ratios.Returns on invested capital - defined as either total assets or total equity - is expected to fall around 19% or 24%, respectively. Both are excellent figures by themselves, and if INFY's ROICs are of any indication, maintenance at this level breaks the downward trend and keeps the company competitive against competitors such as Tata Consultancy.Source: Thomson Reuters, Calculations by Obsido AnalyticsHowever, Wall Street does not expect any big surprises over the next three years.We also compared the market-implied expectations for EPS growth over the next 10 years against those expected by the sell-side analysts working at large firms. Wall Street expects EPS to grow 8.75% a year, whereas the market price implies growth of 9.91% a year over the same time frame, demonstrating a difference of 116 basis points (Source: Thomson Reuters). We find this gap disappointing.Source: Thomson ReutersShortening our time frame to a five-year period, we see 220 bps gap between Wall Street and the market's forward expectations. The similarity shown by the 5-year and 10-year outlooks places stronger emphasis on caution, as it suggests the four straight years of 20+% year-on-year revenue growth enjoyed by Infosys since FY 2011 may come to an end, ushering in a period of considerably slower growth.Valuation Analysis:Proceeding forward, we ran our valuation analysis using a risk-adjusted WACC of 13.88%, a terminal growth rate equal to 8.8% in long-term inflation (India), a FCF margin of 18.70%, which represents the long-term average, and a competitive advantage period of 10 years to account for exceptional RNOAs and ROEs, high GPA and OPA ratios, as well as the slow declines in same over time. Enterprise values, as computed, are subject to a positive INR265 billion ($4.31 billion) adjustment that accounts for non-operating cash, debt, and dilution, as well as other extraneous factors like deferred tax liabilities. This overall adjustment corresponds to INR231 ($3.76) per share. The USD/INR exchange rate was assumed to be INR61.42, the average of the past eight quarters.Source: Obsido Analytics. US dollar values. Valuations are based on a USD/INR FX rate of INR61.42.In a steady-state scenario, we pegged sustainable sales at INR492.65 billion (approx. $8 billion), holding profit margins steady at 18.70% as provided above. Capitalizing the profits and adjusting them will yield a INR932 billion equity value, or INR812 per share, translated to $13.22 per share.In a growth scenario, using the conservative assumptions as defined above, we further presumed a CAGR for sales of 14.6% over the next nine years, which is 40% lower than the historical record from medium- and long-term time horizons. This presumes FCF growth of 14.5% a year, which is also conservative with respect to INFY's history, but depends on INFY's ability to sustain its growth trajectory above even 12% through its business IT initiatives, particularly outsourcing, end-to-end solutions, and intellectual property services. The result is an equity value of INR3.75 trillion (approx. $61 billion), or INR3,265 per share, translated to $53.16 per share.Before we move on, we'd like to point out that INFY is trading at INR2,278 per share as of February 10th, or roughly $36.33 per share.The gap between Net Assets and Stagnation confirms the strengths of Infosys's competitive advantages and management skill, as these drive 49% of the firm's earnings power. The fact goodwill is merely 4% of total assets shows the company had fought for its economic position organically, rather than acquisitively.Comparing Stagnation to the market price produces a INR1,466 (approx. $24) difference. We interpret this to mean that 64% of Infosys's market price contains a premium that investors pay for Infosys's future growth, and this is supported by the firm's fundamental performance to date.The two-stage DCF H-Model used to produce our estimated intrinsic value shows that the market is selling Infosys Limited at a satisfying 31.4% discount to intrinsic value and implies a potential upside of nearly 46% over the long run. We find this appropriate given the risk investors are taking on with INFY.Next, we take this DCF model and its adjustments and ""reverse-engineer"" our valuation to arrive at the expected growth implied by the market price and Wall Street's price targets for the next 12 to 18 months. As the tables below show, its expectations appear very pessimistic.Source: Obsido Analytics. Implied growth assumptions here rely on the same $/INR exchange rate as the other valuations.The expectations embedded in the market price and in Wall Street's consensus targets make assumptions very far off the historical record, with respect to sales and free cash flow growth. We believe Infosys has a good shot at surprising even Wall Street's tempered expectations over the next decade. And for what it's worth, studying the past eight quarters' price targets and share prices 6, 12, and 18 months after the target setting demonstrates Infosys's history of outperformance, surpassing price targets by 13%, 22%, and 36% on average, respectively.Source: Thomson Reuters, Presentation by Obsido AnalyticsLooking at the second chart above, however, we note that the overwhelming majority of the sell-side analysts studying the company - and there are 13 for the current quarter - are neutral about the stock's future outlook.We believe this neutrality stems from the uncertainty with respect to foreign exchange, specifically the exchange rate between the US dollar and the Indian rupee.The chart we have below shows the monthly movements in the USD/INR FX rate since Q1 2005.Source: Thomson ReutersDespite the volatility experienced by the exchange rate over this time frame, the Indian rupee has, overall, significantly depreciated. US dollar now yields twice the Indian rupee from 1995, with the latter losing around 3.4% of its value a year, compounded. If the Indian currency suddenly depreciated to INR80 USD/INR, the growth value as computed in the valuation assessment would drop 23% to $41.Perhaps it is this uncertainty that drives Wall Street's neutrality as well as its (relatively) low expectations for the company's outlook.Presently, INFY is trading at a multiple of 24.6× on its FY2014 net income, equivalent to an earnings yield of 4.06% - 66 basis points above the potential annual loss from foreign exchange. Taking this into account, we still believe that the 31% margin of safety is more than enough to account for sustained depreciation in the rupee."
2768605,23471,2014-12-19T09:53:35-05:00,"INFY is suitable for Enterprising Investors following the ModernGraham approach.According to the ModernGraham valuation model, the company is fairly valued at the present time.The market is implying a 5.75% earnings growth over the next 7-10 years, within a margin of safety relative to the rate the company has seen in recent years.","Infosys Limited (NYSE:INFY) should attract all Enterprising Investors, particularly due to the company's stable earnings growth over the last few years. That said, Benjamin Graham, the father of value investing, taught that the most important aspect to consider is whether the company is trading at a discount relative to its intrinsic value. It is through a thorough fundamental analysis that the investor is able to make a determination about a potential investment's merits. Here is a look at how Infosys Limited fares in the ModernGraham valuation model.The model is inspired by the teachings of Benjamin Graham and considers numerous metrics intended to help the investor reduce risk levels. The first part of the analysis is to determine whether the company is suitable for the very conservative Defensive Investor or the less conservative Enterprising Investor, who is willing to spend a greater amount of time conducting further research.In addition, Graham strongly suggested that investors avoid speculation in order to remove the subjective elements of emotion. This is best achieved by utilizing a systematic approach to analysis that will provide investors with a sense of how a specific company compares to another company. By using the ModernGraham method, one can review a company's historical accomplishments and determine an intrinsic value that can be compared across industries.INFY data by YChartsDefensive Investor - must pass at least 6 of the following 7 tests: Score = 5/7Enterprising Investor - must pass at least 4 of the following 5 tests or be suitable for a defensive investor: Score = 5/5Valuation SummaryKey Data:Balance Sheet - September 2014Earnings Per ShareEarnings Per Share - ModernGrahamDividend HistoryINFY Dividend data by YChartsConclusion:Infosys should satisfy the Enterprising Investor, but not the Defensive Investor. The Defensive Investor is concerned with the high PEmg and PB ratios, while the Enterprising Investor has no initial concerns about the company. Therefore, Enterprising Investors should feel very comfortable proceeding to the next part of the analysis, which is a determination of the company's intrinsic value.From a valuation side of things, the company has grown its EPSmg (normalized earnings) from $1.15 in 2011 to an estimated $1.57 for 2015. This is very strong and an impressive level of demonstrated growth which is in line with the market's implied estimate for earnings growth of 5.75% over the next 7-10 years. In fact, actual historical growth is about 7.16% per year, so the market has priced in a slight earnings drop to a more sustainable level over the long term. The ModernGraham valuation model therefore returns an estimate of intrinsic value falling within a margin of safety relative to the current price, indicating the company is fairly valued at the present time."
4003835,101408,2016-09-02T12:01:23-04:00,"Once the darling of equity markets, Infosys has been through tough times recently.First, they lowered their guidance for FY17 and then announced the loss of a marquee client.This is largely a result of the fundamental transformation in the business environment the company operates in.This article talks about the new reality facing the company and what it means for the stock's medium to long-term outlook.","It has been tough going for Infosys (NYSE: INFY) in recent times. Back in April this year, the company raised its guidance for revenue growth, but had to lower it three months later. This was mainly due to weak discretionary spending by clients on consulting services, which is a result of the current macroeconomic environment.Even before the market could come to terms with the cut in guidance, it received another jolt from the company. A month after lowering its guidance in mid-July, Infosys announced the loss of one of its marquee clients, the Royal Bank of Scotland. While the company did not disclose the impact on revenues from this event, some analysts believed the figure could be USD40 million. The company only said it would impact 3,000 jobs.The stock currently trades at $15.75, which is roughly 2.5x the post-Lehmann lows made during March 2009. However, it is at the same level as in March 2014 and 25% below the recent highs made three months back. In other words, over the last two years, depending on when you bought the stock, you either made no money or lost a good bit.INFY data by YChartsWhile that seems too bad, what about those don't own the stock? Is a 25% dip from recent highs a good time to enter? That's what we are going to explore in the rest of this article.Near term headwinds will only intensify going forward…In last Friday's analyst meet, Infosys' management mentioned that Brexit is going to hit clients' IT spending going forward. The impact on revenues from Brexit is hard to estimate but we can expect more headwinds following the RBS deal cancellation.Even without Brexit, the operating environment remains challenging for Infosys. Majority of its large clients are from the financial services sector, typically global banks, insurance and asset management companies. These large clients are under serious pressure today from regulators (Dodd-Frank, Basel III), disruptive technologies (fintech, P2P) and ultra-low interest rates. More importantly, none of these pressure points will go away anytime soon. As a result, Infosys' large deals are seeing significant cost pressures, something that management is becoming increasingly candid about with each passing quarter.…while the traditional business model stands brokenOperating out of India, Infosys and other Indian IT companies enjoyed significant cost advantages over their more illustrious global competitors, the likes of IBM (NYSE: IBM), Oracle (NYSE: ORCL), Accenture (NYSE: ACN), SAP (NYSE: SAP), Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) among others. Combined with sharp focus on service delivery, this cost arbitrage formed the basis of their value proposition. Those days are now over. Firstly, the large global peers have set up large operations bases in India and other low-cost destinations. Secondly, manpower costs in India have gone up significantly over the last two decades. The combined effect of these two factors has narrowed the cost differential to such an extent that it can no longer be the main value proposition for Infosys and its Indian peers.The changed scenario…The above two points should make it amply clear that Infosys' traditional business model is surely becoming a thing of the past. It is no longer a case of increasing billing rates, adding manpower count and increasing their utilization to fuel growth. Instead of low cost services, clients are looking for solutions tailored for this new world, solutions that address their challenges and fit within their budget constraints. This means a shift to automation and artificial intelligence (AI). A shift towards greater value addition with lower hours billed, i.e. bigger bang for the buck.…creates an uncertain new world for InfosysIn this new environment, Infosys finds itself increasingly pitted against the global IT giants. While its automation and AI capabilities are not to be underestimated, investors need to understand the company is now playing a different ball game. It neither has a great deal of expertise nor a rich legacy in the new world in which it finds itself today. Moreover, disruptive new technologies will only add to its problems. The company is making bolt-on acquisitions to increase its capabilities and stay competitive, but so are its competitors. These competitors have a history of innovation and disruption which Infosys or its India IT peers do not. Whether the company succeeds in this new environment remains to be seen.Infosys is responding to this changed environment. Its automation initiatives have eliminated the need for 3,900 full time employees in FY16, and the number is only going to increase in the coming years. Yet, rather counter intuitively, automation replacing jobs would result in a net loss of revenues in order to create cost savings for clients. While it will be a positive for margins, at a firm-wide level, margin gains through automation and AI are not a given. Such gains will ultimately depend on how successful these initiatives prove to be and how fast the company can ramp down its traditional business. In addition, operating costs continue to increase for Infosys due to ever rising H1B visa costs in the US, the largest market.Valuation does not reflect the new age realitiesThe trailing 12-month PE of Infosys is 17.30x, which is inside its peer group's mean, but not by much.

Revenue was us 5.6% to $2.2 B.The increase in earnings was driven by increase in volume, productivity and utilization rates. However, the strengthening US dollar was a headwind for the quarter, as Infosys has a strong market presence in the US.Highlights• Summary numbers: Revenues of USD 2.21 billion, net earnings of USD 522.60 million, and Earnings per Share (EPS) of USD 0.46.• Gross margins widened from 39.28% to 41.04% compared to the same quarter last year, operating (EBITDA margins) now 29.12% from 28.17%.• Ability to declare a higher earnings number?

The company's performance this period suggests an effort to boost profitability. While this is good to a point, the fact that the company's revenue performance is lower than the average of the results announced to date by its peers does not bode well from a long-term market share perspective. Also, for comparison purposes, revenues changed by 1.39% and earnings by 2.93% compared to the immediate last quarter.Revenues vs EarningsEarnings Growth AnalysisThe company's earnings growth was influenced by year-on-year improvement in gross margins from 39.28% to 41.04% as well as better cost controls. As a result, operating margins (EBITDA margins) rose from 28.17% to 29.12% compared to the same period last year. For comparison, gross margins were 41.16% and EBITDA margins were 28.74% in the quarter ending September 30, 2014.Gross Margin vs. EBITDA MarginGross Margin TrendCompanies sometimes sacrifice improvements in revenues and margins in order to extend friendlier terms to customers and vendors. Capital Cube probes for such activity by comparing the changes in gross margins with any changes in working capital. If the gross margins improved without a worsening of working capital, it is possible that the company's performance is a result of truly delivering in the marketplace, and not simply an accounting prop-up using the balance sheet.Gross Margin vs Working Capital Days.Infosys Limited Sponsored ADR's improvement in gross margins have been accompanied by a deterioration in the management of working capital. This leads Capital Cube to conclude that the improvements in gross margins are likely accounting trade-offs with the balance sheet and not strictly from operating decisions. Its working capital days have risen to 241.23 days from last year's levels of 216.38 days.Gross MarginsWorking CapitalCash vs. Earnings - Sustainable Performance?Infosys' year-on-year change in operating cash flow of 37.40% is better than its change in earnings. This suggests that the company might have been able to declare a higher earnings number. But this change in operating cash flow is lower than the average of the results announced to date by its peer group.Operating Cash Flow vs EarningsMarginsThe company's earnings growth has also been influenced by the following factors: (1) Improvements in operating (EBIT) margins from 25.40% to 27.20% and (2) one-time items. The company's pretax margins are now 32.83% compared to 30.63% for the same period last year.EBIT Margin vs Pretax MarginSupporting DataThe table below shows the preliminary results along with the recent trend for revenues, net income and other relevant metrics:Company ProfileInfosys Ltd. is a consulting, technology and outsourcing company, which provides end-to-end business solutions thereby enabling clients to enhance business performance, delivered to customers globally operating in various industry segments.

2521285,65313,2014-09-25T14:20:06-04:00,"Infosys currently has the highest aggregate ESG disclosure score compared to its top peers.Infosys outperforms Accenture on key GHG emission, energy usage, and intensity metrics.To continue leading, Infosys needs to show continuing improvement on ESG disclosures year to year.","ModernGraham recently identified Accenture (NYSE: ACN) as appropriate for Enterprising Investors, and Infosys (IN: INFY) as appropriate for Defensive or Enterprising Investors. As a potential investor, now I want to know how well these two global professional service enterprises perform beyond the financial metrics, by examining their environmental, social and governance (or ESG) or sustainability performance.Why Do Investors Value ESG Data? There is a growing body of evidence of a strong link between long-term financial performance and sustainability performance from trusted sources like Deloitte, Harvard Business Review and Global 100. See this white paper (p. 5/9) for links to these sources. Also, this summer IR magazine published the results of a study by New Amsterdam Partners that concluded that investors could improve their returns and lower the volatility of their portfolios by eliminating the stocks with the lowest ESG ratings.To drive ESG insights, best practice is to compare several companies' side-by-side, usually from within the same industry sector. In this blog, Accenture and Infosys are compared to each other, and to eight top peers on key environmental and social metrics.Table 1 below compares Infosys and Accenture on aggregate ESG disclosures between the years 2009 and 2014. Bloomberg generates the ESG disclosure score based upon how well a company discloses key ESG metrics. I like the ESG disclosure score because it provides a quick macro-read on how accountable and transparent a company chooses to be when it comes to sustainability performance. ESG scores range between zero (no disclosure) and 100 (full disclosure).TABLE 1: ESG DISCLOSURE TRENDS FOR 2009 TO 2014Infosys currently has the highest ESG disclosure score among its peers, meaning Infosys has made more robust ESG disclosures to date. However, Infosys' 2014 ESG score, based on 2013 performance, dropped eight points from 56 to 48. More research is needed to pinpoint the reason for the drop, but the drop is related to INFY's 2014 environmental and social disclosures.Accenture's ESG score has remained flat between 2009 and 2013 by remaining at 42. Accenture reports ESG data on a fiscal year basis. In March 2014, Accenture released its current ESG data for 2012-2013. Based on this, we expect that Accenture will publish its 2013-2014 ESG data in March 2015 - thus, the ""NA"" for Accenture under 2014. For this blog, we are comparing the most currently available ESG data available for these companies as reported on Bloomberg.Table 2 compares ACN and INFY on total greenhouse gas (NYSE:GHG) emissions, which include company generated GHG emissions (Scope 1) and company purchased or utility emissions (Scope 2), and also three key intensity metrics. According to Bloomberg, Infosys's Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG data has been 100% data verified. Accenture's Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG data is 20% verified.TABLE 2: KEY GHG AND ENERGY METRICSInfosys emits less GHG (Column 2) and uses less energy (Column 5) compared to Accenture, which makes sense because Infosys is a smaller enterprise compared to Accenture. However, Infosys also outperforms Accenture on GHG and energy intensity metrics. This is a fact, whether investors are analyzing the companies' GHG or energy metrics as a percentage of company sales (Column 3), or company assets (Column 4), or company profits before EBITDA (Column 6).According to the data, Accenture's GHG intensity as a percentage (%) of sales (Column 3) is 27 times higher than Infosys's. A close look at Accenture's ESG data suggests that Accenture's Scope 2 (utility) related emissions are much higher than Scope 2 emissions for Infosys.Accenture's GHG intensity as a % of total assets is 56 times greater than Infosys's. Accenture's energy intensity as a % of profit before EBITDA is 39 times greater than Infosys's. These metrics suggest that Infosys is doing a much better job addressing internal operational and energy efficiencies than Accenture, thereby directly reducing Infosys's costs to provide services.TABLE 3: KEY ENVIRONMENTAL METRICS FOR TOP PROFESSIONAL SERVICE PEERSWhen it comes to total water usage (Column 2), and total waste disposed (Column 3), Infosys uses more water and disposes off more waste than the other three peers that reported these metrics. Accenture lags by not disclosing total water usage and total waste disposed, along with about half of the peers in this benchmark.None of the professional service companies in this benchmark have disclosed their investment in sustainable operations. This metric provides investors with the operating budgets for the companies' investment in millions to address operational efficiencies, among other internal sustainability initiatives. By not providing this metric, companies miss an opportunity to demonstrate that sustainability goals and budgets are transparent and executable.At a minimum, the key environmental metrics reviewed above raise intelligent questions for investors that may require more research if you are an investor that wants to invest in companies that are committed to accountability and transparency when it comes to corporate use of natural resources in operations.Beyond the environmental footprint, key social metrics show that both Infosys and Accenture employ women in the workforce at a rate slightly above the industry average of 32% (Column 2).TABLE 4: KEY SOCIAL METRICS FOR TOP PROFESSIONAL SERVICE PEERSWhen it comes to employee diversity, which is often a mark of whether a company attracts the best and the brightest, Accenture has fewer women in management (17%)(Column 4) than it has in its workforce (36%)(Column 2), or on its board (25%)(Column 3). The same is true of Infosys, which has 26% women in management, 34% women in its workforce, but only 8% women on its board of directors.None of the 10 companies benchmarked measure the percentage of minorities in management. However, almost all of these companies have equal opportunity policies, so these key social metrics raise questions about gender parity and equal opportunity in large publicly traded professional service enterprises.Walk the Talk? According to the ESG data provided here, Infosys outperforms Accenture when it comes to measuring and reducing the company's environmental footprint and energy usage. Neither company demonstrates momentum or commitment when it comes to continuing improvement on a range of ESG disclosure and performance issues. Yet, both of these enterprises develop, sell, and deliver a wide range of sustainability solutions to their clients. Therefore, what interests me, as a potential investor, is whether these companies operate in a way that shows they walk the talk. In other words, do these companies demonstrate through sustainability performance disclosures and reporting that they really know how to compete on sustainability to drive business value? I hope that this blog will help you answer that question satisfactorily for yourself.What is ESG Data? Companies release ESG data through annual reports such as the 10K and the corporate social responsibility (CSR) report. Standard key ESG metrics help investors and other stakeholders' conduct due diligence about a company's values, leadership style, operational efficiencies and environmental footprint, employee and customer loyalty and opportunity, and community relations. Our primary source for ESG data is Bloomberg's Professional Finance and ESG database (Bloomberg). Since 2009, corporate ESG data has been available through subscription services provided by Bloomberg. With nearly 400,000 Bloomberg terminals located in financial institutions, publicly traded companies, academic institutions, and some public libraries throughout the world, this big data is available for stakeholder consumption. Therefore, if a company sees an error in their public ESG data, it should have a corporate representative contact Bloomberg and get it corrected, as it would with public financial data.Disclaimer: The author does not hold a position in any of stocks mentioned in this article, and has no plans to change that position within the next 72 hours."
2557665,23164,2014-10-13T11:57:29-04:00,"Infosys reported strong second quarter results and the strong earnings trend is likely to continue for the financial year.
        The company's cash glut will be used for acquisitions that expand the company's capabilities and enhance shareholder value.
        Infosys will focus on innovation, which can drive growth and the organization looks to position itself beyond just business processing.
        A weak rupee will be supportive of growth and margins for Infosys in the near-term.","On Friday, Infosys (NYSE:INFY) came out with strong set of second quarter numbers that beat market expectations. The stock surged by 5.7% on a strong set of financial and on a bright outlook for the current fiscal.Besides the results factor, there are several other positives that can translate into strong stock upside. This article discusses two reasons to consider exposure to Infosys at current levels.Cash Utilization is ComingAs of September 30, 2014, Infosys has cash and equivalents of $5.4 billion. There has been a long standing debate on how the cash can be utilized to create shareholder value. In the past, Infosys has paid special dividends, but the company has refrained from share buyback.Even after the second quarter results, Infosys has not indicated that there will be any share buyback in the foreseeable future. However, Infosys has declared an interim dividend of $0.49 per share. I am of the opinion that the company will increase shareholder value through higher dividends and special dividends in the past back my point.However, the main point of interest and the big positive is that the new CEO, Dr. Vishal Sikka, is looking for acquisitions. According to Sikka -The two important points to note here is that Infosys is looking for acquisitions to boost growth and the company is looking for acquisitions that are beyond their current set of BPO and KPO offerings. The $5.4 billion cash pile can be used to make some high growth technology acquisitions and I see that coming relatively soon.The company's idle cash will be put to use and this will certainly be shareholder value creating.From Processes to InnovationInfosys has been traditionally a process driven company. However, Sikka is looking beyond the processes in order to achieve a 15% to 18% long-term EPS growth that the management is aiming.As a part of the initiative to drive innovation, Infosys has already announced a $100 million fund that aims to invest in innovative ideas from inside the company and also from start-ups. Therefore, Infosys might be targeting some high growth start-ups as a part of their acquisition strategy.Further, according to Sikka -The point I want to make is that Infosys is not trying to completely re-invent itself. However, within the existing business model, the company aims to provide more innovative services that lower cost and increase efficiency for clients globally.If this can be translated into actuality, Infosys will edge ahead of peers such as Wipro (NYSE:WIT) and Tata Consultancy Services. Both these companies are close peers for Infosys and Tata Consultancy Services currently has an edge over Infosys in terms of growth. Innovation can change things for Infosys through superior client service and hence greater client acquisition.The Other Positive - Currency TrendThe current rupee dollar exchange rate trend is also positive for Infosys when it comes to considering the trend for the next few quarters. In general, rupee depreciation is good for IT services companies and rupee appreciation is negative.From levels of 58.3 per dollar in May 2014, the rupee has depreciated to current levels of 61.5 per dollar. If the rupee depreciation continues or the rupee sustains at these levels against the dollar, Infosys earnings will be impacted positively.In the second quarter, the rupee depreciated by 1.3% against the dollar and this has a positive impact of 0.3% on the operating margin. If the rupee depreciation continues, operating margin will get a further boost in the coming quarters.ConclusionInfosys is back to growth path after a series of management exits and restructuring at the top level. Vishal Sikka, who comes from SAP, seems to be the perfect man for the revival job. Under his leadership, Infosys is likely to see a transformational change when it comes to innovation driven growth and a more aggressive acquisition strategy.In the coming 1-2 years, I expect Infosys to deliver innovation for clients to enhance their efficiency and I also expect Infosys to foray into new areas through a series of acquisitions as outlined by Sikka.Investors can expect exciting times ahead for Infosys and the stock is a good buy at current levels. Infosys also offers a current dividend yield of 2.3% and I also expect the dividend payout to swell in the coming quarters."
2550255,43091,2014-10-09T07:38:05-04:00,"INFY reports earnings for its FQ2:15 tomorrow before our opening bell.
        New CEO & MD, Dr. Vishal Sikka, will be talking about INFY's outlook over the next 18-24 months which will be the focus of analysts and investors alike.
        Street expecting 3% USD denominated revenue growth, quarter on quarter.
        Given the 20% return in INFY in the last 4 months, chances of a sell-off on the news more than likely.","Infosys (NYSE:INFY), India's second largest IT/outsourcing company, will be report its earnings for its FQ:02 ended September 30 before the opening bell tomorrow.Currently the Street is expecting earnings of $0.81 per share on revenues of $2.2 billion for the September quarter. The sell-siders have modeled revenues growth of between 2-3% QoQ.For the December quarter expectations are slightly higher at earnings of $0.84 per share and revenues of $2.26 billion.For the fiscal year ending March 31, 2015, the Street is at earnings of $3.36 per share on revenues of $8.87 billion. If those numbers are achieved year on year growth will come in at 10% and 7.4% respectively. Revenues growth guidance by INFY was in the 7-9% range year on year.For the next fiscal year ending March 2016, the Street is current estimating earnings of $3.65 per share on revenues of $9.67 billion, for growth rates of 8.6% and 9% respectively.With Dr. Sikka holding his first ever earnings conference as the head honcho of INFY, it is widely expected that he will be fairly positive on the prospects for the company a couple of years down the road. The US is back on the path to economic recovery and even the European Union has looked at outsourcing with a more favorable light of late, two points which I am sure Dr. Sikka will expand on in his conference tomorrow morning. Investors will also be listening closely to what Dr. Sikka says about the company cash hoard of close to $5 billion. Those expecting a buyback or a one-time extra-ordinary cash dividend will more than likely be disappointed in my opinion unless Dr. Sikka completely reverses the course that the prior management teams had taken in order to establish his management stamp right off the bat. Chances of that happening are pretty slim given the fact that he more than likely has barely had the time to grasp everything that is going on at the company.Secondly and also importantly, the Street will be all ears as to what he says about the current horrendously high rates of attrition that INFY is seeing and how that is impacting the launch of new projects at present and going forward. What does he plan to do to bring those attrition rates down to industry norms is also something that will be closely watched.Finally and most importantly, will be what Dr. Sikka says about guidance going forward. INFY at the moment lags rivals like CTSH and TCS pretty siginificantly both in terms of top and bottom line growth. What steps will he be taking to bring INFY's growth rates at or better than industry levels? What will he do about attrition? What about the acquisition strategy going forward? These are questions that he will have to answer in the conference call come tomorrow morning.INFY shares are a couple of dollars from its 52 week high and in order to move higher on earnings, the following will have to happen:So, in summation, is INFY a buy, sell or hold going into the call? In my opinion the odds favor a slight sell-off post earnings given the fact that the shares are closer to their 52 week highs and are also up almost 20% since their May lows."
2551385,22321,2014-10-09T13:29:06-04:00,,"Yesterday Citibank downgraded Infosys (NYSE:INFY) to neutral while raising its target price from Rs 3,875 to Rs 4,065. The stock responded negatively. And today, the stock is up about 0.5% while the Sensex is up nearer 1%.Infosys has performed very well over the long-term. But of late it has underperformed the industry. For the year to 31 March 2015, it has guided dollar revenue growth of 7% to 9%. Which is nice, but it does not quite represent the growth investors dream. At the same time, the stock is not priced at a level to make value investors salivate.So far as traditional risk parameters are concerned, for Infosys I calculate the raw beta based on a five-year regression of weekly closing prices of the stock, relative to weekly closing prices of the Sensex, at 0.72, and I adjust it to 0.94 to correct the standard error and on account of the beta's tendency to converge towards one. The weekly price volatility has been at 3.76% over the past five years for the company, versus 2.35% for the Sensex. And Infosys has a five-year co-efficient of determination of 20.04 %. This suggests that 20.04% of the price change for the stock is explained by movement in the market, and the rest depends on stock specific factors.The low co-efficient of determination is not hugely attractive in a bull market: a period when investors want market risk (and rewards). But it is not a bad thing if you are expecting great stock specific news. We will hear from Vishal Sikka this week. If what he says disappoints, we could see an interesting buying opportunity. On the other hand, if he pleases markets, we could see the re-rating process for Infosys commence.Either way it is clear that Infosys is trading weak, relative to its historic valuations, and relative to the Sensex. And at such times, it is worth looking at where the stock ought to trade using history as a guide. This chart shows the annual average price (AAP), consolidated fully diluted earnings per share (EPS), annual average price divided by consolidated fully diluted earnings per share (AAP/EPS), the year-on-year change in annual average price (price change), and the year-on-year change in EPS (EPS growth) over the past ten years.As you can see, over the past decade, the stock has traded at an average AAP/EPS of 21.3, and a median AAP/EPS of 20.88. The stock was recently currently trading at Rs 3,650, at a Price/EPS of 17.81 times my consolidated EPS estimates for FY 2015. The present multiple is 3.49 below the average - a level which is 66% of one standard deviation below the long-term average. The stock is at about 8.5% over its annual average price since April 1, 2014.Infosys trades at a multiple roughly in line with the Sensex. And it has a lower beta than the Sensex. However, given the low co-efficient of determination, comparing a valuation against the benchmark index is an exercise in futility.Infosys has delivered annualized earnings growth of 18.44%, versus the 11.54% delivered by the Sensex over the period between April 1, 2004, and March 31, 2014. Investors ought to be expected to pay a premium to market multiple for this superior performance. Unfortunately, the growth at Infosys in fiscal 2013 and 2014 was low (though still better than Sensex), and more importantly forward growth expectations remain subdued (which is certainly not the case for the Sensex). Since valuation depends on future expectations we can't expect markets to pay a higher than market multiple based on past performance. How high a multiple should market participants be willing to pay?Having a lower multiple compared with historic levels does give some comfort to long-term investors. But is the present multiple at an adequate discount for the present times? For the time being, forward Rupee growth expectations are anchored at the 13% level given the company's 7% to 9% dollar revenue growth guidance. Growth at 13.03% for fiscal year 31 March 2014 was 8.4% below decade average year-on-year growth of 21.43%. The standard deviation in year-on year earnings growth was 14.84%. Thus the 8.04% decline beneath average year-on-year growth represents 56.64% of one standard deviation in the decade year-on-year growth.We know that the multiple investors have been willing to pay over the past decade has averaged 21.3 with a standard deviation of 5.26. Given the deterioration in growth and growth expectations investors ought to offer a multiple of about 2.98 (5.26 multiplied by 56.64% [decade year-on-year growth less recent growth or forward growth expectations] divided by [standard deviation in annual year-on-year growth]) lower than the 21.3 decade average. In my view, an appropriate multiple might be 18.3 (21.3 less 2.98). Based on fiscal 2015 earnings expectations of Rs 205, I arrive at a price target of Rs 3,755. Since the recent price is at Rs 3,650, the six month gain potential is unexciting. However, the 18.3 multiple applied to my fiscal 2016 earnings estimate of Rs 230 is Rs 4,214, which implies a 12 to 18 month gain of over 15%. This is a perfectly acceptable return for the quality Infosys represents. Thus, while there is no compelling reason to buy, there is no reason to sell either.Infosys has been through a rough patch for the past few years, and I expect it to emerge from that state of despondence over the coming months. Expectations change rather fast, and re-ratings occur both upwards and downwards. Positives to growth expectations will give Infosys plenty of upside from both expansion of multiples and growth expectations.If the multiple investors are willing to pay for Infosys were to revert to the 10-year AAP/EPS average, the stock would trade up to Rs 4,365 if my estimate of consolidated earnings per share for the year to 31 March 2015 of Rs 205 are accurate. A price target of Rs 4,365 implies a six month gain potential of 19.60%.Looking ahead to the year to 31 March 2016, I expect earnings to grow to Rs 230. If multiples market participants are willing to pay revert to the average of 21.3 seen over the past decade, we have an eighteen month price target of Rs 4,898: a 34% gain potential from the recent price of Rs 3,650.A gain potential of 34% in eighteen months is attractive. And given that my earnings estimates are based on growth expectations guided by Infosys at present, there is scope from further gains from actual earnings being ahead of my expectations.Disclosure: I am long Infosys, and may add positions."

The objective is to acquire new technology companies.CEO Vishal Sikka will soon outline the $5.5 billion cash utilization road map and I expect acquisitions and special dividends.Euro-area growth is one concern over the next 1-2 quarters.","Infosys (NYSE:INFY) today reported its 3Q15 results and the company did not disappoint investors. In the Indian markets, the stock surged by 5% and the stock is higher by 5% in pre-market trade in the US markets. While the key numbers are known from a result perspective, this article will focus on some of the big growth drivers coming for Infosys in the next few quarters.According to the company's CEO and MD, Vishal Sikka -Therefore, the focus for Infosys in the coming quarters will be toward innovation-driven growth that will translate into a higher and better level of customer service.In line with this focus, Infosys has announced in its 3Q15 results that the company will be expanding its ""Innovation Fund"" from $100 million to $500 million. The fund intends to invest in new technology start-ups. In particular Infosys is targeting the field of artificial intelligence, internet of things, automation and design.Another important point that has been in discussion in the past has been the company's cash position and its potential utilization. As of December 2014, Infosys had cash and equivalents of $5.5 billion. On the cash utilization plan, Vishal Sikka has said that ""the company will spell out its capital allocation plan soon.""I expect the following -Therefore, be it special dividends or acquisition, I believe that Infosys will move higher in 2015 as the company embarks on an aggressive inorganic growth strategy coupled with value creation for shareholders.Looking at some of the concerns, a deep recession in the Eurozone can negatively impact the company's growth in the next financial year. Also from a currency perspective, the company's sequential revenue growth in 3Q15 was adversely impacted by 1.8% due to the dollar appreciation against other major currencies.While the dollar appreciation against the rupee is positive for Infosys, the dollar moving higher against the euro can be negative. Therefore, the extent of the slowdown in the Eurozone will impact the company's performance in the coming financial year.Overall, the sentiment remains positive for Infosys into 2015 and when the cash utilization plan is announced, I expect Infosys to trend higher. Therefore, in my view, Infosys is a ""Buy and Hold"" at current levels."
2144873,63203,2014-04-16T13:03:32-04:00,"Infosys is focusing on revenue growth after trailing its competitors over the past years; however, forward-looking view is moderate.Gross margins are declining even with increased utilization, indicating significant pricing pressures.Operating margins are stabilizing but at lower levels, driven by increased competition and cost-consciousness.Competitors are growing faster and more profitably, and outspending Infosys on sales & marketing.Valuations are not attractive at current levels to buy into the stock.","Infosys (NYSE:INFY) is the most prominent among Indian offshoring and IT consulting companies. The company announced its FY14 earnings on 4/15, reporting an 11.5% increase in annual revenue, but only a 1.5% increase in net profit for the year. Cost of sales grew 14%, resulting in gross margin compression of 1.5 percentage points. Over the past 2 years, the gross margin decline has been significant - FY12 gross margin was at 41.1%. The company's previously announced strategy of focusing on profitability led it to be undercut by its competitors, and consequently impacted its utilization; ironically leading to lower gross profit. In FY14, utilization improved significantly by more than 5 points, from 67% to 72.3%, but the gross margin decline suggests that it came under significant pricing pressure. The following chart shows the utilization and gross margin trend for the past three years:Source: INFY earnings callsOperating margins have also been compressed over the past couple of years, declining from 28.8% in FY12 to 24.0% in FY14. FY14 did include a $35M charge for settlement costs related to visa issues with its consultants, which the company says have been resolved.INFY is coming under severe competitive pressure from competitors, such as Cognizant Technology Solutions (NASDAQ:CTSH). The following charts are a comparison of key metrics between INFY and CTSH, which show how Cognizant has overtaken Infosys in both growth and profitability, allowing it to plow back its profits into sales and marketing investments, where it is outspending INFY by over 75%.Source: Yahoo FinanceOver the past couple of years, Cognizant has grown its revenues by 44% compared to only 18% for Infosys, and at a more profitable rate. Its gross profit margins are a healthy 40%, 4ppt above INFY. This has allowed it to over-invest in sales & marketing and easily outspend INFY.ValuationINFY has a pretty clean earnings statement, which makes a DCF valuation fairly straightforward. I assume a 7% revenue growth for FY15 through FY17, and 5% thereafter. I am assuming gross profit margins stay flat at FY14 levels - in light of the pricing pressures that INFY faces, this seems to be reasonable, though Q4 gross margins actually came in slightly higher at 37%.I assume that SG&A expenses grow in line with revenue, after removing the $35M legal expense charge from the FY15 estimates. As we have seen, INFY's competitors are significantly outspending it, and it might need to increase its marketing spend to stay competitive.I am assuming tax rates stay pretty stable, as indicated by INFY management during the earnings calls. For the terminal value calculation, I use a discount rate of 12% and a terminal growth rate of 3%. INFY operates primarily in India, and as such is impacted by exchange rate fluctuations. If the upcoming general elections result in a win for the right-wing coalition, as is widely anticipated, this could result in the rupee strengthening and impact INFY's pricing. The valuation model is attached:A DCF valuation of Infosys with these assumptions yields a fair value of $48/share, which is around 9% below the 4/15 closing price. Even if we use the upper end of management's guidance of 9% growth for the next three years, it would still result in a discount of 5% to the current share price.To sum up, INFY appears to be moving in the right direction as a company, by increasing its utilization and focusing on revenue growth. However, the current share price requires it to maintain its profitability and growth estimates, while being constrained on investment relative to competitors. Investors would be well advised to pass.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2329505,59371,2014-07-24T07:04:09-04:00,"Infosys is going through a multi-year transformation, and Narayamurthy's return to Infosys has ""shaken up the boat"".Operating margins are stabilizing but at lower levels, driven by increased utilization and focus on productivity. Management's focus on ""platform-based solutions"" is likely to be a slow burn strategy that will yield results in the next 12-18 months.The leadership of Dr. Vishal Sikka brings a valuable ""outside-in"" perspective of working with a non-linear, product-led company like SAP, and is likely to help Infosys wring out a lot more juice out of its existing platforms and products.The market is factoring in an anaemic growth, but with the economy thawing in Europe and picking up steam in the USA, growth in FY 16 would be at least 300-400 bps up from FY 15.At the current market price, the company makes for a low-risk buy with a 30%-40% upside over 12 months. Every pullback gives one of the opportunity to accumulate more.","Infosys, a $32 Bn success story in IT services from India, has been going through a leadership transition over the last three years, which has resulted in the company losing its leadership position (in terms of size and growth) to other nimbler rivals like TCS, Cognizant, and also getting snapped at the heels by HCL Technologies and Wipro.This prompted the company's legendary founder, N.R. Narayanamurthy, to come back and shake the boat a little boat and appoint a new captain (Dr. Vishal Sikka). On that note, NRNM (and his son) have left. The street still does not find enough evidence about whether there is a structural permanent change if growth YoY can rise above double digits. The company has guided for a 7%-9% growth in FY 2015.The best investments are those into great companies with temporary, fixable problems. Margins have been steady primarily driven by utilization, which has risen a full 800 bps last fiscal. One of the biggest challenges for Infosys has been employee attrition - for a long time, Infosys used to be the ""Microsoft"" of India. With a lot of start-ups mushrooming and younger, nimbler companies coming up, Infosys no longer has the same charm, especially for mid-to-senior level folks.I decided to deep dive further by speaking to mid-rung employees and also with its sales employees in the USA (close to customers). You can read the transcript from Q1, FY'15 (Qtr ending June '15) here.Having always had an ""investigative kind"" of mentality, I believe a lot more in collecting relevant data points that confirm or negate my hypotheses - feedback from customers, employees, ex-employees is paramount, and this is a summary of what I discovered:So, what's the deal here? Reading between the lines in the annual report, the big takeaway is that Infosys wants to improve its platform-based offerings that actually assist its customers with their business transformation (for e.g., say develop an integrated cloud-based module that allows for omni-channel retailing. That needs synchronization of customer data across stores, e-tail websites, loyalty programs and also managing e-mail, B2C and B2B logistics etc.). These, by their very nature, are a lot more uncertain and iterative than traditional B2B RFP-led ""projects"". Given that, I do expect that this will start showing results by Q4, FY'15. NRN, too, when he took over the helm, pointed at these changes getting completed in another 36 months.For the record, LTV won in the last twelve months and was $2.4 Bn, up from $2 Bn (TTM) in September '13. These take about 18-30 months, on average, to run-off into revenue. My sense is that Infosys will grow at 7%-8% in FY '15 and would move up to a 9%-10% in FY '16 on the back of improved backlog.Valuation:INFY is a fountain that spins cash and has a giant cash hoard. Of the $32 Bn in market cap, about $4.5 Bn is cash. Given Infosys' prudent capital allocation, I do not expect it to ever waste away this money by doing any non-accretive M&A. That leaves a value of about $27 Bn to the core business.The business generated about $2.0 Bn of cash last year, and is on track to generate $2.3 Bn of OCF after all WC changes. That gives it an OCF yield of about 8% (capex is less than $0.4 Bn).Summary:At the current market price of $54.23, I see an asymmetric upside-downside equation. The downside gets cushioned to a large extent by the 2% dividend yield + near $5 Bn in cash + $1.5 Bn of FCF (post dividends) in FY '15. So, it's hard for me to see the market cap go below $29 Bn or so even in the worst case (stock price of $46-$47). On the upside, at a conservative $10.3 Bn in FY '16 topline and a PAT of about $2.4 Bn, applying a multiple of 15-16 x FY '16, the CMP comes to about $34-36 Bn, an upside of 20%-30% from the current levels. All the optionality of:- comes as an upside. That being the case, this represents a low-risk bet with a moderate, nearly guaranteed upside, especially if one is investing in dollars. I would urge investors to buy the stock at the current levels and keep adding on any pullback. This could be a 15%-20% anchor in any moderate-risk investor's portfolio.Remember the new CEO's name means ""money"" in the local dialect!Disclosure: The author is long INFY.

The company is expected to report earnings of $0.79/share on revenues of $2.11 billion for its fiscal growth quarter ended March 31, 2014. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2014, current consensus is for earnings of $3.03 on revenues of $8.28 billion.For the June quarter (FQ:01) the Street is expecting earnings of $0.78/share on revenues of $$2.15 billion. For the year ended March 31, 2015, current estimates are $3.35/share on revenues of $9.06 billion.One of the most important questions/discussions will be on the massive top management turnover the company has undergone since Murthy came back to take the top job. Gone are Kakal, Balakrishnan and at least 7 other highly respected members of upper management. Murthy has stressed that the high level management departures will have very little impact on business and sales flow but I would take that with a small pinch of salt, at the least. You can't have 9 top managers leaving and feel no or very little impact on the business one way or another.Analysts in India are expecting the company to guide FY15 revenues higher by anywhere from 3-8% growth over FY14 with consensus being in the 6-8% range.The local (India-based) Goldman Sachs analyst believes that INFY will announce a one-time special dividend of INR 50 plus a regular dividend of INR 25 for a total of INR 75 or roughly $1.25/ADS. Pretty nice if they'd announce that. INFY had a cash hoard of slightly over $4.5 billion USD as of the end of the December quarter.Shares of INFY are down 8% in India this year versus a rise of 8% in the NIFTY.My take on INFY is that it will more than likely be range bound in the $50-$60 range. If the company managed a small beat and raises to the upper level of current guidance, I expect the shares to rally.I have hedged my position and am poised to more than likely benefit, feast or famine.

1724782,38201,2013-10-02T07:32:04-04:00,,"Infosys (INFY), the third largest player in the Indian IT service industry in regards to revenue, has been implementing turnaround initiatives headed by Mr. N.R. Narayana Murthy, who was reinstated as executive chairman in June this year. Regarded as the face of the growing Indian IT industry, Infosys has been suffering from a slowdown in revenue growth and a decline in its operating profit margin, which has decreased from 34.57% in fiscal year 2010 to 28.58% in fiscal year 2013. Infosys' failure to keep pace with the growing IT industry and losing market share to its competitors, prompted Narayana Murthy to develop a strategic roadmap to revive the company's fortunes in three years on the eve of its first direct meeting with investors.In Image: Narayana Murthy, Photocredit: chaikoffeReturn of visionary leaderSince the arrival of Narayana Murthy in June, Infosys' stock price has appreciated 20%, which denotes the positive investors' sentiment regarding Narayan Murthy's turnaround prospects. During the first direct meeting with its investors as an executive chairman after span of nearly 8 years, the following were the issues and expected initiatives discussed by Infosys' chairman:Focusing on the cost optimization strategy, the company is planning to reduce onsite employees that work in the client's country. When compared to its peers, Infosys has a higher onsite cost and a lower employee utilization rate of 88%, which denotes the inefficiency in onsite operation. Employee utilization rate is the actual billed employees, compared to total available employees. Therefore, the greater the employee utilization rate the greater the revenue generation opportunity.Although the company has not made any official announcement, news reports indicate it may result in job cuts in marketing and strategic global outsourcing divisions. Both these divisions have an overlapping function, which provides room for a reduction. Apart from that, the company is planning to shift some of its onsite function offshore, sending the work back to India, for completion. Doing work offshore has a higher gross margin than onsite operation; it saves expenses like visa application cost. According to analysts, making onsite operations efficient improves the company's margins by 1.5% to 2%. Therefore, this important initiative will lay the foundation for Infosys' revival initiatives. Infosys has been struggling with a declining operating profit margin due to growth in its onsite cost.We believe this move is not only cost advantageous, but it will also help the company hedge against the upcoming headwind of the U.S. Immigration bill, which is awaiting approval in the House of Representatives. This bill is a threat for the Indian IT industry, which depends on exports for most of its revenue. As per the bill passed in the Senate, companies that have over 75% of their US workforce relying on H-1B or L-1 visas would be barred from receiving additional visas by 2015. Also, these companies would have to reduce their visa-dependent workforce to 50% by 2017. This will result in higher costs for the companies as each would have to recruit local employees, which are much more expensive to hire than Indian employees.Infosys, which derives 62% of its revenue from North America, has already started hedging this negative impact by increasing offshoring components in its contracts, opening the company's domestic development center in the same time zone as the client, and recruiting local employees in the client's region.The U.S. Immigration bill is the most hyped topic, and it will decide the future course of IT companies like Infosys. The company is making efforts to offset this upcoming threat, and we believe that its initiative will reduce the negative impact of the bill if it is passed.This initiative will set a base for the company's cost reduction strategy. Infosys is currently undergoing a lot of management change, including the departure of key personnel like Ashok Vemuri (head of global sales and North America operations), Sudhir Chaturvedi (Vice-president and financial services head for the Americas), and Basab Pradhan (global sales head). These high profile exits will affect the company's revival initiative; all these employees had plenty of experience in their respective fields. Therefore, it will create a leadership gap in the organization. We believe its impact will be short term, and with passage of time, Infosys will fill these gaps so that it doesn't hinder the company's growth prospects.Peer AnalysisOnce regarded as the second biggest Indian IT company in terms of revenue, Infosys lost its position to Cognizant (CTSH), which experienced its highest revenue growth rate of 20.1% year over year in 2012, as per global research firm Gartner. Apart from Cognizant, Infosys has been losing its market share to Tata Consultancy Services (TCS.BO) and HCL Technologies (HCLTECH) as well.After comparing the fiscal results, Infosys has lagged behind its rivals in getting revenue growth in their last fiscal year. Also, its bottom line growth was below its competitors, denoting that the company is suffering from an increasing cost base, which is affecting its financials. Infosys has a dollar revenue growth guidance of 6%-10% as compared to the industry's projected growth of 12%-14% in fiscal year 2014. This indicates that the company will grow slower than the expected industry growth.Conclusion:Infosys is currently in a revival phase, and it will take time to boost the company's top line growth. The company has some upside development like depreciation of the rupee vs. major currencies, which will positively affect the margin; a 1% drop in the currency boosts the operating margin of IT exporters by 0.40%.We believe that this stock is currently undervalued, and with the turnaround initiative in place, Infosys' will generate significant value for investors in the future. Since June, the company has been reducing the gap between the stock and benchmark CNX IT index performance, which denotes an upward trend resulting from positive market sentiment towards Infosys.

Conversely, its competitor's CFO depicted a plummeting trend as it was not able to effectively manage its cash conversion cycle.Moving onto its cash flow from investing ""CFI,"" there have been increasing out flows in this section in FY 13 and FY12, primarily due to the capital investments in the company continues to make to develop its process to be fully equipped itself to cater to the expected demand and capture untapped markets like customer-specific products and services. Infosys has also significantly increased its long-term investments in FY13. In contrast, Wipro's CFI has taken on a positive trend as it chooses to monetize its investments in FY12.Cash flow from financing [CFF] is also following a negative trend, largely due to the payment of dividend followed by a small chunk of borrowings in FY13 and only dividends in FY12. On the other hand, Wipro's CFF has plunged in FY12 due to dividend payments whereas in FY11 along with dividend payments, net borrowing was also a major factor of its negative CFF.*Source: Yahoo FinanceWith reference to the bar chart, Infosys has offered a higher dividend yield in contrast to its competitor, Wipro for the past years.

1475921,43091,2013-06-03T04:57:39-04:00,,"On Saturday, the Board of Directors made the surprising announcement that Infosys (NYSE:INFY) co-founder NR Narayana Murthy was returning to the company as Chairman of the Board, replacing K V Kamath, who will become lead independent director and sending Executive Co-Chairman Kris Gopalakrishnan back down to vice-chairman. In addition, Murthy is bringing his son, Rohan, who is a doctoral student/scientist at Harvard, along as Executive Assistant to the Chairman. There will also be one or two other EAs to the Chairman appointments, one from Catamaran (Murthy's family office VC/investment firm-headed by Rohan) and probably another from INFY management ranks.This morning, in India, INFY shares opened as high as up over 9% and as of this writing is up 5%. So, clearly local investors in India think that the second coming of Murthy (well respected as he is) is worth anywhere from $1.4 billion to $2.2 billion judging by the increase in the market cap of the company. Now, the questions, we have to ask ourselves are the following?1) Is Murthy worth that bump up in market cap?2) Is Murthy up to the challenges he faces at the company he left in 2006?3) How long will he take to right the ship?So, to answer the first question, the market clearly thinks that the return of co-founder Murthy is worth the bump in market cap. However, the question begs to be asked. So, with CQ:2 (INFY's FQ:1) earnings about five weeks away, will his return have a positive impact on earnings for the current quarter? Not at all, in my opinion. Too soon. However, over the next two or three quarters, INFY could get things back on track and maybe even the deal pipeline will expand as Murthy is well respected and should be able to bag some deals on his name recognition/business contacts and reputation alone. In addition, his vision could lead to a better understanding of what his plans are for Infosys in the coming quarters which itself could lead to the sellside community embracing his plans.Currently the sell-siders are expecting FY14 (year ending March 2014) of $2.96/share and FY15 earnings of $3.10/share for a paltry YoY growth of 4.7%. Those numbers will definitely be a lot higher by the time Murthy is through. Maybe even 2x the current expected earnings rate of growth. Remains to be seen for now.For the moment, I think the jump in market cap can be justified.Going onto the second question we have to first take a look where the company was when Murthy left in 2006. Back then (FY06) INFY's revenues were $.2.2 billion, profits were $555 million, OM's were 28%, the firm had 460 clients with no client that had a $100 billion market cap, 53k employees and an attrition rate of 11%. At present (FY13), INFY's revenues are $7.4 billion, net profit is $1.73 billion, OMs are 26%, the company has 798 clients with 15 enjoying market caps in excess of $100 billion, 157k employees and an attrition rate of 16%. Not an easy task, no?In his first stint, Infosys and the rest of Indian IT companies were enjoying the powerful benefits of the labor cost arbitrage between India and the West but not anymore. Hundreds of multinational companies have set up their own offshore offices in India, some of which are as big, if not bigger than that of INFY and the rest of Indian IT companies. That change in dynamics will be Murthy's first hurdle.What Murthy also faces at the moment is the fact that he is now dealing with a work force that is 3x what he had when he left the company in 2006. The current workforce seem to be far more dissatisfied and much quicker to jump ship and switch jobs as we can see from the increase in the attrition rates. In addition, at 66, Murthy might not be able to identify closely with the majority of INFY's workforce which is less than half his age. That is where son Rohan will come in. Rohan is just 30 and he will be the conduit between the young workforce and his 66 year old father. Brilliant move by Murthy there. Of course, Murthy is not doing all this out of the goodness of his heart. He and his family are the single largest individual shareholders in INFY with a stake just under 5%. So, there is a lot of skin in the game so to speak which shareholders, both institutional and individual should love.Finally, Infosys is facing unprecedented competition. Already rival Cognizant (NASDAQ:CTSH) is bigger than INFY in terms of revenue and local rival HCL Tech is now considered the leader in the infrastructure management area, an area which has shown far superior growth than the usual IT services. Both these companies were pretty small compared to INFY when he left the firm back in 2006. Winning back market share will be Murthy's single biggest challenge in my opinion.While he has proved to be more than up to the task in the past, can he do it again is something the next few quarters will tell.In answering the final question, here is what Murthy needs to focus on to achieve his mandate as quickly as possible: strengthen the sales force so as to be more aggressive in winning deals, make quick decision so as to enable and empower the executive ranks to be more confident that there will be a quick turnaround in decisions from the top, and finally be able to handle Kris and Shibulal who might be peeved at Murthy's return as it can be concluded that they were/are not up to the task at hand.To conclude, the return of Murthy is definitely a strong signal to investors that INFY is serious about turning things around but the turnaround will take a couple of quarters at least.Disclosure: I am long INFY, CTSH.

1344431,46531,2013-04-16T11:22:30-04:00,,"April 12th was a historical date for India-based and once glorious Infosys Technologies (NYSE:INFY). The company kicked off the reporting season for this quarter by stating its revenue may rise only 6%-10% this fiscal year, a number much lower than the Bloomberg consensus (12.7%).The consequences were dramatic: Infosys shares dropped almost 21%, the most since April 2003, causing the Sensex Index to drop about 300 points (1.6%).In this article, we try to answer the following question: at about $41.00 per share, is Infosys cheap enough to be considered a sound long term investment?(Click to enlarge)First, we need to identified what went wrong. We identified 4 reasons for the decline:Endogenous reasons1) A fierce competition against Tata Consulting Services (NYSE:TCS), Wipro (NYSE:WIT), Cognizant (NASDAQ:CTSH), HCL Tech and Accenture (NYSE:ACN) in the offshore technology industry reduced the ability of Infosys to charge a price premium.Infosys failed to recognize that the price elasticity in the demand for offshore technology was increasing. They decided to keep charging an elevated premium for their services; even when there were clear signals that offshore technological services were becoming commodities as early as in 2010.Many praised Infosys for its abnormal margins. Indeed, Infosys had operating margins of between 28-35%, whereas competitors like IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Accenture had much lower margins. However, this was achieved because they used a fixed billing rate, and they would stick to it, regardless of the client profile or his budget constraints.By 2011, not even high margins were able to hide the opportunity costs of losing potential clients. That same year, main opponent TCS managed to surpass Infosys in market share.(Click to enlarge)2) Opportunity loss in 2012Knowing that they were losing market share quickly, Infosys should have changed its pricing strategy: reduce price premium in order to attract new customers, while retaining their traditional clients. However, the firm kept charging elevated fees.They were also too conservative: even though so far they have accumulated as much as $4 billion of surplus cash, they did not make any strategic acquisition in the past years (apart from McCamish Solutions in 2009), while TCS and HCL were extremely active in the M&A field.2011 and 2012 were unique opportunities for revival. Not only did the global economy start to recover gradually, but Indian inflation also caused the main cost base of Infosys and its competitors to depreciate: labour costs. Yet, Infosys kept charging a premium, while TCS and Cognizant did not.Exogenous reasons3) Strong exposure to foreign currency fluctuations, which were adverse to the firm in 2012 Q4: Infosys cost base is in Indian rupees; but due to its 700 consultants and 42 partners worldwide, it earns its revenue in various currencies.4) Seasonality: The ""official"" reason for the decline. The demand for offshore technology is cyclical: About a third of Infosys projects are related to financial services. This segment has experienced a contraction in the past 8 months.From now onWe believe that stock price will continue decreasing in the next days because there were absolutely no positive indicators in the announcement made on April 12th.There is also a lot of uncertainty: no earnings guidance was given this time. However, we also believe that in the long term Infosys will recover. This is due to the following reasons:1) First of all, the Infosys business model is not dead.They boast more than 775 active and loyal customers, as they built strong relationships with top management at these firms for years. This is the main asset of the company. These are clients that relied on Infosys even in times of high uncertainty and recession (2007-2008).The second most important asset of Infosys is its culture: to be in a constant search for new methodologies to improve efficiency. Just like they developed the global delivery model in the early 90s, they are now proposing new engagement models for achieving lower risk and higher cost optimization.2) A strong balance sheet.No debts. Even better, a cash cushion of $4.1 billion, ready to be used in acquisitions and aggressive growth, if needed.3) A consistent and strong ability to generate free cash flows.Due to its high margins, Infosys generates strong and consistent free cash flows, which represent as much as 20% of total revenues. We believe that even if margins are reduced, the strong upward trend will prevail.3) If Infosys sacrifices some premium pricing in exchange of new clients, stock will rise.After all, the main reason why Infosys lost the price war in the offshore technology arena is because they simply chose not to fight.But as the ""commoditization"" trend in offshore technology continues strengthening, we believe that the time has come for Infosys to reduce its price premium.After stock plummeted 20%, management became under heavy pressure to reduce the traditional premium in order to gain more clients. Sure, this will cause operating margins to contract in the middle run. However, in the long run, Infosys will manage to recover competitive advantage and regain market share by increasing its client base.Final RemarksRating: Buy Consider buying at: $36Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Infosys finished 2013 with impressive 33.81% gains after experiencing sharp moves last year. During the recent earnings report, the company tightened its outlook for fiscal 2014 and now expects top-line growth of 9%-10%, versus 6%-10%. For the December quarter, analysts expect Infosys to earn $0.75 a share on revenue of $2.09 billion. Projected EPS growth for the next 3 to 5 years is 12.50%, lower than 13.85% growth expected for the IT services industry.During the last 3 years, revenue grew by 15.5%, operating income rose by 9.35% and net income rose by 9.52%. Figure 1 highlights year-over-year change in revenues, operating income and net income since 2005.Figure 1. Y-o-Y Growth in revenue, operating income & net income (Source: Morningstar)The company is expanding its current product portfolio to include low-end business process outsourcing services. These growth opportunities are creating headwinds for preserving the pricing power. Figure 2 highlights the declining trend in operating and profit margins since 2010. Management is trying to preserve a fine balance between revenue growth and operating margins. Last year, there were several management changes including the return of its co-founder.Figure 2. Operating & Profit margins since 2004ValuationThe growth story for Infosys in future is the improving global economy and acceleration in IT spending. The company is also expanding its presence in Europe and Latin America to insulate its business exposure to the US market. Reinvestment needs of the business have outpaced the revenue growth since 2010 as presented in Figure 3. Even though the firm enjoys a strong customer base, and scale -upholding pricing power will be a challenge in future. Rise in employee related expenses, higher marketing costs and rising competitive threats will depress the margins for the company in future.Figure 3. Revenue growth and Reinvestment rateRisk resides in the future growth for this company. Investors need to be aware of the price they are paying for future growth. A reverse DCF model can help in finding what market inferred growth rate is. Isolating value of existing assets from the market price yields growth premium built into the stock price. Using a cost of capital of 15.6%, we estimate the value of assets in place, and the price we are paying for growth.Growth premium stated with price earnings ratio is the difference between ttm P/E and P/E ratio for existing assets. Current trailing twelve month price earnings ratio for Infosys is 19.1.PE for existing assets = 7.47Growth Premium = Actual P/E- P/E for existing assets = 19.1-7.47 = 11.65At current price levels, Infosys needs compounded growth rate of 44.5% in operating income for the next 5 years. Excellent customer relations, strong delivery model, and leading market position has enabled the company to earn excess returns on capital invested. Median return on invested capital for Infosys since 2003 is 33.8% against cost of capital of 15.6%. These returns show quality growth created and value creation for shareholders. With these reasons accounted for, my fair value estimate for Infosys is $43.5 (implying operating income growth of 32% over the next 5 years).Stock Movement on Earnings EventsInfosys historically has shown volatile movements after the earnings release. Stock has moved close to 8.2% on an average after earnings release for last 12 quarters. Table 1 below presents the implied volatility levels for first two months before earnings, expected volatility crush after earnings release, stock and at the money straddle performance.Table Implied volatility levels, straddle pricing, stock and straddle performanceTable Implied and actual move in stockFigure . 30 and 60 day implied volatility levels (Source: Livevol Pro)At present, the options market is pricing a move of 8.3% in the stock (Close to 12 quarter average move). 30 day and 60 day implied volatility levels shown in figure 4, presents options as fairly priced.With fair value estimate of $43.50 (22.3% below market price), and reasonably priced options - investors should hedge their gains in the stock before earnings.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a short position in INFY, over the next 72 hours.

1337181,39791,2013-04-12T07:48:02-04:00,,"I have been holding a negative view on the Infosys (INFY) stock for some time now. The Indian IT Services Industry is showing slowing growth due to a number of macro factors. Some companies are managing the transition better while others are still stuck in the glory days of the past. Infosys which used to be the leader in the IT services space earlier, has become its most prominent laggard. The company generates high margins despite its services being no better than other Indian IT companies like Wipro (NYSE:WIT), Cognizant (NASDAQ:CTSH), TCS and HCL Technologies. IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Accenture (NYSE:ACN) have ramped up their Indian operations with thousands of low cost employees. This has allowed them to whittle down the first-mover advantage that INFY enjoyed. Now the U.S. multinational corporations can offer the same services for almost the same price as Infosys. It does not make sense for Infosys to have the same valuation multiple as other faster growing companies. The recent earnings have proved me right with the INFY stock tanking by more than 20% after reporting its FQ413 earnings today.Why we are not positive about InfosysWhat went wrong with the FQ413 earningsSummaryThe Indian economy is going through a very rough patch right now with both investment and consumption declining. The GDP growth is slowing as corruption and governance issues take centre stage. Infosys gets most its revenues from export markets, has been performing badly in the last couple of years. While CTSH, TCS and HCL have kept growing in high double digits, Infosys has been stuck in a rut. The company is also no longer the employer of choice amongst Indian engineering graduates. The top management does not seem to have much of a clue on what to do right now. The company will have to completely reinvent itself to adapt to the changed environment. I would advise investors to look at Cognizant if they want to gain an exposure to the $100 billion Indian IT Services market.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1335151,43091,2013-04-11T12:47:38-04:00,,"Infosys (NYSE:INFY) is set to report earnings on Friday, April 12, 2013. At present, the Street expects the company to earn $0.74 per share on revenue of $1.99 billion for its fiscal fourth quarter ended March 31, 2013. For the current June quarter (Infosys's FQ1:14), current estimates are earnings of $0.75/share on revenue of $1.99 billion as well. For FY14 ending March 31, 2014, the sell-side has modeled earnings of $3.16 per share on revenues of $8.25 billion.INFY is currently trading at just $3 and change off its 52-week high thanks to a surprisingly strong report for the December quarter which led to a 18.81% increase in share price the day it reported earnings in the middle of January (closed at $52.22 versus $43.95 the day before it reported earnings). Having said that, INFY is still a big laggard versus the S&P500 (NYSEARCA:SPY) (or any other major US index for that matter) with a 52-week negative return of around 7% versus a positive return for the S&P500 of almost 15% for the same 52-week comparative period. However on a year to date basis Infosys has significantly outperformed the S&P500 with a return of 25.3% as of yesterdays closing price of $53/share.There is a lot of chatter at the moment about whether INFY will provide guidance going forward for the year. I think they will, so lets put that issue to bed for now. Quarterly guidance is another thing altogether and that might not happen. No matter what, guidance is a key area that investors need to keep an eye out for if the management decides to continue at least annual guidance.Another issue that is looming large at the moment is whether the company will increase their dividend or pay a large one-time special dividend. INFY currently has about $4.15 billion in cash. I am not holding my breath on that however, never say never.Investors need to also keep in mind that the company's short interest (NYSE:SI) has also been increasing along with its share prices. As of March 15, 2013, the current SI was at 23.4 million shares (NYSE.com) with a current short ratio (days to cover) of 12.7x.Having said all that, what should investors and shorts expect from Infosys's FQ1:14 tomorrow morning before US markets open for regular trading?Infosys has guided the March quarter to revenue growth of about 4% including the Lodestone acquisition. Organic growth (not counting revenue contribution from Lodestone) should be around 3.7% to 3.8% QoQ.Last quarter, big upside was significantly attributed to the company's success in the banking and ERP verticals which accounted for almost 69% of the company's upside surprise when they reported earnings for the quarter in mid January. If one were to factor in the recent deal wins by the company, I think one can safely assume in-line revenue tomorrow.On the earnings front, a lot depends on how the onsite wage hikes that went into effect this quarter and how much of an impact will the Lodestone acquisition and integration have on the company's margins. Management had guided to a 120-140 basis points adverse effect on margins in the March quarter due mainly to these two reasons. In addition for IT companies, tax rates for 2014 will also increase by another 1-2% which could further dampen margins and thus earnings for FQ1:14 and for FY:14 as well.Also, look for what management says regarding order booking patterns, budgetary issues and constraints faced by clients given the global economic uncertainty, comments regarding pricing flexibility and finally, comments on how each of the verticals are faring in terms of growth and demand.All in all, I expect INFY to move up after reporting numbers tomorrow before the open. We are adding April 19 calls to our already existing long-side position.Good luck everyone!Until the next time, happy and safe investingDisclosure: I am long INFY.

1164691,39791,2013-02-07T13:09:32-05:00,,"IntroductionInfosys Technologies (NYSE:INFY) successfully pioneered the offshore Indian IT services model which has now become a $100 billion industry. The company managed to grow at a faster rate than its competitors while keeping premium pricing and high margins. The company was looked upon as a bell whether of the Indian IT industry despite bigger competitors like TCS. However, in the last few years, Infosys has faltered as it could not keep up with the growth rates of smaller competitors like Cognizant (NASDAQ:CTSH) and HCL Technologies. Even its main rival TCS has performed much better than Infosys, which has meant that INFY stock has languished compared to the other IT services companies. Only Wipro (NYSE:WIT) has performed as badly as Infosys in terms of growth and earnings. Infosys has also suffered from a number of top management changes and high employee attrition due to wage freezes earlier. The company seems to have finally woken up to its problems and is now trying to be more aggressive about growth, by lowering prices. Earlier Infosys used to follow a premium pricing model compared to its competitors to maintain margins. However, that strategy has proven disastrous in the last few years as growth has slumped taking margins down as well.Why we are not positive about InfosysInfosys - Upside RisksStock PerformanceAs we have said before, INFY stock has jumped almost 20% in the last month after the company reported a good set of quarter results. However over a longer period (5 years), INFY has heavily underperformed companies like TCS and CTSH. Even over the last 12 months INFY performance has been quite lackluster as compared to HCL Technologies.SummaryInfosys faced both macro risks as well as high competitive risks from the likes of Cognizant, HCL and TCS which are eating its market share. The recent surge in the stock price has destroyed the margin of safety in buying the stock. We don't think Infosys is a good investment as it was forced to lower prices to play with the competition. The valuation for Infosys is now level with faster growing competitors like CTSH and TCS. The company does not have any killer product or service which will boost its growth over the competition. The high growth days of low cost off shoring are over for the Indian IT industry which is entering the stage of maturity. Infosys brand does not command the premium over other Indian IT companies as it did before. At best, we see Infosys performing at par with the rest of the major Indian IT service providers. For this reason we would advise investors to switch to other technology companies.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1313851,43091,2013-04-02T05:08:24-04:00,,"The last time I wrote on here was just before Cognizant Technology's (NASDAQ:CTSH) earnings for FY12 and Q4:12. The shares were trading right around here and saw a small pop post-earnings but came shy of my $85/share price target post earnings. The Indian IT and quasi-Indian IT (CTSH, due to the fact that its a US-based company with the majority of its work force based in India, is thus quasi-Indian) sector has received a lot of ho hum articles on Seeking Alpha and also received a few downgrades by sellside analysts. They are wrong! Here's a few reasons that they seem to have missed:The majority of pricing cut seems to now be in the past. Take for instance Infosys (NYSE:INFY); EBITDA margins declined by 530 basis points in the last year as productivity also dropped by 5% over the same period. It would seem that the discounts the company had to provide in order to continue its business traction is almost over with. If there is still going to be any adverse impact to margins, it will be minimal.Current utilization rates at the Indian and quasi-Indian IT companies are at record lows and as volume momentum returns in 2013 and beyond, utilization rates should go up by about 5-7% for the sector.All these companies are continuing with their hiring activity at a frenetic pace, hiring at the rate of several thousand new employees per month, month in and month out. A sure sign that management teams expect better revenue momentum going forward.After the challenges these companies have been through since the financial crises, there have been tremendous improvement made in internal operating performance which will help offset the still slightly sluggish external operating environment as clients are still holding on to their purse strings fairly tightly. In addition, clients are still having difficulty on clarity beyond a quarter or two, but the improvements made to the internal operating improvement should be enough to offset those issues.All the Indian and quasi-Indian IT companies are making a strong push into continental Europe which is where there is tremendous scope for growth going forward. European companies need to bring down costs significantly and outsourcing of IT is one sure fire way to do it and management teams know that. Look for more work coming to IT companies as continental European company management teams start to focus on improving operating efficiencies.The US SEC is set to start the bidding process on its $4 billion Consolidated Audit Trail National Market System (CAT NMS) project sometime this month and I expect the two companies mentioned in this article to win different parts of this massive $4 billion pie, thanks to their expertise in the BFSI (banking, financial services and insurance) verticals. This is a high profile deal and will be a feather in their caps when the winners are announced and could be good for 3-5% gains in the shares on announcement of the winners alone. Chatter is that the expression of interest deadline was March 5, 2013, and the bidding process will begin April 25, 2013.Cognizant is expected to report earnings of $0.93/share on revenues of $2.01 billion for its Q1 ended March 31, 2013. For FY13, current estimates are for earnings of $3.98/share on revenues of $8.62 billion.Infosys is expected to report earnings of $0.74/share on revenues of $1.99 billion for its Q4 ended March 31, 2013. For FY:14, the Street is expecting earnings of $3.15/share on revenues of $8.25 billion.In my opinion, estimates are muted for both companies at the moment and should be going up as we move through the year.In summation, filter out the noise and chatter, and focus on these names over the short-to-medium term where returns could be anywhere from 10% to 20% depending on one's time frame.Until the next time, safe investing.Disclosure: I am long CTSH, INFY.

1114661,41721,2013-01-16T09:15:24-05:00,,"After disappointing for eight quarters, Infosys (NYSE:INFY) surpassed market estimates with better-than-expected results for the third quarter and also raised its full year guidance, contrary to most analysts who were expecting the company to disappoint again.Infosys posted revenue of $1.911 billion, up 6.3 percent sequentially, up 5.8 percent year-over-year and ahead of the Street estimates at $1.85 billion. Profits were 76 cents a share, ahead of the consensus at 72 cents.For the full year ending March 2013, the company expects revenue of at least $7.45 billion and profits of $2.97 a share; Street estimates had been for $7.32 billion and $2.95 a share.A majority of the analysts, including at firms such as Barclays Capital, CLSA, JPMorgan, Nomura and top Indian brokerages, expected Infosys to disappoint as the company headed into the earnings season and lowered their twelve month price targets. Given a string of earnings disappointments, expecting another disappointment was par for the course.Post the results, Infosys shares were on fire, increasing by a record 17 percent on Friday. It added another 3.5 percent on Monday in India's bourses, closing at a PE multiple of 17. Brokerages, including a few who were previously skeptical, have revised their 12 month price targets to indicate a further 10 percent upside, post the 20 percent increase in the stock price.The biggest question after the phenomenal burst, in part driven by massive short covering, is whether the results herald a sustainable turnaround that is structural, or are attributable to an improving demand environment, or are due to a combination of several pent-up positive drivers that are not structural.The largest contributors to the company's revenues like the U.S. region or application, development and maintenance (ADM), which fell 3 percent year-over-year for the first time in 4-5 years, didn't drive the marginal outperformance. The performance was driven by the rest of the business which historically has been relatively volatile.The company's software (IT Services and Consulting) personnel were around 123,000, while utilization was close to 70 percent throughout the calendar year 2012. The stagnation in the software professionals head-count and utilization levels for the last 4 quarters is concerning particularly when TCS and Cognizant (NASDAQ:CTSH) have ramped up.Infosys management didn't attribute the performance to a stronger demand scenario and acknowledged that new contracts are seeing higher competitive intensity in an environment with limited opportunities. Indian IT services companies are aggressively building order books at any cost and are dropping offshore billing rates to bag big contracts. Infosys will find it challenging to aggressively win new projects without compromising its premium pricing strategy.Any pick-up in IT spending in 2013 will boost margins and re-rate the company as it is best leveraged given its large bench and exposure to discretionary projects. Utilizations at <70% offer sufficient margin levers for the company in the short term as it is low compared with its historical levels and its competitors. But, CEO Shibulal said early signs indicate flat to declining IT spend in customers' 2013 budget.Infosys can sustain the higher valuation multiples only after a few more quarters of consistent performance. The recent massive price surge in the absence of clearly demonstrated structural improvements means the stock price can melt again like it did after each earnings announcement in calendar year 2012, in case the IT budgets remain flat in 2013 or the company is unable to increase utilization levels without compromising on pricing.After the results, a few big brokerages revised the EPS estimates upwards, on average, by 2 percent for FY 2013 and 4 percent for FY 2014. The magnitude of divergence between the new price targets and revised EPS estimates reflect the cluelessness of many analysts whose earnings estimates and price targets were widely off the mark in the last 4-6 quarters. The 17 percent price surge factors in most of the positives and given the uncertainty, limits the upside and increases downside risks.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1149541,28511,2013-02-01T03:15:55-05:00,,"Infosys (NYSE:INFY) released its fiscal third quarter 2013 earnings report with better than expected results on all fronts. The Indian IT bellwether reported rupee revenue of Rs 10,424 crore ($1.88 billion US). The number beat analysts' expectations by approximately Rs 500 crore ($~90 million US). Net profits were also higher than expected coming in at Rs 2359 crore ($423 million US) versus and estimated at Rs 2200 crore ($394 million). In dollar terms revenue increased by 6.3%, which includes revenue from the Lodestone acquisition which was completed in the quarter. Infosys is a cash generating powerhouse and produced operating cash flow of 103% of net margins for the quarter.Business looks strong as well, as Infosys won eight big contracts totaling to $730 million during the quarter. Four of the deals were in the United States, while three are in Europe and one in India. The deals include new client engagements as well as renewal and expansion of existing programs. The company also added 53 new clients, launched 20 new products and platforms over the last year and sold to over 70 unique clients.This strong performance will likely get shareholders off of management's back for a little while. Infosys, like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is sitting on a large pile of cash that many shareholders felt management has been too conservative with. The Lodestone acquisition was a good beginning it was thought but more needed to be done as organic growth was thought to be a more distant proposition. So, while Apple is content to run one of the world's largest hedge funds with its pile of cash - further proof of a management that lacks vision in its core competencies - Infosys is being selective in how it deploys what it has saved.Infosys closed the acquisition of Zurich-based consulting firm Lodestone for total of $350 million. The acquisition was announced in September. While Lodestone is expected to contribute $104 million to Infosys full year revenue the real value for it to Infosys comes from its extensive client base -- adding more than 200 across a variety of industries to Infosys.Infosys outright denied the report of the newspaper that it plans to sack approximately 5,000 ""non-performing"" employees and at present has total staff strength of 155,629. The outlook of the Indian IT Industry is to remain gloomy due to uncertainty in the key U.S. and European market.Infosys 3.0The new strategy of Infosys has been termed as Infosys 3.0 and it has already begun to show benefits. I would expect another Lodestone-type transaction in the future while the company continues to shift a greater portion of its resources to consulting versus IT outsourcing, which are easier to acquire but whose margins are eroding as other players like Wipro (NYSE:WIT) and Tata Consulting Services (NYSE:TCS) have driving prices down. This has plagued the company for a few quarters and it looks like it has begun to turn that corner, guiding a 3% organic business growth target for Q4 FY 2013.According to a recent interview on Bloomberg of Infosys' CEO, it does not sound like they are planning on another acquisition in the near future and that uncertainties about the situation in India and around the world, especially currency instability, are still having a depressing effect on business investment. The situation in Europe will continue to be challenging and Infosys is banking on growth there. With the ECB tightening its balance sheet and strengthening the Euro for 2013 I expect the European periphery to begin to improve on cheaper effective energy prices. Infosys will pick up outsourcing clients in that environment to support that organic growth target.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

It also faces the toughest business environment due to the never ending European drama and a weakening US economy, both of which are principle markets for Infosys. It has had to tackle high levels of attrition as the company has refused to hike salaries till the outlook improves. Infosys, along with a lot of other companies, is expected to face political rhetoric as the election season heats up in the US. Employee costs have been higher as the company has had to increase onsite and local hiring to stem this diatribe. It also faces immense pressure to hike salaries in its centers in India as inflation has hovered higher than historical averages for an extended period of time.The company has forecast revenues to be at least $7.343bn for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2013. It also expects EPS to be around $3.03 giving it a one year forward multiple of 12.8 based on Thursday's closing price.In a rare coincidence, its nearest competitor Tata Consultancy Services declared its earnings on the same day and came up with much better numbers.

592121,30651,2012-05-15T19:07:07-04:00,,"Infosys' (NYSE:INFY) share price has dropped more than 20% since April 13, following the reduced 2013 revenue growth forecast of 8%-10%. Some might wonder if Infosys looks cheap at the current price of $43-45. My discounted cash flow model suggests a fair value range of $45-50. Given so, the current discount does not provide enough margin of safety.Infosys has benefited from the typical outsourcing business model.It brings in revenue from US and Europe and provides the service in India to bank on the low labor cost of highly educated Indian labor force. This model allowed it to keep its operating margin around 28%-30% for the past 10 years. On the demand side, companies become more thrift about IT spending during the economy downturn. Rather than building operations in-house, they tend to outsource more. As a result, it has expanded greatly since 2008. According to its annual report, its revenue grew at a CAGR of 10.9% and net income at a CAGR of 8.1% during 2008-2012. Its employee headcount increased from 91,200 in 2008 to 150,000 in 2012.The growth momentum came to a pause in Q4 2012.The company suffered delays in contract closure and observed ramp-downs with a number of clients in the financial services industry. As a result, it failed to meet the already downgraded revenue guidance. On top of that, the management lowered the revenue growth guidance in FY2013 to 8%-10%. Infosys reported revenue of $6.99bn and net income of $1.72bn in fiscal year 2012.DCF model assumptions are set forth below.All the financial statement figures below are sourced from Morningstar.com Premium content.Fair Value Estimated to be around $45-$50Assuming revenue grows at 10% in 2013-2017, the fair value is estimated to be $45.70. The table below lists how fair value estimate is changed by change in 5-year revenue growth. ""10,11,12,12,12"" means revenue grows at 10% in 2013, 11% in 2012 and so forth, which is the more realistic growth pattern featuring the short-term slow-down and recovery afterwards. This scenario values Infosys at $48.33.If the tax rate is set to be at 28.8% perpetually, with short-term revenue grows at 10%, the fair value estimate is revised up to $47.52. Therefore, the higher tax rate assumption does not depress the estimate too much.To conclude, the 5-year growth should range between 10% and 12%, which gives a fair value range of $45-$50. This only provides about $2-$7 margin of safety, which is not enough to compensate for uncertainty around the DCF assumptions. To name a few, operating margin compression due to wage inflation in India and investment loss due to foreign currency movements. Given so, the stock is for sure not a value play at $43. A reasonable entry point will be below $35.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
381181,24107,2012-02-21T16:44:36-05:00,,"By Chris AylottFor the last few months, Infosys Technologies (NYSE:INFY), Wipro (NYSE:WIT) and other IT providers have been worried about drops in their clients' discretionary spending.  Actions speak louder than words, though, and analysts at ICICI  Securities report that Infosys is hiring like it expects more business  soon.That tracks with a February 16 article in the Times of India, which said that Infosys is looking to buy land  and ""expand its footprint"" in India's second-tier cities. Infosys CEO  S.D. Shibulal said that the company had hired over 45,000 people in  2011, and has already made offers to 23,000 new workers for FY2013.ICICI Securities analysts think that the company has the deals needed  to keep the new labor busy. Infosys signed five large deals during the  last quarter, two of which were worth over $500 million. One of these  super-deals was in Europe, suggesting that at least some companies are  doing business despite the debt crisis.Infosys still has challenges ahead. ICICI reports that as expected,  discretionary revenue was a little slow last quarter, and Infosys got  less revenue from its top 5 clients. All those new hires and development  centers will be expensive if the company doesn't get enough work to  keep them busy.Shibulal has high expectations though, saying that the ""need of the  hour"" is to grow at 9%, and that the budget will support the company's  planned growth. ""We have to grow at 9 per cent at least,"" Shibulal says, ""and I think  that is the fundamental need for the country. The challenge is how you  create nine plus growth.""Investors seeking a broad exposure to Indian IT companies may want to look at the ISE Chindia Index ETF (NYSEARCA:FNI), which devotes a total of 10% of its holdings to Infosys and Wipro."
505801,24107,2012-04-18T04:19:07-04:00,,"By Scott MartinThe heaviest weighted stock in India has plunged nearly 16% since its earnings spooked global traders on Friday. Despite the carnage, reaction from analysts and ETF investors has been muted - revealing that the selling may have gone more than a little too far.Infosys (NYSE:INFY) is the largest Indian stock listed in the United States, the first Indian IT giant to join the Nasdaq, and a core holding of just about every large-cap India fund you can find.Unfortunately, the company's technology-driven constituency wanted INFY to confirm its business is still growing at a rate of maybe 12% to 14% a year. On Friday, management was unwilling to go above 10% - and the bloodshed began.That's all old tape by now, though and enough verbiage has been spilled in the aftergame. What's interesting is that Indian funds have somehow managed to keep their asset values flying despite INFY's disgrace.INFY is the top holding in the iShares MSCI India Index ETF (BATS:INDA), for example, starting the month at a weight of 10.12% of the portfolio. The sell-off has since eroded that allocation to 8.50%, destroying hundreds of thousands of dollars in shareholder equity in the process.But if everything else in India was plunging in sympathy, we would expect to see substantial losses here. Add INFY's losses with the 7% decline in arch-rival Wipro (NYSE:WIT) - another 1.7% of the fund's holdings - and INDA should be bleeding, right?Instead, INDA is down a scant 0.4% since Thursday night. Other India funds are practically untouched, despite having 6% to 9% of their money invested in INFY shares. The worst hit, the iPath version of the MSCI India Index portfolio (NYSEARCA:INP), is still weighted over 11% in INFY, but only dipped 0.8% in sympathy.Crunch all the numbers, and you'll not only see that Infosys was an isolated event, but that money pouring out of this stock and the IT sector simply rotated into other large-cap Indian names. On a net basis, the other holdings in these funds actually gained ground. That's what any diversified portfolio is supposed to do, so it's nice to see it actually proved in principle here.From here, the question is whether INFY has been punished enough. Despite a trickle of third-day downgrades from Western analysts at firms ranging from Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank on down the food chain, most of the ratings cuts acknowledge that this stock is now more or less fairly valued at around $48.Even the rare ""sell"" from firms - like Credit Lyonnais Securities Asia (CLSA) somewhat perversely acknowledges that if INFY proves to be an ""underperformer"" in Bombay, that might entail the stock appreciating roughly 10% more by the end of the year.To justify that kind of logic, the broad Indian market - and the funds that reflect it - will have to run rings around most forecasts for Wall Street in the next nine months.That would make funds like INDA and company a huge opportunity for U.S. traders, even if INFY remains a huge drag on their overall performance.And while growth of ""only"" 8% to 10% may not be enough to propel INFY's business into the stratosphere, its shares now look cheap compared to just about everything else you can play in India. INFY's P/E is now 12. Elsewhere in the Indian IT group, WIT is still fetching 23 times earnings after its recent plunge, and upstart Patni (NYSE:PTI-OLD) is trading north of 33.Maybe WIT and PTI are still earning a bigger growth multiple than INFY's apparently less robust business prospects deserve. But if the Indian IT business is really growing at a rate of 9% to 14% and INFY is targeting the middle of that trend for itself, how much faster can these companies really be expanding their own businesses? Growth rates of 20% to 30% just don't add up here.The only alternative - that INFY is now deeply undervalued compared to its peers - is almost too bizarre to contemplate, but that's what the numbers indicate.Of course, if you're looking for value in India and maybe even better growth, there's always car-maker Tata Motors (NYSE:TTM). Mock the ultra-cheap Nano all you want - TTM is cheaper than INFY on an earnings basis and analyst consensus expects it to grow at a rate of 15% in the looming fiscal year."
885831,28511,2012-09-24T17:12:24-04:00,,"Infosys (NYSE:INFY), India's second largest software exporter, is expanding into management consultancy by acquiring the Switzerland based Lodestone Holding AG, that has 750 consultants and 200 clients, for $349 million. The outsourcing giant which was once India's largest IT company is struggling due to declining sales, falling stock, dwindling market share, changing CEOs and growing resentment among shareholders. Shareholders have often openly criticized senior management for its risk-averse approach. Its large stockpile of cash reserves finally raised enough eyebrows that it had to be deployed. Sam Mahtani, an Infosys shareholder with UK based F&C Asset Management had earlier called for the company to either distribute the cash as dividends or use it for M&A.The Bangalore-based IT company is facing increasing competition from Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and IBM (NYSE:IBM). By the end of June, the company had successfully touched the 30% mark of income from consultancy, now it is looking to go beyond that. IBM, in particular, has gotten very aggressive building a very strong full service network in India offering more than just the back-office infrastructure but the software and hardware to run it all. And it speaks to the problems companies like Infosys have when they won't move quickly to innovate.Even after the Lodestone deal, Infosys's biggest; the company will still have plenty of cash. Some will be doled back out to recently-suffering shareholders while the rest will be used for M&A. Infosys had $3.7 billion in cash and short term investments in its latest half yearly report, far more than TCS's $1.7 billion. It has been looking for a European M&A target for the last ten years but have finally gotten their prize. By the end of October, Infosys will close on the deal raising their SAP (NYSE:SAP) consultants by more than 750 people which should push SAP consultancy revenues up near $1 billion annually.Lodestone is expecting to earn about $270 million in the current fiscal year, with about half coming from Switzerland and 23% from Germany. IT companies around the world have been moving into management consultancy due to its higher margins and increasing demand and Infosys looks to be about a year behind the curve. The acquisition will expand Infosys's customer base to include some Fortune-500 companies BMW, and Deutsche Telekom, Europe's largest telecom company. Infosys will have an opportunity to provide IT services as well to Lodestone's high profile customers.It has also faced some difficulties with finding the right new CEO from its seven founders while the current M.D. and chief S.D. Shibula, who is also a founder and fourth CEO to serve his company, has focused on restructuring to tackle the challenges. A lack of firm leadership has contributed to shareholders' unease and demands for action. It has been historically reluctant of doing M&A, preferring to rely on organic growth. But, to shift business models and company focus will require acquiring expertise and a client base if it wants to stave off increasing competition from IBM and TCS.Infosys is also aiming to earn 40% of its revenues from Europe in the current year as opposed to 22% earned last year; the Lodestone acquisition is part of that strategy. It has targeted France and Germany as its greatest opportunities since the two countries spent more than $178 billion last year on IT goods and services combined.For the quarter ending June 30th, Infosys had reported falling revenues by 1% sequentially as net earnings dropped from $463 million to $416 million. However, on a YoY basis, the revenues were up 4.8%. TCS also posted its financials the same day which showed it increasing revenues 3% sequentially and 13% annually. The relative gap in performance between the two companies is having an effect on Infosys retaining the best staff. What once was the equivalent of getting a job at IBM in the 1970's now no longer carries the same halo effect for young workers. Staffing problems have moved up to the senior management level as Shaji Farooq the head of financial services joined its competitor Wipro earlier in the year.Infosys's primary markets are the U.S and Europe. The prolonged economic crisis has translated into falling sales. Falling revenue is almost always associated with declining market share but in Infosys's case, it is declining even faster because its biggest customers, such as Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and UBS are trimming their IT expenditures due to financial issues. Most of the U.S. and European banks have had to excise large portions of their staffs as their core lending businesses have stagnated. For those with vibrant, if shady, trading and investment banking arms the situation is different. Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) have retained their level of IT spending.The net effect of the latest round of QE will be to continue rolling the entire banking system in the U.S. and Europe into the majors while stripping the regional banks of their good assets, whether that will translate into more IT spending for Infosys or not is hard to predict. Many of the layoffs announced came in spite of QE1 and QE2. JPMorgan, in particular, should thrive in this new environment as will B. of A. since it will be their MBS's the Fed will be monetizing.The management insists that the fall in stock is only temporary and with their current strategy of expansion in Europe and shift into consultancy, Infosys is looking to be back on track to growth sooner rather than later. Execution and integration of new acquisitions are rarely smooth and for a company that has grown from within itself from the ground up, incorporating a European company with its different culture may be easier said than done.Infosys is a long way from getting back to an organic growth path and will have to move quickly into the growing markets in Southeast Asia to find their next way forward. The irony should not be lost on anyone that the company which made its fortune outsourcing IT services to the West is now finding itself being outflanked on its home turf by one of the very companies it was founded to support. Both are trading at similar multiples (~15), throwing off similar yields (~1.6%) and Return on Assets (31+ %) but until Infosys proves they can successfully shift into this new business and start growing margins, the stock looks like a value trap.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

A vast pool of talented labor, an English-proficient population and a competitive cost structure characterize this market.

The soft economy or factors that impact the economic health of the United States, Europe or these industries may affect its business.Further, legislation in certain countries, such as the United States and the United Kingdom, may restrict companies in those countries from outsourcing work to INFY. Client contracts can typically be terminated without cause and with little or no notice or penalty, which could negatively impact its revenues and profitability.Intense competition in the market for technology services could affect Infosys' cost advantages, which might reduce its share of business from clients and decrease its revenues.Founded in 1981, Infosys Technologies Ltd. is the second-largest IT services company in terms of revenue in India.

As seen in Chart 1, the stock traded between $38 and $50 until mid-January, when a happy surprise on Q3 F2013 earnings sent the stock to $52 per share during after hours on 1/11/2013. Since then, the stock price has never dropped below $50. At the current level, INFY appears to be fairly valued, according to my updated DCF model. However, with its price above $50 and the stock market near its all-time high in history, this cyclical stock carries great downside risk and therefore, should be avoided in the near term.Chart 1. Stock Performance of INFY since 5/15/2012I believe the market optimism in INFY will be short-lived because I don't find many positive changes in the fundamentals that are substantial and structural. This article does a good job reviewing the Q3 F2012 results in great detail. In addition to what has been mentioned in that article, here are three other reasons why Infosys is not poised for a turnaround yet.1. Infosys' premium pricing continues to struggle, but management does not plan to cut price substantially.Weak IT spending and the commoditization of traditional ADM services during recent years makes it hard for INFY to charge premium prices. Since 2009, there has been a strong trend of vendor consolidation among customers and a shift in client focus from maximizing values to reducing costs. This particularly hurts Infosys, as it is arguably the most rigid among Indian IT firms on pricing. As reflected in Table 1, Infosys grows its top line much more slowly than most of its industry peers, except Wipro (NYSE:WIT). INFY still maintains its advantage on operating margin over other competitors, except Tata Consultancy (TCS.BO). I believe that Infosys' margin contraction over the past few quarters is mostly due to market competition as opposed to any management decision to strategically cut prices. My read from the Q3 F2013 transcript is that, although INFY has softened its stand on pricing, the management team is not planning to fundamentally change its premium pricing strategy.Table 1. Revenue Growth and Operating MarginComment: All revenues are based on U.S. dollars. INFY's and Cognizant Technology Solutions' (NASDAQ:CTSH) quarterly revenue growth and operating margin are sourced from Morningstar.com. WIT revenues here refer to its IT services revenues, which are reported in its analyst data sheet. TCS and HCL Technologies data is sourced from their investor sites here and here. HCL margin in the table is, in fact, EBITDA margin, as HCL does not report operating margin in its press release.S.D. Shibulal, CEO of Infosys, detailed the company's growth strategy in his response to Jesse Hulsing from Pacific Crest Securities on the earnings call. In short, the strategy has two focuses: to expand its consulting and system integration business, where price premiums are easier to maintain, and to achieve non-linear growth in all product lines.2. It could take a few years for Infosys to achieve non-linear growth.The Indian IT industry has long been known to operate on a linear growth model, where revenue per employee is constant. Simply speaking, to grow revenue in the linear growth business model means to hire more programmers to write more codes. INFY wants to achieve non-linear growth in its products and platform business by offering more value-added services. But such transformation could take years, as suggested by this article. Currently, INFY's revenue growth still strongly correlates with headcount growth, as suggested in Table 2.Table 2. Revenue Growth and Headcount Growth3. Infosys does not appear to look for large acquisitions that are much needed to grow its consulting business.Customers of consulting and system integration business are less price sensitive. Therefore, it is easier for Infosys to maintain pricing premiums in such areas. INFY's acquisition of Lodestone in September 2012 is a key step it took to move up the value chain. This type of deal is good, but INFY needs to do more acquisitions like this to really strengthen its consulting business. Its competitors have moved early on this, and INFY would need to move fast to catch the last train, as argued by Indian School of Business Assistant Professor of Strategy Raveendra Chittoor in his article. Bloomberg's interview with INFY's CEO on 1/24/2013 does reveal that Infosys is looking for firms to acquire. However, my understanding of the CEO's tone is that INFY is shopping for smaller firms in the products and platform business for public services in the U.S., and staff integration and culture fit are important. All of these make me think that large-scale overseas acquisitions are not likely to happen in the near future.Updated ModelsMy model in May 2012 was based on an annual revenue growth rate of 10% between 2013 and 2017, and a 5% perpetual yearly growth rate on long-term FCF post-2017. Operating margin was assumed to stay at 28.63% over the next five years. Tax rates were predicted to increase by half a percentage point every year from 29% in 2013 to 31% in 2017, and stay at 31% thereafter.I have rebuilt my model with a revised outlook on revenue growth, margins and tax rates. Below are my key model assumptions. Long-term cash flow growth is kept at 5%. Details about other model inputs and justifications about my assumptions can be found here. For cross-check, in the base scenario, INFY's EBIT margin decreases from 32.23% in the first nine months of F2013 to 29.82% in 2017, and its net margin decreases from 23.46% to 21.47% in 2017.Table 3. Key Model AssumptionsI decided to use a cost of equity of 10.5% as opposed to 10% in the previous model because the stock market is riskier now than in May 2012. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones are trading near their all-time highs from October 2007, despite recent signs of a stagnant economy and weakening company fundamentals. The Fed decided to continue QE and keep interest rates at current levels after a two-day FOMC meeting ending on 1/30/2013. Its latest FOMC statement noted a slowdown in economic growth around year-end, as the fourth quarter GDP dropped by an annual rate of 0.1 percent, the worst performance since Q2 2009. Chart 2 shows that earnings and revenue growth rates of S&P 500 companies have come to a halt over the past two quarters. The disconnect between Fed-policy-driven optimism and the realities of the economy convince me that downside risk outweighs upside potential in the near term. Infosys, as a typical cyclical stock, could be hit very hard in a market pullback.Chart 2. S&P 500 Earnings & Revenue GrowthSource: Earnings, Revenue, & Valuations: S&P 500 Sectors. Updated as of January 30, 2013. Yardeni.comConclusionMy model projects the fair value to be around $55 a share in the base case scenario. The $3 discount based on the current price of $52 does not offer much margin of safety. Furthermore, considering a possible 10%-15% pullback in the near term, I would recommend avoiding this cyclical stock, as it carries too much downside risk at the moment.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

A vast pool of talented labor,  an English-proficient population and a competitive cost structure  characterize this market. Additionally, the Indian offshore services  market only accounts for a small percentage of worldwide IT services  spending, leaving room for Infosys to grow.The company continues to focus on large transformational engagements,  especially through its consulting and enterprise solutions offerings.  The clients have been impressed by its engineering services.  The  pricing environment has stabilized and there is increasing demand for  its system integration services due to Mergers & Acquisition.However, revenues of Infosys are highly dependent on clients primarily  located in the United States and Europe, as well as on clients  concentrated in certain industries. The soft economy or factors that  impact the economic health of the United States, Europe or these  industries may affect its business.Further, Legislation in certain countries, such as the United States  and the United Kingdom, may restrict companies in those countries from  outsourcing work to INFY. Client contracts can typically be terminated  without cause and with little or no notice or penalty, which could  negatively impact its revenues and profitability.Intense competition in the market for technology services could affect  Infosys’ cost advantages, which might reduce its share of business from  clients and decrease its revenues.Founded in 1981, Infosys Technologies Ltd. is the second-largest IT  services company in terms of revenue in India.

However, the Indian  outsourcing firm is wrestling with a 25 percent spike in employee  attrition—the highest mark since 2004, analysts say.The turnover figures are always worth tracking for Indian outsourcing  firms. These companies are moving upstream to more “transformational”  deals including business process outsourcing and consulting. Meanwhile,  these companies are in growth mode and a high attrition rate becomes a  bit of a distraction.First, the numbers. Infosys reported fiscal first quarter earnings of  57 cents a share on revenue of $1.36 billion. Wall Street was looking  for earnings of 56 cents a share on revenue of $1.4 billion. The company  said its second quarter revenue will be $1.41 billion to $1.43 billion  with earnings of 59 cents to 60 cents a share. Wall Street estimates:  earnings of 60 cents a share on revenue of $1.38 billion.Overall, Infosys’ quarter looked good. Executives were a bit cautious  about Europe, but noted they weren’t seeing any major hiccups. The  company, however, underestimated the surge in India’s economy and  competition for workers.Those stats tell the tale. Infosys raised wages and incentives and  hired 8,859 workers in the June quarter. The rub: The company added a  net 1,000 workers. This equation can be worrisome. Infosys has to bring  on new workers and train them. Bottom line: These workers aren’t  productive out of the gate and hurt profit margins. For customers, there  are also worries about project continuity—especially for these high-end  projects. In the fiscal second quarter, Infosys is planning to hire  14,000 employees.T.V. Mohandas Pai, director of HR at Infosys, said the first quarter  turnover rate is coming back down. About 950 employees left for higher  education. However, the rate of attrition for BPO employees is about 35  percent.Pai added:The company now projects it will hire 36,000 employees in the fiscal  year, up from its previous target of 30,000, to account for attrition  and growth.Original post"

131586,20480,2009-04-19T03:34:06-04:00,,"Excerpts from Gilford Securities analyst Ashish R. Thadhani's recent note to clients on Infosys (NYSE:INFY):• • •After Soft Landing, QoQ Growth May Resume in Dec. QuarterBased on near-term uncertainty over client IT spending, pricing pressure and continued hiring to support long-term growth – plus conservative expectation of a drawn out recovery – we are reducing our estimates: fiscal 2010 diluted EPADS to $1.95 on revenue of $4.335 billion (-7% YoY) from $2.05 on $4.386 billion; and fiscal 2011 diluted EPADS to $2.00 – including a one-time jump in the tax-rate – on $4.823 billion (+11% YoY) from $2.20 on $4.927 billion. To reflect improving investor sentiment, we are raising our target price from $32 to $35. In 12-months, this would correspond to 15-20x forward EPS – a premium to the current valuation (14x).4Q09 diluted EPADS of $0.56 on revenue of $1.121 billion met our $0.56 estimate on $1.130 billion. Revenue was held back by currency volatility (-$13 million impact). On a constant currency basis, revenue increased 5.9% YoY but fell 3.2% QoQ vs. reported figures of -1.8% YoY and -4.3% QoQ. Results included a $3.0 million tax reversal (less than +$0.01 EPADS impact). Infosys raised the annualized dividend by 36% to INR 23.50 (or $0.46) per ADS.Not surprisingly, Infosys recorded QoQ slippage across various operating metrics: volume (-1.4%), pricing (-2.1% on a constant currency basis), utilization (-0.6%) and operating margin (-250 bps). However, it also posted QoQ gains in headcount (+1.7% reflecting high acceptance of campus offers), attrition (-0.7%), new clients (+7) and net cash (+$177 million under IFRS). Areas of relative strength included the RoW region (+5.0% QoQ on a constant currency basis) and Retail vertical (+3.5%). Meanwhile, weakness was pronounced across the Financial Services vertical (-9.0% QoQ) and Europe (-5.3% driven by the U.K.). Operating income of $330.0 million (29.4% margin) missed our $342.8 million estimate (30.3% margin). The QoQ decline in operating margin is explained by lower pricing (-150 bps impact) and reinvestment of currency gains in new markets/solutions and sales personnel to shore up future growth.Fiscal 2010 revenue guidance assumes flat to a 3% YoY decline on a constant currency basis. Infosys anticipates a 300 bps deterioration in the operating margin due to price erosion (5.7% YoY = -350 bps impact) and lower utilization (net headcount is expected to increase by 8K in spite of the revenue reduction = -400 bps), mitigated by rupee depreciation (9.0% YoY = +450 bps). While the environment remains challenging, Infosys believes that it can hold pricing at 4Q09 levels since a majority of renegotiations have concluded. While results of some banks suggest signs of stabilization, Infosys has not factored any meaningful recovery into its outlook. According to a March 2009 survey of the company’s top-135 clients (83% of revenue), 69% of respondents expect a double-digit cut in their overall IT budget this year – while a similar number stated that spending on offshore initiatives could decline.Hiring plans call for gross addition of 18K employees in fiscal 2010 – down from 28K in fiscal 2009 – comprising 16K fresh graduates, 1K lateral hires with specialized skills plus 1K onsite staff. Infosys will honor its prior campus commitments, extend the training program by 50% to almost six months, maintain a massive bench (~30K employees) in preparation for an eventual recovery and exit the year with a headcount of 113K vs. 105K in fiscal 2009. It will forego annual salary increases in April. Increments have ranged between 3-7% for onsite staff and 11-15% for offshore in recent years.Recent results demonstrate that Infosys has managed a turbulent environment with exceptional dexterity. Infosys has not suffered any material project cancellations or client departures. However, it has not been able to fully replenish completed projects. Sales cycles have lengthened from six to nine months and deal sizes have contracted due to scope reductions and inclusion of multiple vendors as a means to extract better terms. Still, quarterly revenue should trough “only” 10-15% below the September 2008 peak while the operating margin is unlikely to breach 25% during the current downturn. Infosys has indicated that several clients are seeking its (maintenance) services to optimize their cost structure. The Energy & Utilities and Healthcare verticals appear to offer the best opportunities. It also noted an increasing focus on new engagement models that should enhance client value and Infosys profitability, e.g., solution-based offerings, SaaS, platform BPO and others.Political considerations (proposed tax and visa legislation) have not impacted the business so far. To overcome potential visa restrictions, Infosys can step-up onsite hiring, expand its near-shore presence in Canada and Mexico and/or shift more work to offshore locations.INFY shares are suitable for aggressive investors. In our opinion, principal risks include the following: U.S. slowdown; rising offshore salaries; appreciation of the Indian currency, which would translate into higher expenses incurred in rupees; correction in the Bombay Stock Exchange and/or U.S. markets; political opposition in the U.S.; and geopolitical uncertainty in the Indian subcontinent.Disclosure: I, Ashish Thadhani, certify that all the views expressed in this research report accurately reflect my personal views of the subject companies.

In this post I want to cover Infosys which reported earnings earlier today.  Infosys is a core long term holding for any global portfolio. But valuation is an issue; and valuation is something which must always be borne in mind. Please visit ""The Quant Report"" and link through to the INFY report for a decade's worth of historic data and the various valuation metrics applied in arriving at below referred indicative out values.Between the year ended 31 March 2000 and 31 March 2009, INFY has delivered annualized earnings growth of 37.91%. By end March 2010, annualized earnings growth since 31 March 2000, is expected to have fallen to 32.63%. Dividend growth has been even stronger with a dividend growth rate of near 41% annualized expected between the year ended 31 March, 2000 and 31 March 2010. Payout ratio has run at a median rate of 15.17% between the year ended 31 March, 2000 and 31 March 2009 and are expected to rise to just below 20% by end March 2010 – the dividend is safe. The balance sheet is unleveraged and the management is top quality.PE ratio (Annual Average Price / EPS) for Infosys has run at median levels of 34.7 between the year ended 31 March, 2000 and 31 March 2009. PE 6 (Annual Average Price Divided by Median 6 Year EPS) has run at median levels of 71.32 during the same period. However, the multiples have dropped dramatically in recent years; during the year ended 2009 it was down to 14.72 and for the present fiscal year to date, it is running at 18.The historic multiples were high and investors must bear in mind that Infosys has grown from $0.12 in earnings to over $2.10; growth at these levels going forward will not be as easy. With lower growth expectations, I would be a mistake to look for median reversion on multiples. Growth has numerous challenges; firstly IT Services is intensely competitive and the competition is intensifying; secondly the financial services, a key user of IT services, has been badly hurt by the implosion of the debt bubble; thirdly outsourcing and off-shoring is and is likely to become more politically unpalatable; finally the telecom sector, another major market for IT services is going through pain of its own in terms of growth expectations.There is an added problem, India's IT services face high inflation and Rs cost pressure on input costs; at the same time outputs (revenue) are derived from states with lower inflation rates. What this means is margin pressure. Furthermore, with India's demand for capital, demand for Rs is elevated and this leads to an expectation of a strong Rs. Because revenue is dollar denominated, a strong Rs leads to slow top line growth in Rs terms; and that is a great dampener on valuation. Slow top line growth in an era of rising input costs adds even more margin pressure; in addition a strong Rs makes competition in US more challenging.There is a lot Infosys has done and will do to mitigate these risks; they can be expected to improve productivity and continue making productivity gains; they can move staff closer to customers and hire locally (diversify their input cost base); they can diversify their revenue stream and reduce dependence on US (India is a huge growth market for IT services and gains in Europe are very likely). But the fact remains that there are challenges to growth which lie ahead.I am working with a base case scenario which will allow INFY to grow earnings at 12% annualized going ahead. The calculated multiple an investor should be willing to pay for 12% long term earnings growth, 16% investor long term return expectation and a P% payout ratio is 16.8. For P% we use the median payout ratios over the last 10 years, or 40% if higher. Based on this the value we can expect by 2014 is $41; the share price trades at near $50 today. If we reduce the investor long term return expectation to 14%, a multiple of 33.6 would apply making for a price target of $82.50. If we reduce the investor long term return expectation to 15%, a multiple of 22.4 would apply making for a price target of $55. In my view, a reasonable valuation range for INFY is $55 to $85 by 2014.Through this crisis the stock traded at a low of $21; this is 20% over my estimate of 2009 fair value; this strength is indicative of the very high quality of the holding. Because of the stock quality and its place as a core holding for long term investors, I would add positions at $35 and look to accumulate if it falls towards $30. Infosys is not a share I would recommend selling simply because it got expensive; this share is best held for the long term.Disclosure: Long Infosys."

This compares with our estimate of $0.55 in earnings per ADS on revenues of $1.14 billion and the consensus expectation of $0.54 per ADS on revenues of $1.13 billion.For the full year, INFY reported revenues of $4.66 billion and earnings of $2.25 per ADS. We were expecting revenues of $4.68 billion and earnings of $2.23 per ADS. Weaker business volumes and pricing pressures were offset by higher operating margin, leading to better-than-expected earnings.The tone and content of INFY’s forward guidance confirms our earlier contention that although the deal pipeline appears robust, pricing pressures have been persistent and deals are getting done at a much slower clip. Management acknowledged the impact of the global slowdown and indicated that the extent of pricing pressures are not being fully reflected in current expectations.FY2010 guidance reflects the nature of this impact: INFY guided full-year revenues to decline by 3.1%-6.7%, implying a range of $4.35 - $4.52 billion, while earnings are expected to drop up to 15%. INFY guided earnings per ADS in the range of $1.91 to $2.00, which is markedly lower than the mid-point of the current expectation of $2.14 per ADS.Beyond the doom-and-gloom scenario, INFY management indicated that deal flow still remains healthy and the company still plans on hiring another 18,000 employees in the current fiscal year with no job cuts planned so far. To counter the ongoing business slowdown, the company indicated that it will increase its focus on cost-cutting measures, particularly on discretionary expenses. We have a Hold rating on shares on INFY."

Infosys now anticipates revenues for this fiscal year to be $4.6 billion to $4.62 billion, a much more optimistic forecast than made in July.Earlier this year, Infoysys had stated that it would look to retrench in its domestic market and Asia, as business conditions in Europe & the US continued to deteriorate. So the upbeat quarter & CEO Kris Gopalakrishnan's bullishness have come as quite a surprise.Earnings for the ADS of the company are now expected to be in the region of $2.10, a 7% drop on 2008, however a much improved benchmark from July this year, when Infosys stated a potential overall decline in EPS by up to 12.5%.Normally, companies that make U-turns on forecasts in the middle of the year tend to be broadcasting warning signals, however after a slew of negative messages, it is good to see Infosys are taking a positive track. Infosys is well known for being cautious on it's financial announcements, so any bullishness from Gopalkrishnan, should be taken at face value. As more than 60% of Infosys revenues are generated in the US, could this be a signal that the recovery is actually starting?Disclosure: No position."
115667,20480,2009-01-21T08:40:10-05:00,,"Excerpted from Gilford Securities analyst Ashish R. Thadhani's recent report to clients on Infosys Technologies Ltd. (NYSE:INFY):• • •Founded in 1981, Infosys is a premier technology services vendor. It designs and delivers IT-enabled business solutions that span the entire software lifecycle: consulting, development, maintenance, systems integration and package implementation. Infosys employs a Global Delivery Model that utilizes distributed project management. Infosys is the third largest Indian IT Services company – distinguished by a premium brand, industry-leading profitability and scalable manpower infrastructure. Its global sales headquarters are in Fremont, CA.Based on slow IT spending in a deepening global economic downturn – and pervasive presence across the troubled Financial Services segment – we are reducing our estimates as follows: fiscal 2009 diluted EPADS to $2.24 on revenue of $4.673 billion (12% YoY growth) from $2.25 on revenue of $4.742 billion; and fiscal 2010 diluted EPADS to $2.05 on revenue of $4.386 billion (6% YoY contraction) from $2.25 on revenue of $4.998 billion. At this time, we are introducing a fiscal 2011 diluted EPS estimate of $2.20 on revenue of $4.927 billion (12% YoY growth). Our current model anticipates no sustained upturn in revenue until the March 2010 quarter.We are lowering our target price from $35 to $32. In 12-months, this would correspond to 15x forward EPS – a premium to the current valuation (13x).3Q09 diluted EPADS of $0.58 on revenue of $1.171 billion beat our $0.57 estimate on revenue of $1.186 billion. Revenue was held back by currency volatility (-$57 million impact). On a constant currency basis, revenue increased 14.6% YoY and 1.0% QoQ vs. reported figures of +8.0% YoY and -3.7% QoQ. Results were also distorted by a $41 million currency translation gain (+$0.07 EPADS impact) and $44 million hedging loss (-$0.08) – primarily due to steep rupee depreciation averaging 11.1% QoQ and 25.4% YoY – and a $12 million tax reversal (+$0.02).Notwithstanding the challenging backdrop, Infosys recorded solid QoQ progress across most operating metrics: volume (+2.0%), utilization (+0.6%), offshore revenue contribution (+1.5%), operating margin (+220 bps), headcount (+2.8%) and attrition (-1.0%). However, pricing fell 1.8% QoQ on a constant currency basis. Further erosion is not being ruled out but Infosys did reaffirm its commitment to keep the operating margin on a firm footing. It has successfully negotiated demands to match lower competitor rates with tradeoffs such as higher volumes and/or non effort-based pricing.Areas of relative strength included the Financial Services and Retail verticals (+4.1% and +2.9% QoQ on a constant currency basis) and the North American region (+1.5%). Meanwhile, weakness was noticeable across the Manufacturing and Telecom verticals (-3.7% and -3.4%) and Europe (-1.2%).Operating income of $371.3 million (31.7% margin) surpassed our $347.7 million estimate (29.3% margin). The QoQ improvement in operating margin was driven by rupee depreciation (470 bps) and controlled G&A – mitigated by a larger bench (130 bps), depreciation of European/other currencies vs. the U.S. dollar (100 bps) and lower pricing. Other income included a $7 million break-up fee from Axon Group plc – offset partially by $3 million in transaction-related expenses.Infosys has not suffered any material project cancellations although decision-making has been impacted by the overall environment and ownership/management changes in the Financial Services segment. Client budgets should be finalized by March and are expected to decline 4-5% YoY. The 2% reduction in fiscal 2009 revenue guidance is explained by unfavorable currency swings and, to a lesser extent, recent pricing pressure. Current guidance assumes stable pricing and exchange rates (INR 48.71 per U.S. dollar) with no QoQ volume growth in 4Q09.Hiring plans call for gross addition of 27K employees in fiscal 2009 – up from 25K in October – due to higher acceptance of campus and BPO offers plus lateral hiring for specialized skills. In fiscal 2010, Infosys will honor its prior campus commitments, enrich/extend the training program from 16 to 24 weeks and exit the year with a headcount of 110K vs. 104K in fiscal 2009E and 91K in fiscal 2008. In response to client requests, Infosys will maintain a massive bench (~30K employees) capable of responding quickly to future opportunities. Offshore salary increases in April are likely to be muted. We also note that variable compensation – functioned on revenue growth and operating margin – represents up to 30% of total compensation for offshore employees (and 5% of revenue).During the quarter, Infosys won four transformational engagements. These included Bharti Airtel (delivery of interactive applications to power its Direct-To-Home TV service) and AstraZeneca (expansion of an existing application maintenance relationship). Infosys noted that it is increasingly moving toward outcome-based pricing.Infosys has not felt any immediate fallout from the Satyam (SAY) scandal. As a matter of principle, it is not proactively targeting Satyam clients but will be responsive, if approached. Infosys believes it is well prepared to address heightened due-diligence scrutiny.Finally, we commend Infosys for its voluntary disclosure of cash balances held at all financial institutions. Its audit committee independently verifies these amounts as well. Additionally, unlike Wipro (NYSE:WIT) and Satyam, it did not allocate IPO shares to any clients.INFY shares are suitable for aggressive investors. In our opinion, principal risks include the following: U.S. slowdown; rising offshore salaries; appreciation of the Indian currency, which would translate into higher expenses incurred in rupees; correction in the Bombay Stock Exchange and/or U.S. markets; political opposition in the U.S.; and geopolitical uncertainty in the Indian subcontinent.ANALYST CERTIFICATIONI, Ashish Thadhani, certify that all the views expressed in this research report accurately reflect my personal views of the subject companies.

The results announced by the largest player, Infosys Technologies (NYSE:INFY), did manage to bring some respite to the market. Narayan Murthy must be ashamed of his compatriot, Ramalinga Raju for jeopardizing India’s reputation. For the quarter, Infosys’ revenues grew by 8% to $1.17 billion and met analysts’ expectations while EPS of $0.58 beat the Street’s expectations of $0.55. By segment, the company saw BFSI grow  by 4.1%, retail by 2.9% and other segments grow by 4.3% in constant currency. However, manufacturing and telecom declined by 3.7% and 3.4% in constant currency.In view of economic concerns, the company revised its outlook further downwards to growth expectations in the range of 12%-13% from 13%-15% expected earlier. The company blamed this reduction on the strengthening dollar with reference to European currencies.The company expects profit in the range of $0.55 for Q4 with revenues of $1.13-$1.17 billion. For the full year, the company forecasts profits to rise to $2.23 with revenues in the range of $4.67-$4.71 billion. The Street was looking for Q4 revenues of $1.18 billion with fiscal revenue projections of $4.73 billion.In the previous quarter, Infosys was looking to move out of body shopping through the acquisition of Axon. However, with the deal having fallen through in favor of its competitor HCL Technologies, it is now searching for other potential acquisitions, making me wonder again about its Wave 3 strategy.The company was worried about growing pricing pressures as it saw its prices slide by 2% in constant currency. These price pressures are illustrations to my oft-stated point that the Indian outsourcing industry cannot simply compete on labor arbitrage, as the price differentials will soon vanish.Meanwhile, on the announcement of the results, the stock rose by 6% to $27.40, and at the time of writing was trading at $26.44.Disclosure: None"

The National Outsourcing Association (NOA) published a report titled “Best Practice Outsourcing and Offshoring” which pointed the issue Indian offshore providers face: Increasing operational costs forcing some providers to relocate their centers to cheaper areas in India in order to compete more effectively; although this move has not hindered a recent surge in emerging outsourcing destinations.Indian BPO providers may not be the only ones experiencing increasing operational costs, other offshore providers experience this as well but at a lesser extent as countries such as the Philippines receive strong government support.Proof of Indian outsourcing providers struggles are evident as Infosys Technologies Limited (NASDAQ: INFY) forecasts its first annual revenue fall for the year to March 2010 due to client pricing demands. INFY is looking for 12 to 15 deals worth $1 billion or companies worth 10% of Infosys’ revenue. The firm is considering acquisitions in Europe, Latin America, Australia and Japan, a step that could help boost slowing growth by geographical diversification.Gartner group vice president Mike Lafford warned CIOs not to sign outsourcing deals longer than 5 years and said that the best practice is to sign contracts with a base term of 3 to 5 years with extension clauses of up to 2 years. According to Lafford, shorter deals are more compelling as long term deals will often fail due to the pace of technological advancement, changes in business requirements, and other unforeseen events such as that experienced by Satyam’s clients.Lafford:Despite Gartner’s warning, the NOA’s quarterly Outsourcing Confidence Index study reveals confidence in the outsourcing industry continues to improve with 40% of outsourcing providers forecasting revenue growth. Further, providers are experiencing an increase in high-volume, low-cost deals.NOA’s findings support Everest Research Institute’s second quarter report on global outsourcing and offshoring activity which shows outsourcing transaction volumes increased by 10% globally compared to the first quarter of this year.Disclosure: No positions"

Based on slower decision-making due to the ongoing global financial crisis and lower interest income – offset partially by a currency-aided margin tailwind – we are reducing our estimates as follows: fiscal 2009 diluted EPADS to $2.25 on revenue of $4.742 billion (14% YoY growth) from $2.30 on revenue of $5.015 billion; and fiscal 2010 diluted EPADS to $2.25 on revenue of $4.998 billion (5% YoY growth) from $2.65 on revenue of $6.143 billion. Our model conservatively assumes no QoQ revenue growth for the next three quarters. Longer term, we believe that Infosys should deliver ~20% YoY revenue growth in fiscal 2011 and beyond. To reflect prevailing sentiment, we are also revising our target price from $54 to $35. In 12-months, this would correspond to 15x forward EPS – a premium to the current depressed valuation. These deep cuts enable us to accentuate 1) an upward bias to our estimates; and 2) compelling valuation of only 11x forward EPS. Upon return of more normal market conditions, Infosys anticipates substantial work that will address post M&A integration, risk management, regulatory compliance and urgent cost restructuring initiatives in the Financial Services segment.2Q09 Results. Diluted EPADS of $0.56 vs. $0.48 a year ago on revenue of $1.216 billion beat our $0.54 estimate on revenue of $1.218 billion. Revenue was held back by unfavorable currency swings (-$21 million impact). Results included a $28 million net currency translation/hedging loss (-4.2 cent EPADS impact). Operating income advanced 28% YoY and exceeded our estimate by 12%. Highlights included 19% YoY and 5.3% QoQ revenue growth; currency-aided operating margin of 29.5% vs. 27.5% a year ago; five transformational wins; unchanged hiring plan; a 30% jump in the annualized dividend to INR 17.25 per ADS; and fiscal 2009 guidance necessitating only a 2% reduction to our EPS estimate. Separately, Infosys announced that it will not raise its original ₤407 million offer for Axon Group plc made on August 25, thereby ceding the SAP consulting outfit to rival HCL.INFY shares are suitable for aggressive investors. In our opinion, principal risks include the following: U.S. slowdown; rising offshore salaries; appreciation of the Indian currency, which would translate into higher expenses incurred in rupees; correction in the Bombay Stock Exchange and/or U.S. markets; political opposition in the U.S.; and geopolitical uncertainty in the Indian subcontinent.ANALYST CERTIFICATION I, Ashish Thadhani, certify that all the views expressed in this research report accurately reflect my personal views of the subject companies.

The Indian IT major, Infosys Technologies (NYSE:INFY) had expressed its concerns about the recession when the company announced its Q407 results earlier this year. Its Q2 results and the outlook for 2008-09, announced on October 11, quantify these concerns. For the quarter, revenues of $1.22 billion met analysts’ expectations while EPS of $0.56 exceeded expectations by $0.01. Revenues grew 19% over the year. EPS grew 16% over the year and 4% sequentially.By region, Europe contributed 28.3% of revenues, compared with 27.3% last quarter, and the North American contribution was down slightly, to 61.8% from 62.6% in the first quarter. The rest of the world contributed 9.9% of total revenues, up from 8.8% last quarter. The heavy reliance in American business is a huge concern for the company longer term, as the U.S. is now going to be in a prolonged belt-tightening phase. Sure, companies use outsourcing to cut costs in down markets, and in fact, this decade’s boom in outsourcing was actually a product of the dotcom bust and post 9/11 trauma. However, the current market conditions may not exactly mirror the previous one, and Infosys’ guidance reflects that apprehension.By segment, Application Development and Maintenance [ADM] contributed 44.2% of revenues while Consulting Services brought in 24.3%. Business Process Management contributed 6%, Infrastructure Management 5.2%, Product Engineering Services 2.0%, System Integration 3.1%, Testing Services 7.2%, and Other the balance 4.2%.Infosys was looking at the Axon acquisition to help get it out of pure body-shopping and into SaaS, and remove its reliance on labor arbitrage as a strategy. However, as of now, the company has not increased its offer in retaliation to HCL’s bid. Hopefully, it will continue scouting for similar opportunities. In this down market, opportunities for inexpensive acquisitions abound.In view of the market outlook, the company revised its guidance for the year downwards to revenue growth of 13.1-15.2% against the earlier guidance of 19-21%. For the Q3, the company expects revenues to be sequentially flat at $1.2 billion.The stock slipped 4% from the previous day’s close of $25.02 and went down to a new two-year low of $23.91.

While the short term looks rosy, the long term appears less so. I have repeatedly said that Infosys needs to, The company continues to talk about the advantage of its ‘global delivery model, consulting and solution capabilities, and a strong platform for customers.’ However, in the increasingly diverse globalization trends, China, Eastern Europe, Latin America, and other countries would become bigger factors, which its competitors like IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Accenture (NYSE:ACN) have more experience handling. I am not convinced about its ability to cope with the declining labor cost arbitrage advantage longer term. In my highly controversial Death of Indian Outsourcing series, I highlighted the impact that SaaS can have on pure body-shopping. Infosys needs to migrate out of pure body shopping, and start investing heavily into SaaS and IP. As Mastek CEO Sudhakar Ram writes, India is in Wave 3 of IT outsourcing. Where is Infosys’ Wave 3 strategy?"
81918,21970,2008-06-19T04:44:39-04:00,,"Will Infosys Technologies Inc. (NYSE: INFY) be pulled deeper into the vortex created by the implosion of the U.S. subprime industry, or will it manage to safely skim the surface?  To be sure, the chief fear responsible for dampening investor enthusiasm for Infosys stems from the clouded outlook for outsourcing services given the turmoil within the U.S. financial services industry.To what extent are these concerns justified? An in-depth look at the state of the offshore outsourcing and currency markets and the key risks surrounding Infosys are presented in the next section.The U.S. Economy Will Continue to Grow in 2008Consumer spending (70% of the U.S. economy) will hold up in 2008 as a result of low unemployment (4.8%) and moderate wage growth. In fact, data for November 2007 indicates that consumer spending was the strongest in ten months. It seems that the rumors of the demise of the American consumer have been greatly exaggerated. To be sure, economic growth is expected to decelerate to between 1.5% to 2.0% in 2008 (per consensus estimates from Briefing.com) as a result of the weakness in the housing market and higher energy prices. That is certainly below the U.S. long-term trend rate of 3% but still well above the dire forecasts of an impending recession.Sovereign Wealth Funds Will Mitigate the Risks Confronting Financial MarketsMost observers are well aware of the ominous clouds encircling the U.S. financial services industry at this time. Indeed, even prominent firms have suffered significant sub-prime and CDO related losses. Despite this bleak scenario however, the overall picture appears to be considerably brighter than is widely believed. For example, MBIA Inc., a bond insurer, announced that it will receive a cash injection of US$ 1 billion from private equity firm Warburg Pincus to offset write-downs in the fourth quarter. Warburg Pincus is obviously betting that the credit crisis has reached a bottom. Similarly, as noted by BusinessWeek:This view is shared by Merrill Lynch,which, in a recent report, stated that assets under management in Sovereign Wealth Funds (SWFs) could grow more than fourfold by 2011, surging from U.S. $1.9 trillion to U.S. $7.9 trillion. The report further stated that:In short, given their ever swelling reserves and growing appetite for risk, sovereign wealth funds are likely to continue to inject much needed cash into global financial markets, thereby mitigating the downside risks stemming from CDO related losses.IT Budgets to Remain Buoyant in 2008The pundits forecasting a demand contraction for offshore outsourcing services in 2008 have seemingly misunderstood the value proposition offered by India-based offshore services providers such as Infosys Technologies Inc. In fact, the challenges faced by the U.S. financial services industry actually play to the strengths of India-based offshore services organizations. For example, on December 12, 2007, newly appointed Citigroup (NYSE:C) CEO, Vikram Pandit indicated that Citigroup would consider moving more work to lower cost locations in an effort to rationalize its cost structure and enhance productivity within the organization.This view is also shared by Wipro Technologies (NYSE:WIT) CEO, Mr. Azim Premji who, in a recent interview with AFP (December 11, 2007) stated that:In addition, just as the Sarbanes-Oxley regulations resulted in more accounting being offshored to India, industry insiders believe that regulatory changes within the U.S. financial system will similarly boost demand for offshore outsourcing services. For example, Mr. Stephen J Rohleder, chief operating officer, Accenture (NYSE:ACN), notes that:Perhaps the most reliable insight into future IT spending trends is provided by a recent (November 27, 2007) survey conducted by the publication Wall Street and Technology of 140 senior technology officers from representative companies across the financial services industry. In brief, the survey reveals that 2008 IT budgets will increase by more than 10% across the industry. Specifically, the survey indicated that:The survey further indicates that:“This overall modest increase in spending among banks is in keeping with recent trends, according to Celent Senior Analyst Jacob Jegher. “Spending will be similar to trends over the last two or three years when we saw an average growth rate of about 4 percent. But it is moderate,” he comments.More significantly, however, has been the change in composition of that spending. That is, the portion of that spending going towards offshoring has increased more rapidly than the overall increase in spending. This trend is likely to continue well beyond 2008 in view of the cost pressures facing the industry.Pricing Power to Remain Stronger for LongerOne of the key findings from the Wall Street and Technology survey is that U.S. financial firms are facing skyrocketing labor costs as a result of a shortage of IT workers.“A widespread IT labor shortage is driving IT salaries up, and basic IT infrastructure costs - particularly energy and cooling costs in data centers - also are rising rapidly. “The competition for skilled labor in the technology industry has rebounded from the dot-com bubble,” notes Steve Rapp, SVP and CTO of Nicholas-Applegate Capital Management, a global investment firm based in San Diego. “We’re finding the [pay] rates are back up for both consultant labor and for full-time employees. We have to remain competitive, so we’re trying to be on top of that.”""Moreover, the IT labor shortage confronting the developed economies (i.e. U.S., Europe and Japan) may even increase further due to rapid population aging and declining enrollment in IT programs. As a result, India-based offshore services providers, the key beneficiaries of the global IT worker shortage, should continue to see a favorable pricing environment well beyond 2008.Another concern that has unnerved investors in Infosys Technologies relates to the appreciation of the Indian rupee against the U.S. dollar. To be sure, the downside risk stems more from the uncertainty surrounding the pace of appreciation rather than the appreciation per se.That is, given that a company’s intrinsic value reflects the present value of its future earnings, even a small change in exogenous variables (i.e. currency exchange rate) could have a material impact on its implied intrinsic value.Some market pundits have attributed the sharp appreciation of the rupee against the dollar during 2007 to the sudden surge in foreign capital inflows into the Indian stock market. While technically accurate, this explanation does not tell the whole story. The rupee’s appreciation during 2007 can be better understood in the context of the Dollar’s sharp decline against major world currencies during the same period, largely driven by fears of an impending U.S. recession. However, recent developments are worth noting with regard to the outlook for the U.S. dollar.U.S. Economy to Avoid RecessionContrary to fears of a U.S. recession, the U.S. economy has shown remarkable resiliency in the face of significant headwinds. Significantly, consumer spending has held up as a result of low unemployment and moderate wage growth.“Decoupling” Debunked as U.S. Credit Crisis Spreads to Global EconomiesThe sharp decline in the value of the U.S. dollar was based on the “Decoupling” theory propounded by Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), which argued that the credit crisis was specific to the U.S. and that the rest of the world would continue to enjoy robust growth even with the U.S. economy in recession. However, with the credit crisis spreading to banks in Canada, U.K. and Germany, the Decoupling theory has quickly lost favor.Decoupling is “a good story, but it’s not going to work going forward,” Stephen Roach, chairman of Morgan Stanley in Asia, said in an interview in New Delhi on Dec. 2 2007 (Bloomberg, December 07 2007). Significantly, the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England have both lowered interest rates during December 2007, which is supportive of the U.S. dollar. In addition, global growth is likely to slow to 4 percent next year from 4.7 percent in 2007, according to a recent study by Goldman Sachs. The report sees the Euro zone growth slipping to 2.0% next year from 2.6% this year. As a result, Goldman Sachs expects the euro to fall back to $1.35 against the dollar over the next year, and sterling to tumble to $1.88 as the Bank of England cuts interest rates three times.Coordinated Central Bank Action to Mitigate Risks of the Global Credit CrisisThe first coordinated central bank action since 2001, involving the central banks in the U.S., Canada, U.K, and Europe, is likely to mitigate the risks arising from the global credit crisis.Shrinking Twin DeficitsThe decline in the U.S. budget and trade deficits, which have been a drag on the U.S. dollar, may help to strengthen the dollar going forward. The United States budget deficit for fiscal 2007, which ended September 30, 2007, dropped to $162.8 billion, according to the U.S. Treasury Department. Many analysts expect the budget deficit to fall to $135-$150 billion in fiscal 2008. The budget deficit is down from $413 billion in 2004. Meanwhile, the trade deficit is also declining, dropping to $56.5 billion in September 2007 after hitting $67.6 billion in August 2006, according to U.S. Commerce Department data.“I am confident that the dollar will have a significant rally next year, especially against the euro and the pound,” Stephen Jen, the London-based head of currency research at Morgan Stanley told Bloomberg News on Monday. Jen expects the U.S. currency to strengthen to $1.35 against the euro by December 2008. “The deficits are shrinking fast.”Indian Rupee OutlookThe surge in capital inflows during 2007 from foreign buyers of Indian stocks has also contributed to the strengthening of the rupee. However, after the 50% rise in the BSE Sensex during 2007, foreign buying interest in Indian stocks appears to be waning over concerns that valuations may be stretched. Indeed, capital outflows have exceeded outflows during November 2007. Some of the Indian stock market’s biggest bulls have even turned bearish. For example, Sanjiv Duggal, Sr. Fund Manager, CIO and Director of HSBC Holdings Plc (HBC) overlooking US $ 11 Billion of investments, the world’s largest holding of Indian equities, expects the Indian stock market to decline over the next 12 to 18 month period.This view is shared by Morgan Stanley, which in a recent report, assigned a 55% probability to a 26% decline in the Indian stock market during 2008. If such pessimism were to gain momentum, it could trigger a reversal in capital flows out of India towards more attractively valued markets. As a result, expectations of a continued rapid rupee appreciation against the dollar based on foreign capital inflows may be overly optimistic. While it is impossible to precisely forecast the value of the rupee against the dollar, expectations are being tempered.For example, Mr. K.V. Kamath, CEO ICICI Bank, and Forbes Asia Businessman of the Year for 2007 in a recent press conference stated that the rupee was likely to appreciate against the dollar by Re. 1 or Rs. 2 per year, well below the 12% appreciation during 2007. Mr. Kamath also suggested that interest rates in India were poised to decline, which would imply a softer rupee/dollar exchange rate going forward.Significantly, Indian offshore services providers have oft-repeated that a gradual appreciation of the rupee against the dollar was manageable. That is, to the extent that the rupee appreciation is within 3%-5% per year, offshore services providers can adjust various levers within their business model, including currency hedging, pricing, utilization, offshore/onshore mix, productivity and geographical diversification, to mitigate the risk of margin contraction due to rupee appreciation.While investor enthusiasm for Infosys Technologies may have been dampened as a result of the weakness in the U.S. financial industry, an objective evaluation of the macro environment suggests that the risks appear to be overstated.At this time, it appears that the U.S. economy will continue to grow in 2008 as a result of a low unemployment rate and moderate wage growth. Moreover, a weak U.S. economy may even accelerate offshore outsourcing as customers become more focused on driving operational efficiency. As a result, Infosys should continue to see robust demand in 2008. In addition, fears of a continued rapid appreciation of the rupee against the dollar appear to be similarly overstated. Slower global growth, particularly in Europe, and a deceleration in foreign capital flows into Indian stock markets are likely to result in a moderation in the pace of Rupee appreciation in 2008.Infosys will likely surmount these challenges however, given the resiliency of its business model. Going forward, offshoring will steadily gain momentum, as providers broaden their portfolio of services to include everything from Business Transformation to Business Process Management.In view of the buoyant outlook for offshore services, scalability will be the critical success factor in driving earnings growth. On this score, Infosys appears to have an edge over its peers. The company has made significant investments in training (it operates the world’s largest corporate training facility in Mysore, India) and is the industry preferred employer. As a result, Infosys seems to be best positioned in terms of leveraging India’s highly educated cost-competitive human capital advantage to drive growth.Disclosure: Author holds a long position in INFY"

Companies are also taking steps to restrict hiring, which clearly implies low management visibility.”In connection with his call on the sector, Singh cut his rating on Infosys (NYSE:INFY) to Neutral from Outperform. “Our conversations with Infosys management clearly indicates that the environment is worse than its earlier projections,” he writes. “We believe this could pressure full-year numbers of the company.” Singh notes he now has no positive ratings on any companies in the sector; he also cut ratings today on Indian-traded Tata Consultancy and Mindtree.Infosys today is down $1.80, or 5.1%, to $33.38."

Thadhani's recent note to clients on Infosys Technologies Limited (NYSE:INFY):• • •INFY: “Flat World” No Haven from Flattened Valuation – 16x Forward EPS; Maintaining EPS Estimates, Buy Rating Investment Conclusion. Based on a more cautious revenue outlook – offset by a lower tax-rate – we are adjusting our estimates as follows: fiscal 2009 diluted EPADS remains at $2.30 on revenue of $5.015 billion (20% YoY growth but down slightly from our prior $5.045 billion projection); while fiscal 2010 diluted EPADS also stays unchanged at $2.65 on revenue of $6.143 billion (23% YoY growth and down from $6.231 billion previously). Our estimates imply 22%/14% compound revenue/EPS growth in calendar 2007-09 – after factoring a one-year extension in the “STPI” tax holiday to March 2010.Recent price weakness can be attributed to renewed investor concern over the U.S. IT spending environment (62.6% of revenue). Nonetheless, we are fine-tuning our target price from $53 to $54. In 12- months, this would correspond to 20x forward EPS of $2.69 – a premium to the current depressed valuation (16x). Notwithstanding an uncertain macro environment, Infosys anticipates significant longer- term growth opportunities as clients increasingly focus on their business and IT efficiency.1Q09 Results. Diluted EPADS of $0.54 vs. $0.46 a year ago on revenue of $1.155 billion beat our $0.50 estimate on revenue of $1.153 billion. Results included a $10 million net currency translation/hedging gain (+1.7 cent EPADS impact) and $7 million tax reversal (+1.2 cents). Operating income advanced 34% YoY and exceeded our estimate by 6%. Highlights included 24% YoY organic revenue growth, as well as above-average QoQ gains in the North American and Financial Services segments; currency-aided operating margin of 26.7% vs. 24.7% a year ago; three “transformational” wins and a record 49 new client additions; and reaffirmation of fiscal 2009 EPADS guidance, implying 5-6% QoQ revenue growth.Infosys will hold its annual Analyst Day on August 1 in New York.• Takeaways. Infosys posted acceptable growth in the North American (+4.2% QoQ and +24% YoY) and Financial Services segments (+2.8% QoQ and +19% YoY). Excluding a sharp 22% QoQ revenue decline at the top client (a European Telecom), Infosys recorded 3.8% growth across its top-10 clients and 3.9% at all others. A noticeable drop in utilization is attributed to recent employee additions vs. any unanticipated demand shortfall.Management conveyed the following outlook: fiscal 2009 is progressing in line with prior expectations – IT spending decisions have continued to experience delays in a challenging economic environment pending improved sentiment and visibility; however, the Financial Services segment should mirror overall ~20% YoY growth for the year; meanwhile, pricing is expected to remain stable through fiscal 2009 despite sporadic renegotiation requests; and future overage stemming from potential rupee depreciation is likely to be reinvested toward domain expertise and IP creation.• Infosys provided fiscal 2009 EPADS guidance of $2.32-2.36 (up 14-16% YoY) on revenue of $4.97- 5.05 billion (19-21%). This outlook is based on stable pricing; exclusion of 12-15 large opportunities in the pipeline; annual salary increases (effective April) averaging 11-13% for offshore staff and 4-5% for onsite (220 bps impact); a 50 bps drop in the operating margin; and exchange rate of INR 43.04 per U.S. dollar vs. 40.02 in April.• Areas of strength in 1Q09 included the Manufacturing vertical (69% YoY growth), European region (27%) and Consulting & Package Implementation practice (27%). Including the recent Philips acquisition, BPO revenue rose 46% YoY to $72.5 million accompanied by an 18% operating margin. Operating income of $308.2 million (26.7% margin) surpassed our $292.1 million estimate (25.3% margin). The QoQ gain in operating margin was driven by rupee depreciation (averaging 5.6% = 250 bps) – offset by scheduled salary hikes (220 bps), seasonal visa expenses (70 bps) and lower utilization (150 bps). Other levers for countering currency and wage pressures include price realizations, revenue- mix (i.e., higher-margin solutions and event-based pricing), offshore-mix, utilization, Consulting/China subsidiary contributions (transitioning from investment mode), a variable compensation structure (tied to revenue/margin performance) and scale/G&A benefits.• Hourly realizations averaged $73.16 for onsite work (flat QoQ and up 4.0% YoY) and $27.50 for offshore (flat QoQ and up 4.5% YoY). IT Services utilization (excluding trainees) stood at 70.9% vs. 73.9% a year ago. Billed volume rose 18.5% YoY but just 0.5% QoQ. Higher-margin offshore revenue contributed 52.5% of the total vs. 52.5% in the March quarter. Global headcount rose 3.5% QoQ and 24.2% YoY to 94,379 in June. Attrition improved to 13.6% (LTM) from 13.7% a year ago. Employee departures are attributed primarily to the pursuit of higher education. Hiring plans call for gross addition of 25K employees in fiscal 2009, unchanged from April.• By industry, Financial Services ranked largest (35% of revenue), followed by Telecom (20%), Manufacturing (18%), Retail (12%) and Others (15%). Top-10 clients accounted for 30.1% of revenue, down from 32.0% in the March quarter. Infosys has 91 clients (vs. 89 in March) with LTM revenue of $10+ million, 18 (vs. 18) with $50+ million and six (vs. six) with $100+ million. Infosys added 49 new clients compared with 40 in the immediately prior period. It exited the quarter with an active roster of 567 – including 114 Fortune-500 clients – up from 538 in March.• Infosys generated CFFO of $331 million (or $0.58 per ADS) in the quarter. Major outflows comprised dividends ($424 million) and capital expenditures ($80 million) – budgeted to decline from $374 million in fiscal 2008 to $250-300 million in fiscal 2009 due to completion of the Mysore campus and fewer employee additions. Infosys exited the quarter with net cash of $1.912 billion, down from $2.065 billion on March 31. Accounts and unbilled receivables improved slightly to 73 DSOs from 74 in March.click to enlarge• INFY shares are suitable for aggressive investors. In our opinion, principal risks include the following: U.S. slowdown; rising offshore salaries; appreciation of the Indian currency, which would translate into higher expenses incurred in rupees; correction in the Bombay Stock Exchange and/or U.S. markets; political opposition in the U.S.; and geopolitical uncertainty in the Indian subcontinent.ANALYST CERTIFICATIONI, Ashish Thadhani, certify that all the views expressed in this research report accurately reflect my personal views of the subject companies.

companies like Infosys adapt. In this piece, we look at what is going
on inside the outsourcing giant, and whether their strategy is enough
to sustain continued growth.Infosys (NYSE:INFY) delivers information technology (NYSE:IT) enabled
outsourced business solutions and provides business process outsourcing
(NYSE:BPO) services. In Q2, Infosys achieved $1 billion dollars in quarterly
revenue for the first time, growing 37% versus Q1 (annual revenue was
$3.1 billion and net income $850 million ended March 2007). Only 3-4%
of this revenue comes from the Indian domestic market (63% comes from
the US, Infosys’ largest market, 27% from Europe, UK primarily, and the
remainder is generated in Asia). Revenues have risen 10.1% sequentially by the quarter. Infosys
improved operating margins to 27.5%, 2.8% higher than Q1. The company
recovered from the Indian rupee appreciation impact in Q1, and analysts
pegged Q2 growth at approximately 10% versus guidance of a deceleration
Q3 sequential growth of 5% to 6%. As a result Infosys is expected to
produce 4-5% sequential growth regardless of the rupee value.
Supporting this view, Q1 saw the billing rates going up by 1.1% and in
Q2 by 1.9%. Simultaneously, staff utilization has increased from 73% to
78%.Annual growth guidance for the remaining year has been increased by
5% from 30% to 35%. Management assumes no more large deals for the year
and no further price increases from Q2.Infosys has five segments:New clients/contracts are now won at 3-4% higher than company
average and contract renegotiations are 2-3% above average. The top 10
customers grew by 2.7% quarter-on-quarter and the non-top 10 grew 13.7%
sequentially. Infosys added 48 new Q2 customers with a company total of
520. Infosys plans projects on a basis of 30% onshore and 70% offshore,
showing more offshore reliance to control cost compared to a previous
40/60 split. Fixed prices have increased in Q2 as a company strategic
direction, the goal being Infosys value accrual. Management increased
attention on increasing productivity in the last year with a current
fixed price now being higher than the average margin by 3-4%.The big question for Infosys is where is the new money coming from
and where is it going to go. More new business is coming from Europe
now than the U.S., with the United Kingdom fueling the strongest
inroads. And more than 43 percent of revenue comes from non-application
development, i.e. BPO ventures. Further BPO expansions are being tested
through Finacle as a service, which is currently going through
validating market demand and formalizing offering strategy. Finacle is
Infosys’ Banking solution.Infosys’ acquisition strategy is also focused on filling in BPO
gaps. BPO acquisitions need to provide new platforms for Infosys to
base business on or open new markets. The company is cautious in
selecting target companies, looking not only for strategic fit, but
also overlap of ability to retain employees and alignment of values,
culture, and ethics. Infosys does not support hostile takeovers.
Acquirees are expected to want to be acquired.Summary of recent acquisitions:Most of these purchases expand Infosys’ geographic presence.
However, with a cash and cash equivalent balance of at least $1.4
billion, and a great market cap, it is unfortunate that Infosys is not
really getting into strategic “product” acquisitions. Thus, Infosys’
growth remains head-count-bound, and not much creativity beyond basic
body-shopping seems to be going on. Nonetheless, in body-shopping,
Infosys is one of the world’s absolute best.The time has come, though, for Infosys to take a good look at the
software eco-system in the US, and decide on a strategy that enables
them to play in the more leveraged technology / IP driven business
models, and change the business mix somewhat. The company currently
lacks excitement, but the right signals along these lines would
definitely bring them back to popularity. In fact, the rising wage
costs and appreciating rupee can easily be mitigated if the company
diversifies its business model out of body-shopping.

49926,20861,2007-10-15T10:41:33-04:00,,"While attending Infosys's (NYSE:INFY) earnings call, I got a feeling that the management was playing defense and hence was cautious about future guidance. Even though the company achieved another milestone of hitting $1bn in revenue per quarter, the mood amongst the analysts was not enthusiastic. NOTE : As the Income statement and balance sheets are not completely visible in this blog, to get a better view them, click on this link. Quarter Highlights: 1. The new Mysore facility was not completed in time. This has prevented 2,500 employees from joining the company in time. This is the reason the employee strength was 80,500. The employee strength on Mar-31/2007 was 72,200 and the company was expecting around 11,000 net additions by now. The company still expects the net addition of around 30,000 employees by Mar-31/2008. 2. The attrition rate has climbed to around 12% and the company expects it to be around 12 to 15% in the future. One of the reasons cited for high attrition rate this quarter is the employees with 2 to 3 years' experience are leaving the company and joining the MBA programs. 3. The tax rate for the quarter was around 15% and that for the corresponding quarter in 2006 and 2005 were 11.5% and 10.32%. One of the reasons cited for higher tax rate was reduction in visa processing costs. Analysis of its quarterly income statement: The USD was Rs41.00 in the middle of August and declined to around Rs39.00 by the end of quarter. It was as high as Rs46.5 in August-2006 and declined to around Rs46.00 by the end of Sep-2006. This represents an average decline of about 10%. The EPS per ADS was $0.36 for Q2-2006 and has grown to $0.48 for Q2-2007. This represents a 33% increase.

Shares fell by as much as 6.9% in Indian trading. Infosys reported quarterly net income of 11 billion rupees ($279.2 million) on revenue of 41.06 billion rupees ($1.04 billion), up 18% and 19% respectively from a year ago. The weak dollar forced the company to revise downwards its earnings guidance from previously expected growth of 34% to 30.7% to 31.3% growth. In addition, the company's employee attrition rate rose to 14.2% from 13.7% in the quarter. According to Mumbai-based money manager, Arun Kejriwal, shares fell as a result of Infosys' full year forecasts, which were ""a disappointing set of numbers that have broken the trend of Infosys always delivering more than promised."" The rupee has appreciated 12% versus the dollar so far in 2007. A U.S. dollar bought Infosys just 40.19 rupees on average during its recent quarter, versus 46.29 rupees on average a year ago, hurting the value of the company's repatriated earnings. 63% of its revenue came from North American clients during the latest quarter.

60069,20521,2008-01-14T08:08:04-05:00,,"The general feeling of the West has been that the rise of the rupee would slow down the immense growth of business being funneled into India. The reality is that growth continues to boom in India, barely slowed by currency exchange rates. The short term looks alright for Infosys (Nasdaq: INFY). Infosys’ Q3 revenues posted at $1.084 billion, which is a YoY increase of 32% compared to the same quarter in 2007, and a 6% increase versus the previous quarter. Net profit is expected to post at $299 million, up 7% from Q1, and 20% higher YoY. The boost in revenue was attributed to the 47 new clients that were added in Q3. Guidance forward into Q4 expects Infosys to earn between $1.136 and $1.142 billion in revenue, and between $4.17 and $4.18 billion for the fiscal year in total. Its liquid cash balance exceeded $2 billion. The stock, however, is getting hit because of the CEO’s comment that deals are taking longer to close. With the U.S. recession looking somewhat definite, the future seems cloudy for continued revenue growth in the neighborhood of mid-30%. However, it has also been historically true that as businesses experience slowdown in the U.S., they move more and more of their operations off-shore, which is to the benefit of Infosys and others. Infosys continues to gain business due to market slowdowns and tighter operating cost limitations on businesses in Western countries. However, the mega-deals are dropping in number and taking longer to close. There is also an increasing expectation on what is dubbed mature outsourcing, creating a demand on Infosys and competitors to provide the right mix of onsite and offshore services, including more strategic consulting. In light of this, Wipro is in a $7 Billion acquisition discussion with Cap Gemini. Should Infosys merge with Accenture (NYSE:ACN)? I don’t think so. I have said that the time has come for Infosys to take a good look at the software eco-system in the U.S., and decide on a strategy that enables them to play in the more leveraged technology/IP-driven business models, and change the business mix. The pure body-shopping business needs to start looking at including SaaS, for example. In fact, in Trend radar 2008: SaaS in the Enterprise, I highlighted the example of manual BPO businesses being replaced by SaaS, a trend that puts Infosys squarely at risk. In Trend Radar 2008: Offshoring, I highlighted the concern that India’s cost advantage in pure labor arbitrage would disappear over the next 5 years. Infosys needs to put in place diversification strategies as soon as possible in order to fortify itself against these two key threats."
45126,20364,2007-08-21T03:51:47-04:00,,"I chatted Monday afternoon with Kris Gopalakrishnan, who’s been chief executive of IT outsourcing firm Infosys (NYSE:INFY) for barely two months. He was most passionate about a few broad themes in the changing technology landscape. “One of the biggest changes you will see is the rise of appliances, and appliance-to-person communications on the Internet,” he said. He gave as an example the fact that consumers can now get real-time traffic updates from handheld devices talking with global positioning satellites that in turn talk to computers monitoring the roadways of the world. More and more people talking with more and more devices, which are all talking amongst themselves. The soft-spoken Gopalakrishnan (bio is posted here) took over from the more well-known Nandan Nilekani. The New York Times’s Tom Friedman made Nilekani famous by ascribing to him the observation that outsourcing makes the modern world a “flat” world, in labor terms. Nilekani had taken over from N.R. Narayana Murthy, Infosys’s CEO for its first 20 years to 2002, but both of the latter two gentlemen still serve on the company’s board and show up to guide the company’s vision and culture.    All of which puts Gopalakrishnan in a unique position, as one of the few remaining founding employees in the executive suite, to try and build the management bench of a company growing by leaps and bounds with young Indian engineers fresh out of school. Which is no mean feat when the company is growing in every possible direction. Infosys will Tuesday officially announce the opening of a facility in Monterey, Mexico to service Spanish-speaking clients in this hemisphere. And it has about 700 people working in facilities in China (Gopalakrishnan says the skills of Chinese software engineers is excellent, and improving dramatically these days). At the same time, Gopalakrishnan expects U.S.-based employees will represent an increasing percentage of the company’s total headcount, because as deals with existing customers get bigger and more important, some of the work’s got to be done here. Which brings its own special dilemma: Does Infosys buy a firm here in the States, as its competitor Wipro (NYSE:WIT) did last week with the acquisition of Infocrossing (IFOX), a firm that hosts clients’ computers in its data centers? “Acquisitions can bring you clients,” as well as U.S.-based labor, Gopalakrishnan conceded. “But you are then in a financing business,” he observes, meaning, Infosys would be spending money on real-estate for data centers and for clients’ computers, in such a deal, and, “it’s not really clear we are going to be better at financing in that way than are our clients.” The other option is to ship more Indian workers overseas to “near-shoring” positions in the States. While Infosys will hire some U.S. workers in coming years, Indian IT graduates are not only more plentiful, they also still study some of the exotic, aging technologies of the past that Infosys’s clients still require: things such as COBOL and CICS and other computer programs of the mainframe era. “American engineers who know those technologies are retiring and it's not as much a part of the U.S. engineering curriculum,” which is caught up with technologies of the Internet. Infosys will run smack up against the limits on HB1 visas for foreign workers, which cap how many can be brought here. Amazingly, the company has no lobbyists on retainer in D.C., according to Gopalakrishnan. Amidst all this, some of the challenges on a daily basis are prosaic: why hasn’t the company won more business in managing companies’ IT infrastructure remotely, from India? I asked. Because IBM (NYSE:IBM) gets that business thanks to its years of so-called managed services, says Gopalakrishnan. “We need more references in that area to win more business,” he said. That, and continuing to refine Infosys’s rep as what is basically a big IT shop, but one that does its job better than Infosys’s clients. Big banks have large IT staffs, but the implication Gopalakrishnan made was that Infosys is more adroit at seeing where programming is science, rather than a bespoke art, and turning those observations into codes inculcated into the company’s work ethic. Process, method, re-use, the gradual refining of software development is what Infosys is going after. My overall impression is that with Infosys spreading its wings in many directions, the company has no limit to growth opportunities it can pursue both in India and in the developing world, and even here in the U.S. But it also means the challenges for the company become more diverse and complex, from increasing headcount thousands of miles from home, to dealing with higher attrition rates in China, to calculating just how much growth can be achieved internally versus through buying businesses, to cultivating the next group of executives who will take the helm after Gopalakrishnan. Exciting, modern times for a still-young company."

Following is a table that gives a summary of its cash flow since Fiscal 2002. The last column gives the total for each component for all the years.    Operating cash flow vs market cap : On Jan 1, 2002, Infy was valued by the market at $8.5bn. On Jan-1 / 2007 its market cap was $34bn, which is around four times what it was on Jan 1, 2002 . In the same time its operating cash flow has increased from $191 mn to $862mn - about 4.5 times.Valuing its investments : Out of the total $2.5bn cash generated since 2002, $1.16 bn has been spent on capital investments. Around $972 mn has been spent on adding new offices and infrastructure. Another $160mn has been spent on acquisitions.Return on Infrastructure investment : Applying a layman's approach, let us see how these investments have impacted the cash flow changes in their corresponding years, considering it takes 1 year to start using the new facility.Fiscal 2002 : Investment in Infrastructure - $68.34 mnFiscal 2003 : Net increase in operating cash flow - $20mnFiscal 2003 : Investment in Infrastructure - $43.15 mnFiscal 2004 : Net increase in operating cash flow - $162mnFiscal 2004 : Investment in Infrastructure - $93.22 mnFiscal 2005 : Net decrease in operating cash flow - $29mnFiscal 2005 : Investment in Infrastructure - $186 mnFiscal 2006 : Net increase in operating cash flow - $255mnFiscal 2006 : Investment in Infrastructure - $246 mnFiscal 2007 : Net increase in operating cash flow - $263mnFrom the above table we can see that the sum net increase in operating cash flows for fiscal 2003 till fiscal 2007 is $671 mn.

Net income of $267 million ($0.47/share) was 53.4% higher than a year ago; analysts were expecting $0.39. Quarterly revenue jumped 42.3% to $939 million, $25 million more than analyst predictions of $914 million. The company gave slightly weaker fiscal-2007 earnings and revenue guidance than it had previously, despite charging higher fees. It now predicts Q2 revenue of $974-984 million and EPS of $0.46, or $4-4.05 billion and $1.92-1.94 on the year. The rupee, which made its strongest advance against the dollar in three decades last quarter, is eroding the value of its earnings in the U.S., its biggest market. ""The sharp appreciation of the rupee against all major currencies impacted our operating margins during the quarter. However, our robust and flexible operating and financial model enabled us to maintain our net margins while absorbing the impact of appreciating currency, higher wages and visa costs,"" said CFO V.

72632,20480,2008-04-17T04:38:18-04:00,,"Excerpts from Gilford Securities analyst Ashish R. Thadhani's recent update to clients on Indian outsourcer Infosys Technologies (NYSE:INFY): • • •Investment Conclusion. Based on a pronounced short-term revenue slowdown – offset partially by higher profitability and a lower tax-rate – we are reducing our estimates as follows: fiscal 2009 diluted EPADS to $2.30 on revenue of $5.045 billion (21% YoY growth) from $2.35 on revenue of $5.430 billion; and fiscal 2010 diluted EPADS to $2.55 on revenue of $6.231 billion (24% YoY growth) from $2.70 on revenue of $6.923 billion. Our estimates imply 23%/13% compound revenue/EPADS growth in calendar 2007-09 – after factoring a one- time jump in the tax-rate due to expiration of prior tax benefits.Given continued investor concern over the U.S. IT spending environment (60.7% of revenue), we are resetting our target price from $58.50 to $51. In 12-months, this would correspond to 20x forward EPS of $2.55 – a premium to the current depressed valuation (17x). Notwithstanding its cautious stance in a difficult macro environment, Infosys anticipates significant longer-term growth opportunities and also offers a strong platform for customers seeking efficiencies in their IT spend. Infosys remains the second largest U.S.-listed exporter of software from India distinguished by a premium brand, industry- leading profitability and scalable manpower infrastructure.4Q08 Results. Diluted EPADS of $0.54 vs. $0.45 a year ago on revenue of $1.142 billion beat our $0.53 estimate on revenue of $1.143 billion. Results were held back by an $11 million forex loss (-$0.02 EPADS impact) – offset partially by a $5 million tax reversal (+$0.01). Operating income advanced 39% YoY and exceeded our estimate. Highlights included 32% YoY and 5.3% QoQ organic revenue growth; resilient operating margin (28.8% vs. 27.5% a year ago despite a 400 bps currency headwind); improving employee attrition for the second straight quarter; four $50+ million wins; a special dividend of $0.50 per ADS plus hike in the regular dividend payout to 30% in fiscal 2009 from 20%; and guidance of 18% YoY EPADS growth – ahead of what many investors had come to fear...Takeaways    INFY shares are suitable for aggressive investors. In our opinion, principal risks include the following: U.S. slowdown; rising offshore salaries; appreciation of the Indian currency, which would translate into higher expenses incurred in rupees; correction in the Bombay Stock Exchange and/or U.S. markets; political opposition in the U.S.; and geopolitical uncertainty in the Indian subcontinent."
40763,20171,2007-07-11T11:47:02-04:00,,"Infosys (NYSE:INFY) profit rose 34.5% but its full-year outlook was cut due to a rising rupee, according to MarketWatch: In dollar terms, the company’s revenue of $928 million and earnings per share of $0.46 were better than the analyst estimates of $909 million and $0.40. However, full-year guidance of $4.0 - $4.05 billion in revenue and $1.92-$1.94 in earnings per share are disappointing. Analysts were expecting $4.07 billion in revenue already, and even though the official estimates were for $1.84 in EPS, $0.06 of upside was provided in the past quarter, and investors were surely hoping for more than another $0.02 for the remainder of the year. When I previewed earnings for this week, I said: So far, the company is blaming the crunch not on the tight job market but on the rising rupee. Other factors were not written off entirely: These are all pressures on an employee-centric enterprise founded on the major wage discrepancies between their home country and those of their customers. If wages and the home currency both rise by 10% annually (in many cases it is even faster) relative to customers, it doesn’t take long for that disparity to reverse. And it takes even less time for the disparity to narrow sufficiently to stall out a 30% growth rate. INFY 1-yr chart:"
39037,20861,2007-06-21T06:35:43-04:00,,"Every quarter the IT outsourcing companies give vital information regarding how many new clients they added that quarter. All of us know that this figure indicates the long term growth of the company. But being a number cruncher, I tried to match the revenue growth to the number of new clients.
Revenues generated by existing clients is called repeat business and any revenue generated by new clients is non- repeat business. For Infosys (NYSE:INFY), during fiscal 2007, 95.3% of revenues came as repeat business and during 2006, 95.0% revenues came from repeat business from existing clients.
(Form 20-f : information on repeat business obtained from Item 4. Information on the company from sales and marketing section.)
As we know that the repeat business is defined as any business from existing clients. This means that any revenues that do not belong to repeat business belongs to the revenues generated by the clients added in that fiscal year.
This non-repeat business in 2007 was 4.7% of total revenues. The total of which is $145.23 mn (4.7% of $3,090 mn).
Conclusion: So out of $938 mn growth, $145.23 mn was contributed by new clients - that's around 15%."
37850,20861,2007-06-11T06:21:59-04:00,,"Can Infosys Technologies' (NYSE:INFY) stock grow beyond 2009? A few considerations below: Tax shelter: The biggest advantage Indian IT companies have is the tax shelter provided by Indian government. This is the reason INFY's tax rate is below 10%. This tax shelter is supposed to go away in 2009. After this the company's tax rate would be around 30%. For year ending March 31 2007, income before taxes was $936million and provision for income taxes was $84 million. This makes the tax rate 8.9%. If the tax rate would have been around 30% then the net income would be around $680 million instead of $850 million. Dollar to rupee exchange rate:The second concern is the dollar to rupee conversion rate. Since the beginning of the year, 1USD has fallen from Rs 43 to Rs40. This is because of the robust economic growth in India. If this continues then by the end of the decade the dollar should be around Rs 35. This would reduce the profit margin, because most of INFY's costs are in rupees and revenue in dollars. Inability to increase the number of employees at the present pace: INFY's strength in 2002 was 10,900. It grew to 52,700 by 2006. This amounts to 49% annual growth. This growth has fueled the company's rise in revenues from 555 million in 2002 to $2.1billion in 2006. If INFY wants to grow at this pace, then its employee strength should be 141,000 by 2009, 275,00 by 2011, 500,000 by 2013 and 1 million by 2015. The only company that comes to my mind that has around 1 million employees is Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT). The difference between Wal-Mart’s employees and Infosys’ employees is that the majority of Wal-Mart’s employees are entry level cashiers or store workers working for minimum wages, compared with Infosys's high tech employees, who are in the highest pay bracket of Indian employees.

The following are the highlights of its Q1 results. Click to Enlarge   Even though revenues grew by 40%, gross profit just grew by 32% because of the strong rupee during the quarter and the annual hike in wages. The company, however, has done a good job keeping down its operating expenses, which just increased by 28%. Other Income: But the biggest outlier, I feel, is the contribution of other income. It was a whopping 23% of the net income ($62 mn out of the net income of $263 mn). Looking at this year's 20-F report, one can get some details on other income. Other income/(expense), net includes interest income, income from liquid mutual fund investments, foreign currency exchange gains/losses including marked to market gain/losses on foreign exchange forward and option contracts, and provisions for losses on investments. The investment income in fiscal 2006 (ending Mar-31-2006) was $48 mn and in fiscal 2007 (ending Mar-31-2007) was $71 mn. In 2006, the foreign exchange loss was $18 mn and in 2007 the foreign exchange gain was $8mn. The following are the details of their income and net income for last three years: Looking at the above trend, one can see that as the rupee becomes stronger against the dollar, other income is mostly derived from investments and foreign exchange increases. This quarter it has become very significant, contributing 23% of the net income. Infosys is not in the business of investments, so this gain will not be looked upon as a gain contributed by mainstream business. But we all know that in the long term, the rupee is going to become stronger and stronger. INFY 1-yr chart:"
38440,20861,2007-06-15T04:56:56-04:00,,"The basic revenue generation of any outsourcing or consulting company is the number of billed man hours it had for that year.  In my quest to figure out the relationship between the net income, market cap and employees of a consulting company, I did a sample study on Infosys (NYSE:INFY). Infosys was founded as a private limited company in Pune, India. It went public on the Bombay stock exchange in 1993 and went public on the NASDAQ in 1999. Its sales for 1981-82 were Rs 0.11 crore. Following are my findings. Figures are in crore (1 crore = Rs10 million; 1USD = Rs40.50 (approx)).  Following is the 10 year growth chart:  Disclosure: Author has a long position in INFY"
32336,20171,2007-04-16T04:31:31-04:00,,"Infosys Technologies (NYSE:INFY) announced results for the quarter and year-ended March 31, 2007, and what struck us was not sales or earnings, but employees:
In our earnings preview we said, “They will make the numbers, but investors will listen closely to the update on visas and employee retention.” Doing the math, 3,182 employees left the company (the difference between net and gross.) That number is 5.2% of the number of employees at the beginning of the quarter, which we figure to be an annualized attrition rate along the lines of 20%, in line with the rates that have concerned us for some time. However, instead of the more than 10,000 new hires in the July-September quarter last year (which admittedly may have been boosted by graduation timing) there were less than 6,000 this quarter. As a result, the total number of employees grew just 4% sequentially - perhaps a 16% annualized rate.
While still impressive, it is important to remember that IT outsourcing is a labor-intensive industry. Revenue growth is very much reliant on adding employees and making them more productive. While revenues can grow faster than employees in the short term due to improved productivity, in the long term the relationship will be fairly tight.
Infosys grew earnings per share by 64% last year and is forecasting 27% growth this year. If the current run rate of employee growth is any indication, investors should expect a significant slowdown next year as well."
32370,20099,2007-04-16T04:16:54-04:00,,"Infosys Technologies Limited (NYSE:INFY) released the latest numbers and beat expectations when calculating in rupees. I do not calculate in rupee's. Readers probably do not calculate in rupee's. Infosys work force may eventually stop calculating in rupee's. The outsourcing thing has been very successful. However, it now has changing dynamics. The revenue drivers are overall IT spending and FX ratios (if currencies are allowed to trade freely). The cost drivers continue to be local labor costs and FX ratios. Another contract or two will probably not change shareholders' opinion of this very high PE ratio stock. Infosys probably understands this, as they are establishing a development facility with approximately 300 seats in Mexico. The costs (mostly in Peso's) will be a $U.S. proxy. The challenge for Infosys, which also trades on India's stock exchange, will be to reallocate work flow and costs into cheap countries and avoid the increasing costs of previously cheap but very adequate Indian workers. Clients will become increasingly concerned about locking in FX differentials. Look for outsourcing contracts to start including robust FX guarantees. Infosys will most likely start to include the FX lock in to avoid margin squeezes. Clients will look at end dates of contracts and may actually wish to extend when FX forward rates look favorable. The Infosys play is running to its natural end game as it becomes another commodity provider, much like the mining business which traditionally copes with local labor costs and FX rates. At least the resources business has a forward commodities market. Infosys is currently internalizing that entire risk. INFY 1-yr chart"
26231,20400,2007-02-06T15:42:42-05:00,,"Since the inception of our Clear International Portfolio, Infosys Technologies (NYSE:INFY) has provided phenomenal returns to our clients. INFY evolved from a private consultants firm in 1981 out of Pune, India, to an international information technology company. With its home corporate office now based out of Bangalore, INFY designs and delivers a multitude of information technology [IT] enabled business solutions. For example, INFY provides services including: consulting, design, custom application development, software reengineering, maintenance and production support, systems integration, package evaluation and implementation, testing services, operations and business process consulting, engineering services, and infrastructure management services.    INFY and its subsidiaries employ 69,432 people, as of 12/31/06, at its 24 global development centers, 20 of which are in India. INFY maintains 43 sales offices around the world with only 5 in India. INFY, through its subsidiary, Progeon, provides business process management services, such as offsite customer relationship management, finance and accounting, and administration and sales order processing. It serves clients in financial services, manufacturing, telecommunications, retail, utilities, logistics, and other industries in North America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region.    Improving Toshiba America Information Systems  A recent example of INFY at work is its collaboration with Toshiba America Information Systems, Inc. [TAIS] to improve customer operations and centralize IT services. INFY helped TAIS fully automate its order and financial management processes into an end-to-end, order-to-cash business flow. Additionally, INFY seamlessly integrated Oracle software within the complete procure-to-pay business process which has helped TAIS create efficiencies and streamline its purchase and payment cycles. TAIS now has a greatly improved purchase requisition preparation cycle and a shortened payment approval cycle, helping drive faster and better customer operations. With this collaboration, INFY has further increased its U.S. visibility as a company that delivers solutions and will continue to grow because of such a reputation. With an industry dominating market capitalization of $32.75 billion, INFY proves to be the company with the most momentum entering the fourth quarter and has generated revenues of $2.91 billion over the past year. This incredible revenue resulted in an incredible net income increase of 38.62% over the trailing twelve months. Its growth over five years does not seem to be decreasing, posting a 35.67% five year net income growth. With an outstanding return on equity [ROE] of 39.84%, INFY continues to top its industry while ranking second in that statistic. Financial Analysis  After its last earning report, much analysis has rightfully gone into employee turnover and costs. It is our observation that cost and client contracts are in sync. Employee turnover is at historic norms and with an anticipated 5,000 new hires coming on-line, INFY is not forecasting a slowdown anytime soon. Global businesses view wages as a variable expense and can be adjusted based on actual contract flow. Much of their business outside of India is based on sales and service, and on-site support, which is a business that is not core to its mission. We believe that real wage gaps with Western Europe and the U.S. will exist for the foreseeable and education will continue to improve in India. This combination continues to provide INFY with a competitive advantage in the global marketplace. As for valuation, the price to earnings [P/E] ratio of 43.17 is around the industry average. However, when taking into account growth and profitability, and balancing it with valuation, our algorithms calculate that INFY appears to have room for price appreciation and potentially delivering more benchmark beating results for our investors. There seems to be some consensus as the recommendations of the most recent sell-side research is in agreement with ranking of our multifactor model.

23902,20432,2007-01-10T16:28:57-05:00,,"The Indian markets have been hammered for the last three sessions, with the Sensex trading down 3.7 % since the beginning of the week. The bulls are licking their wounds and hoping for a rescue from Infosys (NYSE:INFY) which reports tomorrow. The rupee's recent strength and its negative impact on INFY's earnings, which are mostly export-driven, have been incessantly flaunted by the bears and skeptics alike. This and a host of other reasons have caused INFY to give up as much as 6.76 % from its highs of last week. Most traders attribute the selling to booking of profits in the stock ahead of earnings, as it has risen by more than 87 % from its May 2006 lows,when the whole market took a beating.   BSE SENSEX vs INFOSYS FOR THE LAST WEEK The perennial bulls on the stock argue that the dip in the stock price and any more to come following the earnings will be historical moments to buy into INFY for the future. Why? They say the company is on a new growth track in its history, with its recent moves up the IT value chain into the high end consulting space. There has also been recent wide acceptance and acclaim of its banking software product, Finacle, among domestic and international banks around the world. INFY and the other IT majors such as TCS and Satyam (SAY) have made aggressive inroads into new countries, bagging new clients and setting up new global delivery centres, thus reducing their dependence on US dollar earnings. Wage pressures will be more than compensated by the higher billing being allowed by existing clients as they get comfortable with the outsourcing concept and its ability to allow client companies to focus on what they do best. As for a slowdown in the US economy and its resultant pressures on dependent companies, they argue that it will be a win-win for Infosys as shrinking margins, sales and cost pressures will send more work towards the Indian IT sector. Their final argument rests on the assumption that INFY has always under-promised and over-delivered. Look for a positive report and future guidance to lift the markets while anything less than great on the earnings front will lead to a rush for the exits. But let me end with a last bullish dissent from market observers, who point out that with the markets and INFY already having weathered a major sell off in the last couple of days, disappointments, if any, are already baked into the stock and an overall bounce could be seen, no matter what.

The company has recently started expanding its operations in UK and this expansion is of strategic importance to Infosys, as it will allow it to leverage the global talent pool, and to utilize the excellent physical and communications infrastructure required to rapidly scale up their operations.  Infosys has a growth rate of over 50% and more than half a billion dollars in revenues in the EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) region. Infosys is currently one of the fastest growing consulting and IT services organization in the EMEA region. Revenue from Europe increased from US $340.3 million in 2004-05 to US$ 495.6 last year.

(After attrition, the net increase in employees was just under 10,000.) So imagine how impressed we were to learn that Infosys (NYSE:INFY) hired 10,795 people during the second quarter (July-September) of the current fiscal (FY 2006-07). As competitive as the job market in India is, it is still hard to hold on to good employees. Infosys notes: On an annualized basis, the quarter’s attrition rate was close to 20%. As the employee base grows, high attrition makes it more and more difficult to grow. In fact, before the report yesterday morning, consensus estimates called for revenue growth to slow to about 28% next year (the fiscal year ending March 2008.) Adding the 20% turnover to that equation means hiring nearly 50% more employees, assuming billing rates and utilization stay about the same. So far, there appears to be no end to the potential growth of these businesses, so we won’t attempt to guess when that will be. In fact, management said that the business environment today looks better than it did 12 months ago.  On the conference call, management also noted that margins were up 2.6%. This was due mostly to a stronger dollar against the rupee and to lower visa-related costs. Today’s businesses want to do more on a smaller IT budget. Indian offshoring firms are one way of helping them do so, which is why the offshoring firms are growing so much faster than the overall technology sector. INFY 1-yr chart:  Comment on this article"

By the numbers, Infosys reported third quarter revenue of $821 million and earnings per American Depository Share of 39 cents. The results topped Thomson Financial estimates by 2 cents. Infosys also upped its outlook for the fourth quarter.
   One of the key issues on the Infosys conference call (see SeekingAlpha transcript) was wage increases and turnover. Although Wall Street worries about turnover, CIOs also worry about it. Wage increases can creep into contracts and turnover can hinder IT project continuity.   
Here are a few mileposts from Infosys:  
–Overall demand: Infosys CEO Nandan M. Nilekani says offshoring ""continues to be a strong secular trend."" Nilekani says Infosys believes IT spending will increase by a ""few percentage points,"" but the spend on ""offshore and global sourcing is going to go up."" 
Nilekani also noted that ""the risk perception of our clients about offshoring has reduced even further, and now they are quite comfortable with having several thousand employees of theirs working in India, through various partnerships or through their own units. So, I think, the risk perception in the mind of the global CEO has come down.""  Strongest sectors for Infosys include banking and insurance, retail services. The company is seeing a slowdown in transportation and logistics.   
–Attrition: Infosys chief operating officer Kris Gopalakrishnan says Infosys has 488 active clients and added 6,092 employees this quarter gross. Of those employees, 1,676 of them came with prior experience. ""We continue to add experienced employees to the workforce,"" he says. ""Attrition is slightly up at 13.5% compared to 12.9% last quarter. Attrition, if I exclude involuntary separation, especially at the entry-level, it comes down to 12.2%. The corresponding number last quarter is 12%.""  
Meanwhile, Infosys plans to hire 5,000 in the next quarter. Many workers leave the company after getting two or three years experience. Here's Gopalakrishnan's breakdown:  
Those rates have been constant for many quarters. ""People leave for various reasons, not necessarily because of other companies coming to India and setting up shop. If you look at the attrition data, we've 1.3% involuntary attrition over the 13.5% primarily driven by people who did not pass our training course at the end of 14 or 16 weeks of training, because we've toughened the entry norms,"" says Gopalakrishnan.
  –The scrum for new employees. CEO Nilekani says wages in India are increasing at a rapid clip. He adds that it's hard to get entry level employees. Nilekani says the biggest threat to Infosys' wage scale for the best workers is financial service firms.
–Pricing: Infosys officials note that for new customers they can get 3% to 4% above our average. For existing customers renegotiating deals Infosys can raise prices 2% to 4%.
   –Onsite vs. offshore. Overall, the company tries to limit onsite work, say Infosys employees working at a company in the U.S., to 30% to 35% of total work."
11227,20153,2006-05-25T07:12:37-04:00,,"Infosys Technologies (NYSE:INFY) is globalization in action - the firm provides application development, IT consulting and business process outsourcing services to their clients. Infosys uses what they call their ""global delivery model"" to deliver their services. Probably the best way to describe this model is to say that it's the consulting equivalent to Dell's just-in-time sourcing model. Infosys uses their global offices, and in particular their offices in India (where they are headquartered) to deliver services 24 hours/day with a highly skilled and cost effective work force. Infosys hits the nail right on the head in their SEC filings - ""customers are increasingly demanding improved products and services with accelerated delivery times at lower prices."" So the business proposition is simple, hire enough qualified people at a low enough cost and solve the customers' problems effectively. Thus far, Infosys has been able to keep up; they have grown their workforce from 10,700 in 2002 to 52,700 as of March 31, 2006, they have been rated as one of the best companies to work for in India and they are currently rated at the highest level of the Carnegie Mellon Software Engineering Institute's Capability Maturity Model (SEI-CMM, which measures the quality of organizations' management system processes and methodologies). WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON  The company has been performing well and though they finished out their 2006 fiscal year (ended March 31st) with a slight earnings miss, they showed strong sales numbers for the fourth quarter and the year. During their conference call, the management team attributed the miss primarily to the dollar/rupee exchange rate, a higher amount of depreciation for the quarter and getting more aggressive on the hiring front than they expected. They claimed that on a ""normalized basis"" that their margins were on target. Of course, I can't imagine that this has been too comforting to investors as they watched the stock jump to $83.74 the Monday after they announced the quarter only to decline to $68.69 as of today. Since the quarter, the stock has been caught in the sickening slide that has hit pretty much the whole market, and Indian stocks in particular, over the last week and a half. GROWTH DRIVERS  According to Gartner, the Indian IT-enabled services export market was $4.6B in 2005 and is expected to grow to $21B in 2009 - an impressive 46% compound annual growth rate [CAGR]. So simply growing with the market could give Infosys some pretty impressive results. The primary drive behind this is going to be an increased willingness for businesses to outsource their IT and other business processes. In an increasingly globalized world, connected by satellites and optical fibers, even the larger companies are beginning to find that vertical integration might not bring the same value as it once did, and so they are beginning to work with companies like Infosys in an effort to become more efficient and cost effective. The great thing for the outsourcing companies is that this process compounds on itself; if, say, a major manufacturer is able to bring costs down by outsourcing some of their IT staff then 1) they are more likely to consider other areas where they could benefit from outsourcing and 2) competitors will have to consider doing the same to be able to keep up. VALUATION   It's a tough time to be a tech stock and an even tougher time to be an Indian tech stock. Right now, Infosys is trading at 28x their forward calendar year EPS estimates with an expected 25% growth rate for a 1.1x PEG ratio. Cognizant Technology (NASDAQ:CTSH), probably the best comparable to Infosys, trades at 43.8x forward earnings estimates with a PEG of 1.25x - a significant level above Infosys. I also see Accenture (NYSE:ACN) and Bearingpoint Inc. (BE.) as good comps for Infosys and they trade at 16.6x and 28.3x their 2006 expected earnings, respectively, with PEG ratios of 1.2x and 2.8x. So on both a comparable and an absolute basis, I'd say that shares of Infosys are trading at a pretty attractive valuation right now. And don't forget, you're getting a stock here with a 25%+ return on equity. CONCLUSION   It's tough to get too aggressive on any stock with the market the way it has been the last couple weeks, but I think that Infosys offers a good value here to start slowly building a position. As business seems to be up and to the right, I'd say that any further pullbacks in the next couple weeks would represent good buying opportunities. Longer term, though, I don't know that I feel quite as bullish on the model behind Infosys, or any of the Indian outsourcing companies for that matter. As we move towards a more globalized economy, prices are going to slowly but surely adjust to this change. More IT consulting getting farmed out to India means that there will be less work for the higher priced US consultants. Simultaneously, more firms will crop up to try to take advantage of the profits that companies like Infosys are making, thereby increasing competition in the Indian labor pool. It may not happen quickly, but these two factors should slowly push down US IT consulting wages while bringing up those in India. As discrepancies disappear, so will the huge cost advantage that Infosys has. Ideally by that time, though, they will simply be a good outsourcing partner due to scale, efficiency and global reach.

31402,20307,2007-04-03T16:19:01-04:00,,"Jospeh Vafi, an analyst at Jefferies & Co., yesterday trimmed his estimates and price target on the Indian IT outsourcing company Infosys (NYSE:INFY), citing a sudden surge in the rupee against the dollar. Vafi notes that the rupee is trading almost 5% higher against the dollar than it has during the average of the preceding 12 months. “While we see demand for offshore-centric IT services as strong as ever, the timing of a material appreciation in the rupee [versus the dollar] couldn’t come at much worse of a time for Infosys, in our view,” he wrote. Vafi notes that the company will give guidance for its February 2008 fiscal year on April 13. He points out that in the past Infosys has said that a 1% appreciation in the rupee could impact margins by 30-40 basis points. Vafi trimmed his fiscal 2008 EPS estimate to $1.76 a share from $1.83; he reduced his price target to $60 from $67. He continues to rate the stock a Buy. Infosys yesterday was off 87 cents at $49.38."

4371391,105096,2020-08-28T13:04:58-04:00,"Intuit shares have returned 29.3% in 11 months since our initial Buy rating, and FY20 results this week again supported our Buy case.
        Even with COVID-19, FY20 was another year of double-digit EPS growth, up 16.4%; revenues were up 13.2% and EBIT margin expanded 111 bps.
        The Small Business segment continued its strong growth, with some negative impact from COVID-19 that moderated during the quarter.
        The Consumer segment had its best year for 4 years, as COVID-19 accelerated the growth in DIY filings, where Intuit maintained its share.
        At $345.00, even if the P/E multiple were to contract 10%, the annualised return would likely be 10.8% over the next 4 years. Reiterate Buy.","We review our investment case on Intuit (INTU), eleven months after our initial Buy rating last September and after this week’s FY20 results. Since our initiation, shares have gained 29.3% (including dividends), more than 10 percentage points ahead of the S&P 500 but behind the NASDAQ: Intuit has outperformed its main listed competitor Sage (OTC:SGGEF) (Neutral-rated) (whose share price rose 9.1% in GBP in the same period), but was behind Australia-listed start-up Xero (OTCPK:XROLF) (no coverage) (whose share price rose 59% in AUD).Our original Buy case was based on Intuit delivering a low-teens revenue growth and a stable-to-rising EBIT margin, roughly in line with management long-term targets, including:With a low-teens revenue growth and a stable-to-rising EBIT margin, we believe Intuit could achieve a low-teens EPS growth. Intuit has been paying a dividend, and also had a growing net cash balance that could be used for buybacks or accretive acquisitions.At our initiation, relative to FY19 financials, Intuit shares were trading at a 39.2x P/E and a 2.6% Free Cash Flow (""FCF"") Yield. We assume valuation multiples would remain roughly stable, which together with EPS growth and the 0.5% Dividend Yield at the time would mean a low-teens investor return.Since then, Intuit's growth and valuation have both exceeded our expectations, with EPS growing 16.4% year-on-year in FY20 and the P/E multiple expanding to 43.9x. However, we believe the shares still offer a 10.8% annualised return over the next 4 years, as we will explain below.Despite COVID-19, FY20 (ending July 31, 2020) was another year of double-digit EPS growth for Intuit, with EPS up 16.4% year-on-year; revenues were up 13.2%, and EBIT margin expanded 111 bps to 34.7% (all non-GAAP): Quarterly comparisons for the Consumer and Strategic Partner segments are not meaningful, as the postponement of the IRS filing deadline from April (part of Q3) to July (part of Q4) pushed substantial revenues back by a quarter. FY20 continued Intuit's track record of double-digit (at least 12.5% so far) revenue growth and margin expansion since the launch of the One Intuit Ecosystem strategy in FY17: Full-year revenue growth of 14.6% in the SBSE segment was near the top-end of the 10-15% long-term target range:Full-year revenue growth of 13.0% in the Consumer segment exceeded its 8-12% long-term target range:We review the performance of individual businesses in more detail below.The SBSE segment continued its strong growth in Q4 FY20, with some negative impact from COVID-19 that moderated in the quarter, partially offset by revenues related to Paycheck Protection Program (""PPP"") loans.SBSE's Q4 revenue growth of 15.9% (including 2% from PPP loans) was an improvement from Q3 (10.7%), mostly due to desktop revenues, but remained below the 16.0% growth seen in H1.SBSE's Online Ecosystem revenue grew 29% in Q4 (or 25% excluding PPP), continuing a deceleration from 28% in Q3 and 35% in H1, and was also below the long-term target of 30%+. The lower growth in Q4 is the result of lower subscriber net adds in previous quarters, as well as delayed price increases and software migrations/upgrades this year.The deceleration in online revenues was broad-based - non-U.S. online revenues grew 31% year-on-year in Q4, significantly decelerating from the “over 50%” growth in Q3 and the “over 60%” growth in Q1 and Q2.Management provided some datapoints to show how its QuickBooks Online (""QBO"") business improved in Q4 FY20 but remained below pre-COVID levels:Similarly, there were datapoints that showed U.S. small businesses had seen improvements in payment flows, number of workers, etc., from the sharp deceleration seen in the second half half of Q3 FY20 (i.e. mid-March to April):Including Q4 FY20, the Consumer segment had its best year for 4 years, as COVID-19 accelerated the growth in DIY filings while Intuit maintained its share there. Excluding stimulus-related filings, the DIY category expanded its share of filings by more than 200 bps.Intuit's TurboTax grew its share of tax filings by more than 150 bps (FY18: 27%). Total TurboTax units were up 9% year-on-year, including online units up 11% and desktop units being flat. TurboTax Live, which includes online consultations with tax professionals, grew its customers by 70%, with most (70%) of the new customers being previously users of assisted filing services. Intuit's lending business has continued to grow. QuickBooks Capital has distributed $1.2bn of PPP loans to date; non-PPP loans totalled $242m in FY20, compared to $441m in the preceding 2 years.In acquisitions, the $7.1bn Credit Karma acquisition announced in February is still expected to close in H2 CY20. Intuit also announced the acquisition of TradeGecko, an inventory management software provider, in early August, at a rumoured total consideration of $80m.A new bank account for SMBs, QuickBooks Cash, with an 1% deposit rate and a Visa-branded (V) debit card, was announced by Intuit in July. This is provided in partnership with Green Dot (GDOT). Intuit is still not providing forward guidance, though management again reiterated the commitment to its long-term targets, stating at the same time that they may not be achieved at present: The main uncertainty is on the economy and how it will affect small businesses. Instead of guidance, management provided a set of expected FY21 SBSE revenue growth rates for 3 different economic scenarios:The expectation of positive SBSE revenue growth even in more adverse economic scenarios shows the resilience of Intuit's businesses. During the Great Financial Crisis, group EBIT grew 2.2% in FY08 and 6.1% in FY09. At $345.00, on FY20 financials, Intuit shares are trading at a 43.9x P/E and a 2.0% FCF Yield:The Dividend Yield is 0.7% ($2.36), after the dividend has been raised (as is typical each October) by 11% to $0.59 per quarter.On share buybacks, management repeated their comments from last quarter, specifically that they have been suspended because of the part-stock Credit Karma acquisition, $2.4bn remains on the authorised program, and “we expect to be in the market in the future”.We believe Intuit’s sustainable low-teens EPS growth and resilience during downturns justify a high valuation, though perhaps not as high as 43.9x P/E.Our illustrative returns calculations are below - they mostly use the same high-level assumptions as before, but with more specifics added, including:With shares now at $345.00, these imply an exit price of $501.06 and a 10.8% annualised return over the next 4 years: Intuit shares have returned 29.3% in 11 months since our initial Buy rating, and FY20 results this week again supported our Buy case.Even with COVID-19, FY20 was another year of double-digit EPS growth, up 16.4%; revenues were up 13.2% and EBIT margin expanded 111 bps.The Small Business segment continued its strong growth, with some negative impact from COVID-19 that moderated in the quarter.The Consumer segment had its best year for 4 years, as COVID-19 accelerated the growth in DIY filings, where Intuit maintained its share.At $345.00, even if the P/E multiple were to contract 10%, the annualised return would likely be 10.8% over the next 4 years.We reiterate our Buy rating on Intuit.Note: A track record of my past recommendations can be found here.

4375472,103480,2020-09-21T11:14:24-04:00,"Shares of Intuit have dropped nearly 20% from all-time highs, falling in line with the recent market-wide tech rout.
        Valuation is the key concern here: Intuit is trading at a ~36x forward P/E ratio despite low-teens revenue growth and single-digit EPS growth.
        While Intuit's products still remain the gold standard for individual and small business accounting, competition is steep on both sides.","Intuit (INTU), the consumer-oriented financial software company behind popular programs like Quickbooks and TurboTax, has seen strong performance this year as the global pandemic impacted its business by far less than originally feared. The company has also brazenly moved ahead with its $7.1 billion purchase of Credit Karma. In defending the large purchase, Intuit has argued that the company is betting big on being able to help consumers ""unlock smart money decisions"" through its fuller product set, and that Credit Karma helps Intuit nearly double its consumer TAM from $29 billion to $57 billion.So far, the market has responded well to Intuit's strategy. Year to date, the stock has rallied ~13% - paling in comparison to some faster-growing software stocks, but certainly beating the S&P 500's 3% gains over the same timeframe by a wide mile. Yet over the past month, shares of Intuit have pulled back sharply from their all-time highs for one reason alone: investors are sounding off alarm bells on valuation again. News headlines of a 2000s-style tech bubble have become rampant over the past few weeks, and Intuit is a great example of a company whose recent stock price outperformance is due primarily to multiples expansion rather than fundamental growth.Even after the recent pullback, Intuit's current share price of ~$300 is priced at a 35.5x forward P/E multiple based on expected FY21 (the fiscal year that Intuit just began this August) pro forma EPS of $8.45 (data from Yahoo Finance), which would represent only meager 7.5% y/y growth versus FY20 actualized EPS of $7.86. That's a premium multiple for subpar growth. Intuit's PEG ratio, dividing P/E by a 7.5 growth denominator, winds up at a meaty 4.7x (a <1x PEG ratio is considered a value stock). To me, there are three key near-term risks that may cause Intuit shares to slide from its current premium multiples. While the first item is a pure and circumstantial toss-up, we can review the latter two items in greater detail. In my view, investors should lock in gains on this stock and invest elsewhere. Let's start with the competitive piece first. In my view, Intuit would be able to justify its premium P/E multiple if it was the only game in town, but this is far from the case. (even though Adobe (ADBE) is also trading at elevated earnings multiples, I find that justified by the company's superior growth profile and the fact that virtually no other company can match Adobe's creative suite).Let's start with the consumer side first, which I think is the less competitive of Intuit's two segments. The most obvious competitor to Intuit's TurboTax product is H&R Block (HRB). A comprehensive review of the two platforms on NerdWallet notes that:While the most basic tax returns (standard deduction only, no itemization) are free on both TurboTax and H&R Block, the first paid tier for H&R Block starts at $50 versus $60 for TurboTax. Similarly, the more comprehensive package for self-employed workers costs $105 on H&R Block, versus $120 for TurboTax.TurboTax's stronger brand recognition may let it get away with charging a slight premium, but there's likely very little loyalty among consumers between these two platforms, and switching providers year-over-year has low barriers.The biggest competitive risk on the consumer side, however, is if the IRS finally decides to modernize and make online tax filings easier for consumers. The Trump administration has already taken small steps in this direction by simplifying federal tax forms, but in the future a TurboTax-like interface could be added directly on the IRS site. This would put pressure on Intuit's entire consumer arm, which generates roughly 40% of annual revenue.Competitive pressures are even fiercer on the small business front. Similar to TurboTax, Quickbooks has built up a venerable brand reputation for quality and for being the gold standard among bookkeepers, but it's not exactly known for being the budget option. Quickbooks' basic ""Simple Start"" package, which only allows for one user and doesn't include key features like bill payments or inventory tracking, costs $12.50/month, while the more comprehensive ""Plus"" plan starts at $35/month. Payroll options, meanwhile, will run an additional $22.50/month at the most basic level plus $4/month for each employee. Figure 1. Quickbooks pricing Source: Quickbooks websitePlenty of Intuit's competitors, meanwhile, try to attack Quickbooks from the price angle. Wave Accounting might be the best example of this: Wave's basic accounting features including invoice creation are completely free, though it makes money on payroll options which is slightly more expensive than Quickbooks':Figure 2. Wave Accounting pricingSource: Wave website Aside from Wave, the list of other Quickbooks competitors is long: Xero, Freshbooks, and Quicken are some notable examples. And once companies move up from the small business sphere to the mid-market level, Oracle's Netsuite (N) becomes a far more dominant player.In part due to competition from lower-priced alternatives on both the consumer and small business front, and in part due to sheer saturation from the fact that Intuit's products are already so well-adopted, Intuit's growth over the past few years has been rather subpar, at least in tech sector terms.Take a look at Intuit's performance through its most recently-released fiscal Q4: Figure 3. Intuit quarterly resultsSource: Intuit fact sheetDisregard the 83% y/y growth rate in Intuit's fourth-quarter revenue: the company benefited from the extension of federal tax filings to July, which pushed a swath of consumer revenues from Q3 to Q4. When we look at Intuit's combined second-half revenue of $4.82 billion, that grew only 13% y/y - consistent with FY20's full-year growth rate of 13% y/y. Now, there is some good news embedded here. The bear case for Intuit posited that the company may perhaps see a large decline in small business revenue due to the widespread closure of many mom & pop businesses like restaurants that form a not-insignificant portion of Intuit's small business customer base. Thus far, after slowing to 11% y/y growth in Q3, the small business arm re-accelerated to 16% y/y revenue growth in Q4. Sasan Goodarzi, Intuit's CEO since 2019, noted on the most recent Q4 earnings call that trends in the small business space have markedly improved since the onset of the coronavirus:The company additionally noted that QuickBooks Online (the cloud-based version of Quickbooks, and the company's primary focus) saw ten points of customer growth acceleration since Q3, but that new customer growth is still below pre-pandemic levels. Quickbooks' retention rate has also slipped two points to 77%, reflecting churn from failed businesses. Still, while Intuit's most recent results are certainly far better than feared, we find the ~13% y/y revenue growth rates and single-digit EPS growth expected for FY21 to be unimpressive relative to Intuit's rich valuation multiple.Intuit's current downtrend is a reflection of a business whose share price has advanced past what its fundamentals justify. Intuit isn't growing materially faster on either a revenue or earnings standpoint than the average company in the S&P 500, yet its >35x forward P/E ratio seems not to take into account either its lackluster growth or its wide pool of competitors. Don't be tempted to buy the dip here."
4356514,104302,2020-07-01T05:07:48-04:00,"Intuit and Shopify are the leaders in their corresponding target markets: Intuit caters to SMBs and Shopify caters mostly to Manufacturers/Producers, small brick-and-mortar stores and small e-commerce retailers.The overlap between these segments is remarkable, and this positions Intuit to start competing in the e-commerce software platform arena.This competition can happen through an acquisition of an existing e-commerce software platform provider and integrating the acquired product with Quickbooks Online.In addition to the financial benefits of investing in one of the fastest growing industries, Intuit would also have huge benefits resulting from the synergies with the acquired company.The success of this venture will depend on both Intuit’s efficiency in integrating the operation with Quickbooks Online and Shopify’s retaliation against this new competitor.","Over the last four years, I have been quite actively following the stocks of both Intuit (INTU) and Shopify (SHOP), and trading on both of these companies. I am very bullish on Intuit for various reasons that I will talk about later. As for Shopify, I am bearish on the key segment of its client base, the smaller e-commerce retailers; while I am bearish on a key component Shopify’s target market and believe that it has an abnormally high valuation, I am trying to ride the momentum for the Shopify stock by writing out of the money put options on it.Recently, I have been reading comments on Seeking Alpha that talk about how there are “no competitors to Shopify”. While there are some competitors like BigCommerce, Magento (ADBE), WiX (WIX) and WooCommerce, I found that these competitors, maybe with the exception of BigCommerce, are lacking a lot in their competitiveness. In addition, the omnichannel distribution network of Shopify puts it at a distinct competitive advantage compared to its competitors. In simple terms, Shopify is leading the market for e-commerce software platforms.Last week, the weather was wonderful in Toronto (it still is), and I decided to take a siesta in my backyard. Before taking the siesta, I was reading about Shopify’s competition, and during the siesta I dreamt about Intuit being a Shopify competitor. I am blessed that I am able to remember my dreams very vividly, so I put a comment about my dream on Seeking Alpha. This comment drew its share of sarcasm and ridicule, but the more I thought about the potential of Intuit entering into the e-commerce software platform business space, the more it made sense.This article explains the logic for Intuit to enter into the space of being an e-commerce platform provider and potentially being Shopify’s biggest competitor.This article looks at the potential for Intuit throwing its hat into the e-commerce software platform arena. It also looks at the impact of this new competition on the market leader, Shopify.The article first dissects the e-commerce platform market place into five segments:The article looks at which of these five segments are target markets for both Intuit and Shopify.The article then looks at the competitive position of Shopify and the difficulty that a new entrant would have in competing with them. At the same time, the articles presents the characteristics that would make a new competitor successful in this space, and how Intuit has all the characteristics of a successful competitor. The blueprint for how Intuit can enter into this market through an acquisition of an existing provider is then presented.The article does not provide any numeric calculations as these calculations would be dependent on many internal factors associated with the acquisition that are not currently available. However, a brief review of Intuit’s balance sheet shows that such an acquisition is within its means without having to raise any additional capital.Before we address the main thesis of this article, we need to first understand the competitive landscape. Understanding the different e-commerce segments will position us to appreciate the vulnerabilities and strengths of both companies and why the entry into the business of e-commerce software platforms is an attractive option for Intuit.There are five key segments for e-commerce, that is, the users of the e-commerce software platforms. Shopify currently caters to the first three of these segments and is trying to make inroads into the other two with limited success. Following is the detailed description of these five segments.Description and Characteristics:These are the companies that own, for example, factories, food processing plants and assembly establishments whose products are mostly sold through retailers. The product line for these companies rarely changes, and except for white-label manufacturers, they have well-established brands. Traditionally, these manufacturers and producers have been selling their products through their distribution channels rather than directly to consumers.Prospects for Growth and Potential E-commerce Market:The number of these manufacturers and distributors is expected to remain the same. However most of these manufacturers, especially the very small ones, do not yet have a viable e-commerce presence. Many analysts consider them, especially the ones with successful recognized brands, as the largest growth segment for e-commerce.Platform RequirementsThe e-commerce software platform requirements for manufacturers and producers are fairly limited. They do not normally resort to “pressure tactics” and do not normally need the “bells and whistles” that we sometimes find with smaller e-commerce retailers. The e-commerce platform for these manufacturers is mostly a complementary distribution channel, as most of them would rely on other distribution channels for selling their products.Manufacturers utilize third-party software providers for their e-commerce platforms. E-commerce is not an integral component of their businesses and building their own e-commerce software platform from scratch is not a viable option in most situations. These manufacturers are seasoned business professionals and, as a result, they would be price sensitive; using a product like Shopify would make better business sense for them than building their own e-commerce software platform.Of course, there are always exceptions. These exceptions would be giant manufacturers, and manufacturers who produce high cost items priced at tens of thousands of dollars or higher, like cars, heavy machinery and airplanes. Because of the long sales cycle associated with these products, together with the relatively high transaction costs, these manufacturers may not even need an e-commerce software platform, and if they need it (e.g. Tesla, (TSLA)), they would build their own.Description and Characteristics:These retailers usually have a limited number of retail outlets in malls and shopping centres, and usually specialize in selling niche products. Many of these companies did not have an e-commerce retail presence prior to COVID-19, and only had static web sites. These stores have started to realize the importance of e-commerce after the pandemic hit us, and started creating e-commerce retail stores. Shopify's share of these brick-and-mortar e-commerce stores was higher than other providers because of both its reputation and because of extending the Shopify trial period from 14 days to 90 days (now back to 14 days).Prospects for Growth and Potential E-commerce Market:While the number of smaller brick-and-mortar stores is expected to drop with the pending bankruptcies resulting in COVID-19, it can still be considered a growth potential from an e-commerce perspective. Most of these smaller brick-and-mortar stores always had an Internet presence at least via static sites, and with COVID-19, they are now realizing the importance of e-commerce, and are creating new Internet outlets.What would happen with these stores as we defeat COVID-19 is anyone’s guess. If these companies survive, they would retain their e-commerce retail outlets, as their cost is insignificant compared to that of the physical stores. These stores may completely go out of business, and abandon the retail business altogether. Also, these companies may choose to close their physical stores and turn to be small e-commerce retailers.Platform RequirementsSimilar to manufacturers, these smaller brick-and-mortar merchants would not consider their e-commerce outlets as their primary distribution channel, unless they close their physical locations as described above. As a result, they would not have highly sophisticated needs. They are, however, still a retail store with requirements that are higher than those of the manufacturers; their platform provider needs to have strong capabilities to handle their needs.Because of their size, these merchants would utilize third-party providers for their e-commerce software platforms; Their size would not allow them to put in the investments to build or customize their e-commerce retail solution. These merchants are also seasoned business professionals and are price sensitive; using a product like Shopify would make better business sense for them than building their own e-commerce software platform.Description and Characteristics:These are retailers who do not have a physical retail outlet. Many of these retailers do not even have a warehouse for the products they sell and rely on the drop-shipping business model. Some of these retailers are multi-employee companies, but most of them are a one or two person shop operating from their own home using drop-shipping as the core of their operation. Some of them may even be conducting their business on a part-time basis. Many of these retailers have a very limited number of products on their site, sometimes even a single product. With a single product, once it goes out of fashion, they close the e-commerce store and start a new one focusing on a different product. Many of these retailers have multiple stores running concurrently.Prospects for Growth and Potential E-commerce Market:I expect that this segment of the market will be declining over time for two reasons:I believe that the COVID-19 crisis has accelerated this trend: the e-commerce increased with clients being locked down with lots of time on their hands to buy products online. However, they also now have the time to research products before buying them. So, the question is “where is this smaller e-commerce retailers revenue going to?” It would go either to the manufacturers who can afford dropping their prices as they cut out the middle-man (the retailer) or to the larger e-commerce providers like BestBuy, Amazon and Walmart who possess the proper economies of scale.Platform RequirementsThe key need for smaller e-commerce retailers from an e-commerce platform is the bells and whistles that can attract the buyers and get them to buy the products on an impulsive basis. They also need the omnichannel capabilities that would allow them to sell their product concurrently through multiple advertising venues. Because of their size, they would not build their own platform.So far, these merchants are not price sensitive, as their margins are relatively large considering the very low startup costs that they have. I expect this to change over time as price wars hit these merchants and as their margins drop.Because of its superior omnichannel capabilities combined with its affiliate marketing strategies, Shopify has practically owned the lion’s share of this segment.Description and Characteristics:These are the larger brick-and-mortar chains (e.g. Walmart (WMT) and Target(TGT)) together with the giant e-commerce retailers (e.g. JD.com (JD) and Amazon (AMZN)). These companies have massive supply chain management systems and sophisticated IT departments.These companies have the economies of scale to keep the prices relatively low compared to smaller retailers. Most of these companies own their own fulfillment centres, which would allow them to have fast and efficient delivery. Moreover, because of their physical locations, they can afford having very friendly return policies that would be attractive to the buyers.Because of the dynamics of e-commerce and the shift towards economies of scale and higher education for customers as described above, e-commerce products will be commoditized and these larger retailers would be the winners from this commoditization.Prospects for Growth and Potential E-commerce Market:I expect this segment to consistently grow as they take on the business from the smaller e-commerce retailers, amplified by the e-commerce market increases. As a result, I expect that their growth rate would be faster than the general e-commerce growth rate.Platform RequirementsThese companies require very sophisticated e-commerce platforms that are directly linked to their supply chain management systems. Most of these companies have deployed major customization to their supply chain management systems, and as a result cannot use off-the-shelf e-commerce platforms for their operations.In addition, their sophisticated IT departments would be able to build the e-commerce systems needed for the company operations. Of course, if they can avoid building the e-commerce software platform from scratch and use some open-source software instead, it would be a good thing to save costs and expedite the development process.The key point here is that these companies would consider the e-commerce software platform as one of their core competencies, and the possibility of outsourcing it is very remote.Description and Characteristics:These are companies that do not buy and sell products, but provide a marketplace for other manufacturers and retailers to sell through. Some of these marketplaces (e.g. Amazon and Walmart) are also direct retailers, while some are strictly marketplaces (e.g. Alibaba (BABA) and Etsy (ETSY)). Many of these marketplaces provide their retailers and manufacturers with fulfillment services that are directly integrated with their e-commerce software platforms. The number of these marketplaces is fairly limited compared to the other segments, but their Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV) is massive. Their clients are either manufacturers (segment-1) or small retailers (segment-2 and segment-3).Personal Opinion: I personally believe that Shopify has the long-term vision to operate in the e-commerce marketplace segment, and this is why they ventured into the fulfillment centre business. These centres would not only increase the revenue for Shopify but may also circumvent the slow down or death of the smaller e-commerce retailers.Prospects for Growth and Potential E-commerce Market:The decline in the small e-commerce retailers segment should be balanced with both the growth of manufacturers/producers segment and the overall growth in e-commerce. As a result, I expect the e-commerce marketplace provider segment to have a relatively slow growth. However, because of the economies of scale that this segment possesses, most of the growth would go directly to the bottom line.Platform RequirementsThe software for this segment is its core competency, and its requirements are fairly sophisticated. They need to keep it connected to the different e-commerce store providers to allow the users of these platforms to list their products with them. In addition, most of these companies have strong IT departments, and they would create their own e-commerce software platform to allow it to be integrated with their operations and fulfillment systems.The following table summarizes the differences among the five retail segments:Before looking at the accounting software category used by the five segments, we need to understand the market that Intuit caters to.Intuit is the market leader in accounting software for small and medium size companies. It currently holds over 55% of accounting software installations through its corporate accounting software products QuickBooks, QuickBooks Online and QuickBooks Desktop as per ZoomInfo (ZI).Source: Datanyze, A Zoominfo CompanyThe first segment (the manufacturers/producers) would fit into Intuit's target market if they are smaller in size. Large manufacturers most likely would not fit as they use sophisticated ERP systems that integrate their production environment with their accounting systems, and QuickBooks does not normally provide this automation level. On the other hand, smaller manufacturers fit perfectly into Intuit’s target market, and there is a high likelihood that they would be using Quickbooks.The second and third segments (the small brick-and-mortar retailers and the small e-commerce retailers) fit perfectly into Intuit’s target market. They are small and medium size companies, and the majority of small and medium size companies use Intuit’s Quickbooks.The fourth and fifth segments (the larger e-commerce retailers and the e-commerce marketplaces) similar to the larger manufacturers will most likely use sophisticated ERP systems and would need an integration level that Quickbooks does not provide.The following table summarizes the five segments, whether they are part of the target market for Intuit’s Quickbooks, and the justification for this assessment.Shopify is currently the world leader in e-commerce platform software. Their target market is the first three segments, the manufacturers/producers, the small brick-and-mortar retailers and the small e-commerce retailers.Shopify’s fastest growing segment is potentially the first segment, the manufacturers and producers. With Shopify’s reputation, with its omnichannel capabilities and with its affiliate marketing sales force, many manufacturers and producers who did not have an e-commerce retail presence before, are now moving to the direct-to-consumer distribution channel.As a result of COVID-19, Shopify’s market grew significantly within the second segment, the brick-and-mortar retailers especially the smaller ones. I expect this to be a short-lived growth: If COVID-19 lock-down continues, many of these retail stores would go bankrupt. If COVID-19 is defeated, these stores would most likely return to their brick-and-mortar sales; most would have lower sales and some might still go bankrupt. There is also the possibility that they would abandon their physical stores and have a business model similar to the third segment, the small e-commerce retailers.Because of its affiliate marketing strategies (which I believe they have executed to perfection), Shopify has a stronghold on the third segment, the small e-commerce retailers & drop-shippers.The Shopify omnichannel capabilities far surpass most of its competitors, and this is one of the reasons for its dominance. However, these omnichannel capabilities, while impressive, do not provide Shopify with a defensible position; they are relatively easily replicated. In addition many of these channels are not significant, and adding them may be counter-productive in certain situations.Similar to Intuit, Shopify does not cater to the fourth and fifth segments, the large e-commerce retailers and the e-commerce marketplace providers; these companies, primarily based on their size, usually build their own e-commerce software platforms in-house and consider these platforms as part of their core competencies.Let’s first take a look at Shopify’s position in the e-commerce software platform space.Shopify is the fastest growing e-commerce software platform provider enjoying a revenue CAGR of 71.9% over the last five years. While the growth rate has been declining, this is normal and expected with the growth of the business. Despite this growth, according to Statista and ZoomInfo (ZI) Shopify is still the third in market share with 10.98% of the overall market as of April 2020.Source: StatistaThese numbers are not consistent with the numbers presented by Oberlo, a Shopify company, which claims that Shopify holds 31% of the market.Source: OberloLooking at another source like BuiltWith, we see that Shopify is the world leader with a 1.4 million web sites currently using Shopify (1.8 million web sites that stopped using Shopify, most likely resulting from their customer churn). According to BuiltWith, the runner up is WiX Stores (WIX) with about one million web sites. The growth graph of the web sites using Shopify is nothing sort of impressive as shown below.Source: BuiltWithNow, for the capitalization. Shopify is currently priced with a capitalization of $108B, more than 8 times the capitalization of its runner up in terms of web sites, (WIX). Remember that Shopify has about 1.4 million sites and WiX has about one million sites. From a revenue perspective, WiX has about half the revenue of Shopify.Personal Opinion: The abnormally high capitalization for Shopify can mean either that the Shopify stock is a bubble that would eventually burst or that its growth rate will accelerate beyond the 71% CAGR. I personally believe it is a bubble, and I justified that in an earlier article, Shopify, A Reality Check, when the stock price was much less than its current price.Shopify is clearly one of the world leaders among the e-commerce platform software providers, and some may argue that it is the undisputed world leader. So, the question now is: Why would a company compete with such a strong company that has a capitalization higher than Lockheed Martin (LMT), and that has not yet earned a profit after 16 years of operations?Before answering this question, we have to realize the types of expenses Shopify has.Looking at its financial statements, Shopify currently spends about 50% of its operating expenses on its sales and marketing expenses. Reviewing the details of this section of the financials, we will find that this is mostly spent for its affiliate marketing expenses. Shopify needs the affiliate marketing to maintain its subscription level because of its relatively high churn.Another significant expense, which is disclosed in the annual report, is the stock-based compensation. Shopify spends over $150M annually in stock-based compensation. This is another expense (a non-cash expense this time) that can be adjusted when considering entering into this business.Once we adjust the financial statements by taking out the affiliate marketing expenses and the stock-based compensation, Shopify would turn out to be a highly successful and profitable business. The old adage tell us that successful businesses invite competitors, especially when the barriers to entry or moat is limited for the business model; this applies for Shopify.History has shown us that software is rarely a valid moat for a business. History has also shown us that the market share is not a valid moat either. I believe that Shopify’s biggest moat is its execution of its affiliate marketing scheme which, IMHO, is a text-book prefect execution. Whoever looks at competing with Shopify needs to look at establishing a solid affiliate marketing program, already has a strong affiliate marketing program or has other complementary assets that would compensate for the affiliate marketing program.To be able to compete with Shopify, a new entrant needs to have the following characteristics:Looking at the above criteria, I found it hard to identify a company that is more suited to enter into this business than Intuit.To answer this question, we need to look at the criteria stated in the prior section and assess how they apply to Intuit:Intuit targets the same market segments as Shopify with another product and the company possesses a dominant position with its own product lines in these market segments.Most of Intuit’s corporate clients (via its Quickbooks suite of products) are small and medium size businesses. Intuit has over 55% market share of this accounting software as per the chart shown earlier. If we look at the first three e-commerce segments (manufacturers/producers, small brick and mortar retailers and small e-commerce retailers), we would find that the vast majority of them are small and medium size businesses as well; this is hugely overlapping with Intuit’s customers. We have established earlier that Shopify primarily caters to the first three segments as well.Intuit has deep pockets to make an acquisition of an existing e-commerce software platform provider.Intuit has about $4B of cash and marketable securities on its balance sheet. This cash balance, which is cyclical in nature as shown in the next chart, has been growing at a good rate over the last few years. With the conversion towards the more profitable Quickbooks Online product, the cash balance is expected to continue to grow and to become less cyclical.Source: Compiled by author from Intuit financial statementsThe Intuit liabilities are very low compared to its assets, and it is mostly composed of deferred revenue and deposits from customers. The following chart shows the strength of Intuit balance sheet as it relates to historical debt:Source: Simply Wall St, We Think Intuit Can Manage Its Debt With EaseWe can conclude from this that Intuit can use a part of its cash balance for the acquisition of an e-commerce software platform that can be integrated within its products.Intuit would be able to recognize significant synergies between its existing products and a new e-commerce software platform, including seamless technical integration.The existing accounting systems invariably have an inventory control subledger that keeps track of the inventory items. At the same time, e-commerce software platforms are mostly an inventory system with a few layers on top of it. E-commerce software platforms need to interface to accounting systems and feed data to it to ensure the proper controls are in place. Frequently, the interface is not done through a direct interface, but rather through a manual journal entry into the accounting system.Assume that Quickbooks would have a “Quickbooks Shops” feature which would allow customers to have an e-commerce software platform that is fully integrated with Quickbooks. This would result in synergies on the following fronts:Intuit would benefit by reducing the churn on both its products and the new e-commerce software platform.The more integrated components that a company uses with the same provider, the less likely that the customer will seek moving to another provider. This basic principle will help Intuit on two fronts related to the churn:Intuit has a strong affiliate marketing program and Intuit has enough complementary assets that would allow it to run its e-commerce software platform operations without the need for affiliate marketing.Intuit has one of the most elaborate affiliate marketing programs in the corporate world with its Intuit Partnerships programs. These programs not only address sales and marketing, but also extend to consulting, education and app integration. Intuit can easily extend these partnership programs to provide an affiliate marketing programs that rival and even better the Shopify affiliate marketing programs.At the same time, Intuit has many complementary assets in its existing products that would compensate for the need to have an elaborate affiliate marketing program for the sale of the e-commerce software platform product. The discussion of Intuit complementary assets requires an article on its own and is beyond the scope of this article.Intuit can have a presence in the e-commerce software platform market in one of two ways:The “build” solution would be time consuming, which would not capitalize on the existing growth of the e-commerce market. In addition, building software products always involves a significant risk from multiple perspective, the least of which is the inflated actual costs compared to the budget. Finally, the marketing campaign associated with the launch of a new e-commerce software platform of Quickbooks would be very long and overly expensive campaign.The “buy” solution does not present the problems found in the “build” solution. The main drawback of the “buy” solution is the cost factor, and the amount of cash that needs to be put upfront. Except for this cost/cash drawback, the “buy” solution provides the following benefits to Intuit:Based on the above analysis, acquiring a company would be far more advantageous to building a product from scratch. The question now is “How much should Intuit pay for this e-commerce software provider?”On June 22nd, Bloomberg reported that “BigCommerce could IPO”, and that the company would be valued at around $1B (remember, Shopify is valued at $108B). BigCommerce is considered one of the most viable competitors from a functionality perspective especially for higher-end customers. Style Factory provides a comprehensive overview between BigCommerce and Shopify: BigCommerce vs Shopify (2020) — Which is Best?, and I would suggest that you read it to assess whether the valuations of BigCommerce and Shopify are in line with each other.While a possibility, I am not suggesting that Intuit buys BigCommerce (although they can easily afford it via a cash and share deal) unless the technology and culture between both companies are highly compatible. Rather, Intuit can look at the other providers in the market that are most compatible with Intuit from an acquisition perspective, and offer to buy them. Most of these providers are private companies, which would allow Intuit to benefit from the private company discount.Assuming that the offer for the e-commerce software platform company is no more than $500M (half the valuation of BigCommerce), Intuit would be able to afford without raising any additional funding. With the growth in e-commerce, the direct financial benefits for this acquisition will far exceed the $500M.More importantly, the indirect benefits like the reduction of the churn, the reputational benefits and the increased market capitalization (resulting from moving into, potentially, one of the fastest growing businesses) would far exceed the direct benefits addressed earlier.In any business, incumbents are always negatively impacted when a new competitor throws their hat in the ring, regardless of the strength of this competitor. Intuit being the new competitor would have a double whammy on Shopify. Not only is it a powerful new competitor with deep pockets, it is also a market leader with almost 100% overlap with Shopify’s target market; both companies target the first three segments of the e-commerce software platform market.On the other hand, Intuit is not coming as a brand new competitor as it is acquiring an existing provider. If this acquisition is not properly executed, it might be a beneficial thing for Shopify, as it would be eliminating or reducing the power of an existing competitor. We have seen that happening in many cases, and an example is provided in the next section.How much market share would Shopify lose or gain from this competition is anyone’s guess, and will depend on the execution of Intuit on the acquisition more than Shopify’s reaction to the new competition. Acquisitions are always tricky matters and no one can predict what would come out of them.A recent example of a company trying to enter into the e-commerce software platform market through acquisitions is Adobe through its acquisition of Magento in May 2018 for $1.68B. This acquisition resulted in a significant loss of market share for Magento from over 10% of the total market to around 4% in just a few years. The reasons for this drop and potentially acquisition failure can be the subject of another paper.Following is how I think Intuit should/would be different from Adobe:Now, what actions would Shopify take if/when such an acquisition happens, and Intuit becomes a competitor in the e-commerce software platform space is anyone’s guess. My guess is that they would try to come up with something innovative and creative as they have done in the past. There is a possibility that they would create an accounting software extension to Shopify; this venture would have some interesting challenges and should be the subject of another paper.There are five segments of e-commerce, and Shopify caters to three of them: the manufacturers/producers, the small brick-and-mortar stores and the small e-commerce retailers. Intuit caters to small and medium size businesses (SMBs) and the three e-commerce segments that Shopify caters to, with the exception of a few large manufacturers, are almost all small and medium size companies, fitting perfectly in Intuit's target market.Shopify and Intuit are both the leaders in their corresponding markets. Interestingly, these markets have a huge amount of overlap as shown earlier in the article. This overlap, in addition to other factors presented in the article, would render Intuit as an ideal candidate to venture into the e-commerce software platform space.This article suggests that Intuit, through its deep pockets, would buy an existing e-commerce software provider at a price tag that does not exceed $500M. This acquisition would allow Intuit to hit the ground running and become a viable serious competitor to the existing players, with Shopify, the market leader, having the most to lose.If/when this acquisition happens, and Intuit enters into the e-commerce software platform business, its success would depend on how efficiently the company integrates this acquisition into its operations and get it to be an extension of Quickbooks Online. Its success would also depend on how Shopify reacts to this acquisition and what retaliatory actions it might take."

The most constructive definition to address this question is Warren Buffett's concept of ""economic moat"", a long-lasting competitive advantage that allows a given company to harvest above-average returns on its capital, even when faced with economic downturns or powerful competitors.A quality investing strategy should, therefore, capture the fundamental nature of Buffett's philosophy. Here, the aim is to identify high-quality stocks - or ""compounders"" - trading at reasonable prices by calculating a simple Quality Score based on 12 fundamental factors related to the actual business and its intrinsic economic characteristics. These are (possibly) the qualitative and quantitative factors that best capture the elusive 'quality dimension' of a specific company, at least according to Buffett and other investors in these best-of-breed companies like Charlie Munger, Chuck Akre, and Joel Greenblatt. The intention is not to discuss fleeting quarterly results (far from it) but rather to analyze and find superior companies and business models capable of compounding value for many years into the future. To calculate the Quality Score, the following questions will be addressed:1) Presence of strong and enduring competitive advantages; 2) Favorable market dynamics and relative positioning; 3) Presence of multiple and complementary sources of revenue; 4) Presence of market leadership; 5) Presence of pricing power; 6) Presence of high and persistent Cash Returns on Invested Capital; 7) Strong cash-generation ability; 8) Presence of superior gross profitability; 9) Presence of superior revenue growth; 10) Absence of systemic and company-specific risk factors with the potential to compromise the firm's future; 11) Presence of a solid financial position, with little debt.To calculate the Quality Score, one (1) point is awarded when the answer is fundamentally positive (""Yes""); minus one (-1) point is subtracted when the answer is essentially negative (""No""); no points are added or subtracted (0) when there is too much uncertainty or when negative and positive factors are essentially in equilibrium. 'High-quality companies' are the ones with a Quality Score of ""6"" or above. Let us then calculate the Quality Score for Intuit Inc. (INTU).One night, some 37 or so years ago, Scott Cook's wife Signe Ostby entered the kitchen and once again went through the hassle of trying to track the couple's finances with good old pen & paper; complaining about the monotony of this time-consuming chore, Ostby told Cook that there should be a way to computerize the financial tasks that every household has to do on a routine basis.An ambitious Harvard graduate working for Bain & Co., Scott Cook was immediately struck by his wife's words. At long last, he knew what he needed to do to start his own business: he would develop and sell software to replace paper-based accounting with digital-based accounting. But, despite having all sorts of prized skills, he was not much of a programmer.And so he went to the University of Stanford looking for a more accomplished one. Randomly, while at the campus, he tapped the shoulder of a passing student and asked: ""Excuse me, where would be a good place to post these flyers? I'm looking for programmers"". Intrigued by Cook's question, the student replied: ""Tell me a little bit about what you're looking for…"". As it turned out, inspired by Steve Jobs, this computer science student named Tom Proulx also wanted to start his own company. Cook's ensuing explanation entranced young Proulx then and there - and with that, the stage was set for the creation of the company we now know as Intuit.What set Intuit apart from the very beginning was the founders' obsession with the customer experience. Indeed, Intuit may have been the first company to perform usability tests. The firm's first product (Quicken) became so famous and popular for its ease of use that Intuit saw no reason to spend large sums on sales and advertising. Quicken and the firm's subsequent offerings combined the advantages of pen & paper (simplicity) with the advantages of computerization (precision and speed). Before Quicken, and because of usability constraints, only a few people used financial software for personal purposes.Scott Cook has always preached that Intuit wins ""by creating products that function well and feel good to the senses"", and he readily admits that many of the company's best ideas were - and still are - produced by its customers. Still today, through its 'Follow Me Home' program (which includes 10.000 hours of visits to customers each year), Intuit carefully studies the experience of its users to improve existing offerings and anticipate their needs and problems.Despite ferocious competition from the likes of Microsoft (MSFT), such relentless focus on usefulness and functionality enabled the company to capture 75% of the market by 1997. In turn, the company's dominance and profitability also empowered it to make a string of acquisitions that further bolstered its sales and competitive position over the years.Intuit's Competitive Advantages | Customer Switching BarriersSpearheaded by offerings like TurboTax and QuickBooks, the company's solutions are now deeply embedded in the workflow of countless individuals, small businesses, and self-employed customers (and their respective bookkeepers and accountants).However, despite its popularity, the problem with a professional tool like QuickBooks, for instance, is that it requires time and effort to be fully mastered. Naturally, once the software is mastered, customers become quite reluctant to switch to another provider because of the time it takes to learn how to use a competing application and because of the difficulties associated with transferring accounting records.Being so, once a business owner has taken pains to implement and learn a new accounting solution, the prospect of repeating the process for anything less than a vastly superior competitor becomes very unattractive, which in turn leads to price tolerance and strong customer captivity.Moreover, a switch would also bring about the inconvenience of reconnecting the new software with needed apps from third-party developers (such as third-party apps for analytics, time tracking, or expense management). According to Intuit, QuickBooks Online (QBO) is at the center of the largest third-party app ecosystem for accounting software, a fact that extends its appeal to a broader spectrum of established and prospective customers.Through its 'Education Program', Intuit has been doing an outstanding job at nurturing this switching barrier from an early stage. The program has established partnerships with US and Canadian universities in which thousands of accounting students (and their teachers) receive Intuit's software for free, making these institutions and these future accountants hooked on the company's offerings - naturally, students introduced to the firm's software are much more likely to stick with Intuit once they have used its products and integrated them into their workflows.The Education Program is, therefore, an effective way to convert accounting students into lifetime users. Moreover, students have a strong incentive to learn how to use Intuit's products (as the industry uses them extensively) and accounting practices also have a strong incentive to continually embrace the firm's software (because new hires arrive with a proficient understanding of Intuit's latest offerings). These initiatives create a virtuous cycle that perpetuates the company's dominance.Intuit's Competitive Advantages | Network ExternalitiesQuickBooks's celebrated ease of use must be properly relativized: sure, judging by the time it takes to reach full mastery, QuickBooks is probably easier to master than Autodesk's (ADSK) AutoCAD or ANSYS's (ANSS) CFD software, for instance, but it is also much more difficult to use than Microsoft's Word or other general-purpose software code.Because of this (and also because accounting can be a difficult subject), many business owners without an accounting background still need to hire an accountant to ensure that Intuit's offerings are used correctly and effectively. Indeed, even with QuickBooks or other similar programs, many business owners still require someone who understands tax and accounting regulations inside-out. Accounting software is not a replacement for accountants.Besides, advances in society and technology have made sales, marketing, and accounting more complex than ever. As a consequence, many owners also see accountants as trusted advisors on multiple aspects of their businesses (tellingly, about one-third of small businesses place accountants at the top of their list of trusted advisors).Furthermore, completing tax returns can be a bewildering and labor-intensive task for owners who would rather be focused on their core competencies - being so, hiring an accountant to help not only saves them time, but an accountant may also be able to deal with tax debts, lower the tax exposure and perform many other decisive tasks.Due to these tight and often unavoidable relationships between accountants and small business operators, there's little incentive for both parties to use software other than the most popular and well-understood solution available in the market (which is QuickBooks); for better or worse, QuickBooks is also the gold standard for small business accounting.In essence, Intuit provides the most complete matchmaking platform. Based on Intuit's metrics from 2018, QuickBooks users with an accountant are 31% more likely to stay on the platform; in addition, the platform also triples the average number of client leads for accountants. Ultimately, accountants use QuickBooks because business owners use QuickBooks, and business owners use QuickBooks because accountants use QuickBooks. This interdependency, in turn, has created positive network externalities for the benefit of the company.Such externalities arise in the so-called Platform-mediated Networks (PMNs), which include a specific population of users who need to interact with each other (in this case, accountants and business operators), along with an intermediary (Intuit itself) who provides a given platform (like QuickBooks) that supports the necessary interactions between these users. For users, the value of PMNs increases exponentially but, for providers, the costs of running them increase only linearly. PMNs are often self-reinforcing, too.Intuit also persuaded the most successful third-party programs to join its ecosystem by promising access to its vast customer base, a fact that again contributes to attract both more customers and third-party developers to Intuit's ecosystem. QuickBooks has thus created a network that became progressively more valuable to its existing users as the number of new customers increased over time.Because they create barriers to exit (by locking-in its customers), as well as barriers to entry (by making competitors less relevant), such network externalities are one of the most powerful competitive advantages a company can have.The company has three business units: Consumer, Strategic Partner, and Small Business and Self Employed (SBSE). Each business segment offers products optimized for particular customer needs in accounting, individual tax filing, and professional tax preparation.The SBSE unit targets self-employed individuals and small to mid-sized businesses, as well as the accounting professionals who serve them. This business accounted for about 52% of the company's sales in 2019. Its flagship offering is QuickBooks, a financial and business management tool with online and desktop versions; the unit also offers payroll solutions, merchant payment processing solutions, and financing for small businesses*.In addition to the core QuickBooks offering, it also sells an Enterprise solution (designed for businesses with 10-100 employees), a Self-Employed solution (intended specifically for self-employed customers) and solutions for accounting professionals (QB Online Accountants and QB Accountant Desktop Plus).The SBSE unit competes with a wide variety of private and public companies such as Gusto, FreshBooks, BlueVine, Paychex (PAYX), Microsoft, Automatic Data Processing (ADP), and Global Payments (GPN); however, SBSE's closest competitors among publicly traded companies are Xero (OTCPK:XROLF) and The Sage Group (OTCPK:SGPYY).Companies (and eventual competitors) like PayPal (PYPL), Square (SQ), and Shopify (SHOP) have online and mobile applications that integrate with QuickBooks' open platform. Currently, the main problem faced by this unit is how to move beyond the accounting niche to provide comprehensive solutions for the entirety of a business, from accounting to payroll, and from financing to taxes.The Consumer unit offers do-it-yourself and assisted TurboTax income tax preparation products and services to consumers; this unit, which generated 40% of the firm's sales last year, also offers personal financial management services and apps (Turbo and Mint). The company monetizes Mint mainly through lead generation for financial products and the sale of user data. The Consumer business faces competition from private concerns such as TaxSlayer or TaxHawk, and from public companies like Blucora (BCOR) or H&R Block (HRB).Responsible for 7% of the company's sales, the Strategic Partner unit serves professional accountants in the United States and Canada. It includes offerings like Lacerte, ProSeries, ProFile, and ProConnect Tax Online. Lacerte is designed for accounting firms that handle complex returns, whereas ProSeries is intended for tax practices that handle moderately complex tax returns. ProConnect Tax Online is a cloud-based solution designed for practices that prepare consumer and small business tax returns; this offering integrates with QuickBooks Online. And finally, ProFile is Intuit's Canadian tax offering. The Strategic Partner unit also offers a diversity of services that complement the tax return preparation process, such as document storage and e-signature services. Its largest competitor is Thomson Reuters (TRI).By integrating distinct solutions offered by Intuit itself and by third-party developers, the three business units form a large and synergistic ecosystem unmatched by the firm's direct rivals. Besides locking-in its customers, such ecosystem allows Intuit to use complementary offerings from different segments to cross-sell distinct services and increase its revenue per user (one example of this cross-selling dynamic is provided by the customers that combine QuickBooks Self-Employed with TurboTax to export and pay year-end taxes).As explained before, Intuit also benefits mightily from the integration between its customers and their accountants; furthermore, by leveraging its solutions for accounting professionals, the company has convinced accountants to act as 'ambassadors' or 'friendly middlemen' who actively recommend the firm's offerings to their self-employed and small-business clients (tellingly, in the United States, 4 out of 5 accountants recommend QuickBooks to their clients) - of course, besides reinforcing Intuit's brand appeal and positive network externalities, these active recommendations also perpetuate the company's grip on the market.If there's one criticism that can be made regarding Intuit's sources of revenue, then it's the company's over-reliance on the North American market. Intuit benefits from revenue diversity at the product level but not at the geographic level: for better or worse, and since 90%-95% of its revenue comes from the United States, the company's faith is closely tied to the faith of the small businesses and self-employed individuals in the country. And those are now suffering disproportionately with the COVID-19 crisis.Moreover, the company's narrow focus on the domestic arena created a large void in international markets that was duly explored by the competition. Its rival Xero, in particular, has made meaningful inroads in several countries across the globe and has positioned itself as one of the main players in Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. Xero also enjoyed solid growth in South Africa and Southeast Asia. Once the disruptor, Intuit was on the brink of being disrupted by an aggressive upstart from the other side of the world.* Depending on the credit score and loan amounts, the interest rate charged to small businesses varies between 9% and 19.3% - Intuit can evaluate this risk with great accuracy because the small businesses' financial transactions are coded to the software's general ledger.Competitive and Technological Disruption: ""You guys are really disrupting Intuit"", asserted Clayton Christensen, the late guru of 'disruptive innovation', when praising Xero at a seminar held 6 years ago. Indeed, despite its self-proclaimed culture of innovation, Intuit was caught napping by Xero back in 2011-2012. Sage, the UK's incumbent, was also caught off guard and leaked a significant amount of market share to Xero in the online space.Founded in New Zealand, Xero started off based on the premise that international markets were underserved and up for grabs; then, as owners around the world started using smartphones to conduct their lives and businesses, Xero seized the opportunity to offer a low-priced mobile app that won over many of those underserved owners. This goes to show that disruptive actions may happen in the blink of an eye in today's world.Fortunately, Intuit responded fast by turning a once mistreated offering (QuickBooks Online) into a proper rival to Xero - and yes, what allowed Intuit to pivot was indeed its culture of innovation and its ability to self-disrupt. In fact, the company quickly recognized the threat from the pesky upstart and virtually disrupted itself before Xero could do so.Besides selling Quicken, Intuit also abandoned the idea of offering a closed system and opened up its platform so that other companies could plug their services into it. Still, in countries like the UK, Intuit's average revenue per customer is just above half that of Xero's (Intuit is gaining ground fast, though).Disruption will probably also arrive from outside the accounting software industry: with their millions of small business customers and appetite to enlarge their product portfolios, capable companies like Shopify, Square (SQ), or Wix (WIX) may one day decide to compete head-on against Intuit.Expensive Acquisitions: Intuit needs to expand its ecosystem to combat these potential rivals, and the most direct path to gain scale and new functional attributes is to buy companies with promising portfolios. However, M&A deals often destroy shareholder wealth in the acquiring firm; together with the current economic environment, this is one of the reasons why the acquisition of Credit Karma by Intuit should be tempered with a healthy dose of skepticism.Indeed, despite the enthusiasm shown by some investors, this unicorn won't come cheap: Intuit will disburse USD 7.1 billion in cash and stock to buy it (or 7x Credit Karma's annual sales), making this acquisition the largest in the company's history; moreover, Credit Karma is unlikely to boost Intuit's profit margins over the medium-term. About USD 1 billion of the total purchase price will be earmarked for equity awards that will be expensed over the next few years; once the deal closes, Intuit will then issue about USD 300 million in shares to Credit Karma employees.These terms are not as unfavorable as they seem at first glance, though, because Intuit is taking advantage of its own higher-priced stock to fund the purchase (INTU is now selling at roughly 10x annual sales). The acquisition also makes some strategic sense, as Intuit can tap Credit Karma's young customer base and wide portfolio of services to synergize and upsell its offerings. It all hinges on execution.Intuit also intends to create a groundbreaking, artificial-intelligence powered 'digital personalized finance assistant' by leveraging Credit Karma's treasure trove of consumer data (which includes not only financial data but also key behavioral and location data). With the integration of Credit Karma with Mint and QuickBooks, Intuit will have a full picture of what consumers are doing at any given time and location.Does this ring a bell? Well, a bell should be ringing, because what Intuit wants is to use all this prized data to serve highly relevant personalized ads - in a certain manner, and adjusted for its scale and audience, Intuit's purpose is to follow the same playbook that made Alphabet (GOOG) and Facebook (FB) so profitable.By integrating data from multiple sources, Intuit will also be able to reinforce its competitive standing through the so-called 'data network effects' (as long as the integration of Credit Karma goes according to plan). These data network effects occur when a firm gains an advantage by gathering customer data and making that data more valuable to all other customers.Typically, in a product benefiting from such network effects, there is a sort of 'central repository' that consolidates data from distinct origins. The more data is added to this repository, the more valuable it becomes and the company can then use that information both to develop better algorithms and to attract new customers to the platform. These effects are the reason why Google continues to be the most dominant, profitable, and relevant information retrieval system ever designed.Currently, Credit Karma provides about 37 million monthly active users with free access to credit scores, credit monitoring, data-breach alerts, and tax-filing services; in exchange, this privately-held company makes money by recommending products such as credit cards and loans based on users' financial data. Though Credit Karma's estimated market share stands at a very low 3%, the company is growing fast; moreover, its users include about half of all Millennials in the United States (or twice as many as Intuit). The transaction, which has drawn many critics*, should almost double Intuit's estimated addressable market from USD 29 billion to approximately 57 billion.*A pertinent example: according to John Newman, a former DOJ Antitrust Division trial attorney, ""Allowing a near-monopolist (Intuit) to eliminate a maverick competitor (Credit Karma) poses obvious risks of harm (…) it's hard to imagine any reason why this should be allowed.""Competition from the Public Sector: In aggregate, American taxpayers spend 6-8 billion hours filing their taxes each year; in addition to this immense amount of time, Americans also spend up to 215 billion dollars annually to keep the IRS off their backs. Collecting records, completing worksheets, and filling out tax returns are mind-numbing tasks for most people. But the IRS could do the taxes of millions of Americans for free if only the political establishment would let it. After all, the IRS already possesses most of the information it needs to automatically produce tax files; such a free system is the norm in most developed countries around the world, including in the Netherlands, Norway, Japan, New Zealand, Estonia, Great Britain, and many others.However, 90% of all the taxpayers in America either use software or pay someone to file their taxes. This state of affairs benefits tax return preparers, but it also enriches the maker of the TurboTax software used by masses of Americans; no wonder then that Intuit has spent millions of dollars lobbying to ban the IRS from offering free and simple tax filing. The success of TurboTax thus rests on a seemingly precarious foundation that can collapse overnight if Intuit fails to shape the law.Capitalist markets crave convenience, simplicity, accessibility, and affordability; in contrast, these markets loathe complication, protectionism, inefficiency, and high costs (both financial and all others). This helps to explain why open markets tend to become more efficient over time. Being so, by spending vast sums of money to maintain an artificially inefficient status quo, Intuit is fighting the basic forces of capitalism.Intuit is also the subject of lawsuits - claiming that the company engages in ""egregious false advertising"", for instance - and regulatory inquiries relating to the provision and marketing of the TurboTax product. Recently, a biting government audit found that some 14 million Americans paid for tax preparation services they could have received for free. This seems to have greatly benefited both H&R Block and Intuit, which may have made over a billion dollars in additional sales. For how much longer can Intuit maintain the current situation?Well, Intuit can maintain it for many years or even decades, it seems: first, due to ingrained cultural and political views, many Americans would balk at the idea of letting the IRS prepare their tax returns; second, overhauling the complex tax-payment apparatus would be a very fractious and expensive undertaking (the IRS, which is chronically understaffed, would have to grow considerably to handle millions of software queries); third, some politicians and other agents are frightened by the possibility that a more efficient collection of taxes could lead to a larger public sector or government overspending; and finally, Intuit's commitment to provide a free tax offering has indeed meant that millions of Turbo Tax users paid nothing for the service over the last decade.As it stands now, by respecting the so-called 'Free File Program', the IRS has agreed it will not compete with Intuit or with other for-profit companies like H&R Block. Under this program, the IRS has worked with these players so as to provide free returns for low and middle-income taxpayers, at no cost.However, only 2.5 million of the 104 million Americans eligible for Free File ended up using it in 2019; this low adherence of 2.4% has led the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) to state disapprovingly that ""The process to participate in the Free File Program is fraught with complexity and confusion. IRS management seems unaware of the complexity and confusion taxpayers face.""The program's continuity depends on a number of external factors, including public awareness of the free program and continued government support (the current agreement is scheduled to expire in October 2021). Either way, considering the heat the company has taken lately, and with or without Free File, Intuit can still be pressured to include previously unavailable premium features in the company's free tax-filing offerings; moreover, some proposed forms of tax reform would also impact Intuit's ProConnect business. All this, in turn, could obviously erase a large part of its future revenues.Valued on average at USD 7.5 billion in 2019, the global accounting software market was expected to grow at an optimistic CAGR of about 6.0%-8.5% up to 2025. The COVID-19 crisis has changed these sanguine expectations and made growth projections even more futile than usual. With or without a vaccine it is, of course, impossible to come up with a model to predict how the crisis will evolve over the next couple of years* and how exactly Intuit will be affected by its consequences - in the end ""all models are wrong, but some are useful"", be it epidemiological models, valuation models or growth projection models. Over the long-term, though, the odds are still stacked in Intuit's favor.Indeed, the last decades have seen substantial growth in the small and personal business sectors that form Intuit's old stomping grounds, and information technology has been a major contributor to this secular trend. The expanding digital infrastructure reduced the costs of starting and running a small business, revealed new markets, lowered competitive barriers, and led to the creation of disruptive business models. Today, by leveraging the offerings of global behemoths like Amazon (AMZN), Shopify, or Facebook, among many others, just about anyone can become an entrepreneur either in Lebanon, New Hampshire or in Lebanon, the Middle East country.However, as the digital infrastructure matures and becomes commonplace, small and medium-sized enterprises - usually late adopters of innovation -will need to employ new and better technologies to create, manage, and market their offerings in today's complex, hypercompetitive environment.Businesses that fail to embrace technological change will be under increasing competitive pressure from more savvy competitors. In fact, digital adoption can be a do-or-die affair for most business owners. In particular, with roughly two-thirds of small-business owners feeling they are not very knowledgeable about finance and accounting (and with a staggering 82% of small businesses failing due to poor cash flow management), using digital products like accounting software is currently a basic prerequisite to survive and thrive in the marketplace.According to Deloitte, relative to businesses that have low levels of digital adoption, more digitally-advanced businesses realize significant benefits. For example, such businesses earned two times as much revenue per employee than late adopters. Such pressures stand to benefit Intuit, a dominant company with captive customers that provides cost-effective tools to improve the compliance, efficiency, productivity, and operations of increasing numbers of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The lifeblood of the world economy, these small businesses are extraordinarily varied and plentiful: in aggregate, they account for about 90% of the firms across the planet, for 50%-60% of the global employment, and for 40%-60% of the GDP in most countries.In the United States alone, small businesses make up 99.7% of all firms with paid employees. As stated by Intuit, there are approximately 460-600 million SMEs in the world, a massive number that has the double advantage of offering consumer-like scale and an abundance of direct monetization opportunities. Intuit's addressable market is therefore enormous no matter how one slices it.On a global basis, this market is also fragmented and largely underpenetrated: even in a developed country like the US, anywhere between 18% and 36% of small-business owners still aren't using any form of accounting software; furthermore, cloud accounting penetration in the US market is still less than 15%-25% (which compares to around 50% penetration in countries like New Zealand). Outside of the UK, US, and Canada, total penetration of the global TAM by all cloud-based accounting players is likely less than 5%, a very low percentage that points to a very long growth runway ahead.As SMBs proliferate, as complexity and transnational trade increase, and as e-commerce growth accelerates (one of the evident outcomes of the current crisis), Intuit will most likely grow with the growth of the strange bedfellows with which it has integrations, such as Square (credit card payments), PayPal and Stripe (online payments), Salesforce (customer relationship management), or Amazon and Shopify (e-commerce). In a certain sense, betting against the growth of Intuit is also betting against the growth of these expanding companies.Notwithstanding its intrinsic attractiveness, the market where Intuit operates also has a few weaknesses. For example, Intuit's revenues are both cyclical and seasonal because the total number of returns filed with the IRS fluctuates in tandem with the wider economy and the time of the year; moreover, Intuit's customer turnover is not trivial, as the death rates of small businesses are usually high even during good times: according to the Small Business Administration Office of Advocacy (2018), in the United States only 45%-51% of small businesses survive the five-year mark, and only about one-third survive 10 years or longer. On the other hand, in favorable years like 2013 - when the S&P500 was up 30% - the US economy has created roughly 540.000 new businesses per month.The rapid rise and demise of small businesses explain QuickBooks' deceptively poor customer retention rate of roughly 80 percent: while low compared to other enterprise offerings, this rate is actually quite solid when the wider context is taken into account (other companies that serve small businesses, like Shopify or Paychex, for example, also exhibit retention rates of 70%-80%). Customer churn can have a sizable impact on financial results because it is usually less expensive to keep current customers than acquire new ones.The markets for software and related services are also characterized by fast technological change, shifting customer needs, and constant new product introductions and enhancements; therefore, to remain competitive, Intuit needs to invest continuously in order to innovate and develop new products and services, as well as to improve existing offerings.Despite these shortcomings, the digitization of services, the expectation on the part of customers of more personalized experiences, and the substantial expansion in the self-employed workforce (which includes the rising numbers of 'gig workers') should all unlock significant opportunities to drive growth over the long-term.What's more, about three-quarters of all US small businesses will be owned by tech-savvy Millennials by 2025. This statistic has deep implications for the adoption of technology by newer generations of SMEs because, unlike many of their predecessors, Millennials won't be running their businesses on pen & paper or on Excel spreadsheets; mandated by legislators and governments worldwide, the increasing computerization of tax - which is forcing many businesses to take the digital route to submit tax returns online - should also act as a tailwind to the company. To capture all this potential growth, Intuit's strategy is to transform itself into an 'artificial intelligence-driven expert platform' by:1) Building an open platform where the company and its partners can seamlessly integrate together to solve the problems of customers and improve their financial outcomes;2) Accelerating the application of artificial intelligence to improve the experience of customers; this technology can already be seen in TurboTax, for example, a program that can use machine learning to create customized financial interviews adapted to each individual situation;3) Creating more connections among customers, partners, and experts. Currently, Intuit's TurboTax Live already connects TurboTax users with tax experts via a live one-way video; the company will now continue to develop more means to connect customers with experts in order to help them make quick, informed and personalized financial decisions. Due to better connectivity, industry insiders are predicting that the relationship between accountants and their clients will be near-instant - soon, accountants will have an immediate view of their clients' businesses and will be able to interact with these clients in real-time; in addition, accountants will know straight away when certain business aspects change for a client (for example, the accountant will be alerted when their client incurs bad debt resulting from an order placed by a client's customer whose credit rating is low). More and better connections with clients will also enable accountants to solve problems preemptively. According to Intuit, many SME clients are willing to pay their accountants for these richer services; as a consequence, there could be a major revenue and relationship opportunity for those accountancy practices that manage to adopt the company's newer technologies. This, again, should strengthen Intuit's ecosystem and generate win-win interactions for all the involved parties.*4) Developing deeper relationships with key partners such as accountants, financial organizations, enterprise platforms, and educational institutions; the partnerships will allow the company to co-create strong business connections by sharing expertise, product integrations, and new, tailored solutions to solve more customer problems.The objective of all the aforementioned measures is clear: while it expands profitably, Intuit's purpose is to reinforce its positive network effects and ecosystem of offerings; besides, the company wants to take advantage of 'user-generated content' - such as the data from customers or the advice from experts - to become more relevant and grow sales without too much exertion in terms of future capital expenditures.To achieve those goals, the firm intends to harness technologies like cloud computing, data analytics, and artificial intelligence, as well as greater bandwidths (thanks to its speed and greater bandwidth, 5G technology is expected to advance connectivity far beyond what current cellular technology allows - this, in turn, is expected to improve the all-important customer experience).With such combination, and adjusted to their scale, Intuit will give small companies the ability to benefit from the same type of finance and accounting integration once reserved for large companies. To that end, in 2019 the company increased the number of employees working in artificial intelligence by 60%, developed more than 100 machine learning models, and has filed hundreds of AI-related patents. Intuit will also lay off 715 employees (about 7.3% of its headcount) and add more than 700 roles to build the competencies it needs to execute against its strategy.Intuit's plan is likely to succeed because it is consistent with the company's long-standing culture of applying digital transformation not as a one-off process but rather as a continuous feature of how it operates; if successfully executed, the strategy will then create a deeper and wider web of interdependencies by reinforcing the connections between the demand side of the network and the supply side of the network; it will also lock-out would-be competitors and lock-in new users more effectively. It looks promising.*In April 1918, during the last great pandemic, people were fairly confident that the worst was behind them. Then they were hit by an even more ferocious second wave in the fall. Sure, at the beginning of the 20th century, medical science didn't have the tools to fight one of the deadliest influenza viruses Humanity has faced; but, with an effective vaccine still in development, the world today is as vulnerable as its most fragile health system. And there are many fragile health systems around the world. No wonder Warren Buffett appears gloomy.Intuit's flagship offerings are some of the most dominant within their respective end markets. Despite its age, Mint is still the most widely used budgeting tool and the second most popular personal finance app overall behind PayPal and ahead of Square; Lacerte is also the second most popular high-end professional tax preparation software in the United States behind Thomson Reuters' UltraTax CS and ahead of Wolters Kluwer's (OTCPK:WTKWY) CCH ProSystem fx. On its part, Intuit's ProConnect is still the most widely used professional tax preparation software in the domestic market.Of course, Mint, Lacerte, and ProConnect are all relevant to Intuit's ecosystem of products but, in terms of strategic importance, they cannot be compared to the company's two largest moneymakers: TurboTax and QuickBooks. Approximately 40 million Americans filed their taxes online with Intuit's TurboTax in 2019, which was far more than with any other tax prep software.The number of TurboTax users has been growing at a measured but consistent pace as new cohorts of US taxpayers turns to financial software to do their taxes: according to the IRS, the amount of self-prepared returns filed in 2019 increased by about 3.3% compared to the previous season, whereas the number of returns filed by accounting professionals declined by 1% over the same interval. And, unfortunately to H&R Block and its network of accounting pros, Intuit has been the main beneficiary of the ongoing shift from the assisted tax preparation mode to the digital, do-it-yourself mode.To add insult to HRB's injury, Intuit also launched its TurboTax Live offering, which is aimed at consumers who still want some form of tax assistance. Because it lets consumers interact with certified public accountants without leaving their homes - a behavior that fits the demands of a post-pandemic world - this pioneering offering is expected to grab more market share over the next few years and to have a transformative effect on the way many Americans (and especially the 'digital-native' generations) prepare their taxes.Intuit's moneymaker QuickBooks also dominates a high share of its respective market. Initially, QuickBooks became one of the most popular enterprise software solutions for SMEs through a combination of reliability, ease-of-use, accessible entry-level price points, and marketing muscle; today, QuickBooks leads the market in the United States, which is still the largest and most profitable market in the world for accounting software. QuickBooks also occupies a leading position in India and Canada - with strong competition from privately-held FreshBooks - and a distant second place in Australia and the United Kingdom (behind Xero). On a global basis, QuickBooks has nearly 6.0 million paying customers.It should be noted that Intuit didn't release a UK-specific version of QuickBooks Online until 2011, a fact that gave Xero the upper hand in this important market. QuickBooks has a strong presence in the European Union as well: it is the most popular solution in countries like Italy, Greece, Poland, Portugal, and Spain and the second most popular in Austria, Belgium, and Ireland. According to Datanyze, QuickBooks is equally one of the top accounting programs in Singapore, Malaysia, South Korea, and South Africa.Outside of the largest geographies, the market for SME accounting software is too large and too fragmented for any one vendor to build a truly dominant share. Still, in terms of global sales, there is a massive difference between the top players - like Xero, Sage or Intuit - and the 10th or 11th player in any given local or regional market (in other words, QuickBook's end market has a 'long tail' of smallish software vendors vying for local customers).On the flip side, many of the behemoths of enterprise software - like IBM (IBM), SAP (SAP), and Oracle (ORCL) - sell few offerings to the enormous global SME market. Why? Because these companies cannot have a USD 120k sales person selling into an account that will only return USD 500 of sales per year. Intuit is therefore within a 'goldilocks' zone of the enterprise software market.This occupation of a goldilocks zone explains in part why Intuit is so profitable: besides serving a large and fragmented market where it faces relatively few threats to its competitively advantaged position, the company also profits from the fact that its millions of locked-in SME customers have no real bargaining power. For software providers, dealing with small businesses is much easier and lucrative than dealing with large corporations. Other mature software companies that serve individuals and small businesses - like Paychex or Adobe (ADBE) - are also within that highly profitable zone.The other parts that explain Intuit's profitability are its extensive scale, the very low incremental costs of providing its mission-critical solutions to SMEs and consumers, and the good capital allocation skills of the management team (however, as mentioned before, the jury is still out regarding Intuit's latest acquisitive moves).Such a potent mixture has resulted in returns on invested capital well in excess of Intuit's estimated WACC of about 6.5%. Even when goodwill and intangibles are included in the calculation, the company's ROIC has averaged a very healthy 30% over the past decade of operations. H&R Block only achieved a respectable but much lower average ROIC of 20.1% during the same period.As shown above, Intuit has been the most potent wealth creator within its chosen peer group* (Xero is still spending heavily to acquire clients, hence its negative returns on capital). However, the acquisition of Credit Karma will certainly inflate goodwill and intangibles and depress Intuit's ROIC, at least over the short- to medium-term. Shareholders should hold management's feet to the fire to deliver adequate returns on all the capital they allocate, and that naturally includes the capital used to pay well above the sum of the net fair value of all the acquired assets. Now, it remains to be seen if the Credit Karma deal is going to generate the same long-term economic profitability that has made Intuit so attractive to investors in previous years.*Please note that no company within the chosen peer group is perfectly comparable to Intuit.The beauty of achieving consistently high returns on capital is that even a slow growth rate is enough to create added value through the generation of plentiful cash flow. This cash flow can then be allocated to dividends, sensible share repurchases, and growth initiatives. Cash flow is also what determines the value of a firm to investors. This concept is easier to grasp when a given business is viewed through the lens of a private business owner: if this owner purchased a business that he could not sell for 30 years, he would derive value exclusively from the cash flow generated by that business over time; meanwhile, his returns would be quantified based on the size of those cash flows relative to the original acquisition price. Being so, and considering the importance of cash flow, how cash-generative is then Intuit?Intuit | Free Cash Flow Generation & FCF per Share: Intuit has always been Free Cash Flow-positive over the past decade, a period through which cash flow generation increased by an impressive 158% (from USD 855 million in 2010 to USD 2169 million in 2019). On a per-share basis, FCF has expanded by 194% over the same period as Intuit repurchased shares and became more efficient; H&R Block and Thomson Reuters, on the other hand, saw their FCF per share compress by -30% and by -118%, respectively, during the same interval. No competitor even comes close to Intuit in this instance; however, over the medium-term, the current crisis will, of course, harm the company's FCF generation.Intuit | Free Cash Flow Margin (5-year average): Generating abundant and growing FCF is always desirable but the amount should be scaled by revenue to show what proportion of the top line gets converted into cash. Intuit's current FCF/Sales (TTM) ratio is 27%, an outstanding percentage that translates a very healthy conversion of sales into FCF; on average, this parameter has been around the 27.6% mark during the last 5 years of activity. Here too Intuit tops its peer group by a comfortable margin.Intuit | Cash Conversion Rate (5-year average): As measured by Free Cash Flow/Net Income, Intuit' CCR averaged an impressive 135% between 2015 and 2019 (ratios above 100% reveal an excellent translation of net income into cash); obviously, companies that do not achieve a high conversion - and there are many - are more inhibited in their capacity to reinvest in the business or return money to shareholders. Due to its relationship with the accrual ratio, the CCR also provides a means to identify firms with high earnings quality*. As shown by Sloan and others, companies with low or negative accrual ratios like Intuit tend to outperform companies with high accrual ratios.* The accrual ratio can be calculated as (Net Income - FCF) scaled by total assets - when FCF is larger than Net Income (that is, when the CCR > 1 in any given year), accruals are negative. This means that cash earnings - or 'real' earnings - are higher than accrual earnings and that earnings quality is high.Intuit| CapEx/Operating Cash Flow (5-year average): Capital-light companies obviously require lower amounts of capital to realize equal or superior profits than capital-heavy companies. For example, hardware producers or oil and gas corporations must always invest in expensive PP&E that requires periodic repair and replacement; such businesses must also tie up cash in assets like inventory. Software companies, on the other hand, might use close to zero major physical assets. Intuit is the epitome of a capital-light business as CapEx, on average, only consumed 8.5% of the company's OCF over the past half-decade. Intuit does not need to reinvest a large portion of the cash generated by its operations just to keep on functioning and growing, which again indicates that the company is capable of generating surplus capital with relative ease.Naturally, lower intra-industry average ratios are in general better than higher ratios; however, their long-term trend needs to be monitored because chronically low or falling ratios can also signal lethargic demand, challenges to execution, heightened competition or absence of reinvestment opportunities. None of these situations affected Intuit but they certainly affected Sage, a firm that struggled to migrate its customers and services from a standard license model to its cloud platform.Being a cyclical company, Intuit does not perform equally well regardless of the economic environment. Still, supported by the benign economy of the last decade, Intuit has displayed a consistently solid performance on the sales front. Over that period, Intuit only delivered negative sales growth in 2015 as it solidified its transition to a cloud-based business model; ultimately, this transition helped to create recurring streams that made revenues more predictable and lessened repeat customer acquisition efforts. A series of divestments, the new recognition of revenue on a ratable basis, as well as an impairment charge of about USD 260 million against goodwill, have also impacted the company's performance in 2015.That speed bump was not structural, though, because Intuit's sales were not affected by weakened competitiveness or by persistent market share losses. However, the company's latest quarter results offered a glimpse of what the future might bring: compared to the year-ago quarter, third quarter 2020 revenues declined by 8.25% due both to the negative effects of the lockdown on small businesses and to the extension of the tax filing deadline in the US (the extension of the deadline is a temporary issue, of course; either way, due to the high levels of unemployment, Intuit won't be able to recoup all its lost revenue). Naturally, upcoming quarters are expected to see a deceleration in the company's sales and an acceleration of customer churn.Can Intuit cover payments on its outstanding corporate debt without difficulty? According to Moody's (MCO) it can, as the credit ratings agency assigns an A3 long-term rating to the company, with a stable outlook. This rating is a reflection of Intuit's market leadership, highly recognized offerings, low financial leverage levels, and established recurring revenue streams. Long-term debt and other long-term liabilities now account for only 4% of the company's total current liabilities, whereas short-term debt and other short-term liabilities account for 25.8% of Intuit's debt obligations. Total liabilities have been declining since 2016.On aggregate, these numbers are translated into a strong debt-to-equity ratio of only 0.06 and in a rather high cash-to-debt ratio of 6.58, as well as in quick and current ratios of 1.70 and 1.79, respectively. Intuit's interest coverage ratio stands at an impressive 158.5. The company's current Altman Z-Score of 18.8 also places Intuit well inside the 'safe zone' and shows that the firm is nowhere near bankruptcy; at the present, though, Intuit has a low Piotroski F-Score of 5 (out of 9); also, with the acquisition of Credit Karma, the company will deplete its stores of cash to near zero. For the time being, though, Intuit seems to be in good financial shape. All these parameters suggest that the company is slightly leveraged for growth and not at all exposed to default risk.Asset productivity is a key contributor to shareholder value. Being so, how productive is Intuit relative to its total assets? There are of course several parameters that can be used to answer this question, including the company's total asset turnover (which measures the efficiency of total assets in producing sales) or the return on assets (which measures the overall profitability of assets by scaling net income by total assets).However, because net income can be manipulated, the following analysis will instead focus its attention on Intuit's gross profitability (which is calculated as gross profits/total assets). This parameter uses gross profits instead of earnings because gross profits are often a purer measure of economic productivity (as they are not usually affected by accounting tricks); besides, gross profits are not impacted by advertising or R&D expenses, or by other capital expenditures incurred to improve a company's competitive positioning.In very general terms and over the long-term, any given company should be able to exceed an average gross profitability of 33% regardless of the sector or industry where it operates. That is the minimum hurdle of asset productivity. Said differently, companies should be able to generate throughout the years a minimum of USD 3.3 of gross profits for every USD 10 invested in assets.There's no hard-and-fast rule to analyze a given company along this dimension but the calculation should be made both with and without goodwill just to make sure the firm is not overpaying for unproductive acquisitions over time; in Intuit's case, goodwill has been responsible for about 28% of the company's total assets throughout the last decade, showing that Intuit has been moderately acquisitive.The calculation should also adjust for the presence of a large amount of cash and short-term investments in the balance sheet because, if 'excess' cash is included in the calculation, companies like Microsoft, for instance, would apparently fail to reach the minimum 33% threshold of gross profitability; however, after adjusting for its presence, it is possible to verify that this cash-rich firm (cash comprises about 48% of MSFT's total assets) is in fact quite productive and profitable relative to its assets. In Intuit's case, cash and short-term investments currently account for a staggering 51.2% of assets.A chronically depressed gross profitability ratio (<33%) indicates trouble around the corner, especially for growing companies: striving for sales growth often means large upfront investments in assets, including in facilities, equipment, or accounts receivables. Any protracted decline in demand - prompted by a pandemic crisis, for example - can then leave an expanding company stranded and overinvested in assets it cannot divest to pay its bills. This can have grave financial consequences. That's not the case regarding Intuit, though: as shown below, relative to its asset base, Intuit has been the most productive company within its peer group by far. In fact, along this specific dimension, Intuit is one of the most productive large-cap companies in the world.Intuit's gross profitability ratio averaged 138% since 2015. This means, naturally, that the amount the company made per annum in gross profits was substantially larger than the amount it owned in total assets (excluding cash). And the trend continues mostly unabated. These results are almost beyond belief, even for an asset-light software maker. Intuit more than doubles Sage's average gross profitability of 59%; with an average ratio of 107%, the only competitor that comes remotely close to the American firm is Xero. Among its peer group, Intuit is also the most efficient company at generating revenue from its streamlined asset base.10. Does Intuit exhibit a high degree of pricing power? Yes: 1 Point""You can determine the strength of a business over time by the amount of agony they go through in raising prices"" (Warren Buffett).Pricing power is one of the main attributes of a strong business. A major difference between a compounder and an average company is that the former can mitigate the impact of falling demand through its capacity to raise prices without alienating customers. Along with the presence of recurring revenue streams, pricing power is, therefore, one of the features that allow the top line to hold up better during harsher times. Pricing power also enables strong businesses to reduce prices temporarily in order to capture market share without compromising its long-term prospects (and indeed that is what Intuit has been doing in markets like the UK).Judging by the prices it has been able to charge over the years, Intuit surely seems to be one of those strong businesses. This assertion is confirmed by Intuit's small competitor ZipBooks, for example, when it stated that the company's ""many customers feel like price changes happen often. This is a frustration for many, because the learning curve, time, and information they've put into QuickBooks make it unlikely for them to switch despite price increases."" Because it benefits from two of the most effective types of competitive advantages, regular price hikes are not at all agonizing for Intuit. In fact, the company was able to raise prices by as much as 66% for many QuickBooks' customers in the recent past. Of course, Intuit can drive its prices and profits upward as long as the cost to the customer does not exceed the cost of switching to a competing provider. Concerning TurboTax, and to ""encourage early filling"", the company was able to hike prices in March 2015, March 2016, February 2018 and February 2019 as (remarkably) it gained market share.Intuit also charges higher fees than its nearest rivals for equivalent software solutions: for example, at the lowest per-month fee, QuickBooks Online costs USD 15-25/month while Xero and Sage only charge USD 9 and USD 10, respectively, to small businesses; QuickBooks' top-tier plan is more expensive too, as it costs USD 150 per month compared to Xero's USD 60 or Sage's USD 25-78. There is also a large price difference between paid versions of TurboTax online (which cost USD 110 - 170) and similar versions from H&R Block (USD 67 - 117) or TaxAct (USD 68 - 115)*.Intuit's capacity to charge higher prices than competitors - and to raise those prices on a regular basis - is reflected in the company's operating parameters. However, by looking only at average gross margins (which is the classical way to estimate pricing power) one would presume that Sage is superior to Intuit in this regard:But that would ignore the fact that operating margins are also an important factor in the evaluation of pricing power - after all, for modern knowledge-based companies like Intuit, pricing power also arises from a company's intellectual property and research & development prowess. And R&D is, of course, an item included in the calculation of operating margins. As shown below, Intuit is the company with higher average operating margin among its peer group.Moreover, pricing power must also be assessed via a company's average ROIC throughout the years (as persistently high returns on capital can only be maintained when competitors are not stealing customers and economic profits) and long-term sales trajectory (which is a reflection of market share gains and losses). Being so, by finally considering Intuit's market share stability, strong operating margins, and remarkable returns on capital (which are the highest among its peer group), there can be no doubts that the company has indeed a high degree of pricing power.*Some prices may have changed at the time of publication.Relative Valuation: With a free cash yield of only 2.6% and an earnings yield of 1.8%, Intuit's valuation surely looks full and about to overflow; the company's EV/EBITDA is also very high at 39.4. In fact, Intuit is now displaying its highest price multiples of the past five years amid a context marked by a pandemic crisis. Paying up for high-quality companies sometimes makes sense but paying too much is rarely a good idea, of course. Currently, the market at large seems to be projecting an enthusiastic earnings growth rate on the part of this strong but cyclical firm. For Intuit to re-rate, either growth has to accelerate meaningfully - very unlikely considering the current economic deceleration and uncertainty - or multiples need to compress. Nevertheless, when compared to most peers, Intuit certainly deserves a premium valuation.Absolute Valuation (Discounted Cash Flow Analysis) | Main AssumptionsRevenues: A series of factors and trends should all allow the company to capture further market share in the United States and international markets. These include innovative offerings like TurboTax Live and QuickBooks Live, cross-selling of services, rising numbers of freelancers, gig workers and independent contractors, further computerization, and Intuit's envisioned suite of new interconnected solutions. The acquisition of Credit Karma might also bolster revenues over the medium-term, but this is a highly speculative assumption. Still, because Intuit seems to be reinforcing its switching barriers and positive network externalities, retention of existing (and surviving) customers should likely improve over the next 5 years. Over time, solutions like QBO should also enable Intuit to expand its business in underpenetrated markets such as India, Brazil, and France. However, the COVID-19 crisis should still exert a negative impact on the company's revenues up to 2022-2023 - perhaps inaccurately, the model assumes that it will take a minimum of 3-4 years to 1) develop effective vaccines against the SARS-CoV-2 virus; 2) immunize large segments of the world's population; and 3) restore a semblance of self-sustained growth in the global economy. As a consequence of all these factors, the model assumes high revenue volatility translated into negative sales growth of - 10% in 2020-2021, a reacceleration of revenues to 2%-6% in 2022-2023, and finally, a further reacceleration to 8%-12% in 2024.Gross and Operating Margins: The model assumes that gross margins will stay within the 80.0%-82.5% range over the next 5 years (down from the average gross margin of 83.5% achieved between 2015 and 2019). Meanwhile, as both customer retention and operating leverage are anticipated to improve, the model also assumes that SG&A expenses should decrease by about 5%-10% from the current levels over the forecast period; on their part, R&D expenses as a percentage of sales are expected to fall within the 19%-19.5% interval. This, in turn, should lead to operating margins of 27%-28% by 2024. Further margin improvements should be more difficult to achieve due to competitive pressures exerted by aggressive rivals like Xero.Operating Cash Investments: The model assumes that the sum of capital expenditures investments with the changes in working capital will reach a level equivalent to 8.5%-10.5% of revenues, on average, per year; it also estimates that invested capital will reach an amount equivalent to 20%-25% of sales, on average, per year, in line with the company's investments over the preceding years.Cost of Capital, Terminal Growth Rate, and Fair Value Estimate: The DCF model assumes a WACC within the 6.5% + [± 1.5%] range. The model also assumes a terminal growth rate between 1% and 2%. After a sensitivity analysis, the valuation model delivers a present-day fair value estimate range between USD 250 and USD 270 per share, implying that Intuit is currently overvalued.Making it one of the highest-quality mature companies within the tech sector, the Quality Score for Intuit is 8 out of 11 possible points. As mentioned by Aswath Damodaran ""There are more 'bad' businesses in the world than most people realize. In fact, it is the 'good' business that is unusual, not the 'bad' one."" Intuit is one of those unusual and unusually good businesses, of which there are probably less than 75-100 on a worldwide basis.The pressure of this pandemic accelerated DIY trends and the adoption of certain technologies. It also changed how people interact with each other. Progress out of the crisis will be predicated on solutions that reinforce human connections by encouraging rapid and effective collaboration at a distance. These changes should benefit Intuit over the long-term.However, while clean balance sheets, strong corporate cultures, high sales growth, high profit margins and high returns on capital are clearly alluring attributes, there are many high-quality companies that have made for inferior investments and many low-quality companies that have made their stockholders wealthy: without considering the price paid, high-quality is not at all a guarantee of adequate returns. And Intuit seems overvalued for now.Intuit also operates within an economically-sensitive industry and, given the likelihood of the biggest global recession since the Depression, the company's medium-term outlook is a bit murky (to say the least). Indeed, the company has yet to see what its prospects look like when bankruptcies really start to cascade through the economy.Besides, prospective investors cannot ignore the risks looming over the horizon, as one day Intuit might be forced to include previously unavailable premium features in the company's free tax-filing offerings. In addition to its impact on revenues, such a forced move could obviously obliterate its current levels of profitability (the Consumer unit, which offers these free tax-filing solutions, generates gross margins of about 63%, whereas the SBSE unit 'only' produces gross margins of roughly 44%).By itself, however, this is probably not enough to preclude a future investment in Intuit. Thanks to the unique triumvirate of Mint, TurboTax, and QuickBooks, no company has more data on the finances of individuals and small businesses in the United States. This precious asset gives Intuit immense optionality, new insights, and new opportunities to replace waning businesses at a time when proprietary data is solidifying its standing as the new gold. With such data, artificial intelligence can arguably do wonders in Intuit's arena. Many skeptics argue that customer and consumer data is a commodity. It is not, as attested by the meteoric rise of data-driven companies like Alphabet, Facebook, Amazon, or even Credit Karma (tellingly, in 2019, Facebook produced almost four times more free cash flow than Exxon Mobil (XOM), which was the largest company in the USA just a few years ago).Moreover, as a very general rule, investors should never bet against a company introducing efficiency within a given system (as attested by the preeminence of SaaS companies, for example); Intuit is reducing entropy and increasing gains for those involved within its narrower ecosystem but it is also, arguably, decreasing the gains of millions by lobbying to ban the IRS from offering free tax filing. Yet, throughout its history, Intuit has been reshaping its goals and methods to match the demands of the world outside. And this specialist in self-disruption is doing it again. Even with its risks and stretched valuation (which makes it a 'hold'), and to paraphrase Scott Cook, Intuit still ""functions well and feels good to the senses."""
4350688,105400,2020-05-28T17:51:02-04:00,Intuit has a strong track record of innovation that has driven steady growth and strong margins.Potential competition from the private and public sector could hinder its growth in the future.The company appears expensive at 26.2x forward EV/EBTIDA due to its strong financials.,"Intuit Inc (NASDAQ:INTU) has the combination of steady growth and high operating margins due to its strong track record. The company has a strong history of innovation, which has built up an ecosystem to support its switching costs and network effect advantages. With strong competitive threats from the public and private sectors, it increases the long-term uncertainty levels for the company. Even then the company should still be able to achieve roughly 10% revenue growth in the near term and 30% operating margins within the next 5 years. With favourable fundamentals, investors can expect to pay a premium 26.2x forward EV/EBITDA for the company. Intuit has multiple platforms to help customers better their money and handle their tax with ease. These platforms include QuickBooks, TurboTax, Mint and Turbo and cumulatively they make up more than 52 million customers. Intuit's ability to attract such a large customer base boils down to its history of innovation. Intuit has now transitioned into a cloud-first company, which enables the company to serve its customers better and increase its long-term value. With a strong value proposition, Intuit has grown revenues from $3.4B in 2010 to $6.8B in 2019 at an annual rate of 7%. (Source: Investor Presentation)With such a long history of growth, one might expect that the days of growth for Intuit are over. But the company's total addressable market appears to be huge. The company estimates the total addressable market to be roughly $432B. At its current revenue of $6.8B, Intuit has only penetrated 1.3% of its total estimated market size. The company intents to capture more market share by integrating its existing ecosystem in a more seamless manner. There are also opportunities to grow its core customer base and expand globally. Furthermore, there are some trends like artificial intelligence that could improve customer experience and grow the market for all players. With the rise of omnichannel commerce, more companies would also embrace tax automation through Intuit.  (Source: Investor Presentation)The company generates 50% of revenue from small business & self-employed. These customers are likely using Intuit's Quickbooks services. Once businesses use Quickbooks for bookkeeping, it is unlikely that they would switch to other software providers. Businesses keep records on a regular basis and switching would mean having to transfer and relink all the data and third-party apps connected to their Quickbooks program. (Source: Annual report)The company has also been encouraging companies to build software on top of its Quickbooks program. This helps enhance the company's switching costs as customers' use of software increases as their business grows. (Source: Annual report) 41% of the company's revenue comes from consumer offerings, which includes software like TurboTax. We believe that the switching costs are also high due to the reluctance of consumers in learning new filing interface. Filing taxes is a tedious and infrequent task. Once consumers are familiar with TurboTax and it serves their needs, it is unlikely that customers will switch to other software. Quickbooks is also the most well-known accounting software for small businesses. As small businesses likely have accountants that manage their finances, this creates a network effect. With more accountants that know how to use Quickbooks, it increases the number of small businesses that would purchase the software. As there are a larger number of small businesses that use Quickbooks, accountants would unlikely use other software and go through the process of importing data once they switch companies. Hence, new accountants and small businesses will likely pick Quickbooks as their choice. With a track record of innovation and a large addressable market, we can expect Intuit to average 10% growth for the next 5 years at least. The company also experienced an acceleration of growth in recent years from -1.2% growth to 12.6% growth in the previous year. The company's strong ability to increase value for existing customers and entering into new markets will also contribute to growth going forward. With its switching cost and network effects, we expect Intuit to maintain high operating margins in the future due to its pricing power. Operating margins have averaged roughly 26-27% in the past 3 years, and we expect there would be some operating leverage that would drive some efficiencies in the future. Hence, operating margins should be closer to 30% after 5 years. Intuit faces huge competitive pressures from the private and public sector: (Source: Annual report)Popular small businesses platforms like Shopify and Paypal might choose to vertically integrate into this space, which could provide a compelling reason for businesses to switch if provided for free. The government could also implement the compulsory need to use government tax software, which could render Intuit's software obsolete. Intuit recently acquired Credit Karma, which would help support inorganic growth. But with all acquisitions, there are integration risks. It is uncertain if Intuit can extract an appropriate IRR from the purchase price they paid for the company. More often than not, acquisitions result in poor IRR due to a high purchase price or integration issues. ValuationBased on relative valuation, Intuit appears to be overvalued based on consensus EV/Revenue and EV/EBITDA multiples. The company's consensus EV/Revenue of 9.5x is higher than the average figure of 6.0x. Intuit's EV/EBITDA of 26.2x is also higher than the average of 17.4x. However, Intuit has much better fundamentals than its peers. Its consensus EBITDA margin and revenue growth of 36.1% and 9.2%, respectively, are better than the average of 33.1% and 1.5%, respectively. Hence, potential investors in Intuit will be paying a higher price for a better company based on financials.(Source: Atom Finance)For Intuit to sustain its favourable economics, the company has to continue to improve its value proposition for its customers so that they do not have a strong reason to switch to other compelling solutions. The company also has to maintain its expansion strategy in order to capture market share before local competitors embed their solutions in their home countries. Intuit also has to manage its integration with Credit Karma well to ensure that it earns a decent return from the acquisition."

The global pandemic has hurt the smaller businesses most and with the US tax deadline being extended, the company's revenues were hurt. But it still managed to surpass market expectations.Intuit's FinancialsRevenues for the third quarter fell 8% to $3 billion, in line with the market's expectations. EPS fell 21% to $4.11. On an adjusted basis, EPS was $4.49 compared with the market's forecast of $4.48 for the quarter.By segment, Small Business and Self-Employed Group revenue grew 11% to $982 million driven by growth in customers for QuickBooks Online. Small Business Online Ecosystem revenue grew 28% to $560 million and Consumer Group revenue fell 15% to $1.83 billion. The decline in the consumer group revenue was due to the extension of the US tax filing deadline as tax filing revenues spilled over to the fourth quarter.Intuit did not provide any guidance for the quarter or the rest of the year. Analysts expect Intuit to report revenues of $1.56 billion for the quarter with an EPS of $0.86 and revenues of $7.38 billion for the quarter with an EPS of $7.13.Intuit's AI FocusIntuit is leveraging AI to drive to its next level of growth. First, it is working to connect people to experts on its platform using TurboTax Live and QuickBooks Live. Within TurboTax Live in the last quarter, it improved access to an expert by providing real-time chat and a Live Help button. The move has helped it improve customer conversion and retention. Intuit is also leveraging AI by automating repetitive tasks and providing contextual customer information to experts so they can help customers based on their location and product experience. Overall, the AI implementation has helped it reduce session handle time and improve customer satisfaction scores to best ever levels for TurboTax Live.For small businesses, it is using AI to sell in an omni-channel world. It recently released Cash Flow Planner in QuickBooks Online to help small businesses with their cash flow issues. Its AI-based interactive solution will help business get paid fast, manage capital and pay their employees on time. Within payroll, it is helping small business customers hold on to their money longer by using its money movement capabilities to pay employees next day, thus reducing the time between running payroll and paying employees by nearly 30%.Its stock is trading at $283.87 with a market cap of $74 billion.

4348086,102007,2020-05-15T15:26:39-04:00,"Intuit is a leader in consumer tax and small business financial software, both of which are relatively mature markets.Its pending acquisition of Credit Karma adds an established platform in personal finance which is a fast-growing segment.The shares have held up strongly in 2020 so far but we think a prolonged downturn could hurt small businesses more than others, thus impacting one of Intuit's core segments.","Intuit (INTU) is the leading player in consumer tax and small business applications. With its acquisition of Credit Karma, the company has further expanded into consumer finance. However, we think the current torrent of events will likely impact Intuit more so than other software names. The shares have recovered strongly since the initial market selloff but we think the optimism has rendered risk/return profile unattractive at the moment.(All amounts in USD)Intuit's bread and butter has been its suite of software that helps consumers file taxes and assist small businesses manage their finances. The company's most famous products include its TurboTax and QuickBooks, both well-known products with significant market shares in their respective domain. Both products aim to help customers become DIY and less dependent on traditional services such as manual tax preparations and bookkeepers. Compared to other software giants such as Adobe (ADBE) and ServiceNow (NOW), Intuit's target customer base comprises primarily of small businesses and individuals. In the 2019 investor day, the company laid out its vision including growing its core segment in small businesses and consumers. This distinction has played to its favor during the 11-year bull market as the economy expanded and consumer confidence remained high. However, the impact of COVID-19 will undoubtedly impact the small business segment and consumers harder than large enterprises. Given this distinction to other software companies, one should expect that Intuit's financial performance will fluctuate more in relation to its reliance on the economy. Its business model also means that its revenue visibility is lower due to the challenges facing its core customers when compared to vendors that target large corporations.(Source: Investor Day Presentation)Intuit has achieved outstanding growth with a consistent execution track record. The company expects to grow its core segment by 10-15% revenue over the long term but the pandemic has brought unexpected short-term challenges. In the corporate update from May 7, 2020, the company withdrew its 2020 guidance and took down its fiscal 2020 Q3 guidance due to the impact from COVID-19 and the extension of the tax filing deadline to July 15. Intuit expects its consumer group, which houses its tax-filing software, to see a 15% revenue decline from last year primarily due to the extended tax deadline. As a result, it is conceivable that a majority of the lost growth will be regained in the fourth quarter. The small business segment has not seen too much impact thus far but the struggling private sector could result in weakness in this segment in the coming months. We think management's decision to suspend its 2020 guidance reflects the high level of uncertainty in its businesses.(Source: Investor Day Presentation)In February this year, Intuit announced the acquisition of Credit Karma for $7.1 billion. The deal further extends Intuit's reach into personal finance and will add a popular platform with 100 million members and 37 million monthly active users. Credit Karma reported $1 billion of revenue in 2019 and has a growth rate of ~20%. The acquisition is really meant to double down on Intuit's presence in consumer finance which is a fast-growing segment. People are increasingly looking for ways to manage their own finances using technology, instead of the traditional wealth management services provided by banks or funds. Similar to Robo-advisors platforms, Credit Karma is a powerful brand in consumer finance, covering a wide range of services including credit score, credit cards, loans, and financial literacy.(Source: Investor Presentation)While TurboTax remains Intuit's primary consumer-facing product, it does have a platform called Mint that helps consumers track credit scores and manage personal finances and budgets. Credit Karma and Mint have significant overlap and the consolidation will likely see both platforms unify, or more likely folding Mint into Credit Karma. The acquisition will position Intuit as the undisputed leader in personal finance platforms.Despite all the positive attributes of the deal, we also think the current crisis will bring outsized impact to Intuit's consumer segment due to its dependence on the economy. Specifically, the pandemic has resulted in bigger impacts on consumers and small businesses. Larger corporations with strong access to capital will weather the storm more easily. However, for small businesses such as private retailers, restaurants, gyms, the impact could be devastating and that translates into headwinds for Intuit. Although Intuit is better insulated from the impact compared to certain vendors due to the critical nature of its products, we think it will face a bigger challenge in the coming quarters compared to enterprise-focused software companies.Intuit currently has a market cap of $75 billion and trades at an EV/2021 Sales of 9.1x. The stock is reasonably valued given its lower growth rates than peers. The company has historically grown at high single digits or low teens as its markets are more saturated and mature. It competes aggressively with competitors in the tax domain which includes H&R (HRB) and Thomson Reuters (TRI). The fierce competition limited Intuit's pricing power in the consumer tax segment and it has to rely on volume and product innovation for growth. We think one of the key reasons for its Credit Karma acquisition is to add another growth engine in a fast-growing segment. Unlike consumer tax, personal finance is a much larger market with more growth potential. The price paid of ~7x revenue is also lower than its own trading multiple.(Source: Filings and Bloomberg)Intuit has performed strongly in 2020 despite the macro headwinds. The company is among the top performers in our peer set. We think the outperformance at Intuit was likely due to its strong fiscal 2020 Q2 results that saw market share gain at the consumer tax business and good margin. However, we think the pending acquisition of Credit Karma and Intuit's focus on small businesses could result in higher earnings volatility compared to other software peers. As a result, we felt Intuit's strong performance to date has already priced in certain optimism that might prove immature if the economic recession prolongs to damage the small business segment severely.(Source: Bloomberg)Intuit has dominant market shares in consumer tax and small business financial software. Its pending acquisition of Credit Karma adds an established platform and management team to expand its presence in the high-growth personal finance category. While the company will likely be transformed through the acquisition, we also think its reliance on the small business segment could result in more headwinds compared to its enterprise-focused peers. Thus, combined with its strong 2020 performance to date, we think it is prudent to be patient and await clarity on the pandemic, broader economy, and impact on consumers and small businesses before investing."
4350020,105096,2020-05-26T09:23:52-04:00,"Intuit grew revenues for its small business segment by more than 10% last quarter, despite COVID-19's impact on the quarter's second half.U.S. small business indicators deteriorated sharply from mid-March, but showed signs of stabilization in May.Intuit's business remains cash-generative, dividends are still being paid and management is likely to resume share buybacks in the future.While near-term financials are hard to predict, the company’s resilience and double-digit medium-term CAGR look set to continue.At $287.61, investors' annualised return will likely be in the low teens, mainly from a low-teens EPS CAGR. Reiterate Buy.","We initiated our Buy rating on Intuit (INTU) last September. In the 8 months since then, shares have returned 7.7% (including dividends), nearly 1,000 bps ahead of the S&P 500, though approx. 500 bps behind the Nasdaq:Our Buy case has been that Intuit is a high-quality asset that can deliver a low-teens annualised return for investors, driven by a low-teens EPS CAGR that is the product of a double-digit organic revenue CAGR and a rising EBIT margin. This is backed by structural drivers such as a resilient customer base, a large pool of potential new customers and the ability to cross-sell products:With the release of FY20Q3 (Jan-Apr) results last Thursday, we review the assumptions behind our Buy case, in particular to assess the impact of COVID-19, and also look for any read-across for the wider U.S. economy.The headlines of the FY20Q3 results were pre-announced in early May, but Thursday's release provided more detail on Intuit's performance.Key P&L items from Intuit's results are below - as a reminder, the P&L is highly seasonal, because the Consumer segment (48% of FY19 segmental EBIT) typically generates 95%+ of its EBIT in fiscal Q3, during the U.S. tax season. With the postponement of the IRS's filing deadline from April (in Intuit's Q3) to July (Q4), both the Consumer and Strategic Partner segments have seen revenues shifted by a quarter, so the Small Business & Self-Employed (""SBSE"") segment is the only one where year-on-year comparisons are meaningful:SBSE reported year-on-year growth of 10.7% in revenues and 10.1% in EBIT for FY20Q3, helped by Online Ecosystem revenues growing 27.6%. While these are strong growth rates, they represent a deceleration from FY20H1, when Intuit reported year-on-year growth of 16.0% in revenues, 22.1% in EBIT, and 34.8% in Online Ecosystem revenues. Non-U.S. revenues again grew faster than U.S. revenues, at “over 50%” year on year for the quarter, similarly decelerating from the “over 60%” seen in both Q1 and Q2.The deceleration was due to COVID-19's impact on the second half of the quarter (from mid-March onwards), which we will discuss further below.While COVID-19 had an impact on key metrics such as QuickBooks Online new customer acquisition (down 15% in the second half of FY20Q3, compared to the first half) and retention (down 2% compared to prior year), Intuit executives ""continue to expect the small business customer base and ARPC (Average Revenue Per Customer) to grow in fiscal year 2020”.Consumer revenues were 15.3% lower year on year for FY20Q3 (and 10.2% lower year to date), due to the postponed IRS deadline shifting many tax filings from Q3 to Q4. According to Intuit, IRS data showed total e-filings year to date being 9.6% lower (at 116 million) as of May 8, even after an unknown number of filings this year from people who were only filing to receive the U.S. government stimulus (the company believes this represents a pool of 10 million). Moreover, the later filers have disproportionately higher ARPC, with the “majority” of Intuit's higher-value customers not yet having filed.There were some positive data points, however. Within the 9.6% decline in total IRS e-filings year to date, self-prepared e-files were up 2.2% while assisted e-files were down 18.8%, meaning the customer base is continuing to shift towards Intuit's addressable market. The company's executives also stated that they “feel good about where we stand with the TurboTax online share and ARPC”. In addition, while job losses in the economy will lead to fewer tax filers over time, for FY20 at least the impact will be limited by the fact that individuals who received income for only part of the year will still have to file.Strategic Partner revenues were similarly impacted as Consumer revenues, as Intuit's accountant customers delayed tax filings for their clients.During the quarter, Intuit's QuickBooks Capital distributed $875 million of Paycheck Protection Program loans to 25,000 small businesses, and it expects to earn 3-4% on these loans, including servicing fees.The above shows that Intuit's business continues to perform, though growth has become slower due to COVID-19, and we may see more impact from this next year (FY21). A recession that reduces the number of small businesses and taxpayers will ultimately have some short-term impact on Intuit's P&L, but we remain confident in the business' long-term potential.Intuit management expressed the same views - the withdrawal of current-year guidance (in early May) due to COVID-19 does not reflect any change in their long-term confidence in the business. As the CFO stated:Intuit also provided data points from its platform as a read-across for U.S. small businesses. These show a sharp deceleration in the second half of FY20Q3 (from mid-March):Source: Intuit FY20Q3 earnings callHowever, signs of “stabilization” have become visible in May, though management cautioned this may not indicate a sustained recovery:The $7.1 billion acquisition of Credit Karma (announced in February) was still expected to close in CY20H2, though due to COVID-19, it is no longer expected to be neutral/accretive in the first full fiscal year after closing.A quarterly dividend of $0.53 per share was declared, unchanged from last quarter (as is customary for Intuit, which has typically raised its dividend in October each year) but 13% higher year on year.Share buybacks are suspended, which management described as customary before stock-based acquisitions such as Credit Karma. The CFO reminded the investor community that the authorised buyback program still has $2.4 billion left, and “we expect to be in the market in the future”.We value Intuit on last-twelve-month (ending January 31, 2020) financials, which excludes the fiscal Q3 where the shift of tax filings to Q4 has distorted the quarter's financials. At $287.61, Intuit is on a 40.9x P/E and a 2.3% free cash flow (""FCF"") yield; the dividend yield is 0.7% ($2.12 per share):We believe Intuit’s valuation multiples are justified by its sustainable low-teens EPS growth and its proven earnings resilience during previous downturns. This is especially true given the ""lower for longer"" outlook on interest rates.With stable valuation multiples, Intuit's share price will likely rise in line with its EPS, which we expect to growth with a low-teens CAGR. Combined with the 0.7% dividend yield, this gives investors a low-teens annualised return.While COVID-19 was a significant negative impact on the second half of FY20Q3, Intuit still grew revenues in SBSE by more than 10%, and its performance in Consumer appears to remain resilient.We remain confident the company will continue to achieve its targeted double-digit organic revenue CAGR and rising operating margin in the medium term, continuing the strong track record it has demonstrated in recent years:We believe Intuit's main listed competitor, U.K.-based Sage Group PLC (Neutral-rated) (OTC:SGGEF), to be structurally challenged; similarly, we believe the assisted part of H&R Block (HRB) will remain under intense pressure. Xero (OTCPK:XROLF), the disruptor from New Zealand, is growing strongly, but Intuit's strong growth both in the U.S. and internationally show it is holding its own.At $287.61, Intuit shares are at a 40.9x P/E and a 2.3% FCF yield. With its proven earnings resilience during previous downturns and ""lower for longer"" interest rates globally, we believe these valuation multiples are justified.We expect Intuit to deliver an average annual investor return of at least low teens, from an average EPS CAGR of at least low teens, stable valuation multiples and a 0.7% dividend yield. We reiterate our Buy rating on the stock.Note: A track record of my past recommendations can be found here."
4350073,103480,2020-05-26T11:54:12-04:00,"Share of tax software company Intuit are up nearly 10% this year despite a ~10% decline in the S&P 500 over the same time period.More than half of Intuit's revenue is derived from its small business group, which may experience much higher churn this year.On the consumer side, the delay of the tax filing date to June 15 (which is causing a tough comp to Intuit's recently released Q3 results) adds additional risk.Intuit's $7.1 billion acquisition of Credit Karma may also prove less beneficial than intended.Intuit looks pricey at ~10x forward revenues (despite meager mid-teens growth rates) and ~34x FY21 EPS.","Intuit (INTU), the well-known software publisher behind many popular tools like TurboTax and Quickbooks, has been one of the better-performing stocks in the tech sector this year. investors have shrugged off any impact of the coronavirus on Intuit, and confidence in the stock has led to a nearly 10% rise year-to-date, despite a loss of the same magnitude in the broader S&P 500.Intuit recently released fiscal third-quarter (the period through March) results, and though the true impacts of the coronavirus are difficult to assess from that quarter alone (especially because the federal government officially pushed individual tax filing deadlines to June 15), investors weren't concerned enough about Intuit's results to put a dent in its year-to-date rally.Data by YChartsI, however, remain skeptical of Intuit on the following counts:Be careful of Intuit at present levels. I'd prefer to sit on the sidelines here.The biggest concern I have with Intuit at the moment is its heavy dependence on small business customers for the majority of its revenue. See the company's historical breakdown of revenue by segment in the chart below:Figure 1. Intuit revenue by segmentSource: Intuit fact sheetAs can be seen above, in FY19, Intuit's small business/self-employed segment contributed 52% of the company's total $6.8 billion of revenue. Moreover, the small business arm of the company is also the faster-growing side, and pulling up the company's total growth rate to make up for the slower-growing consumer and strategic partner (essentially software for accountants) segments.Not surprisingly, Intuit has noted that since the coronavirus began, its small business customers have been disproportionately affected. The company's commentary on its recent Q3 earnings release clarifies this in greater detail:Figure 2. Intuit Q3 results commentarySource: Intuit 3Q20 earnings releaseQuickbooks' customer growth decelerated fifteen points in March alone. And what's not mentioned in the commentary here is churn. Quickbooks' primary clientele are smaller businesses who opt for its simplicity over more powerful and complex software tools that are intended for companies with large, formal accounting departments. Small businesses around the U.S. have been under pressure, especially the types of businesses that are most likely to be Quickbooks clients - restaurants, mom and pop-owned restaurants, independent hotels and vacation homes, or service providers. I wouldn't be surprised to see the small business segment slip into negative revenue territory in Q3 - though Intuit's CEO Sasan Goodarzi noted on the Q3 earnings call that ""we continue to expect the Small Business customer base and ARPC to grow in fiscal year 2020.""It should be noted as well that auxiliary products such as payroll and time tracking form a lot of the ""upsell"" packages that Quickbooks sells to its clients. A lot of these packages are priced per employee, as shown below:Figure 2. Quickbooks payroll pricingSource: quickbooks.comSmall companies that don't completely go belly-up are likely at least to let go of a few of their employees (consistent with the record-breaking unemployment numbers in the U.S.), which will have the effect of reducing payroll-related revenues for Intuit. Quickbooks noted that since mid-March, the number of workers paid through Quickbooks payroll had declined to -10% y/y, though pre-virus that figure had been growing at +20% y/y - indicating thirty points of headwind from the virus to payroll volumes.The last small-business related risk is QuickBooks Capital. As most investors know, Quickbooks also has a small lending business that makes small loans directly to its customers. The general idea behind QuickBooks Capital is that since QuickBooks already has access to years of its customers' financial data, loans could be safely made and the process sped along as well.The coronavirus, of course, has thrown a wrench into this formula, with many small businesses failing to meet rent, payroll, and supplier payments - all higher priorities than debt repayment. Now, QuickBooks Capital's balance sheet is relatively small in relation to Intuit as a whole. At the end of Intuit's most recent quarter, QuickBooks Capital had $89 million of loans outstanding - which is small in relation to QuickBooks' ~$7 billion annual revenues, ~$4 billion of balance sheet cash, and ~$75 billion market cap. Even so, investors will still have a negative reaction if these loans sour, consistent with investors' reaction to higher credit loss provisions in the consumer division of most major banks this quarter.Though I believe Intuit's risk is largely concentrated in its small business arm, its consumer business isn't without its share of risks either.You'll see in Intuit's revenue table above that consumer group revenues declined by -15% y/y in Q3. This is because Q3 is typically the quarter in which consumers pay for TurboTax to file their taxes - this year, of course, the federal government has allowed for an automatic extension of the tax filing date to June 15.Most investors may be content to think that the consumer revenue that Intuit lost in Q3 will simply be pushed out to Q4 when taxes are due. I think to assume that all of these revenues will be recaptured, however, is overly optimistic. Intuit's simplified tax software is largely geared to individuals with less-complicated deductions and for those who tend to get refunds at the end of the year - individuals who are more likely to file on time than delay filing to June 15. When you put Q3 and Q4's eventual consumer revenue together, I expect we'll see some deceleration in Intuit's consumer revenue growth relative to the low-teens growth seen in prior quarters.The other consumer-oriented risk is Intuit's February announcement of its acquisition of Credit Karma for $7.1 billion, to be paid for in a mix of cash and stock. Expected to close in the second half of 2020, Intuit originally expected that Credit Karma would be ""neutral to accretive"" to Intuit's pro forma EPS in the first full fiscal year after the transaction closes. But now, the company isn't so sure, with CFO Michelle Clatterbuck noting as follows on the Q3 earnings call:This is a big acquisition that will add $1 billion (~15%) to Intuit's revenue base, and any integration missteps especially in the midst of a global pandemic will cause Intuit to trip even further, on top of its cash outlay for Credit Karma. The $7.1 billion purchase consideration is split 50/50 into cash and equity (per the company's February SEC filing), and Intuit's current 3Q20 balance sheet has ~$4 billion of cash and $400 million of debt on it, or $3.6 billion in net cash. Intuit (which maxed out its $1 billion credit line in May to increase its cash balances) is essentially reducing its net cash balances to near-zero in order to acquire Credit Karma, while the earnings contribution timeline from the acquisition is unclear.Data by YChartsAs seen in the chart above, Intuit currently trades at 10.4x EV/forward twelve month revenues and 41x P/E based on forward-twelve month EPS. When calculating its P/E against a more normalized FY21 EPS, based on Wall Street's consensus of $8.26 (per Yahoo Finance), Intuit's P/E multiple only squeezes down to ~34x. Most software companies with a growth rate in the low/mid-teens (where Intuit was growing pre-pandemic) tend to trade at mid single-digit valuation multiples, while larger software companies with an earnings base that are also growing in the mid-teens, like Microsoft (MSFT) and SAP (SAP), also trade at lower P/E multiples. It should also be noted that unlike Intuit, these enterprise software companies aren't disproportionately reliant on small business customers:Data by YChartsIntuit's peak valuation multiples, in my view, represents the fact that investors are rather complacent about the risks this company faces, especially by the small business segment that is seeing declining payrolls and likely much larger churn as the pandemic wears on. The fact that Intuit is also spending the majority of its net cash balances for an aggressive takeover of Credit Karma is another near-term risk on the horizon. Intuit is essentially priced for perfection, even though many unknowns are stacked up against it.Stay on the sidelines here."
4342522,101959,2020-05-03T15:10:06-04:00,"Intuit has an attractive business model with sticky customer relationships in small business and tax preparation software.The company is making moves to expand itself into a personal financial management juggernaut, although its past forays have met with mixed results.Although the business is attractive overall, the valuation is not where all the risks are taken into account. I rate Intuit as a hold.","During times like these, I've been looking for companies with sustainable business models regardless of the economic environment. In the case of my last article on Booking Holdings (NYSE:BKNG), I surmised that the business would stay viable despite being dealt a serious blow by COVID-19. In the case of Intuit (NYSE:INTU), however, the company faces less severe risks to its business. Because of this, the company is merely 12% off of its highs as the market prices in little economic impact.Intuit has a sticky business model and will likely continue to be successful over the long term. Additionally, management is making moves in the form of new acquisitions to transition the company into a personal finance powerhouse. There are risks to the business, however, in the form of any changes to tax legislation and concerns over the health of small businesses across the country. Taking all that into account and considering the company's valuation, I am not a buyer of Intuit today, but I will be looking to purchase on any weakness in this volatile market.Source: 10-KIntuit is a leader in personal tax and small business software with its TurboTax and QuickBooks software suites. The company's revenues are split almost 50/50, with a slightly heavier weighting in the small business/self-employed segment, which represents mostly QuickBooks revenue.Looking at margins, the SB/SE segment has the weakest gross margins, at a respectable 44%, with consumer at 63% and the strategic partner segment at 67%. Strategic partner revenue represents software solutions for professional accountants to aid in small business tax prep/filing.What initially interested me in Intuit is the pervasive nature of its software. Anyone who read my article on Adobe (NYSE:ADBE) knows that when a company boasts software products that have become nearly ubiquitous in any discussion surrounding an entire field, it provides a significant moat. Think Photoshop for Adobe, or Windows, Office, etc. for Microsoft (NYSE:MSFT). QuickBooks is a powerful name in bookkeeping and payment management, and TurboTax holds a strong position in DIY tax preparation. QuickBooks is taught to accounting students, similar to Photoshop in creative fields, making it the standard for smaller businesses without in-house accounting teams.Part of the power of QuickBooks is the ability for third-party software providers to link with the software. The company has partnerships with Bill.com (NYSE:BILL), Square (NYSE:SQ), Shopify (NYSE:SHOP), and PayPal (NYSE:PYPL), to name a few. QuickBooks processes payroll and provides for invoicing. Just like other business solution SAAS companies, retention is high at around 79%. It's likely that it would be higher, but turnover in the small business space is higher than among the larger companies, which are not customers of a product like QuickBooks.Although QuickBooks has pretty solid customer retention, any significant downturn that causes widespread failures in small businesses (a real concern with COVID) could materially affect the business. However, people will still file their taxes, insulating Intuit to a degree since around half of its revenue is derived from TurboTax. Additionally, the government has stepped in with significant loan injections for small businesses. It will take time to assess the damage to the economy when the dust settles, but it's likely that Intuit's results will recover with the economy. The issue is that any upcoming effects to Intuit's operating results are not necessarily priced in at this point. The company has run up with the market, putting it around ~10% off of its highs. This leads me to believe that there is significant near-term downside risk.In order to find further growth, Intuit will be acquiring Credit Karma, which is similar to the purchase of Mint for $160M in 2009. The company paid $7.1B for Credit Karma, which derives its revenue from affiliate links. The company boasts 100M users, with 37M of them active on a monthly basis, and it boasted ~$1B in revenue in 2019 at a 20% growth rate YOY. The acquisition has the capability of being a slam dunk for Intuit. If management is able to effectively streamline its customer base and integrate Credit Karma into its ecosystem, it will pay dividends for years to come. Management projects that the acquisition increases the TAM for Intuit's consumer segment from $29B to $57B.However, Intuit has long mismanaged Mint, in my view, which carries many parallels to Credit Karma. The company was founder-led and cruising when it was purchased, but has been allowed to languish inside the Intuit umbrella. The founder, Aaron Patzer, said it had effectively been in maintenance mode for the last 8 years. From my personal experience, I can't help but agree. I've moved on from Mint to Personal Capital, which I have found to be much more streamlined even though its main focus isn't on its transaction tracking. Seemingly easy integrations like the ability to upload transactions into TurboTax haven't been handled well, leaving Mint on the outside of Intuit's ecosystem.While this won't necessarily be the fate of Credit Karma, I am wary of Intuit expanding further into the personal finance space when Mint has not been a great case study into how management will continue its expansion into the personal finance space.Intuit and H&R Block (NYSE:HRB) have a vested interest in maintaining their collective tax preparation moat. Many countries are much less stressful. Specifically, the government pretty much has all the information it needs before you ever send them anything. Your taxes are cross-checked against what the IRS has on file anyway to either accept or reject the return, and in many countries, taxes are quickly handled through the government agency.However, in America, Intuit and HRB have spent $6.6M lobbying politicians to maintain their spot in the market. They have a compromise called the Free File Alliance (2002), where anyone with income <$66,000 can file for free with TurboTax or at an H&R Block location. However, although this comprises nearly 70% of the population, only around 3% use this feature. Through this alliance, filing goes through these companies allowing for upsell and a built-in customer base.The issue is what happens if the government ever decides to pass new legislation, which has been considered. This represents an existential threat to the company's business. That being said, Intuit is not alone in this fact. There are many businesses out there that would no longer have the advantage that they do if laws were to change. It's worth considering, however, that there are strong opinions out there that life would be better if the worst came to pass for Intuit.Data by YChartsConsidering the company's financial position, things look good overall. The company has increased its dividend for 9 consecutive years at an 18.8% clip over the last 5, and still only pays out around 1/4 of free cash flow. The company generates more in free cash flow each year than it has in long-term debt, so I have no concerns about solvency. Additionally, the company has sufficient cash on hand.Considering Intuit's long-term operating history, the company has been very successful. It has grown earnings at a 16% clip over the last 20 or so years, paid and grown its dividend since 2012, and rarely had an impact to its earnings. However, the price reflects that. Starting in around 2017, the price has become more and more disconnected from its results, and the blended P/E ratio stands at 37X today.Looking at the more recent past, earnings growth stands at 12% per year, and the dividend yield hasn't been able to keep up with the strong share price performance.Based on analyst estimates for growth and a return to the company's long-term average valuation multiple (more than fair considering the company's growth is slower today than earlier in its history), an investment today could yield around 6% annualized. This highlights what I expected from looking at the previous graphs. Considering the potential downside, I assess that Intuit is effectively priced for perfection today. I would love to own the company, but I think that it bears waiting. I'll have it on the watchlist until then.If you liked this article and would like to read more like it, please click the ""Follow"" button next to my picture at the top and select Real-time alerts.

Other than death, taxes are the only thing that is guaranteed. Regardless of recession, collapsing oil prices, or zero interest rates, Uncle Sam will still be collecting. That is why I believe that Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) may be one of the few safe long-term bets. This company's stock may fall in the short-term, but if its performance in 2008 was any indication, the fall will be much less than the general market.(Source: Yahoo Finance/MS Paint)Intuit has a strong free cash flow margin, and with the potential acquisition of Credit Karma, a future path towards renewed growth. For these reasons, I am giving Intuit a bullish rating.Intuit's financial performance primarily comes from the earnings-rich fiscal Q3 because of the consumer segment. This segment contributes close to 50% of the company's EBIT, and 95+% is generated during the U.S. tax season.(Source: Portfolio123/MS Paint)In the Q2 2020 quarterly earnings call, the management indicated that:Given that there may be some delayed tax filings due to COVID-19, investors should expect a small reduction in revenue for Q3, but will be recovered later in the year.Assuming that the acquisition of Credit Karma is approved, this will represent Intuit's largest acquisition at $7.1 billion. I consider this to be an exciting development for Intuit as the merger offers synergy and will help reinvigorate growth. Credit Karma has an annual revenue of $1 billion with revenue growth of 20%. The end goal is to produce a product that will be a personal financial assistant, helping consumers match their financial situation with products such as loans, mortgages, and insurance. It appears to be a win-win situation for both consumers and financial institutions.One industry metric that is often used for software companies is the Rule of 40. It is an industry rule of thumb that attempts to help software companies ascertain how to balance growth and profitability. For a further description of the rule and calculation, please refer to one of my previous articles.(Source: Portfolio123/MS Paint)In Intuit's case:Revenue Growth + FCF margin = 13% + 23% = 36%Intuit scores marginally below the 40% needed to fulfill the Rule of 40.As an investor, one wants to make sure that if a company doesn't fulfill the Rule of 40, it is at least not burning cash. One can tell by examining the SG&A expense relative to sales.Note that SG&A includes Sales & Marketing, General & Administrative, and R&D.(Source: Portfolio123)In the case of Intuit, the SG&A expense is 55% of the total revenues. This level of spend is reasonably conservative for a maturing company. I certainly don't consider this level of expense to be a cash burn.The following scatter plot of enterprise value/forward sales versus estimated forward Y-o-Y sales growth illustrates Intuit's stock valuation relative to the 152 stocks in my digital transformation stock universe.(Source: Portfolio123/private software)A best-fit line is drawn in red on the scatter plot and represents a typical valuation based on next year's sales growth. As can be seen from the scatter plot, Intuit is situated somewhat above the best-fit line, implying that the company is overvalued based on forward sales multiple.The Sales/EV multiple tells me that the stock is overvalued, but my value assessment changes when I substitute next year's earnings estimates for forward sales.(Source: Portfolio123/private software)The results shown on this second scatter plot suggest that Intuit is fairly valued based on next year's earnings estimates.The major concern for Intuit is that the government amended the wording for the IRS Free File Program in December 2019 to eliminate the wording that the IRS will not offer a competing service. Keep in mind that the Free File Program is meant for low- and middle-income taxpayers and there are already suppliers of free tax software, including Intuit, that provide free tax software for this type of taxpayer.Adverse macroeconomic conditions such as we are now experiencing could negatively impact consumer and small business spending as stated in the Q2 quarterly report:It should be noted however that Intuit has ""historically performed well in economic downturns.""During this time of extraordinary uncertainty, it is safe to say that in spite of any economic slowdown, we will all be filing income taxes, and so will small businesses. Intuit has historically performed well through recessions and will likely do so in the future. There is a strong possibility that we are about to enter a recession if we have not already done so.Intuit has strong free cash flow and remarkably has positive GAAP earnings, something of a rarity for software companies. While Intuit comes up just short of fulfilling the Rule of 40, the company is certainly not burning cash, alleviating most of my concern in this regard. In addition, parts of Intuit have some strong growth potential including online ecosystems, the acquisition of Credit Karma and growth outside of the United States that could improve its performance as a growth company.Intuit stock appears to be overvalued when evaluated based on the forward sales multiple but is fairly based on forward earnings.Given the current turbulence in the stock market and uncertainty going forward, I believe that Intuit is one of the few stocks that presents a lower risk investment. Therefore, I am giving Intuit a bullish rating."

Not only did it deliver stellar second-quarter results, but the company also recently announced a $7.1 billion acquisition - its biggest acquisition till date.Revenues for the quarter grew 13% to $1.696 billion, ahead of the market's expectations of $1.68 billion. Net income rose 27% to $240 million. On an adjusted basis, it reported quarterly earnings of $1.16 per share, up 16% and ahead of market estimate of $1.02.By segment, Small Business and Self-Employed Group revenues grew 17% to $973 million. Online ecosystem revenues which include QuickBooks and other online services grew 35% over the year. Consumer Group revenues grew 8% to $499 million.Among other key metrics, QuickBooks online accounting revenue grew 43% driven by strong customer growth. The 23% growth in Online Services was driven by the continued adoption of QuickBooks Online payroll and QuickBooks Online payments. Its total international online revenue grew by more than 60%.Within the Consumer and Strategic Partner Groups, DIY revenues grew by 3.5%. Professional tax revenue in the Strategic Partner Group grew 8% to $224 million.Intuit expects to end the current year with revenues of $7.44-7.54 billion and an adjusted EPS of $7.50-7.60. The market was looking for revenues of $7.53 billion with an EPS of $7.57. Intuit forecast an EPS of $5.90-5.95 for the quarter with a revenue growth forecast of 10-11%. The market was looking for an EPS of $6.17 for the quarter.Intuit's result announcement was overshadowed by the $7.1 billion acquisition of Credit Karma. San Francisco-based Credit Karma was set up in 2007 as a tool to help consumers get deeper insight into their credit scores. Since being set up, the company had diversified into other personal finance management tools such as tax filing assistance and help on vehicle purchase documentation and financing. The company claims to have over 37 million monthly active users.Prior to the acquisition, Credit Karma had raised $645.3 million in funding from investors including Silver Lake Partners, Google Capital, Tiger Global Management, Susquehanna Growth Equity, Ribbit Capital, 500 Startups, Susquehanna Growth Equity, Angel LLC, QED Investors, SV Angel, Founders Fund, and Felicis Ventures. Its latest round of funding was held in March 2018 when it raised $500 million in a round led by Silver Lake Partners at a valuation of $4 billion.Credit Karma offers its services for free to its customers, but earns revenues through advertisements. It has been profitable since 2015. Reports suggest that it generated revenues of over $1 billion last year. Intuit plans to let Credit Karma run as a standalone entity for now. It will leverage the acquisition to grow its customer base and service offerings. Credit Karma's marketplace of service offerings already has more than 100 financial services partners that provide credit cards, loans, and auto loan and insurance services. Consumers can apply to leading credit cards and also shop around for home loans, personal loans, auto loans, and refinance opportunities. Credit Karma's online calculators help users calculate amortization, debt repayment and simple loan details. Users can also simulate their credit scores to see impacts of their transactions on the credit rating.Overall, the acquisition is a good strategic fit. Credit Karma has a subscriber base of over 106 million customers and 37 million monthly active users. Combining this with data from Intuit's own portfolio of 37 million Turbo users and more than 40 million TurboTax users will create an opportunity to build one of the largest consumer marketplaces that can connect these consumers to thousands of financial institutions.Intuit will be looking to cross-sell and upsell its own services to Credit Karma's user-base. Analysts expect that the acquisition will help Intuit tap into Credit Karma's younger client demographic. Together, the companies will be able to offer individuals the ability to access personal financial information such as income, spending, and credit history in a single place. They can use this knowledge and the right kind of tools to simplify personal financial planning and get access to the right financial products and insights that help them achieve their financial goals.Its stock is trading at $297.57 with a market cap of $74.6 billion.

4329478,105096,2020-03-04T11:31:38-05:00,"Intuit's share price has corrected 12% in the last 2 weeks, amid wider market turmoil, despite reporting strong FY20Q2 results last week.The key Small Business & Self-Employed segment grew revenues 16.8% year-on-year in Q2, with online revenues again growing above 30%.The $7.1bn Credit Karma acquisition will be neutral to accretive to EPS in the first full year, and Intuit management has a good M&A track record.Intuit will likely achieve annual earnings growth of at least low-teens, as implied by its outlook, and earnings were resilient in previous downturns.At $268.24, Intuit shares are attractively priced and are likely to deliver a low-teens annual return for investors. Reiterate Buy.","(We previously wrote about Intuit as ""Blue Sky Capital"")We review the investment case on Intuit (INTU) following a 12% correction in its share price in the last 2 weeks and its FY20Q2 results last Monday.Since we initiated our Buy rating last September (""Intuit: Multi-Year Double-Digit Compounder""), the shares first reached a peak of 14% higher by late February, but have since fallen back substantially amid wider market turmoil, and are now roughly flat (+0.3%) (including $1.06 in dividends) for the period, roughly in line with the S&P 500 but behind the NASDAQ:Our investment case on Intuit is that it is a high-quality asset that can deliver a low-teens average annual return for investors, driven by a low-teens EPS growth backed by structural growth drivers including a resilient customer base, a large pool of potential new customers and the ability to cross-sell products.Under the “One Intuit Ecosystem” strategy since FY17, management has explicitly targeted a double-digits organic revenue growth and an rising operating profit margin:Intuit's revenue targets include an annual growth of 10-15%+ for its Small Business & Self-Employed (""SBSE"") segment and an annual growth of 8-12% for its Consumer segment:As we will explain below, we remain confident that Intuit will continue to achieve these targets.Key P&L items from Intuit's FY20Q2 results are below - Intuit's financials are seasonal, because the Consumer segment (48% of FY19 segmental EBIT) typically generates 95%+ of its EBIT in fiscal Q3, during the U.S. tax season:All three of Intuit's segments continue to perform in line with expectations:The SBSE segment saw revenues grew 16.8% and EBIT grew 25.6% year-on-year for the quarter, bringing year-to-date growth to 16.0% for revenues and 22.1% for EBIT. Revenue growth in FY20Q2 included a 34.5% growth in Online Ecosystem revenues, above the target of “more than 30%”. Markets outside the U.S. continue to grow faster, with non-U.S. online revenues growing more than 60% year-on-year. Such strong performance figures lead us to believe that Intuit is likely to be gaining market share from historic competitor Sage Group (OTCPK:SGPYY), and at least holding its own against newcomer Xero (OTCPK:XROLF).In the Consumer segment, while the tax season has “got off to a slow start through January” (with the total number of e-filed returns being 0.7% smaller year-on-year), Intuit has continued to gain share in the DIY category, which in turn has continued to gain share in the overall market. Management also confirmed that, in consumers' usage of free tax software (from the Free File Alliance), they “don’t see anything outside of the norm, based on the way the season is playing out”.The relatively small Strategic Partner segment saw a high-single-digit revenue growth in FY20Q2, “reflecting delivery of more forms”, and saw its operating margin expand further.Intuit also announced the acquisition of Credit Karma during FY20Q2 results, confirming press rumours in the preceding days. At a total consideration of $7.1bn (and $300m in retention equity), Credit Karma will be Intuit's largest acquisition to date.Credit Karma is a consumer financial technology platform that helps its members monitor their credit scores, search and apply for financial products and file tax returns. It operates in the U.S, Canada and the U.K., and has 106m members. Founded in 2007, it now has 1,300 employees. It had $1bn of revenues in CY19, growing 20% year-on-year (profitability is not disclosed). Intuit believes the acquisition will expand its total addressable market in consumer finance from the current $29bn to $57bn.The $7.1bn consideration will be 50/50 split between cash and Intuit stock, with the value of Intuit stock fixed at $299.73 (the 10-day average up to February 21), 11.7% higher than the latest price. The 7.1x EV / Revenue multiple for the deal compares with Intuit’s own multiple of 10.3x, though the levels of profitability are very different in the two businesses.The transaction is expected to close in CY20H2, and is expected to be “neutral to accretive” to Intuit's non-GAAP EPS in the first full year thereafter. Management has stated that ""our M&A principles have not changed”, and historically Intuit had a policy of requiring acquisitions to meet the same ""15% IRR over 5 years"" hurdle as other investments.While we do not have all the information to fully access the merits of the acquisition, the strategic rationale appears to make sense, and we are reassured by the expectation of the deal being EPS-neutral/accretive early on, and by Intuit management's M&A track record in general.As part of FY20Q2 results, Intuit management reiterated the guidance for the full year, which included a 10-11% revenue growth, a 10-12% EBIT growth, and a 11-13% EPS growth (with respect to non-GAAP figures):We remain confident that Intuit will continue to achieve the targeted double-digits organic revenue growth and rising operating margin in the medium term. Management's record has been strong (excluding the impact in FY15 of moving the revenue model to a subscription-based one):Intuit's EBIT is likely to continue growing by at least low-teens annually. With a low interest expense and buybacks at least offsetting share-based compensation, Intuit's EPS growth will likely be in line with its EBIT, i.e. at least low teens annually.Covid-19 will likely have only a limited impact on Intuit's financials. Intuit's tax and accounting products fulfil recurring, mission-critical needs for its customers, and approx. 75% of its revenues each year come from existing or returning customers. Earnings have demonstrated resilience in previous downturns - during the 2008-9 crisis, revenue and EBIT continued to grow, as did EPS (excluding an one-off disposal gain):At $268.24, on FY19 financials, Intuit shares on a 39.7x P/E and a 2.5% Free Cash Flow (""FCF"") Yield; the Dividend Yield is 0.8% ($2.12 per share). (We value Intuit on its FY19 financials, given the seasonality in its Consumer business; cashflows were negative in FY20H1, similar to the prior year.)We believe Intuit’s valuation multiples are justified by its sustainable low-teens EPS growth and its proven earnings resilience during previous downturns. This is especially true given the ""lower for longer"" outlook on interest rates, with 10-year U.S. Treasury bond yields having fallen below 1% for the first time.For FY20Q2, Intuit's SBSE segment has continued to deliver on its revenue growth and margin targets, driven by the success of its Online Ecosystem.We remain confident Intuit will continue to achieve its targeted double-digits organic revenue growth and rising operating margin in the medium term.The Credit Karma acquisition is large and its merits difficult to assess fully, but we are reassured by the neutral to accretive EPS impact and Intuit management's M&A track record.At $268.24, Intuit shares on a 39.7x P/E, a 2.5% FCF Yield, and a 0.8% Dividend Yield. With its proven earnings resilience during previous downturns, and 10-year U.S. Treasury bond yields having fallen below 1%, we believe Intuit's valuation multiples are justified.We expect Intuit to deliver an average annual investor return of at least low teens, from average annual EPS growth of at least low teens, stable valuation multiples and a 0.8% Dividend Yield.

4327790,101421,2020-02-27T13:29:36-05:00,"Intuit said it would acquire Credit Karma for $7.1 billion in cash and stock.Credit Karma provides consumer and small business owner financial information across several verticals.With the deal, Intuit plans to combine CK's consumer finance portal with its financial product subscriptions and related service offerings.INTU appears priced for perfection at its current level, so my bias is NEUTRAL.","Intuit (INTU) has announced the proposed acquisition of Credit Karma for $7.1 billion in cash and stock.Credit Karma has developed an online resource for consumers and small business owners to learn about and manage their credit information, loans, taxes and related services.With the deal, INTU gains an important ‘front door’ to consumer financial information with the prospect of smoothing out its revenue stream in the bargain.However, INTU the stock looks priced for perfection. Maybe management can execute perfectly, but my bias is NEUTRAL.San Francisco, California-based Credit Karma was founded to provide consumers and small business owners with information about their credit profile, related offers, financial information on loans and tax filing information.Management is headed by founder and CEO Kenneth Lin, who was previously President at Multilytics Marketing and Director of Analytics at E-Loan.Below is an overview video of Credit Karma's tax marketing campaign:Source: Credit KarmaCredit Karma’s primary offerings include:Investors have invested at least $868 million and include Tiger Global Management, Susquehanna Growth Equity, SV Angel, QED Investors, Founders Fund, Felicis Ventures, CapitalG and others.According to a 2019 market research report by TransUnion, the market for U.S. consumer personal loans reached $138 billion by the end of 2018.Notably, the report indicated that fintech companies were responsible for the 17% growth over the previous year, while bank loans dropped accordingly.Furthermore, the U.S. vehicle finance market is expected to reach $1.36 trillion by 2023, a roughly 4% CAGR from 2018 to 2023.Intuit disclosed the acquisition price and terms as $7.1 billion in equal portions of cash and stock, with $1 billion allocated for equity awards vested over a three-year period.Management didn't provide a change in financial guidance as a result of the transaction.A review of the firm’s most recent published financial results indicate that as of January 31, 2020 Intuit had $2.27 billion in cash and short-term investments and $3.0 billion in total liabilities of which $373 million was long-term debt.Free cash flow for the twelve months ended January 31, 2020 was $2.25 billion.In the past 12 months, Intuit’s stock price has risen 14.0% vs. the U.S. Software industry’s rise of 26.1% and the U.S. overall market index’ growth of 10.5%, as the INTU chart indicates below:Source: Simply Wall St.Earnings surprises versus analyst consensus estimates were positive in ten of the last twelve quarters, as the chart shows below:Source: Seeking AlphaBelow is a table of relevant capitalization and valuation figures for the company:Source: Company FinancialsBelow is an estimated DCF (Discounted Cash Flow) analysis of the firm’s projected growth and earnings:Assuming the above generous DCF parameters, the firm’s shares would be valued at approximately $174.58 versus the current price of $282.73, indicating they are potentially currently overvalued, with the given earnings, growth and discount rate assumptions of the DCF.INTU is acquiring Credit Karma to marry Intuit’s software-based solutions with Credit Karma’s marketing funnel and consumer information business.As INTU’s Sasan Goodarzi stated in the deal announcement,So, the deal promises to consolidate consumer information and service delivery under one roof, potentially improving efficiencies and conversion rates in the process.Also, given Intuit’s lumpy earnings calendar, the deal promises to help it smooth out earnings more evenly throughout the year, possibly increasing its valuation as a result.With Credit Karma’s ‘nearly’ $1 billion in revenue, Intuit is paying approximately a 7.1x Price / Sales multiple for the deal, which while not cheap, is reasonable given Credit Karma’s 20% revenue growth rate.The greater question is INTU’s stock price, which my generous DCF shows is quite extended in its valuation...priced to perfection I would assert.Maybe INTU can execute this deal perfectly, but as the recent stock drop shows, the firm is not immune to larger market sell-offs.Given its current price level, my bias on INTU is NEUTRAL."
4328819,105055,2020-03-02T13:12:07-05:00,Intuit is acquiring Credit Karma for $7.1B.The deal gives Intuit access to more than 100M users who are interested in their financial well-being enough to have signed up for Credit Karma.$71/user and close to $1B in revenues for just $7.1B mean that Intuit got quite the deal.,"I was already planning on writing a piece for Seeking Alpha about Intuit (INTU), but it was further down the line. The company had shown up in my high-quality tech screens, and for a good reason too as the company is a straight-up cash machine.Intuit has, over the last several years, built a sort of mind share monopoly around the personal/small business financial space. This quasi-monopoly protects an investor's interests while helping Intuit continue to generate free cash flow that will hopefully compound for years to come. Their acquisition of Credit Karma, in my opinion, aids this endeavor.Well, I said it in the introduction, but I had to headline it for our article scanning friends, ""Intuit is a cash machine.""The company has been consistently increasing its free cash flow over the last several years, and that shows no sign of slowing down. Also, Intuit is not bogged down with debt, no matter how inexpensive it might be, and their products are not exactly going out of vogue. There is no reason to suspect that Intuit's cash cow days are numbered.These cash flows, chartered by Intuit's excellent management team, will continue to compound for years to come. Those compounded returns are precisely what we, as investors, are searching for. Especially so when it comes to cash flows that appear to be as secure as those of Intuit.For $7.1B in cash and shares, Intuit is buying something that cannot easily be created, a user acquisition machine.For those unfamiliar with Credit Karma, the free to use app provides users with their credit scores from TransUnion (NYSE:TRU) and Equifax (NYSE:EFX). The app allows users to see those scores, see what affects those scores, and offers recommendations for financial tools that the user might like (and that would earn Credit Karma a kickback).Intuit isn't buying the tech here. Intuit isn't even buying the approximately $1B in revenues generated by Credit Karma. Intuit is buying the more than 100M users that Credit Karma currently has (an estimated 30M of those are MAUs).Why acquire Credit Karma? After all, the technology running the show isn't exactly groundbreaking. Well, as we saw almost a decade ago now with Facebook's acquisition of Instagram, the user is everything. Capital is cheap; attention is not. Intuit is choosing to spend their cash flows and some equity on the data of 100M users. $71 for the complete financial life of 100M who care enough about their finances to want to check their credit score seems like a bargain for the financial services company.The acquisition has to pass the DOJ. While it's unlikely they take issue with such an acquisition, it wouldn't be a complete shock if they did. After all, Intuit is acquiring a company that provides users a free tax filing service.That tax filing service will likely come into question during any hearings the DOJ has. Intuit has, in the past, kept their free filing service well hidden, and only recently was told it had to be more prevalent. It is possible that Intuit has to give some concessions with regards to tax filing and the acquisition.Then, there's the case of Mint. Mint was a high-flying financial startup, much like Credit Karma. Intuit acquired it for $170M in 2009. Since then, Intuit has loaded Mint up with ads, scaring some longtime users away (I was one of them). There's the possibility that the same thing happens with Credit Karma, but one could argue that by the time that happens, Intuit would have already reaped their rewards.We know from press releases that Credit Karma currently brings in ~$1B in revenues. If Intuit were to leave the firm entirely alone, company-wide operating income could easily see an increase of ~$500M per year, especially after any cost-cutting synergies.Why $500M? Credit Karma by its nature has minimal cost of goods sold. It falls into a similar bucket as Mint.com and TurboTax, which, according to Intuit's last 10-K, have operating margins of 63%. I was a little more conservative with my $500M assignment.To figure out a fair 2020 valuation of the businesses as a whole, we will need to dilute Intuit stock by ~$4B. $4B because a portion of the deal will be paid in cash, and some part of the agreement (~$1B) will be paid in subsequent years. This would add ~15M additional shares to those outstanding, bringing our total to 275.5M.At 10% growth for Intuit, with the additional $500M from Credit Karma, 2020 net income would come out to roughly $2.25B.In the chart below, we can see that Intuit's PE ratio very rarely dips below 30, so at a base level, $2.24B gives us a valuation of $67.5B. An average PE for Intuit of 34 leaves us with $76.5B.Data by YChartsAt the time of writing, Intuit is trading right there in that above range (~$73B). Anything above $76.5B ($277 per share after dilution) and I'd find myself turning more bearish on the stock, while anything below $67.5B ($244 per share after dilution) would have me ""Very Bullish.""Given that we see turmoil in the markets, I think we are getting to a point where entry into Intuit will be worthwhile for the long-term investor. I am bullish on the stock over the long term myself after the acquisition, but I do plan on waiting for the markets to settle a little before acquiring a position."
4295156,105096,2019-10-05T10:00:11-04:00,"Intuit's investor day yesterday provided further operational data and strategy details which add to our confidence in our Buy case.Customer retention has improved further, and QuickBooks Online growth has been strong, including in the highly contested U.K. market.Management also shared more details on how new products, including small business finance, have broadened customer pathways with Intuit.Intuit is set to continue its strong structural growth from resilient existingcustomers, large pools of new customers and cross-selling extra products.At $263.00, shares can deliver a low-teens annual return from EPSgrowth, stable multiples and a 0.8% dividend yield. We re-iterate Buy.","Intuit (INTU) is one of our favourite software stocks and we initiated our coverage on the company on Seeking Alpha with a Buy recommendation last month (see ""Intuit: Multi-Year Double-Digit Compounder""). The investor day held Thursday (03 Oct) provided more operational data and strategy details that add to our confidence in the Buy case, and we share the highlights below.Intuit management reiterated the guidance for FY20, which included a 10-11% year-on-year revenue growth, a 10-12% (non-GAAP) EBIT growth and an 11-13% (non-GAAP) EPS growth - reassuring given concerns around a slowdown in the U.S. economy and wider global trade tensions over the last few months:For the medium term, the company continues to expect double-digit organic revenue growth and for operating income dollars to grow faster than revenues. Management also disclosed they have now formulated ""bold"" financial and operational targets for 2025, although these are not disclosed.Intuit also shared operational data that showed both its Consumer and Small Business & Self Employed (""SBSE"") segments have either maintained or improved their customer retention rates in their online offerings.In the Consumer segment, the TurboTax Online flagship has improved its customer retention by 2% to 79% during FY19, after a similar 2% improvement during FY18;In the SBSE segment, QuickBooks Online has maintained its customer retention at 79%, despite strong growth in the self-employed market, which typically has lower retention (49% in FY18):A high retention rate is important in laying the foundation for cross-selling extra products to customers and for growing customer numbers overall. It also reflects Intuit products' continuing competitiveness against rival offerings.The investor day also provided a more detailed breakdown on the 33% year-on-year growth in QuickBooks Online subscribers during FY19, with U.S. subscribers growing 25% year-on-year, and total non-US subscribers growing 58%, including a 78% year-on-year growth in the U.K.:The strong growth in U.K. subscribers was helped by the U.K. government's ""Make My Tax Digital"" initiative. It is also particularly relevant because of the U.K.'s status as probably the most contested market between Intuit, incumbent Sage Group (OTC:SGGEF) and new disruptor Xero (OTCPK:XROLF). The U.K. is Sage's home market, and one of the first markets for Xero's international expansion; it is the second largest market by revenues for both companies.QuickBooks Online's strong growth in the U.K. shows its ability to out-compete both Sage and Xero. With another year of near-80% growth (it grew subscribers by 84% in FY18), its U.K. subscriber number has likely overtaken Xero's. (QuickBooks Online had 545k subscribers as of July; Xero had 463k as of March and, assuming it also continued its prior-year growth rate of 48%, would only have reached 510k subscribers in July.)Intuit cited one of the reasons behind its U.K. success as its status as the first product to be compliant with “Make My Tax Digital”, which is a sign of Intuit's superior R&D capabilities over competitors.The investor day also covered how Intuit’s suite of products (including third-party apps on its open platform) has helped broaden the pathways by which customers join the Intuit platform and purchase more products over time.Traditionally, QuickBooks customers have followed a path of buying accounting, payments and then payroll products:With more new products added, there are more pathways for customers to follow. Capital (i.e. small business finance) is an important cross-sell, and even customers who follow the traditional path of accounting, payments then payroll may start doing so earlier. In addition, products such as TSheets (employee scheduling) offer additional entry points onto the platform; 1.2m employees are on TSheets as of July, representing a growth of 60% year-on-year:Management also clarified its strategy towards third-party apps and its own apps on the Intuit platform. In general, Intuit would leave the choice to customers, allowing multiple apps (including its own) to be available. Development of its own apps will focus on its core competencies of payments, payroll, time-tracking and capital; ""everything else we partner on"".Capital was also highlighted as a top-3 priority among small businesses (as shown below); cashflow was mentioned as the #1 cause for business failure among them. This confirms the potential of QuickBooks Capital, Intuit’s small business finance offering, which has made $441m worth of loans in the less than 2 years since it launched.Since our Buy recommendation on 17 Sep, Intuit's share price has fallen 1.7% amid a wider market correction, but outperforming the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ over the same period:At $263.00, Intuit shares are trading on 38.4x P/E and a 2.6% FCF Yield; dividend yield is 0.8% (the annualised dividend is $2.12):As explained in our last article, Intuit’s high valuation multiples are justified by its sustainable low-teens EPS growth and its resilience during downturns.Further operational data and strategy details from Intuit's investor day adds to our confidence on our Buy case.We expect Intuit to continue its strong structural growth from a resilient existing customer base, large pools of new customers, and cross-selling extra products. We expect Intuit to deliver a low-teens annual return from a low-teens EPS growth, stable multiples and a 0.8% dividend yield.We re-iterate our Buy recommendation.Note: A track record of my past recommendations can be found here (updated)."
4292239,105096,2019-09-18T10:34:12-04:00,"Intuit is a high-quality asset with strong structural growth from a resilient existing customer base, large pool of new customers and cross-selling.Its Small Business & Self-Employed segment is growing revenues 10-15%+, thanks to still-low software penetration and cross-selling.Its Consumer segment is growing revenues at 8-12%, thanks to resilient U.S. returns volume, market share gains, and positive product/price mix.Intuit can deliver a sustainable low-teens EPS growth, which along with its resilience during downturns justify its current valuation.At $268.54, shares can deliver a low-teens return from low-teens EPS growth, stable multiples, and 0.8% dividend yield. We recommend Buy.","Intuit (INTU) is a global provider of accounting and tax software to consumers, small businesses and accounting firms. It operates 3 segments:SBSE and Consumer generate 43% and 48% of segmental EBIT respectively:SBSE operates in the U.S & Canada, the U.K., Australia, France, etc., while the other segments operate in North America only.Intuit's revenues are highly recurring, with about ½ of its revenues from online subscriptions, and additional revenues in desktop subscriptions. The ""services & other"" revenues above consist largely of subscriptions, payroll services, payment services, and other recurring revenues, etc.Intuit competitors include Sage (OTC:SGGEF), Xero (OTCPK:XROLF), as well as private-equity-owned companies such as Visma, Iris, and MYOB.Intuit long-term targets include double-digits annual organic revenue growth and a stable/rising operating margin. This includes revenue growth of 10-15%+ for SBSE and 8-12% for Consumer, as shown below:Intuit has many competitive advantages that power its growth and give us confidence that it will deliver on its financial targets.One key advantage is the ""One Intuit Ecosystem"" it has operated since 2017:As an open platform, it allows third-parties (including as payment and payroll operators) to add their apps to serve Intuit's customers, increasing the range of services available and creating a strong ""network effect"". The platform also allows data to flow easily, for example between business accounts and tax returns for the self-employed, encouraging customers to use it for all their needs. The wealth of data, when combined with Artificial Intelligence (""AI"") and Machine Learning, enables Intuit to provide an improved, personalised user experience - for example, AI can help one user detect error entries in his/her work based on how other users have completed their entries. The data also allows Intuit to offer customers additional services, such as consumer finance referrals. All of these ensure a high customer retention rates for Intuit and raise the barrier to entry for new competitors.Other Intuit advantages include its brand, superior products after years of R&D spend, and customers' technical familiarity with its products (implying high switching costs in learning time if they decide to switch to a new one). An example of Intuit's lead is how QuickBooks Online enjoys high Net Promoter Score in all its established markets, and leads its rivals in all but one:The exception is Australia, the home market for upstart Xero, which Intuit only entered in 2013; its experience competing there has helped it maintain its lead over Xero in its core markets in the U.S. and the U.K.We review each segment to demonstrate its growth potential below, starting with SBSE. For both SBSE and Consumer, there is a resilient existing customer base, large pools of new customers, and the potential to cross-sell products.SBSE's existing customer base is resilient, with QuickBooks Online (""QBO"") having a total retention rate of close to 80%; excluding the self-employed, retention rate is even higher, at 82%.SBSE has large pools of potential new customers because the use of accounting software remains low among small businesses, even in Intuit's U.S. home market. As shown below, QBO had 2.6m subscribers in the U.S at the end of FY18 (3.2m at FY19), a small fraction of the Serviceable Addressable Market (""SAM"") of 48m. QBO penetration is even lower in non-U.S. markets, owing to their software adoption rates being lower than the U.S.:The list of countries also shows Intuit's ability to enter new geographies. While the U.S., the U.K. and Canada are historic markets, and Australia also was relatively established (2013 launch), France, Brazil and India are relatively new geographies that Intuit only entered in earnest after FY17. QBO subscriber growth rates are high in all these countries, showing Intuit's success.SBSE has also continued to tap into new customer segments, for example recently entering the mid-market segment (10-100 employees) with the QuickBooks Advanced product:Intuit's success in tapping into its large pools of new customers is evident in QuickBooks customer statistics. Since FY17, total QuickBooks customers have grown at a CAGR of +25.6%, including +38.0% for QBO; within QBO, customers have grown at CAGR of +30.5% in the U.S. home market:Cross-selling represents a large source of future growth as well. Management believes a typical QBO customer's revenue will be more than 3x higher if he/she adds payments and payroll services to the accounting product. Non-accounting revenues used to be 3x that of accounting revenues prior to FY15, but has dropped to 1x in recent years due to the fast growth in QBO:The large number of new QBO customers who have not yet added payments and payroll services implies significant revenue growth in future years. Online Ecosystem revenues, which include both accounting and non-accounting services, is expected to continue growing at 30%+ annually.In addition to payments and payroll, Intuit has also added new services like QuickBook Capital, which has made $441m in loans cumulative to SBSE customers in the less than 2 years since its launch.Since the new strategy in FY17, SBSE has delivered revenue growth above the high end of the 10-15%+ target; segment EBIT margin has also been rising slightly, from 43.3% in FY18 to 43.8% in FY19 (as shown below). We expect SBSE revenue growth to continue on target and its margins to remain stable.Like SBSE, the existing customer base in Consumer is resilient, with retention rate at above 70% in TurboTax Online. Price/mix benefit continues to help grow revenue, with average revenue per return CAGR of 3.2% in 2007-17:The pool of new customers, while not as large as that for SBSE, is also substantial. The total number of IRS returns continues to grow at a CAGR of about 0.6% each year, from population growth. Intuit is gaining customers through the growth of the DIY segment, and its own market share gains, mostly at the expense of tax stores and manual filers. In addition, Intuit has also started to expand beyond its traditional DIY market, into the Assisted market where filing involves a CPA or other credentialed tax professionals, with the 2017 launch of TurboTax Live to link up consumers with experts:The expansion of Intuit into Assisted filings, which have a much higher revenue per return than DIY ones, helped increase Consumer's average revenue per return by 11.5% in FY18 (as shown above).Consumer has cross-selling potential with SBSE, as the self-employed need both accounting and tax software. Intuit has also experimented with cross-selling new products, such as referrals of consumer finance and mortgages, using data that 23m TurboTax consumers who have agreed to take part.Since the new strategy in FY17, Consumer has delivered revenue growth in the upper half of its 8-12% target; segment EBIT margin has been broadly consistent at around 63%:Management believes Consumer can generate annual revenue growth of 0-2% from the rising number of returns, 3-5% from the growth of the DIY category, 1-2% from Intuit's own market share gain, and 3%+ from the growth in average return per return. We expect these targets to be achieved.Strategic Partner was only 8.8% of total segment EBIT in FY19 and is more focused on supporting SBSE's small business ecosystem through serving accountants who do business there. The segment has maintained low-to-mid-single digits revenue growth (including 4% in both FY18 and FY19), and stable or rising margins (including rising margin since FY17, thanks to cost control):With strong performance in both SBSE and Consumer, group P&L has achieved double-digits revenue growth and stable margins since FY17:Long-term targets of double-digits revenue growth and stable/rising operating margins imply double-digits EPS growth, before any buybacks.FY20 guidance are for 10-11% revenue growth, 10-12% (non-GAAP) EBIT growth, 11-13% (non-GAAP) EPS growth, in line with long-term targets:At $268.54, shares are on 39.2x P/E & 2.6% Free Cash Flow (""FCF"") Yield; dividend yield is 0.8% ($2.12 per share, annualising the latest dividend):Intuit has historically returned substantially all of its FCF in dividends and share buybacks, which totalled $9.3bn in FY13-19, as shown below:Buybacks beyond offsetting share-based compensation are limited by a ""grid"" where their returns have to exceed Intuit's Weighted Cost of Capital. Since FY17, management has only bought back enough shares to keep the share count roughly the same, while net cash has risen from $41m to $1.68bn.Intuit's premium valuation is justified by its sustainable low-teens EPS growth and resilience during downturns. Approx. 75% of revenues each year come from existing or returning customers and, during the 2008-9 crisis, revenue and EBIT continued to grow, as did EPS (excluding an one-off disposal gain):Intuit has strong structural growth from a resilient existing customer base, large pools of potential new customers and cross-selling extra products.Both its SBSE and Consumer segments have delivered on their revenue growth targets while on stable margins, and we believe they will continue to do so.At $268.54, Intuit shares are on 39.2x P/E and 2.6% FCF Yield; dividend yield is 0.8%. Its premium valuation is justified by its sustainable low-teens EPS growth and demonstrable resilience during downturns.We expect Intuit shares to deliver low-teens annual return over multiple years from a low-teens EPS growth, stable valuation multiples (which mean the share price also grows in low-teens) and its 0.8% dividend yield.We recommend Buy.Note: A track record of my past recommendations can be found here (updated)."
4290072,95006,2019-09-05T23:24:55-04:00,"This analysis of Intuit stock uses a 10-year time frame and assumes a recession will occur at some point over that period.It projects expected returns from sentiment reversion-to-mean and business/shareholder yield based on the last economic cycle.It offers a buy, sell, hold suggestion and shares a strategy to take advantage of Intuit's current sentiment cycle.","(Source)Traditionally, most of my analysis on Seeking Alpha has focused on how to avoid losses and how to profit from the price cycles of classic cyclical stocks. There is another group of stocks, however, whose stock prices and earnings fluctuate far less than the classic cyclical stocks I have traditionally written about. While these stocks aren't as cyclical as a ""classic cyclical,"" they can still be subject to large swings in sentiment and can go through what I call ""sentiment cycles."" Recently, I have been adopting some of the techniques I've used with classic cyclicals and applying them to sentiment-driven cyclicals. Today's stock is one of those.One of the major assumptions I make for both approaches is that history is the most reliable guide to the future. My experience has been that 80% of the time, even if we looked at nothing else, a stock will behave in a similar manner as it did the previous cycle or two unless there is a disruption to its core business. For this reason, I don't rely much on predictions of future earnings or sentiment that aren't supported by their existence during past cycles. That doesn't mean that ""this time is different"" isn't true sometimes - it just means that my analysis isn't counting on this time being much different. That said, if I think a stock is currently a ""Buy"" based on my 10-year, full-cycle analysis, before I invest I will examine the forward-looking trends and narratives more carefully to make sure there aren't major changes in the works that could affect the business.The main differences you'll find between my analysis and others' is that: 1) I focus on a clear 10-year time frame and the compound annual growth rate (aka CAGR) one might expect over that period of time; 2) I assume we will experience a recession during that time period, and I build that into the expected returns; 3) I try to calculate the expected returns based on a full business cycle; 4) I usually share both a basic shareholder return estimate and a more conservative shareholder return estimate, where I lower expected returns for companies with higher debt levels and raise them for companies with higher cash levels; and 5) I usually provide an ""opportunity risk/reward analysis"" if a stock is a ""Sell"" so that we can get an idea of how likely it is that the stock will trade low enough to become a ""Buy"" again over the next few years.As part of the analysis, I calculate what I consider to be the two main drivers of future total returns: Market Sentiment returns and Business/Shareholder returns. (Within the Business/Shareholder return category, I further break down where the future expected returns will likely come from: dividends, buybacks, business reinvestment, and earnings growth. This can help paint a clearer picture for investors who prefer to get their expected future earnings from one category or another.) I then combine the CAGR estimates from Market Sentiment and Business/Shareholder returns together to get an expected 10-year, full-cycle CAGR estimate. Currently, I consider an expected 10-year CAGR > 12% a ""Buy,"" 4-12% a ""Hold"" and < 4% a ""Sell.""With that, let's get into the analysis.Since I use different approaches for analyzing a stock based on how cyclical earnings are, historical earnings cyclicality is the first thing I like to examine. Let's take a look at Intuit's (INTU) historical earnings using a F.A.S.T. Graph, which is a great tool for this sort of analysis:I break down earnings cyclicality into five basic categories. The first category I call ""secular growth."" This category describes earnings that continue to rise every year even during economic recessions. The next three categories are ""low,"" ""moderate"" and ""deep."" ""Low"" is usually for businesses which have earnings that have a history of declining in the single digits percentage-wise during downturns but not much further than that. ""Deep"" I consider earnings that fall more than -50%, and ""moderate"" somewhere in between low and deep. And last but not least are businesses whose earnings go negative during cyclical downturns but recover soon after that, which I call ""highly cyclical."" For businesses that have earnings in the deep or highly cyclical categories, I use an entirely different type of analysis, so it's important to determine at the outset which category a stock falls into.Over this entire 20-year period, Intuit has only had one year of EPS declines. That year was 2014/2015, when EPS declined -26%. That is kind of an odd year to have such a decline. I suspect it could be M&A-related, as the company did make an acquisition in August 2014. Overall, though, in terms of the business's historical earnings cyclicality, I would categorize it as ""Low,"" and on a scale of 1-8, I would rate its earnings cyclicality a ""2.""For stocks in the ""Low"" category, their price cycles are not usually explained by earnings fluctuations as much as they are explained by changes in market sentiment. In Intuit's case, with EPS this stable, it is appropriate to use a 10-year, full-cycle analysis rather than the shorter-term, price cycle-based analysis that I use for stocks with highly cyclical earnings. So, using a 10-year, full-cycle analysis is what I will do.In order to estimate what sort of returns we might expect over the next 10 years, let's begin by examining what return I could expect 10 years from now if the P/E multiple were to revert to its mean from the previous economic cycle. In order to estimate that, I'm going to shorten the time frame of the F.A.S.T. Graph so it starts about 2007, a little before the last cyclical peak.Intuit's current blended P/E is 41.64, while its normal P/E this past cycle has been 25.40. If, over the course of the next 10 years, the P/E were to revert to 25.40 and everything else was held equal, it would produce a 10-year CAGR of about -4.82%.There are four components to the business/shareholder yield: the dividend yield, the expected buyback yield, the portion of the earnings yield that the business keeps to reinvest itself, and the full-cycle earnings growth rate. Ultimately, the business/shareholder yield is going to be limited by the earnings yield or the FCFE/EV yield. So, let's take a look at those:Data by YChartsIntuit's basic forward earnings yield is 2.67%.Since I'm using historical EPS estimates from the F.A.S.T. Graphs for many of my calculations, I like to have a way to quickly check to see if a business is taking on debt (or already taken on debt) as a way to prop up those EPS numbers (often through stock buybacks). I like to look at free cash flow to equity/enterprise value yield in order to highlight potential problems. Looking at the longer-term chart typically also will show events like acquisitions, because there will often be a downward spike in the FCFE/EV yield. I tend to avoid stocks that have made bigger acquisitions or mergers and stocks that are borrowing money to buy back shares. So this is a good, quick check for me to know whether I need to dig deeper or not.Data by YChartsAs of the end of last quarter, Intuit's FCFE/EV yield is +3.10%. That's actually better than the earnings yield. This is a good sign in terms of the quality of the company. It typically means the company has low debt and higher cash. So no red flags are showing up here, and I'll even give Intuit a higher expected 10-year return expectation based on its FCFE/EV yield along with using the basic earnings yield.Currently, Intuit's dividend yield is about +0.75%.Now let's see how much is being used for buybacks. This serves two purposes. The first is, much like the dividends, we want to know as investors how our money is being allocated. If the stock price of the business is low, then buybacks are a very efficient way of returning money to shareholders, especially if they are paid for with earnings instead of borrowed money. If the stock price is high, then buybacks are not a wise use of funds, because the returns might be lower than an investor might be able to get if they received a dividend and invested in something else or if the business invested in itself. And the worst case is when a business is borrowing money to buy back expensive shares. Businesses that do this are to be avoided. It's a flashing warning sign that management's interests are not aligned with shareholders.Second, since I use long-term EPS trends in order to estimate earnings growth, I want to know how much stock was repurchased over the last cycle so that I can back out those stock repurchases when making my earnings growth estimates.Data by YChartsIntuit has reduced the number of shares outstanding by -24.08% this past cycle. I will back these share buybacks out of EPS estimates later in the analysis, but first I want to estimate how much shareholder yield we might expect from buybacks based on the most recent trends of 3 years and 1 year.Data by YChartsData by YChartsWhile Intuit has bought back shares in the past, that trend has not been in place the past few years. Given how high the share price has been trading over this time period, the fact that the company stopped its buybacks is a good sign that management is allocating capital wisely. However, it does mean that I'm not going to expect much in the way of a buyback yield going forward.So, at its current price, Intuit is earning +2.67% and paying out +0.75% to shareholders all via the dividend, and there is 1.92% remaining for the company to invest in its business. Including the more optimistic FCFE/EV yield limits the long-term yield expectation to 3.10%, which means right now we can expect a business/shareholder yield range of +2.67% to +3.10%.Since I am interested in how much money Intuit might be earning over the next 10 years, I also want to take into account any additional earnings from earnings growth that might occur over this time period. I'll estimate that by looking at the previous cycle which runs about 13 years from 2007 to 2020, and I'll remove the effects of stock buybacks. When I do the math on that, I get a cyclically adjusted earnings growth rate of +13.39%, which is very good.Now, what I want to do is apply that growth rate to current earnings looking forward 10 years to get a final 10-year CAGR estimate. The way I think about this is, if I bought Intuit's whole business for $100, it would pay me back $2.67-3.10 per year, and that amount would grow at 13.39% per year for 10 years. I want to know how much money I would have in total at the end of 10 years on my $100 investment, which I calculate to be about $156.89-166.07, and that translates to a +4.61% to+5.20% 10-year CAGR.Potential future returns can come from two main places: market sentiment or business/shareholder returns. If we assume that market sentiment reverts to mean from the last cycle over the next 10 years, Intuit will produce a -4.82% CAGR. If the business/shareholder yield and growth are similar to the last cycle, Intuit should produce a +4.61% to +5.20% 10-year CAGR. If we put the two together, we get an expected full-cycle, 10-year CAGR of -0.21% to +0.38%. This range falls entirely below the 4% threshold I use for a Sell rating, so Intuit is currently a ""Sell.""Since I think Intuit is a good business and that it is simply priced too high, it's worth looking at the odds of the price falling to a level where we could buy it back if we sell, versus what we might miss out on by rotating out of the stock at today's prices.The first step of this process is to see during how many years in the past 20 did Intuit trade below its long-term average P/E of 25.40. At some point during each year in 11 out of the past 20, you would have had a chance to rotate into the stock below its average P/E. The last opportunity would have been in 2014. So, it doesn't seem unreasonable to me to think that during the next economic slowdown, Intuit's P/E will fall at least to that level (during the Great Recession, the P/E fell below 14). If the company's P/E contracts from its current multiple of 41.64 to 25.40 while earnings are held steady, the price would drop about -39%.In order to estimate the opportunity risk/reward, I use F.A.S.T. Graphs' forecasting tool to estimate future price appreciation, including dividends, for the next 2-3 years using analysts' estimates. Then, I assume we will have an economic slowdown after that point. What I want to know is if a recession begins in 2-3 years, whether I will have a reasonable chance to buy Intuit at a significantly lower price than it trades today or if I would likely never get a chance at a lower price.Forecasting out toward the middle of 2022, including dividends, we can expect to add $115.59 to Intuit's current price. That gives us a price 2.5 years from now of $399.79 using today's 41.64 P/E ratio. If the stock price at that point reverts to its mean, it would lose about -39% of its value and produce a price of $243.87. That is significantly lower than today's price, so there doesn't seem to be much opportunity risk in selling at today's price if we experience an economic slowdown within the next 2-3 years. Obviously, if an economic slowdown were to occur sooner than that, the stock would fall much lower before reaching its mean P/E.I am currently writing a series about high-quality businesses that are overvalued, like Intuit. You can read about the strategy in these three articles: Part 1 ""Ignore Sentiment Cycles At Your Own Risk,"" Part 2 ""Mitigating Sentiment Cycles"" and Part 3 ""Sentiment Cycles: When To Sell And When To Buy Back Again.""My current suggestion is that owners of Intuit who would like to avoid part of the eventual correction in the stock rotate out of it and into a 50/50 mix of the Invesco S&P 500 Low Volatility ETF (SPLV) and the Invesco S&P MidCap Low Volatility ETF (XMLV) until Intuit's price falls to a more reasonable level that offers better forward returns. My expectation is that owners would be able to increase the number of Intuit shares they own by 20-25% using this strategy without spending any additional money.

The slightly disappointing FQ1 results further reinforces that the stock isn't worth the premium valuation. The only reason the stock gained following my negative thesis last year was unsustainable multiple expansion.Image Source: Intuit logoFor FQ1, Intuit beat analyst estimates with revenues growing about 15%. The major hiccup here was very weak guidance for FQ2 with EPS guidance of ~$1.00 that was way below consensus up at $1.16. The issue related to more marketing spend prior to tax season on the company's new online and live services.The quarter ending in January is the second most important quarter of the year for Intuit, but investors do need to keep perspective that the quarter ending in April along with the prime tax season typically account for 80% of the annual income.What really matters is the updated FY20 guidance:This is where investors need far more from the financial software company. Intuit kept EPS guidance in line with previous numbers of $7.50-7.60, with analysts up at $7.57. Now, the company has to generate an additional $0.15 from the big quarter in order to even match their estimates.Intuit is making a smart move into accounting and online services, but these offerings have lower margins. Currently, the Services category has 68% gross margins, while Product revenues are virtually all gross profits. Growth via lower gross margins isn't the ideal path for stock gains.Investors need to grasp that Intuit only forecasts revenue, operating income and EPS growth in the 10-13% range after guiding down for FQ2. The stock trades above $260 with an EPS target for this year of only $7.50.Even using the FY21 EPS target of ~$8.50, the stock trades at ~31.5x those analyst estimates. My analysis last year pegged the forward P/E ratio at 28.6x analyst estimates, and the multiple rose over 10% during the year.Data by YChartsInvestors have no reason to doubt those FY20 estimates or whether Intuit will keep growing revenues at clips above 10+%. The question is why one should invest in a stock valued at a PEG ratio of nearly 3.The stock has been very expensive for years. My previous research was complaining about an even lower forward P/E ratio, and Intuit did nothing special this year to warrant outsized stock gains.The problem here is that the company could slightly rein in growth targets and the stock could suddenly collapse 50% and trade at a 15 forward P/E multiple. The market wouldn't suddenly see the stock as a bargain down at $130, and this is the ultimate problem for investors.Even the company itself doesn't the stock as a bargain since the surge into 2018. Intuit has consistently spent far less on stock buybacks as the stock soared above $150. A dip in the stock might actually provide another opportunity like buying the stock at $100 back around 2016.Data by YChartsPart of the problem with stock buybacks is the general lack of cash with only a net cash balance of $2 billion. For a stock with a $67 billion market cap, Intuit doesn't have the cash to warrant the current valuation.The key investor takeaway is that Intuit is far too expensive considering the expensive valuation, limited cash and minimal 10% growth rates. The recommendation is that investors should avoid the stock until the valuation gets more reasonable."
4291889,104952,2019-09-16T15:37:03-04:00,"For a company with ~$70 billion market cap, Intuit has done a great job in growing its business. Every year since FY'17, Intuit has posted double-digit TTM revenue growth.Intuit's strong market positioning has separated itself from its competitors. Its closest possible competitor clocked in a revenue of $2.2 billion in FY'18, merely a third of Intuit's FY'18 revenue.Intuit today is more than just a software company. Its recent offering in small business financing and payroll solution has become its growth engine for the last few years.","In the last Q4 2019 earnings call, we saw how Intuit (INTU) has again had a great quarter where it exceeded expectations in terms of revenue and EPS. Revenue grew by 15% YoY, followed by EPS beat by $0.05. Historically, Intuit has been a dominant player in the financial software market. In the last decade alone, it has consistently ended every fiscal year with a double-digit net profit margin and revenue growth rate. In its most recent fiscal year in FY 2018, Intuit recorded annual revenue of $6.78 billion, which was a 12.4% growth YoY. For long-term investors looking to get an exposure to the small business finance software market, we believe that Intuit provides the best investment opportunity today. When evaluating Intuit, we pay close attention to the competitive landscape, in which its main focus on the small business customers in the US and Canada has left itself with virtually no close competition. As a result, Intuit today has grown to be more than just a software company. Since 2017, Intuit has been in the small business financing and payroll solutions, which are growth drivers of the business today. Before we dive deeper into Intuit’s competitive landscape, it is critical to review how Intuit makes money. Intuit has three main business segments. It generates over 90% of its revenue through QuickBooks and TurboTax products/services. Intuit reports these revenues under its two largest segments: the Small Business & Self-Employed (NYSE:SBE) and the Consumer. SBE is its largest segment, which is where Intuit recognizes all of its revenue from QuickBooks and other merchant-related services across financing, payroll, and payment processing solutions. Its smallest segment, Strategic Partner, makes up less than 10% of overall revenue.(Source: Intuit’s 10-K)All of the revenue generated from TurboTax, its well-renowned tax filing and preparation software, is recognized under its second-largest segment, the Consumer. As stated in its 10-Q, the revenue in this segment tends to be more seasonal, given the relatively higher demand for the services during the US federal and income tax filing and reporting season from November through April.(Source: Intuit’s 10-Q. Revenue of its two-largest segments)While its desktop-based solution (Product) has contributed to most of Intuit QuickBooks and TurboTax growth in the past, most of its growth today comes from the cloud-based subscription fees (Service and other). As of Q4 2019, we saw that its SBE segment has grown faster at 38% YoY, driven by QuickBooks’ 42% YoY growth in revenue. Its Consumer segment, in the meantime, has only increased by about 11% YoY.Within the small business financial and tax preparation software market in the US and Canada, Intuit is the de-facto market leader. Such a strong market positioning has allowed Intuit to post strong financial performance every year. When we examine its competitive landscape further, it appears that there is not a close competitor. (Source: G2Crowd. Competitive landscape of Intuit QuickBooks and TurboTax)When it comes to its two flagship products, QuickBooks and TurboTax, we found that the closest possible competitors to either of them are too different in terms of overall business strategy or size. Sage Group (OTC:SGGEF), for instance, which our source considers as the QuickBooks’ closest and largest competitor, focuses more on building a localized offering to fit its global expansion strategy rather than on building a solution for the US and Canada market like QuickBooks. Sage Group also only recorded annual revenue of GBP 1.86 billion in FY 2018, which is roughly equivalent to $2.2 billion. As a comparison, that figure is only a third of Intuit’s revenue in FY 2018. TurboTax, on the other hand, is considered to closely compete with CCH, which is a privately-held company targeting a niche segment. CCH focuses on developing a tax preparation and filing software targeted towards professionals, while TurboTax focuses on developing a product for the mass market. Having achieved considerable successes with QuickBooks and TurboTax, Intuit has also ventured into small business financing and payment processing businesses later on. In that sense, Intuit’s overall approach is not only to provide software tools for its core small business users but also to empower them to grow. This strategy is proven to boost its growth in the SBE segment. In the Q4 earnings call, Sasan Goodarzi provided a bit of an overview on Intuit's approach: With almost three times as much YoY growth rate than the Consumer segment today, we believe that the SBE segment’s revenue will surpass the Consumer’s in FY 2020. At the moment, SBE’s 2019 YTD Revenue is $2.6 billion, which is about $100 million lower than Consumer segment YTD revenue.(Source: stockrow. Intuit’s profitability metrics)Furthermore, an overall solid execution in product strategy has also allowed Intuit to maintain a consistent profit level over the years. Apart from a one-time drop in 2015, Intuit’s trailing annual operating margin has always been within 25% to 30% range. In terms of valuation metrics, Intuit trades at a premium compared to its peers, though we have not seen a lot of pure-play competitors in the market. Taking Sage Group as the closest possible competitor in the small business segment, for instance, we found that its TTM P/E of 23.38 is almost half as much as Intuit’s TTM P/E of 48.86.(Source: seeking alpha. Sage Group’s vs Intuit’s growth metrics)Despite its premium valuation, Intuit has always delivered on the growth expectations. From the top-line and bottom-line growth perspectives, Intuit has a much more promising outlook. Intuit grew its revenue by 12.6% YoY, while Sage Group only did so by 7.33% YoY. When we examine its bottom-line growth metrics such as EBIT or Levered FCF growth rate, we found that Intuit is even much further ahead compared to its peers. Intuit grew its EBIT by almost 19% YoY and grew its Levered FCF by 40.75%, which means overall, Intuit grew at least twice as fast than its peers.With no comparable pure-play competitors, it is a bit challenging to value Intuit. In most cases, Intuit appears overvalued most likely due to it being in more diversified business. As we discussed earlier, Intuit’s SBE segment now includes payroll and small business financing in addition to its traditional accounting and tax software businesses. With SBE segment growing the fastest among all of the other segments, Intuit has recently found itself to be more than just a software company. We believe that all these factors combined justify Intuit’s premium valuation.Our thesis highlights Intuit’s track record in building a very valuable business that sets it apart from its competitors. As a company with over $70 billion market cap, Intuit has done a great job to boost its growth. Through its solid product expansion strategy, Intuit has been able to achieve a double-digit growth rate and profit margin every year over the last decade. In conclusion, looking at where Intuit is at the moment, we think that it would be difficult for any competitor to challenge its position as the market leader."
4287212,20715,2019-08-21T17:19:38-04:00,Intuit is expected to report a loss when it reveals fourth quarter results on Thursday.The stock has been trending higher for over three years with just a few pullbacks.Sentiment towards the stock is slightly more bearish than most stocks and it has also been moving to a more pessimistic view.,"Application software company Intuit (INTU) is expected to report earnings after the closing bell on Thursday. Analysts expect the maker of TurboTax and Quickbooks to report a loss of $0.14 per share for the fiscal fourth quarter. The company is expected to report revenue of $961.89 million. The company reported earnings of $0.32 per share in the same period one year ago on revenue of $988 million.The company has seen earnings grow by 24% per year over the last three years while sales have grown at a rate of 14% per year. In the third quarter, the company saw earnings grow by 16% while sales increased by 12%. Analysts expect earnings for 2019 as a whole to show growth of 16% on a revenue increase of 13.2%.The management efficiency measurements for Intuit are incredibly strong with a return on equity of 81.5% and a profit margin of 36.3%, at least according to Investor's Business Daily. Because the numbers were so high, I also checked the Wall Street Journal and it has those figures at 65.32% and 20.31%, respectively. Even with the lower figures from the Journal, the figures are still very impressive.There are a couple of factors that account for the expected decline in earnings. First, the fiscal fourth quarter is traditionally slow for Intuit as it comes right after the tax season ends during the fiscal third quarter. Secondly, the company acquired Origami Logic during the quarter and there could be some acquisition costs associated with the transaction.The weekly chart for Intuit shows a persistent climb for the stock over the last few years with very few major pullbacks. The only time the stock has pulled back below its 52-week moving average was in the fourth quarter when the stock closed below the trend line for one week.We see that there was a minor pullback in the second quarter of this year, but that didn't bring the stock down to the long-term moving averages. It did bring the overbought/oversold indicators down out of the overbought territory, but not down to oversold territory.Looking at the 10-week RSI, the indicator hasn't been in the oversold territory in the last three and a half years. The reading just below the 40-level in December was the lowest reading for the indicator going back to August 2015.Both the RSI and the weekly stochastic readings were in overbought territory toward the beginning of July, but the increased volatility in the overall market and the little slip for Intuit brought the indicators down slightly. I wouldn't mind seeing them a little lower before possibly jumping into a bullish position.Turning our attention toward the sentiment indicators, we see a slight skew to the pessimistic side. There are 23 analysts following the stock with 12 ""buy"" ratings, eight ""hold"" ratings, and three ""sell"" ratings. This puts the overall buy percentage at 52.2% and that is below the average buy percentage in the 65% to 75% range. There haven't been any changes in the analysts' ratings in the last three months.The short interest ratio is at 3.39 and that is a little higher than the average stock. What may be more important than the actual reading is the trend in the ratio. At the end of April, the ratio was only 1.3 and it has increased steadily over the last few months. We also see that the ratio is getting higher as the result of the short interest increasing as the average daily trading volume has been declining. While this change is indicative of increasing pessimism, if the increase in the ratio had been due to a big increase in short interest while the trading volume was constant, that would have been a stronger indication of increased pessimism.I was a little surprised when I checked the put/call ratio. The ratio is right at 1.0 with 17,513 puts open at this time and 17,523 calls open. The ratio wasn't the surprising part, the low open interest was what surprised me. The total open interest is only 35,036, and I expected it to be much higher. Looking back at May 23 when the company last reported earnings, the ratio was only 0.56, so option traders have become more bearish in the last three months. I also took note that the overall open interest was 45,773 before the last earnings report.Overall, I think the sentiment is slightly more bearish for Intuit compared to other companies and it is slightly more bearish compared to the last earnings report. The short interest ratio is higher and the put/call ratio is almost twice as high.As a long-term investment, I like Intuit. The company has solid fundamental statistics, the overall trend is higher, and there is some skepticism toward the company. Those circumstances are usually good for a stock over the long term.There are some concerns for the stock with the biggest one being the expected drop in earnings on a year over year basis. The overall 2019 results are still expected to show a solid growth rate, so that takes away a little bit of that concern.A second concern is the proximity to overbought territory for the RSI and the weekly stochastic readings. As I mentioned before, the 10-week RSI hardly ever gets to oversold territory, but I wouldn't mind seeing it below the 50-level before buying the stock.I like the fact that the sentiment indicators are showing some skepticism toward the stock, and I like that the pessimism seems to be growing. This usually indicates that the expectations are low for the earnings report.Intuit has a habit of beating earnings estimates, and it has done so in each of the last five reports. The stock has tended to respond positively after the earnings reports with the exception being back in November. Of course, the market was extremely volatile back in the fourth quarter and that may have had an impact. The initial reaction was to the upside, but once the calendar rolled over to December, the stock slid with the rest of the market.While I like Intuit, I won't be buying it ahead of the earnings report. I think the risk is greater than the reward ahead of the report. If the company beats forecast and maintains or boosts its outlook for fiscal 2020, the stock should move higher for several weeks and maybe longer. There is enough skepticism toward the stock that it will take a little time for it to shift."

The Street was expecting revenues of $7.42 billion for the year with an EPS of $7.55.Intuit continues to drive growth by expanding its product offerings. Earlier this year, it launched a service for next business day payments, saving the usual waiting period of 3-5 days. Within Payroll, it introduced next-day and same-day direct deposits that will allow customers to hold on to their money for longer and manage their cash flow better. The move has helped QuickBooks Online payroll service grow.For the year, the payroll service revenue grew more than 35%. It is also seeing an increased adoption of its full-service payroll offering, which is growing more than 35 points faster that its self-service offering. The full-service payroll offering provides added support for its customers.Within the time tracking service, it improved the mobile capability of the service and added new features, such as GPS time tracking to increase accuracy and flexibility for both employees and employers. Time tracking on its platform grew by more than 60% during the year to over 1 million employees.Intuit remains focused on AI and is integrating AI capabilities into its financial software. During the year, it personalized the tax preparation process for its Turbo Tax offerings using AI. Besides customization, the service is helping customers get higher tax refunds. It uses AI to help customers get their maximum refund by recommending whether to go through the time-intensive itemized deduction process or not.For those who do itemize, TurboTax uses data analysis and ML to identify and recommend deductions. Ultimately, Intuit wants to be able to power its engine so that every time a business files its return, the software evaluates the deductions used by its virtual peers to recommend appropriate approaches for the taxes. It wants to build a platform where users can just say yes or no verbally to the software's suggestions.The market is pleased with Intuit's product focus. Its stock is trading at $283.29 with a market cap of $73.48 billion. It had soared to a record high of $295.77 earlier last month. Like other technology stocks, it too had fallen to a 52-week low of $182.61 in December last year.Editor's Note: The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors."
4266770,105186,2019-05-28T10:58:10-04:00,"Intuit's business is essentially a 50/50 split between tax software and business management software.Operating losses during non-tax quarters shows Intuit is highly dependent on tax-filing for profits.Intuit's valuation compared to tax related peers is absurd.No valuation metric makes sense, Intuit is a sell.","Intuit (INTU) is significantly overvalued. Intuit has an extremely seasonal business. Intuit's valuation compared to other tax businesses such as H&R Block (HRB) and Blucora (BCOR) must be taken into consideration. Intuit's tax business makes up half its revenue and all of its profits. Intuit loses money in quarters where tax-filing related revenue is nonexistent. This is due to relatively constant operating expenses throughout the year despite huge fluctuations in revenue.Intuit derives about half of its revenue from tax filings. By deducing the companies segments and seasonal revenue distribution we can come to this conclusion. Intuit has 3 reportable segments. This includes Small Business & Self Employed, Consumer, and Strategic Partner. The revenue breakdown for fiscal 2018 was 50%, 42%, and 8% respectively. The consumer segment consists of Turbotax, Mint, and Turbo. Mint and Turbo are both free for consumers, so we can reason this revenue is mostly generated from TurboTax. We can also reason most of the Strategic Partner segment is tax related based on description in the company's annual report.The company takes operating losses for Q1 and Q4, the quarters from July to February. Selling and marketing expense is the only variable operating expense. The other expenses are fairly consistent. The company's operating margin has improved throughout the company's tax-less quarter. This improved efficiency is not enough to validate the extreme valuation. The company is heavily dependent on tax season to deliver profit. For this reason it's important to compare Intuit to other tax filing services.Owning Intuit shares at the current valuation is insanity. The fundamentals are so far behind the valuation. The stock has more or less trended upwards since the bottom of the recession, this strength could cause the stock to continue higher, but investors would knowingly be owning a significantly overvalued asset.Data by YChartsSource: IBIS WorldIntuit's tax business faces intense competition. The above chart shows the stagnation of revenue growth in the tax preparation industry. This figure shows the market is consistent at around 11 billion dollars. We can make a reasonable assumption that tax filing related revenue is half of Intuit's business, equating to about 3 billion dollars. This is based on the reported percent of revenue of the company's different segments. Half of Intuit's revenue is in a segment with essentially zero growth. For Intuit to grow its tax business, it has to grab market share. The company expects the following guidance for the full fiscal 2019.The tax segment is far weaker than the business segment. In an essentially zero growth market, Intuit is growing by about 10%. I believe this is due to the overarching trend of technology disruption as tax software overtakes humans for filing purposes. This shows Intuit is indeed taking some share of a stagnant market. That being said, as taxes make up half of Intuit's business, it would appear this segment is way overvalued. 10% growth for current valuation metrics looks crazy from the surface. As we dig deeper, we discover that this indeed is what it looks like from the surface. Considering that the company takes quarterly seasonal operating losses, the entire business is reliant on the tax segment for profits, thus the entire business is overvalued.Intuit commands a significant premium compared to other tax preparation businesses. While tax preparation is only half of the business, the divergence between Intuit and its peers is remarkable.Intuit expects 10% revenue growth in its consumer segment. H&R Block only grew by 4% last year, while Blucora's tax segment posted 16% growth. When judging Intuit's value versus its peers, despite its size, reveals that the company is ridiculously overvalued. Blucora's tax segment is growing faster, but the multiples are much lower.While TurboTax has a huge size advantage over Blucora's TaxAct, the quality is similar. Research is limited to more anecdotal evidence and opinions such as this. While TurboTax has some edge in terms of quality, it's slight.Data by YChartsRevenue difference is important to note because Intuit is a larger company than H&R Block and Blucora. But, proportionately, Intuit's market cap exceeds H&R Block and Blucora by miles. Put more simply, Intuit's price to sales ratio is stratospheric compared to its peers. Half of Intuit's business is nearly identical to Blucora's TaxAct. H&R Block offers a slightly different service, but competes in the same arena.Data by YChartsIntuit is a behemoth compared to H&R Block and Blucora. While the market cap should be much larger, the degree is quite staggering. In terms of future cash flows, the company is aggressively priced.Data by YChartsIntuit is not competing in high growth segments. When looking at the business as a whole, paying up for the company's future cash flows does not make sense. It would take far too long to recoup this investment. For the stock to double, the company must be worth a whopping 132 billion dollars. There won't be any revelations that make Intuit's software more valuable than it is now. There are no catalysts that would cause rapid expansion.Analysts' estimates call for 35% earnings growth for 2019, dropping to 10% for 2020. We can model an incredibly bullish scenario where earnings growth continues at 35% for the next 5 years, and sell out for a terminal multiple of 15. I generally like to model in this manner because of the difficulty in predicting beyond that period. This would give the company a value of future cash flows somewhere around 83 billion for the period past 2023. Discounted back to the present, we conclude that the fair value of Intuit in this incredibly bullish scenario is about 69 billion or $267 per share, just about 4% upside. With revenue growth in the low teens, this scenario is very unrealistic. If our bullish case is unrealistic and indicates the stock is fully priced, the risk to the downside is far greater than the upside.The company's bullish story points to a large TAM as a driver for growth. The figures are quite ridiculous. The company uses silly metrics like net promotor score, and highlights customer growth that appears detached from tangible income statement results.Source: Intuit Investor PresentationThese figures seem to distract from the point that Intuit is a mature slow growing business trading with a high growth valuation.Source: Intuit Investor PresentationThe entire presentation is nearly void of self-evident figures until the very end. The company then shows its moderate mid-teens expectations for operating income growth over the long term. As my model shows, 35% earnings growth over the next 5 years results in essential fair value. If the company only expects mid-teens growth in operating margin, how can we reasonably believe we are purchasing an undervalued asset? Poor analysis of the company's prospects has run amuck.It's important to note that taxes are only responsible for half of Intuit's business. But, that half is responsible for all profits. Revenue generated in the non-tax quarters is largely concentrated amongst the Quickbooks software.Source: DatanyzeQuickbooks' market size is more difficult to discern. Datanyze estimates that Quickbooks has about 74% market share. Quickbooks already dominates its segment. Yet, Intuit only expects revenue in its segment that includes Quickbooks to grow by just 15%. Whatever way you slice it, the growth is very modest. We can estimate this segment already accounts for half of Intuit's revenue. With this growth level and the current revenue the segment generates, the delta is nowhere close to making up for the lack of value in Intuit's tax filing business. Remember, Intuit posts losses in quarters when TurboTax is out of the picture.I find this situation unlikely, but possible, and worth noting. The tax industry as a whole is tied to another entity, the United States government. As we have seen with the recent implosion of Stamps.com (STMP), there is greater risk associated with businesses that are reliant on other businesses or entities. Stamps.com was reliant on the United States Postal Service, Intuit is reliant on the IRS. The same goes for the various semiconductor companies reliant on Apple (AAPL) that experience increased volatility.This issue was recently brought up with the Taxpayer First Act. Leftists argue that this is a prime example of corporate welfare that prevents the IRS from essentially preparing taxes for free. Reverting back to the IBIS Report, the tax preparation industry employs 300,000 people across 130,000 businesses. Intuit itself only employs 8,900 people according to Yahoo Finance. Accountants are subject to human error that tax software is not. If Intuit can render tax filings from humans obsolete, a similar free service directly through the IRS could render TurboTax obsolete.With changing political tides leaning to the left, this could be a risk down the road. Tax filing services are reliant on the government, a change in government leadership or policy could crush Intuit and its rivals. Recognizing that there could perhaps be an easier way to circumvent the process through direct filings. The general inefficiency of the government will most likely prevent this from ever happening.Investor psychology and the faulty belief that a company may ""deserve"" a premium valuation for arbitrary reasons could keep Intuit's stock price afloat. Perhaps it will run higher. With the current information available, the stock is significantly overvalued. Growth is existent, but not stunning.The stock has had a great run, it would be a good time to lock in gains. There's no tangible evidence of value. The stock is way ahead of itself. Owning shares now would only be profitable if the market continues to incorrectly value Intuit."

4266359,103480,2019-05-24T12:14:36-04:00,"Shares of Intuit rallied more than 5% after posting strong Q3 results that beat Wall Street's expectations on both the top and bottom lines.
        Q3 is Intuit's most critical quarter, as it comprises the April tax deadline that prompts many individuals and businesses to purchase TurboTax.
        While Consumer revenues saw a marked deceleration, a sharp uptick in small business revenues helped keep revenue growth in the mid-teens.
        Intuit has also continued a steady trend of earnings growth, up 16% this quarter.","Intuit (INTU), the software company best known for its tax and accounting software tools like TurboTax and Quickbooks, just beat estimates in its most important quarter yet. Revenues and earnings soared past Wall Street's estimates, causing shares to vault up more than 5% as a result. Investors were undoubted relieved that the third quarter - which, being Intuit's biggest quarter that's responsible for raking in ~80% of the company's annual earnings - contained no surprises, especially in a quarter that has been marred by surprise earnings misses from powerhouses like Alphabet (GOOG).I haven't been a perennial Intuit bull. In November of last year, I had cautioned that Intuit's valuation would cause the stock to falter (and indeed, the stock sank alongside the rest of the market in the painful December crunch). But while valuation is still a persistent issue for Intuit (against Wall Street's consensus EPS target of $7.07 for FY20, per Yahoo Finance, Intuit trades at a rather lavish ~37x forward P/E ratio), the stock has room to rally after it cleared third-quarter obstacles.Given the stock is still ~7% below year-to-date highs, it might be a good tine to explore buying Intuit into its strength.Let's dig deeper on this. The 2019 tax season was the first filing period which incorporated the changes signed into law by President Trump. We didn't know how the supposed simplification of the tax system would impact consumers' decision to purchase tax accounting software. On the one hand, the much larger portion of the population that is electing for the doubled standard deduction is likely to cause a shift from paid prepares onto tools like TurboTax. But on the other hand, filers who had previously used TurboTax may find taxes simple enough to do by hand. We didn't know the net effect surrounding the uncertainty of the Trump tax changes - thus, Q3 had always hung as a question mark over Intuit.It turns out that the consumer segment didn't perform incredibly hot in Q3. Intuit still managed to grow consumer revenues by 10% y/y to $2.15 billion, as shown in the chart below - but that's the slowest growth rate in five quarters.Figure 1. Intuit revenue trends by segmentSource: Intuit earnings fact sheetThankfully, there was a powerful counterbalance: the small business group, anchored by the infamous Quickbooks application. Small business revenues jumped 19% y/y to $887 million, the strongest growth rate to date in FY19.The count of paying Quickbooks customers, similarly, notched a record high just under 5 million, up 28% y/y and indicating a net add of 442k paid customers in the quarter:Figure 2. Quickbooks customer trendsSource: Intuit earnings fact sheetGoodarzi additionally noted that Quickbooks Advanced Online saw tremendous traction, helping Intuit to push further into the mid-market space for companies with under 100 employees. In addition, Intuit saw its fastest-ever 9% y/y growth rate in strategic partner revenues of $235 million, which is the revenue stream that Intuit collects from professional tax services.All told, Intuit's revenues of $3.27 billion in the quarter notched a 12.4% y/y growth rate, actually accelerating 70bps over last quarter's growth rate and beating Wall Street's expectations of $3.23 billion (+11.3% y/y) by a one-point margin.With the Q3 hurdle in the rearview mirror for Intuit, investors can now focus on the future rather than on the question marks surrounding tax season. The question now becomes: what tailwinds can push Intuit stock higher?Outside of the tax concern, one of the biggest issues that investors take up with Intuit is the idea that its products are saturated. Its biggest money-makers, TurboTax and Quickbooks, are both category-leading software platforms that virtually eclipse all other offerings in the market. The small business segment, in particular, sees no shortage of competition. There are tools like Xero and Wave (the latter is ""totally free forever"" for its core bookkeeping features, per its slogan - Wave primarily generates revenues from payroll administration and other tertiary services).Despite this glut of competing platforms, QuickBooks is still treated as the gold standard for small business accounting. Investors are naturally concerned that Quickbooks has hit a saturation point. Fortunately for bulls, Intuit has made a point of pushing its offerings upmarket into the mid-market space, whereas Quickbooks previously had long been the domain of smaller mom-and-pop outfits.To accelerate this push, Intuit has invested deeply into its AI capabilities. One of the most practical applications of AI for Quickbooks customers is an automated tool that helps customers see which payables are lagging in conversion to cash. In addition, when customers are pinched for cash, Quickbooks now offers QuickBooks Capital as a short-term loan option.These efforts haven't hurt the small business segment's margins; in fact, in Q3, the small business segment saw a five-point jump in operating margins to 42%, versus 37% in the year-ago quarter:Figure 3. Intuit segment margin trendsSource: Intuit earnings fact sheetThe small business segment - and by extension, Quickbooks - is vital to Intuit's future. Intuit has long been dominated by the huge lumpiness in its consumer revenues, which generates a massive windfall in Q3 but - as seen in the chart above - tends to generate flimsy margins in other quarters, especially Q1. SaaS revenues from Quickbooks, on the other hand, is evergreen - and alongside strong high-teens revenue growth, the small business segment has also achieved remarkable margin expansion.In my view, Intuit's investments into the Quickbooks platform and its upmarket push will reduce the company's dependence on third-quarter consumer TurboTax revenues. Investors can then view Intuit less from a seasonal lens and put the company more on par with its peers in the SaaS sector.While Intuit remains an expensive stock, it is richly valued for good reason. The company is a consistent earnings performer, having beaten expectations by a comfortable margin over multiple quarters. For better or for worse, the third quarter is Intuit's biggest quarter, which generates well over 80% of Intuit's annual EPS - and fortunately, the company's EPS of $5.55 this quarter shattered Wall Street's estimates of $5.39, driven by strong performance in Intuit's small business arm.Moving ahead, Intuit's push upmarket in its small business arm - driven by advanced solutions like QuickBooks Capital as well as AI-assisted features - can continue to drive strong growth alongside margin expansion. With the uncertainty of tax season behind us, investors can focus more on Intuit's upcoming growth drivers. Look for any dips as buying opportunities in this stock."
4241931,103763,2019-02-18T16:07:45-05:00,"Intuit’s flagship platforms continue to be in the early stages of penetrating their respective markets in the U.S. Coupled with nascent penetration globally, Intuit's runway for growth is long.Given the nature of Intuit’s business, users are faced with high switching costs - this constructs an economic moat, providing Intuit with pricing power.Implementation of AI and ML may relieve labor spend down the road while accelerating penetration of their consumer tax addressable market.On top of the bright outlook, Intuit currently boasts ~$1.3b in cash and equivalents and a mere $425m in total debt.Backing our R&D spend, shares are trading at~25x LTM adjusted earnings – an attractive valuation when factoring in Intuit’s robust growth and potential, and more than reasonable vs. other slow-growth firms.","Intuit Inc. (INTU) provides small businesses, accountants, and individuals with financial management and business solutions. The business is comprised of three segments with the two largest being Small Business/Self-Employed (SMB/SE) and Consumer Tax. Intuit’s SMB/SE segment provides small businesses and owners with accounting solutions (QuickBooks), while their Consumer Tax segment helps individuals file taxes through programs such as TurboTax.Intuit has been around for decades yet continues to be well positioned for robust growth in the coming years. With low penetration rates across the board, a strong economic moat, and healthy financials, outlook is bright for Intuit shares. Additionally, management’s keen ability to adapt to a changing consumer environment have allowed Intuit to pivot in the past and remain relevant.SourceCurrently, in the U.S., Intuit holds ~2.6m QuickBooks Online subscribers. Management pins their serviceable addressable market (""SAM"") at 48m. In the U.S. alone, this equates to a penetration rate of just 5.4%. On a global basis, the SAM is ~85m subscribers. With total QBO subscribers of 3.4 million, the global penetration rate is 4%. Revenue in SMB/SE has grown at over 15% for the past two years, with subscriptions growing at breakneck speed (+43% y/y in FY18). Going forward, a double-digit average growth rate in SMB/SE would not be far fetched. A CAGR in the mid-teens would not be unreasonable, equating to a viable share of the SAM years down the road.Figure 1: SMB TAMSource: Company PresentationOn the consumer tax side, the penetration rate within the U.S. is much higher, with TurboTax accounting for 27% of total returns and 11% of revenue. The discrepancy between revenue share is notable, displaying pricing potential in our eyes. With more than 45% of returns being attributable to CPAs/accounting professionals, TurboTax certainly has room to increase its share. Given the recent implementation of CPA professionals in the segment, we're optimistic on management's ability to flourish in this market.As of 1Q19, the company holds just over $1 billion in cash and equivalents, alongside $248 million in investments. Combined cash and investments total more than $1.3 billion (~$5/share). On the other hand, Intuit’s total debt sat at $425 million in the MRQ –coverable by cash alone. As a result, debt servicing costs continue to be low with the company covering interest expense more than 80 times over.The company continues to plow high amounts of capital back into the business, averaging between 19%-20% of total revenue. Going forward, management guides a similar range for R&D spend. Again, this line of thinking is immensely beneficial in the long run. Margins already are quite high yet come in even higher when backing out R&D spend.Figure 2: Consumer Tax TAM (U.S.)Source: Company PresentationCombining Intuit’s strong balance sheet and impressive performance, management has plenty of tools in their toolbox to help drive shareholder value into the future. Whether that be through strategic M&A or share repurchases, the firm is well positioned to provide shareholders with a strong return over the next several years.Figure 3: Operating Margin (ex-R&D)Source: SEC FilingsOther value drivers in the scene include pricing power, with many of Intuit’s platforms boasting high switching costs – that is, once SMBs shift their accounting onto a platform such as QuickBooks, it’s unlikely that a switch will happen anytime soon. There’s room for Intuit to leverage this and increase their average revenue per customer over time, further fueling revenue growth. (Note that ARPC has been increasing across QBO and Consumer Tax.) Essentially, the firm has a wide economic moat keeping many competitors at bay. The integration of AI/ML only helps emphasize this, allowing Intuit to provide customers with affordable solutions.Figure 4: Average Revenue Per CustomerSource: Company PresentationOn top of this, other interesting platforms Intuit is leveraging include its One Intuit Ecosystem, comprised of various platforms connecting people, businesses, and professionals. The platform provides a myriad of solutions ranging from consumer loans to lead generation for accounting professionals. One platform connects accountants with small businesses. In this example, accountants would be provided with effective marketing (and client acquisition) solutions. On the other side, a small business is able to connect with a reputable accountant which meets their specific needs. Another platform connects consumers and SMBs with lenders. Through this platform, lenders can obtain key information (loss rates are less than half the industry average) and lend money with confidence. Consumers and SMBs can obtain the financing they need. Intuit is merely bringing the two together. Partnerships also exist to provide an even larger product offering (Chase Savings, Marcus by Goldman Sachs, etc.).Many investors like pointing out that Intuit is seemingly overvalued. Yet we believe it’s not fair to value the business without making some key adjustments first. Currently, the firm is trading at an appropriate valuation in our eyes: ~25x LTM adjusted earnings. Compared to other slow-growth firms already at scale, Intuit’s valuation is more than reasonable. Additionally, we foresee Intuit’s multiple trading at a premium given their sound financials and growth outlook.On a forward-looking basis, however, we believe shares are priced attractively. We anticipate earnings growth to be in the teens over the next several years, in-line with analyst estimates. This is based on reasonable estimates of increased adoption of SMB/SE and Consumer Tax software services across the U.S. (and world), alongside margin expansion. In FY18, diluted EPS grew by ~25% year-on-year (~21% y/y on an adjusted basis). When adjusting for discretionary spending on R&D, the business generated a diluted EPS of more than $9 in the past year. Looking ahead, our FY20 adjusted EPS forecast comes in on the high end of the $11 range. (Ex-R&D, it would be a mere $6!) Assuming no multiple expansion takes place, shares would be worth ~$290. This reflects upside of more than 26% from Friday’s close – or a 12% return compounded annually.Of course, we believe the best course of action be to hold shares (and dollar cost average) over the long haul. Investors who are able to hunker down and contribute capital on a consistent basis, will reap a healthy rate of return over the next several years."

Shares are still up 23% year to date, and its forward P/E of 30x looks rich.With the market declining, there is far better value to be found in other large-cap tech names. Profit-takers will rotate out of Intuit and into more battered stocks.","Consistent as always, Intuit (INTU) outperformed Wall Street's consensus estimates when it posted earnings this week. Both revenues and earnings came in well above expectations, as Intuit conformed to its usual strategy of guiding low and then outperforming. Seeing as many tech stocks actually missed revenue expectations this quarter (including giants like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL)), however, the revenue beat was a much-needed signal of strength that investors did not take for granted. Shares initially rose more than 5% in after-hours trading immediately after the earnings release, but overall tech weakness ultimately pushed Intuit down about 2%.INTU data by YChartsIn my view, Intuit is long overdue for some profit-taking, which is further evidenced by the post-earnings drop despite a strong quarter. Relative to other names in the software sector, Intuit has emerged from the October/November selloffs relatively unscathed - it's barely down 10% from its peak, and it's also still up 23% year to date. As investors look more toward value names and sell this year's big winners, Intuit's gains become vulnerable.There are fundamental reasons to be wary of Intuit as well. Last quarter, when Intuit first introduced FY19 revenue guidance, it pointed to revenues of $6.53 to $6.56 billion, or a growth range of 8-10% y/y. Alongside this quarter's results, despite the Q1 beat, Intuit has barely raised the top end of its guidance range (in fact, the ~$50 million bump essentially just accounted for this quarter's beat) and stuck to its original 8-10% y/y growth forecast:Figure 1. Intuit FY19 guidanceSource: Intuit investor relationsWhen we also consider the fact that Intuit's revenue growth slowed down dramatically from 17% y/y growth in Q4 to 12% y/y in Q1, we begin to worry about Intuit's deceleration pattern. As I noted in a prior article, the upcoming year is one of uncertainty for Intuit's consumer business, given that many individual filers are filing under the Trump tax system for the first time.In addition, Intuit's efforts to diversify its business away from consumer tax returns and into small business is now up against new competition. Avalara (AVLR), for example, recently released a new module dedicated to helping small businesses file and pay state sales taxes, in response to a Supreme Court ruling earlier this year mandating e-commerce firms to collect sales tax. Additionally, there are other accounting software firms - such as Wave Accounting, for example - that offer many of QuickBooks' functionality for free. With Intuit already holding the lion's share of small business accounting software, the game is Intuit's to lose.Overall, there is no shortage of risks to Intuit's growth trajectory - yet the stock still trades at a hefty premium. Wall Street analysts have penciled in a consensus EPS estimate of $6.48 for FY19, per Yahoo Finance. This puts Intuit's current valuation at a forward P/E of 30x. In a time when tech titans are stumbling, there are far better bargains to be had. Alphabet and Facebook (FB) - each of which are growing both the top and bottom lines far faster than Intuit and have far more product lines to diversify their revenue streams - are now trading at year-to-date lows and P/E ratios far lower than Intuit's.GOOG PE Ratio (Forward) data by YChartsIn the presence of these alternatives, I'd be cautious on holding Intuit's seemingly overpriced stock.Here's a look at how Intuit fared in its fiscal first quarter:Figure 2. Intuit 1Q19 resultsSource: Intuit investor relationsTotal revenues grew 11.6% y/y to $1.02 billion, healthily surpassing Wall Street's estimates of $975 million (+7.1% y/y) by a four-point margin. Note that Wall Street's low estimates, however, was a direct function of Intuit's tendency to underwhelm with its estimates - it had forecast just 5-7% y/y growth for Q1. Nevertheless, it's important to note that revenue growth decelerated sharply from 17% y/y exiting Q4.As usual, the focus in a non-Q3 quarter (Q3 is Intuit's biggest, due to consumer tax filings) is on the small business segment. The QuickBooks Online subscriber base continued a strong trend, growing its membership by 41% y/y and padding Intuit's recurring revenue streams. Meanwhile, Intuit also introduced the upper-tier QuickBooks Online Advanced offering this quarter, tailored toward slightly larger small businesses with 10-100 employees.Despite these advances, we note that Intuit's small business group grew revenues by just 11% y/y - the weakest growth rate in many quarters, as seen in the chart below:Figure 3. Intuit Small Business segment trends Source: Intuit investor relationsOne of the key bullish themes driving Intuit is its ability to shift into more of a recurring revenue SaaS company and reduce its reliance on a big stream of packaged-software sales to consumers in April. The company's massive deceleration in Small Business (the growth rate was sliced in half going from Q4 to Q1) is an extremely worrying sign on Intuit's progress.Intuit's issues extended into bottom-line metrics as well. This quarter, gross margins slid down to 76.2% - still a high gross margin to be sure, but a full 200bps lower than 78.2% in 1Q18.Luckily, the company was able to wring some efficiency out of research and development spending, which was flat at $294 million on a dollar basis, representing just 28.9% of revenues in this quarter versus 32.2% in the year-ago quarter. Similar, general and administrative spending captured additional operating leverage, slimming down to 13.5% of revenues from 15.9% in 4Q17. These efficiency gains were able to offset the gross margin losses and land Intuit's GAAP operating margins at -1%, slightly better than -4% in the year-ago quarter. On a pro forma basis, netting out the effects of stock comp, Intuit's pro forma operating margins extended to 10%, up three points from 7% in the year-ago quarter.Pro forma EPS of $0.29 also showed meaningful upside to Wall Street consensus of $0.11. Operating cash flow burn, meanwhile, nearly doubled to -$148 million; though, as Q1 is not Intuit's big profit-generating quarter, this trend is likely to reverse as the year progresses.Figure 4. Intuit OCFSource: Intuit investor relationsOverall, I can't help but to feel that Intuit is being priced as a growth stock at a ~30x forward P/E, while its actual growth is coming in slightly disappointing. While Intuit's cost controls are impressive and a three-point operating margin expansion is certainly welcome, it's difficult to expect too much earnings growth when top-line revenue growth is only in the low teens.Intuit isn't a bad company - it's just unattractively priced, especially when many other reliable tech giants are suddenly trading at much more reasonable valuations. Intuit's relative strength in a choppy year leaves it vulnerable to profit-taking, and investors should take caution not to get burned."
4233449,102404,2019-01-15T10:57:25-05:00,"Intuit is offering business management services for small businesses (like QuickBooks) and self employed and do-it-yourself tax preparation products (like TurboTax).
        Aside from some network effects, Intuit's moat is mostly stemming from switching costs (as a result of the data trap Intuit's products have).
        Despite high expected growth rates for the future, Intuit is still overvalued as its fair value is $158 in my opinion.","So far, I have mostly covered companies with the wide moat stemming from network effects or the brand. Accenture (NYSE: ACN) and 3M (NYSE: MMM) relied at least partially on switching costs, but with Intuit (Nasdaq: INTU) I will analyze a company which is gaining its competitive advantage mostly from switching costs. My article will be structured in the usual way: first I will describe Intuit’s business, look at past performance metrics and analyze the competitive advantage of the company. And in the second part I will try to determine a fair price for the stock and determine what we are willing to pay.Intuit is offering financial management and compliance products and services for consumers and small businesses. Additionally, the company provides specialized tax products to accounting professionals who are key partners for Intuit in order to reach small business customers. Intuit is reporting in three different business segments: small business and self-employed, consumer and strategic partner.When looking at revenue distribution, we see that the “strategic partner” segment is only responsible for 8% of total revenue and growth was “only” in the low single digits in the last year for that segment. The “consumer” segment is responsible for 42% of total revenue and the segment grew 8% in 2017 and even 14% in 2018. But the most important segment is “Small Business and Self Employed” as it is not only responsible for the biggest part of total revenue (50%), but also generating the highest growth rates: in 2017, the segment grew 14% and in 2018 revenue from the segment grew even 18%.The biggest expenses for Intuit stem from research and development cost as most applications and software solutions have to be updated constantly (at least once a year). Applications and software have not only to be updated in order to improve performance or customer-friendliness, but also to reflect new regulations. In 2018, the company spent $1,164 million on research and development (20% of total revenue). Aside from R&D, selling and marketing is a second big expense factor. In 2018, Intuit spent $1,634 million or about 27% of total revenue.In the past, Intuit’s revenue as well as net income were significantly higher in the second and third quarter than in the first and fourth quarter of every year and this seasonality will continue in the future. This fluctuation is mostly caused by the strategic partner segment and especially by the consumer segment. While in the first and fourth quarter, revenue in the consumer segment was about $60-70 million, in the second quarter revenue was about $400 million and in the third quarter revenue was $1,668 million in 2017 and $1,949 million in 2018.When we look at the last decade, revenue could increase constantly (except for 2015) and on average, Intuit could report a growth rate of 7.2%. For earnings per share, the picture is quite similar. In 2015 earnings per share decreased almost 60%, but in all the other years of the last decade EPS increased and the company could report a CAGR of 14.7%. Free cash flow increased 13.6% annually (and that’s the number that counts), but the year-to-year fluctuations were quite high.(Source: Own work based on numbers from Morningstar)Margins stayed more or less stable during the last decade. Gross margin fluctuated slightly above 80% during that time with a small upward trend (in 2009 gross margin was 78.7% and last year gross margin could improve to 83.6%). Operating margin fluctuated about 25% and could also improve a little from 22.8% in 2009 to 25.1% last year.(Source: Own work based on numbers from Morningstar)Intuit could always report above-average RoIC and RoE numbers in the last decade. Between 2009 and 2014, return on invested capital fluctuated between 15% and 25% and while 2015 was a difficult year for the company, returns really took off in 2016 and in 2018 the company could report a RoIC of 52.3%.When examining the company’s balance sheet, we see mainly three asset classes. The company has currently $1,770 million in cash and short-term investments (36% of total assets) and $805 million in property, plant and other equipment (about 16% of total assets). However, the company also has $1,610 million in goodwill on its balance sheet (almost 33% of total assets). On the liabilities side, the company has $425 million in short- and long-term debt. Comparing that amount to the shareholder’s equity ($2,782 million) leads to a D/E ratio of 0.15. Debt levels shouldn’t be of any concern to us as the company is generating an annual operating income that is three times higher than the outstanding debt and the company could repay its debt easily with the cash it has.Intuit is certainly no company that is interesting for a dividend investor right now, but in 2012 Intuit started paying a dividend to its shareholders and increased it about 17% annually since then. The company is paying a quarterly dividend and recently increased the amount to $0.47 which would lead to an annual dividend of $1.88. In most years, the company had a payout ratio of 30% with the exception of 2015. Currently the dividend yield is slightly below 1% but we probably can expect dividend increases in the high single digits or even in the low double digits in the years to come.(Source: Own work based on numbers from Morningstar)Intuit’s business model seems to be built on strong competitive advantages creating a wide economic moat for the company. On the one side, the company is creating network effects, but those are rather weak in my opinion. Intuit is targeting the small-businesses and individual people on the one side and professional accountants on the other side. This creates a kind of two-sided network and if one side is using QuickBooks (for example the professional accountants) it becomes much more likely the other side (the clients of that professional accountant) start using QuickBooks too. This can become a very powerful network and even lead to QuickBooks reaching the status of “industry standard” like Microsoft Office (meaning that every accountant should be able to use QuickBooks, but I don’t see that yet for QuickBooks.Aside from network effects, Intuit’s competitive advantage is mostly relying on switching costs right now. Intuit’s business model is generating high switching costs for the customers and making it difficult to switch to a competitor even if the software should be better or the price significantly lower. First of all, customers have to put all the relevant data into QuickBooks and it probably takes a lot of time to transfer the data to some other application or software. Therefore, QuickBooks created a “data trap” for its customers. Aside from the data trap, we are also dealing with a learning curve trap. For many software applications it takes time to learn a new software (and maybe even train your own staff to use the software). Switching to a new application or software might lead to hundreds or thousands of additional hours necessary to learn the new software (for small businesses maybe a bit less). Additionally, one gets better and better over time with an existing system and it takes a lot of time to build up a knowledge base (for example if you use a software over years) and many people will think hard before they switch to a new system where they have to begin from scratch.QuickBooks is built as an open platform and is allowing third-party developers to create online and mobile applications. A growing number of companies is offering applications built for the QuickBooks platform – like PayPal (Nasdaq: PYPL) or Square (NYSE: SQ) – and by embedding additional applications into QuickBooks, customers have even less reason to switch and the costs of switching increase (as maybe other applications don’t have PayPal or Square embedded).So far, we established that Intuit is a great company with a great business model and probably will outperform the stock market in the years to come. But as always, we need a fair, intrinsic value in order to know if Intuit will be a good investment. And aside from the intrinsic value we also need an entry point – a price at which we will buy Intuit and be certain it will be a good investment.When looking at the last 25 years (the time since the IPO), free cash flow increased 21.18% annually on average. Revenue increased in the same timeframe 14.91% annually on average. For earnings per share I only had data for the last 21 years, but with 15.5% annual growth the numbers are very similar. I am very well aware that numbers can fluctuate depending on the point in time we use as starting point (for example if EPS or free cash flow was extraordinarily high or extremely low in that year). But the numbers will give us a feeling what is possible and what kind of growth rates might be realistic over a very long timeframe. As growth slowed down in the recent past, we can’t use these numbers, but rather have to calculate with 8% free cash flow growth for the next decade and 5% for perpetuity.Aside from the growth rates over the next years and decades, we also need a free cash flow as basis. I assume we are headed towards a new recession in the United States and therefore it makes sense to take a look back how the company developed during the last recession (although the next recession doesn’t have to be as extreme as the last one). In 2009, despite the recession, revenue growth only slowed down (3% growth compared to 2008) and earnings per share decreased about 4% from 2008 to 2009. Intuit is offering recession proof products and services as companies still have to complete their accounting and people have to do their taxes despite the economic conditions. Considering these facts, it could very well be that revenue will decrease only in the low single digits or maybe not at all. But aside from the negative effects of a recession, I still wouldn’t use last year’s free cash flow as the number was exceptionally high. To reflect the negative effects of a potential recession as well as a likely reversion to the mean I would subtract about 20% from last year’s FCF and use $1,590 million as basis.Using the numbers from above, we get an intrinsic value of $158.48 for Intuit and like always we will add an additional margin of safety to reflect the potential for errors or to compensate the risk of being too optimistic. Adding the margin of safety, we get a preferred entry point of $126.78.In the last few months, the stock declined a little, but is still trading above $200 and rather close to its 52-week (and all-time) high. The stock presented itself very strong and hence doubts remain if Intuit will ever reach our preferred entry point. Nevertheless, Intuit stays on our watchlist like many other companies and we will see what happens over the next few months and quarters."
4223688,22148,2018-11-20T16:35:18-05:00,"Intuit produced solid FQ1 numbers that smashed analyst estimates.The company continues to grow online subscribers, pushing revenues up 42%.The stock trades at a stretched P/E multiple of 28x FY20 EPS estimates.Intuit has pulled back on stock buybacks only spending $101 million in the quarter.","Even with the recent market selloff, Intuit (INTU) hasn't provided much of a buying opportunity. The company guided towards roughly in line FY19 EPS guidance with analyst consensus at $6.48. The stock is back above $200 in initial trading on these numbers, and the 15% grower just isn't appealing up here with so many other stocks beaten down.Image Source: Intuit websiteThe small business financial software company has a strong business with multiple growth opportunities, but the scale of the company doesn't offer the massive growth potential to warrant the large valuation multiple. The QuickBooks division is quickly taking advantage of their connection with small businesses and self-employed professionals to expand into ancillary product lines like payroll capital and payments. These additional modules beyond accounting and tax will provide the next growth drivers of the online financial services company.These new units aren't expected to greatly drive growth of a business that already reaches annual sales of $6.5 billion. Consistent revenue growth in the 10% range will generate strong cash flows for years into the future making for a great company.Intuit continues making exceptional progress with shifting small business customers online. QuickBooks Online subscribers were up 41%, and international subs surged 61%. Total online revenues were up 42% with new product lines like QuickBooks Capital only funding a very minimal $200 million in loans so far. These new areas offer the growth to fuel the business into the future.The problem here is the stock valuation. Even the $30 dip from the highs hasn't greatly altered the stretched valuation. The stock still trades at about 28x FY20 EPS estimates of $7.32.INTU PE Ratio (Forward 1y) data by YChartsThe large beat should provide some upside to current estimates, but FQ1 isn't a meaningful quarter. The April quarter drives the majority of the profits for the company with the corresponding tax season.One only has to review the share buyback to see where the company sees value. Intuit only spent $101 million on share buybacks during the period ending in October.Interestingly, the company spent aggressively on share buybacks back in 2015 when the stock dipped to $80. Intuit has pulled back on buying shares on the run up above $200. Heck, the company stopped meaningful buybacks as the stock launched above about $150 last year.INTU data by YChartsThe company has a substantial $3.1 billion remaining on the approved share repurchase plan. Intuit has about $1.1 billion in cash and limited debt, so not aggressively spending on repurchasing their shares when the stock spent the quarter above $200 is very telling.The projected FY19 net income is about $2.2 billion, so the company has the earnings stream to support more aggressive capital returns to shareholders. The hiccup is likely that paying nearly 2x the earnings growth rate of ~15% isn't a wise use of shareholder cash.The key investor takeaway is that Intuit found its own stock far more appealing below $100 as the company was starting the shift to online small business subscribers. The financial accounting and tax software company doesn't find the stock as appealing above $200 while trading at 2x the earnings growth rate.Investors should heed the advice of the management team of Intuit and avoid the stock up here.Disclaimer: The information contained herein is for informational purposes only.

4223150,37141,2018-11-19T05:27:22-05:00,,"By SprinklebitIntuit (NASDAQ:INTU) is set to report Q1 earnings today (Nov. 19th) after the market closes.Intuit Inc provides financial management and compliance products and services for small businesses, consumers, self-employed, and accounting professionals in the United States, Canada, and internationally. The company’s Small Business & Self-Employed segment provides QuickBooks online services and desktop software solutions comprising QuickBooks Enterprise, a hosted or server-based solution and QuickBooks Advanced, an online enterprise solution; QuickBooks Self-Employed solution; and QuickBooks Online Accountant and QuickBooks Accountant Desktop Plus solutions; payroll solutions, such as online payroll processing, direct deposit of employee paychecks, payroll reports, electronic payment of federal and state payroll taxes, and electronic filing of federal and state payroll tax forms.In the last quarter, the company reported EPS of $0.32 on revenue of $988M, beating analysts’ estimates of $0.23 on revenue of $952.67 million. Intuit had a return on equity of 67.39% and a net margin of 20.31%. During the same period last year, the company posted earnings of $0.11 per share, beating adjusted earnings estimates of $0.05 per share while the revenue figures of $886 million, topping Zack’s consensus estimate of $854.98 million.Currently, Intuit is benefiting from solid growth in subscriber base of QuickBooks Online, which is driving its Small Business & Self-Employed segment, the major revenue contributor. Banking on its rich product portfolio, Intuit has capitalized well on this opportunity, which is clearly reflected in its previous quarterly results and is likely to sustain in this to-be-reported quarter as well. Moreover, the company with its QuickBooks Online Advanced solution is now targeting the midmarket. The year-over-year increase in online subscriber base will continue to drive revenues for the stock. The company’s Consumer Tax segment revenues have been benefiting from a strong adoption of its Turbo Tax products. Intuit’s steady focus on bringing in innovative and easy-to-use TurboTax products for different users has helped it to win customers.What Are the Analysts’ Saying?A number of analysts recently commented on INTU shares. Zacks Investment Research raised shares of Intuit from a “hold” rating to a “buy” rating and set a $243.00 price objective on the stock in a report on Tuesday, August 28th. Barclays boosted their price objective on shares of Intuit from $204.00 to $219.00 and gave the stock an “equal weight” rating in a report on Friday, September 7th. Wells Fargo & Co boosted their price objective on shares of Intuit from $215.00 to $235.00 and gave the stock an “outperform” rating in a report on Monday, August 27th. Oppenheimer boosted their price objective on shares of Intuit from $206.00 to $224.00 and gave the stock an “outperform” rating in a report on Friday, August 24th. Finally, Credit Suisse Group boosted their price objective on shares of Intuit from $230.00 to $250.00 and gave the stock an “outperform” rating in a report on Friday, September 28th. Two investment analysts have rated the stock with a sell rating, five have assigned a hold rating and twelve have assigned a buy rating to the stock. Intuit has a consensus rating of “buy” and an average price target of $224.29 with the current price target of $211.44. That price change would mean 5.72% gain.Wall Street’s EstimatesEPS (Average Estimate): $0.11/shareQ1 Revenue (Average Estimate): $6.61B"
4230402,104952,2018-12-27T12:38:44-05:00,"Unlike other cloud software like CRM/file sharing, accounting and tax preparation software faces a higher barrier to entry to the overseas market with different tax and financial reporting standards.Comparable stocks are almost twice their size, such as Salesforce, which is expected to grow faster than INTU. INTU's forward P/E is 28.57, while CRM's is 47.14.Xero, which leads the Asia Pacific market for tax and accounting software and grows at 47% YoY, could be a strategic takeover target for Intuit to expand into Asia.","Through their flagship products such as TurboTax and QuickBooks, Intuit (INTU) has been the dominant accounting and tax preparation software providers in United States. Xero (OTCMKTS: XROLF), on the other hand, started out in New Zealand and Australia as a small business accounting software provider in 2008 and expanded into United States in 2011.We see Intuit as a growth stock. However, as the company expects to grow slower in the next 12 months, entering the emerging market could provide a reasonable way to unlock growth opportunity. This is why we believe that Xero would be a strategic takeover target for Intuit. The potential acquisition will allow Intuit to expand into fast-growing Asia Pacific market, where Xero is a much more dominant player. Intuit has grown 12.49% while Xero 46.58% YoY on average in the last 3 years. We believe that accounting and tax preparation software market faces a few barriers to entries that would make it difficult for overseas players to enter. For instance, a high degree of tailoring to a specific accounting or tax software is required to account for differences in languages and reporting standards. On that basis alone, the acquisition provides the most strategic path to expand into a new market and exponential growth.Cloud tax preparation and accounting software adoptions have increased significantly in emerging regions such as Southeast Asia and some parts of East Asia.Some fast-growing regions in Asia Pacific like Southeast Asia have been known to be very diverse in terms of economic development and regulatory policies. However, we've seen that the member countries in the region have gotten more integrated in recent years. Barriers for trade deals and labor movements among its members have significantly reduced. In addition, we've observed that the less developed member countries have successfully revamped their fiscal and other national security policies to level the playing field. Regulations have gotten significantly stricter, for instance, when it comes to tax reporting and collections. This increasingly stricter policies and more mature economic developments will drive the adoption for cloud tax preparation and accounting software.Based in New Zealand and Australia, Xero is the largest player in the region with the closest proximity to the rest of the fast-growing countries in Asia Pacific. We believe that the regions will reward the early trailblazers. In Southeast Asia, we've seen private equity and leading venture capital firms like Warburg Pincus and Sequoia Capital leading $28.5 million growth stage investments in a tax preparation software company in the region. The company has reportedly processed over $8 billion of tax returns to date.Much of Intuit's Q1 2018 - Q1 2019 YoY 12% revenue growth has been driven by their Small Business & Self-Employed segment. This segment contributes $908 million of overall $1 billion revenue as of Q1 FY 2019. Some product lines in the segment include QuickBooks financial and business management software, payroll solutions, and merchant payment processing solutions.92% of Intuit's overall revenue is also made up of Small Business & Self-Employed and Consumer segments, both driven by their Quickbooks and TurboTax products. In their financial reports, Intuit only reports segments that makeup of at least 8% of total net revenue. Source: Intuit 10-K Filing Aug 31 2018.International segment, which makes up 5% of the total net revenue, is not included. That is where Intuit has a lot of room to grow. Intuit's Quickbooks online product has about 3.4 million subscribers as of today, or up 43% YoY. But, Xero acquisition would allow Intuit to increase their number of subscribers by 47% to 5 million and to expand to Asia Pacific market.Source: Xero presentation slideshow as of August 2018.Xero has had a very strong Q3 performance. Besides having grown their number of subscribers by more than 30% in the last twelve months, we also see that their cash flow generation has improved significantly in the last three years.By looking at the other comparable companies in the cloud software market, we think that Xero is fairly valued.Source: Author. Comparison of relative valuation metrics for Intuit and Xero.One thing we noticed is the similarity between the market valuation for Xero and Zendesk (ZEN), despite their obvious difference in sizes. With $7.5 billion market cap, Zendesk is about twice the size of Xero. However, Zendesk is also at a similar level of growth and earnings to Xero. As it stands, Xero still has negative earnings due to its high growth rate. Zendesk, on the other hand, also hasn't had positive earnings until the recent quarter due to the same reason.Source: Author. Market cap comparison of all Intuit and Xero comparable companies.CRM products like Zendesk and Salesforce (CRM) would have an easier time to expand across geographic without needing a high degree of localization or tailoring on its software. As we've mentioned, this won't be the case for accounting and tax software providers like Intuit and Xero.This becomes clear when we look at the forward P/E ratio and size of Salesforce vs Intuit. Looking at the forward P/E ratios for both companies, we see that investors have a higher expectation of Salesforce growing faster than Intuit despite their size. However, the real opportunity lies in the fact that accounting and tax software has a higher switching cost than CRM products. With a market price of $3.81 billion, we think that Intuit can easily finance the acquisition through debt issuance and cash. Servicing the debt won't be a big issue. Xero has recently had a positive operating cash flow last quarter. In addition, Intuit's cash flow generation has been very strong and remained at 10% growth YoY. Last year, Intuit generated $2.1 billion of cash flow from operations.We think Intuit can unlock higher growth opportunity by entering a faster-growing market like Asia Pacific. In stark contrast to other cloud business software like CRM, an accounting, tax, and HR software provider like Intuit faces a certain challenge when they try to expand their services overseas. Due to different reporting standards and country-specific regulations, such software typically requires a high degree of localization in terms of features and potentially pricing in order to gain adoption in certain overseas markets. Being based in the region already, Xero could provide that access for Intuit for $3.8 billion.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

4202062,103480,2018-08-25T12:03:32-04:00,"Intuit's shares have vaulted to all-time highs on the back of Q4 earnings beats.Looking ahead to FY19, the company is expecting relatively modest 8-10% y/y revenue growth and 11-12% y/y EPS growth.Baked into that guidance assumption, however, is a 9-10% y/y growth assumption in the consumer business. With Trump's tax simplification, there's risk to meeting this forecast.For a company trading at a >30x P/E ratio, Intuit's growth forecast (and the potential risks to hitting it) is somewhat disappointing.","Over the past year, Intuit (INTU) has been one of the strongest-performing consumer software stocks. Buoyed by a strong tax quarter in Q3 (Intuit's fiscal Q3 is when tax returns are filed - and in that quarter, Intuit saw robust 15% y/y revenue growth and 24% y/y earnings growth), and further encouraged by strong Q4 results posted in late August, Intuit's stock has veered even higher.There's no question that Intuit's growth over the past year has been nothing short of impressive. The company has done a good job of diversifying its business away from the all-important consumer segment, and to that end, Quickbooks Online has continually been picking up large batches of new signups each quarter. But even in the consumer segment, Intuit is experiencing growth thanks to its assisted tax solutions, which give Intuit customers the option of live-chatting with a tax preparer.But the main question for investors now is: can Intuit's impressive run continue into FY19?INTU data by YChartsIntuit's rapid rise over the past year has given it a rather full valuation. An 8.0x forward revenue multiple and a 33.5x forward P/E ratio imply a company that is expected to grow much faster than Intuit is. There are plenty of strong enterprise SaaS companies that trade at similar to cheaper multiples of P/E or revenue that are growing much more quickly than Intuit, and carry none of the risks to growth that Intuit does. A consumer-facing stock like Intuit faces much more revenue volatility than an enterprise software company does.In my view, Intuit's upside is limited, especially following news of a CEO exit and the lack of positive near-term catalysts. With the broader market hitting all-time highs and investors increasingly becoming conscious of growth stocks' valuation, it's a good time to begin underweighting Intuit in your portfolio.With Intuit exiting Q4 and FY18 on a high note - with strong results in both the fourth quarter and, more important, the third quarter (virtually all of Intuit's profits in a fiscal year are generated in the third fiscal quarter due to the tax season timing) - Intuit failed to produce a very impressive forecast for FY19.Here's where the company landed in terms of FY19 guidance ranges:Figure 1. Intuit FY19 guidanceSource: Intuit investor relationsNote that Intuit's first-quarter revenue outlook midpoint of $965 million (+6% y/y) falls short of Wall Street's forecast of $989 million, though part of the gap may be due to the fact that Intuit shifted its accounting convention to ASC 606 this quarter, as did many other SaaS companies.The full-year outlook failed to impress as well - Wall Street was looking for revenues of $6.56 billion, which is bracketed by Intuit's range of $6.53-$6.63 billion.Note that this revenue view implies just 8-10% y/y growth - not exactly the kind of growth rate that merits an 8.0x forward revenue multiple. And earnings growth of 11-12% y/y isn't terribly impressive either, at least not for a company that is trading at a 33.5x forward P/E ratio. We have to take Intuit's high valuation multiples in the context of its subpar growth - Intuit's PEG ratio, taking the forward P/E ratio divided by the growth rate, sits at a sky-high 2.9x. Classic value stocks trade at a ratio below 1.0x.There's one other risk to call out: how will Trump's tax simplification affect Intuit? There are two schools of thought on this subject. Taking an optimistic point of view, we could say that the fact that more people will be taking the standard deduction for the 2018 tax year implies that many will switch from having their CPAs file their tax returns to a solution like TurboTax. But, on the other hand, people who used to use TurboTax could also suddenly have much simpler tax returns, and turn to doing taxes completely on their own.It's unclear yet which effect will dominate - but Intuit's guidance, calling for 9-10% y/y growth in the consumer segment, certainly seems to take the more optimistic view. If this assumption gets busted in Q3, Intuit could be at risk of meeting even its modest growth targets.Here's a look at Intuit's latest quarterly results:Figure 2. Intuit Q4 earningsSource: Intuit investor relationsTotal revenues grew 17% y/y to $988 million, slightly surpassing last quarter's growth rate of 15% y/y and implying two points of sequential acceleration. Wall Street had not been expecting this acceleration - consensus Called for revenues of $956 million, or +14% y/y growth.The big growth driver in Q4 was the business segment, producing net subscriber adds in the off-season for consumer taxes. Small business revenues grew 20% y/y this quarter, helped by a large 38% y/y increase in the domestic subscriber base and a 62% y/y increase in the overseas subscriber base.Quickbooks' growth has certainly been impressive. Looking at the growth trends in the chart below, we note that in the last three fiscal years, Quickbooks has grown its subscriber base by nearly 3x:Figure 3. Quickbooks subscriber trendsSource: Intuit investor relationsStill, we have to note that the small business segment - while important for revenue diversification and reducing Intuit's seasonality - is still a very small portion of its overall revenues. In FY18, $2.5 billion of Intuit's total $3.1 billion in revenues was produced by consumer software. The small business segment does produce a strong quarterly operating income that, for the full year, nearly matches consumer software's operating income contribution, but a hit to the consumer segment will still cause disproportionate volatility for Intuit.Higher expenses this quarter, however, drove Intuit's operating losses in the quarter to be deeper than in the year-ago quarter. Pro forma EPS of $0.32, however, beat Wall Street expectations of $0.23.Despite good results in Q4 and for FY18, there are compelling reasons to believe that Intuit's recent growth streak will hit a speed bump in FY19. Intuit's own guidance range, calling for low double-digit earnings growth and high single-digit revenue growth, already implies a bit of a slowdown - and uncertainty around consumers' tax behavior in Q3 will add additional ambiguity to Intuit's weak forecast.In my view, a company with such a modest outlook plus added risk on top isn't worth Intuit's premium valuation. I've been bullish on Intuit in the past - when shares were trading in the $140-$150 range - but it's difficult to ignore the company's outsized valuation in light of weak growth estimates. Investors are best sitting out on the sidelines until Intuit trades at a better price."
4203281,52852,2018-08-30T17:42:56-04:00,"There is general lack of awareness of the large executive turnover at INTU.INTU recently announced that its long-time CEO and CTO are both leaving at around the same time.Its CFO resigned in January 2018.The company also lost its head of sales and marketing in July 2018, and its Chief of Staff in August 2017 -- neither was disclosed in a SEC filing.","OK folks, we need to talk. High level executives are leaving Intuit (INTU), but judging from the stock, which is at an all-time high, and lack of public debate on the subject, no body seems to care. Most of us know that INTU's CEO is leaving because it was widely covered by the press. But the same press release also said that the CTO will resign at around the same time. And do you recall INTU's CFO transition in January of this year, which the company announced in August 2017? And I bet that you didn't know that INTU's Chief Marketing & Sales Officers left in July 2018 and that INTU's Chief of Staff left in August 2017. Perhaps this is because the bulls are now fat and lazy after years of gorging on INTU's massive returns. The bears? May they rest in peace. Five years ago, August 2013, INTU's short interest was 8.9% and now they are at 1.2%. Although INTU continues to post strong results, keep in mind that current results are mostly the result of decisions and investments made years ago.I think it is time to think critically about what all these executive turnover means for INTU's future. On August 23rd, Intuit (INTU) announced that its CEO and CTO are both resigning from the company by the start of next year. According to the press release, the CEO, Brad Smith, led the company for 11 years and increased the stock's value by over 600 percent under his watch, nearly three times the return on the Nasdaq over the same period. Needless to say, Wall Street loves him, and his reputation requires no explanation to tech investors.But that's all behind us now. Did anybody bother to find out why Brad Smith is leaving now, and what is he going to do going forward?In a recent Fortune article, Smith told said, “I never wanted to be that athlete who loses half a step or can’t complete the pass. I wanted to step down when I was still in my learning zone and still had gas in the tank.” That is about as vague as you can get, but still adds more color than just about any of the articles from other major publications. For example, Wall Street Journal, Business Insider, Market Watch, and CNBC offers nothing more than a regurgitation of INTU's press release. During the earnings call, analysts' avoidance of the turnover question was almost comical. That is until the 2nd half of the call, when Jefferies analyst, Brent Thill, finally asked about the elephant in the room:Feel free to read Smith's response in the transcript, but I walked away with absolutely nothing. He basically said that he reached his goals, trained his people, and now it is someone else's turn. That is fine, but Smith is only 54 years old, and his successor, Sasan Goodarzi, is only 4 years his junior. Unfortunately, the rest of the call jumped right back to the type of questions that would trigger Elon Musk. I read sell side research notes from most of the major banks (no link due to client only access) and nobody provided any insight as to why Smith is resigning now, and where he is going. We didn't even get the standard ""spending more time with my family"" explanation, which at least is something to hold on to while remaining skeptical. Now I'm just skeptical with empty hands. If the press release, call, media, and sell side research told us little about why the CEO is leaving and where he is going, even less was said about the CTO's resignation. The CTO is only 56 to 57 years old, according to the 10-K. If you read this article carefully, you probably asked ""who is the third executive turnover, according to the Jefferies analyst?"" Almost exactly a year old, INTU announced that its CFO, Neil Williams, will step down in January 2018. Like the CEO and CTO, Williams has been with the company for many years (10 by the time he resigned). The press release says he will pursue other interests, but his LinkedIn profile still has not been updated, and I don't see any press releases from other organizations who might have hired him. But to be fair, Williams was 64 as of the 2017 10-K, so this could be a standard retirement. In August 2017, around the same time that INTU announced the resignation of its CFO, the company also lost its Chief of Staff, Lindsey Argalas. According to her LinkedIn profile, Argalas left the company in August 2017 and started work at Banco Santander in September. Aragalas described her role at Intuit as follows, per LinkedIn:I bet you didn't know that she left, because the company didn't disclosed it through a SEC filing. It is debatable if losing its Chief of Staff is a material change, so I won't push this issue any further. However, losing your head of sales and marketing does sound material, but I can't find any disclosure from INTU on that either. According to Lucas Watson's LinkedIn profile, he served as INTU's Chief Marketing & Sales Officer until July 2018, and began work at Cruise Automation in August. Here is how Watson describes his role at INTU, per LinkedIn:I don't like to jump to conclusions. I'm not saying INTU will implode, that there is fraud, or that there is anything terrible going on behind the scenes. My concern is that the stock is at an all-time high, senior executives are leaving in droves, and I have no clue what is going on. With just a little bit of sleuthing, I was able to uncover two additional, undisclosed executive turnovers. At least one of these undisclosed turnover, the Chief Marketing & Sales Officer who left in July 2018, seems material. Could there be more? I find the lack of explanation from management troubling. As a personal policy, I do not write about anything that I or my firm have a position in, so I do not stand to benefit one way or the other. But it pains me to see the lack of awareness among retail investors concerning this glaring issue. If you found this article helpful, please do me a favor and hit the follow and like buttons.

INTU has remained a Wall Street favorite with overwhelmingly positive coverage. Over the past five years, INTU stock has rocketed 213% in addition to providing investors with a 0.84% dividend yield. With tax season in full swing, investors may gravitate to tax stocks with the hope of realizing a short-term gain. This article will provide my investment thesis on INTU, discussing the company's business strengths, valuation, and overall outlook.With $6 billion in annual revenues, INTU remains the preeminent player in the tax preparation and consumer/small-business financial service industry. The company exhibits a highly diversified financial product portfolio that caters to small business professionals, do-it-yourself consumers, and tax professionals. The majority of INTU's revenue base is derived from small business owners and consumers. INTU offers business owners various online business management solutions - the most popular of which is QuickBooks, an accounting software suite that enables business owners to accept business payments, manage and pay bills, and execute payroll functions. The company's intuitive and easy-to-use financial management products make the lives of business professionals much easier and precipitate strong customer loyalties. The total number of QuickBooks subscribers has increased dramatically over the years, with the user base nearly doubling between Q1/17 and Q1/19, from 2,153 million to 4,093 million users. INTU's consumer segment also accounts for a large portion of the company's total revenues: INTU's highly popular TurboTax product line enables consumers to easily file their taxes from home, maximize deductions, and talk to live CPA professionals regarding their individualized tax questions. INTU now derives 52% of total revenues from the company's small business segment, 42% from the consumer segment, and the remainder from the company's professional tax segment. INTU's programs have been incredibly popular due to their ease of use, cost-effectiveness, and overwhelming functionality. From an overarching perspective, the tax preparation and financial services segment offers distinct advantages through astronomical margins and stable revenues. The company's tax and business software programs require very limited capital expenditures aside from software updates and marketing/R&D expenditures. INTU's financial products also eliminate many expenses associated with traditional businesses as the company's products are digital, and the hard copy versions are very inexpensive to create and distribute. Furthermore, INTU's revenues are tied to tax preparation and business management needs, which remain an unchanging necessity. In other words, the government will indefinitely collect taxes, complications in the tax code will increase the dependence on tax software, and easy-to-use business management solutions will remain unchanging tailwinds for INTU.Data by YChartsIn addition to revenue diversification and inherent business advantages, INTU benefits from strong competitive deterrents arising from high entry and exit barriers as well as the virtuous nature of INTU's tax preparation software. INTU's business model disincentivizes small business owners and consumers from switching to an alternative platform due to the convenience and cost effectiveness of INTU's tax and financial management programs. Consumers have to dedicate a considerable amount of time to input all their financial data into TurboTax, then they have to spend even more time mastering and familiarizing themselves with the program's interface. This makes them highly unlikely to want to switch to a competitor and go through that process all over again. Furthermore, the duality of INTU's business across its consumer/small-business segments and professional accountant segment creates a network effect in which tax professionals integrate QuickBooks and TurboTax into their own business to streamline the return filing process. INTU's products display underlying strengths as a result of their continuity of service and broadened professional integration.From an investment returns perspective, INTU offers added appeal. The company has sustained continued share price appreciation. The stock has experienced year over year capital appreciation, offering a 213% return over the past five years. In addition to good capital appreciation, INTU offers a dividend yield of 0.83%, and the company has consistently expanded its dividend yield for the past eight years. The payout ratio on the dividend, at 40%, is moderate as well, allowing the company flexibility to increase the yield. Overall, INTU makes for a great investment holding with considerable monetary rewards.INTU is also well-positioned financially. The company exhibits positive shareholder equity, significant liquidity reserves of $1.9 billion, and a manageable debt load of $425 million. The company debt is overwhelmingly covered by operating cash flows, at 481% coverage, suggesting an easily manageable debt load. However, INTU's formidable business comes at an exorbitant cost. Based on a discounted cash flow analysis, INTU is severely overvalued. The company's current share price of $225 far exceeds the future cash flow value of $127, implying a 44% trading premium. Although I anticipate solid results this tax season, INTU's extreme overvaluation positions the company for substantial downside.Data by YChartsIntuit demonstrates a formidable business awash with strong competitive advantages and sustained operational outperformance. The company is well positioned financially and exhibits a stable revenue outlook. However, in spite of these positive characteristics, INTU furnishes a sell rating due to the stock's extreme overvaluation. Although the stock may trend higher in the interim as we delve further into tax season, the risk-reward ratio becomes increasingly asymmetric. INTU remains a good buy in the event of a pullback.Author's note: Thanks for taking the time to read the article.

4176425,103480,2018-05-23T06:49:54-04:00,"Intuit beat analyst expectations on the top and bottom lines for Q3, which includes the tax season and is Intuit's most important quarter.Historically, Q3 has provided nearly half of Intuit's full-year revenues and essentially all of its full-year profits.The soft Q3 guidance given in Q2 initially caused Intuit to pull back, but it seems the concern was overblown.However, Intuit's rapid rise since last quarter leaves shares extremely expensive.","Within the technology sector, very few companies exhibit a meaningful amount of seasonality. Sure, software companies tend to do better in the fourth quarter as IT leaders spend the remainder of their budget allocations, but beyond that, the effect isn't too pronounced.The one exception to this trend is Intuit (INTU), for which a full year of financial results essentially rests on the quality of its fiscal third quarter (February through April), results which Intuit just reported. This reliance, of course, is due to the tax season.Over the past several years, Intuit has been trying (and succeeding) to diversify its business more into the small business segment, as well as software for tax professionals. These lines of business generate meaningful revenues in every quarter, not just fiscal Q3, so smoothing out Intuit's results over the long term depends on the company's ability to expand these segments. At present, however, Intuit still depends heavily on its consumer software (aka, TurboTax) business, and as such, Q3 provides essentially half of Intuit's revenues in any given year. And since every other quarter outside of Q3 operates at near-breakeven or at a small loss, Q3 also contributes to the entirety of Intuit's EPS in one year.The main point here - a lot rides on Q3, and fortunately for Intuit this quarter, it passed with flying colors. With Intuit's most important quarter already in the books, it looks like clear skies are ahead. Initially, after Intuit posted Q2 results and posted underwhelming Q3 guidance, investors sold off the stock on concerns that Intuit was forecasting a weak tax season. The company had originally guided to 10-12% revenue growth in Q3 as well as EPS of $4.57-$4.62 - as it turns out, Intuit was able to beat even the high end of both of these ranges. Investors had worried for nothing.Intuit's stock is little changed on the news. The company has had more than its fair share of gains over the past year, however, with shares rising 20% year to date and up ~10% alone since last quarter:INTU data by YChartsIn my view, Intuit has shifted into being quite an expensive play. On a revenue basis, Intuit now trades at 8.5x forward revenues (up half a turn from the 8x it was at last quarter), far above the peer average for software stocks, and especially expensive for a company whose revenue growth is only in the double digits. And good tax quarter or no, the fact that so much of Intuit's results rides on a consumer customer base (and not enterprise), whose demand by next tax season can be radically altered, is also disconcerting.On an earnings basis, Intuit now also trades at a 35x forward P/E, also up from a valuation of approximately 32x forward P/E last quarter. Again, in terms of Intuit's 25% earnings growth this quarter, a 35x forward P/E indicates a PEG ratio of about 1.4x - indicating quite an expensive stock. In short, from either a revenue or earnings standpoint, Intuit's shares look expensive even when accounting for its growth premium.In my view, Intuit is at best a hold. There are few bullish catalysts remaining for the stock in the near term. Sure, non-Q3 results matter, but in terms of a full fiscal year, they don't really move the needle that much. I don't see how Intuit can sustain its elephantine valuation with just so-so growth capabilities. Now would be a good time to lock in gains on the shares, or at least consider an exit point.Here's a look at Intuit's results in the third quarter, taken from the company's earnings supplement:Figure 1. Intuit Q3 resultsSource: Intuit investor relationsTotal revenues grew 15% y/y to $2.93 billion, beating analyst expectations of $2.80 billion (+10% y/y) by a respectable five-point margin as well as delivering above its internal expectations of $2.785 to $2.835 billion (10-12% y/y). Clearly, expectations in the quarter were muted, and for no good reason.The strength was driven, unsurprisingly, by outperformance in the consumer tax returns side of the business. Growth of 15% in the consumer business to $2.03 billion actually outpaced the 12% growth in Q2 as well as the 9% growth Intuit saw in 3Q17. In fact, the 15% growth Intuit saw in the consumer business this quarter was the strongest it's seen since 2Q16, as seen in the chart above.Brad Smith, Intuit's CEO, offered the following commentary on the earnings call regarding consumer upside:He went on to note that as a percentage of total tax returns, do-it-yourself tax preparation gained 0.5% of share (which is the space Intuit plays in). And within the DIY space, Intuit itself gained market share. Intuit's additional offerings of TurboTax Live, which gave DIY tax filers the additional option of video chatting with a tax professional, also saw positive reception from customers in the quarter and helped to generate new business.And despite the focus on the consumer tax side of the business this quarter, the small business segment (Quickbooks) also showed strength. The company ended the quarter with 2.5 million U.S. subscribers and 0.72 million international subscribers, representing growth of 40% y/y and 66% y/y, respectively. As these clients offer recurring, year-round revenues, increased subscriber growth will be an important part of steering Intuit toward decoupling full-year results from solely Q3. The company is guiding to full-year FY18 subscriber growth of 41-42% y/y for Quickbooks.On the cost side, however, Intuit didn't see that much improvement. GAAP operating margin in the quarter stood at 55.2%, down 130 bps from 56.8% in the quarter. However, Intuit was still able to drive robust net income growth due to - in a circumstance that's only fitting for a tax software company - a lower tax rate, stemming from the Trump tax reductions. The company paid just 26% of pre-tax income in taxes this quarter, versus 33% in the year-ago quarter.Largely as a result of this lower tax rate, Intuit grew net income and EPS to $1.2 billion and $4.68, respectively. On a pro forma basis, Intuit's PF EPS of $4.82 beat Wall Street expectations of $4.60 with 5% upside, and also muscled past its original guidance range of $4.57-$4.62.Despite the strong tax quarter, Intuit's shares seem to have already fully baked in excellent results, as judged by the lackluster market response. In my opinion, Intuit's shares already look fully valued at 8.5x forward revenues and 35x forward P/E.The company is certainly posting strong results, but its revenue and earnings growth rates of 15% and 24%, respectively, simply don't justify the kind of premium that Intuit is trading at. With bullish catalysts numbering so few in the near term, I don't see a path for meaningful appreciation in Intuit's shares. Investors would be wise to take advantage of the YTD rise in Intuit's shares and start divesting their stakes."
4188388,104586,2018-07-19T13:04:08-04:00,"Intuit has continued to reinvent itself over the last many years.The company’s focus on customer monetization and a new tax filing offering (TurboTax Live) has helped Intuit beat its guidance for the 3Q18 and also led to an increase in.While the company trades at a rich 9x P/S, the evolving business model justifies further upside.","Intuit's (NASDAQ:INTU) emphasis on customer behavior-led business model pivots has allowed the company to stay ahead of the curve. INTU is building an ecosystem to monetize its customer base through advertisements and commission-based products. The launch of highly engaging products, such as TurboTax Live (TTL), appears to be geared towards growing INTU's customer base and thus the monetization income. This, coupled with a highly effective targeting strategy, is likely to deliver stock outperformance.INTU is a provider of tax filing and financial management solutions. The company competes with professional accountants and other providers such as H&R Block, ADP etc. Not only has the competition led to pricing pressures but also a loss of customers. In many cases, the customer has also decided to opt out due to a pressing need for professional assistance. Since acquiring customers is expensive, INTU decided in favor of selling more to the existing customer base. This selling need not be necessarily that of INTU's own products. Instead, a higher margin business is to get a commission cut on selling a partner's product to an existing customer base.The ability to monetize customers is a function of 1) ability to effectively target users and 2) grow and engage the user base.Effectiveness of user targetingEver since the advent of Google Ads (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), every website aimed to rake in millions by showing visitors ads. The efficacy of this approach has continued to decline. Another approach was that of social advertising - something that Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) had mastered. The idea of social ads is to show advertisements to people based on their social profile. The social profile is based on many factors such as age, gender, location, preferences (friends, food, cars etc.) and other demographically significant metrics. During its first earnings call (on 26 July 2012), FB had shared that most ads on its platform delivered ""a return on ad spend of 3x or better"" and nearly half the ads ""delivered a return of 5x or better"". On its 3Q18 earnings call, the INTU management noted that INTU's partners were witnessing an 8-10x higher conversion on INTU's leads versus leads from other sources. INTU's delivered ROI being higher was a result of a far more detailed level of information about its customer that INTU has versus what FB gathers. While customers willingly and accurately disclose their information to INTU (they need to, for compliance purposes), FB scrapes off and 'figures out' information about users. This makes it very easy for INTU to target customers with relevant partner products and ROIs at 2X that of FB bear testament to INTU's capability.Another parallel is that INTU is also testing its targeting strategy, like FB was in 2012. If we follow the Facebook example, with time, INTU's returns for advertisers should only get better. This in turn should help margins and cash flows, a lot of which the company plans to invest in customer acquisition.User growth and engagementFinancial management and tax compliance discussions are not as cool as sharing photos of the latest trip to the Colosseum. The option of a free tax filing software or getting the filing done by a professional further makes the possibility of meaningfully engaging with users very low. In order to increase engagement, INTU launched TTL last year. TTL is the Uber of tax filing - TTL allows customers to have online access to a tax professional to help solve their queries and to file their taxes. Not only is TTL a higher revenue product (~3x of regular ARPU), but it also reduces reasons for customers to leave the INTU platform.The timing of the introduction of TTL also seems to be near perfect, with two important upcoming events. The more visible event was the new tax legislation in the US, which has had many taxpayers scratching their heads about how to file and thus looking for a professional. The more strategic event is the possible expiry of the exclusive contract between the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the Free File Alliance (FFA), in 2020. In case this contact does not renew beyond 2020, many people using FFA would be scouting for alternative means for their tax filing. The default option would be to reach out to a professional accountant, something which INTU can offer through TTL. The stickiness witnessed from TTL has made the INTU management decided to sacrifice margins to continue investing in customer growth.3Q18 results seem to have benefited from the company's customer monetization approach. Consumer group revenue grew 14% YTD, exceeding the annual guidance of 7% growth. However, the 3Q18 results may just be the tip of the iceberg. Despite INTU earning virtually all of its revenue and operating income in the third quarter, the company has raised its full year (F2018) guidance for revenue from $5,640-$5,740 to $5,915-$5,935 and for non-GAAP operating income from $1,885-$1,935 to $1,950-$1,960, in the third quarter.Financials and valuationINTU is an operating leverage play. The company's focus on customer monetization can lead to a new trajectory for revenue growth and profitability. I try to estimate this using my financial model.My model working is based on the following assumptions:In the base case (built using management guidance), my financial projections are as follows:Source: INTU Financial ModelINTU trades at ~9x times on a P/Revenue (F2018E), which may appear expensive. However, on a P/TAM basis, INTU trades at ~0.4x which is quite inexpensive when compared with some of the other names in software.However, the business momentum calls into question whether a multiple based approach may be the right way to value INTU. The cash flows associated with an increasing focus on user engagement and monetization makes INTU a good candidate for a DCF valuation. In the base case (management guidance driven), I use a CAPM derived WACC of 11.7% and a terminal growth rate of 2% to arrive at a value per share of $256.Give the compounding nature of benefits and risks in an operating leverage-driven business model, I have also built out a bull and a bear case. In the bull case, my expectations of volume growth and ARPU growth are higher than in the case, and in the bear case, these are lower. The expected share price across the three cases is as follows:Source: INTU Financial ModelINTU is becoming a play on customer monetization. The valuation growth for FB and Uber, on the back of user growth is well documented; also well documented are issues of privacy invasion and corporate governance across these two giants. INTU seems to be bringing to the table the best of both worlds, without the associated issues. This can make INTU a possible multibagger."
4160506,20521,2018-04-02T12:34:04-04:00,Intuit faces strong competition.Another concern for Intuit is the price pressure from free and low-priced online tax and accounting offerings.And a final concern is the US government's intention to streamline tax filing.,"Last month, cloud-based accounting and tax giant Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) reported a strong second quarter that beat analyst estimates. However, its soft outlook is causing analysts to ponder the growth rate question.Founded in 1983, California-based Intuit reported revenue of $5.2 billion in fiscal 2017, a growth of 10.3%. It serves 46 million customers and has about 8,200 employees in major offices in the United States, Canada, India, the United Kingdom, Israel, Australia, and other locations.Its flagship products and services include QuickBooks and TurboTax, which make it easier to manage small businesses and tax preparation and filing. QuickBooks Self-Employed provides freelancers and independent contractors with a way to manage their finances and save money at tax time, while Mint delivers financial tools and insights to help people make smart choices about their money. ProSeries and Lacerte are its tax preparation offerings for professional accountants.Its second quarter revenue grew 15% to $1.16 billion, within Intuit's guidance range for revenue of $1.160 billion to $1.180 billion. Non-GAAP operating income increased 13% over the year to $120 million or $0.35 per share, from income of $106 million or $0.26 per share a year ago. Analysts had estimated earnings of $0.34 per share on revenue of $1.16 billion.Revenue growth was driven by 19% growth from the Small Business and Self-Employed Group and 12% growth from the Consumer Group. QuickBooks subscribers grew by 51% with US subscribers growing 47% to 2.2 million and international subscribers growing 69% to 630,000.Intuit repurchased $83 million of its shares in the quarter and has $1.3 billion left in its share purchase authorization. It has received board approval for a $0.39 per share dividend for Q2 2018, an increase of 15% over the year. It ended the quarter with cash, equivalents, and investments of $726 million.For the third quarter, Intuit expects revenue of $2.785 billion to $2.835 billion or moderate growth of 10% to 12%, GAAP operating income of $1.535 billion to $1.555 billion or $4.32 to $4.37 per share, and non-GAAP operating income of 1.635 billion to $1.655 billion or $4.57 to $4.62 per share. Analysts expect adjusted earnings of $4.68 on revenue of $2.75 billion.For full fiscal year 2018, Intuit expects revenue of $5.640 billion to $5.740 billion or growth of 9% to 11%, GAAP operating income of $1.485 billion to $1.535 billion or growth of 6% to 10%, non-GAAP operating income of $1.885 billion to $1.935 billion or growth of 9% to 12%, and QuickBooks Online subscribers of 3.275 million to 3.375 million.During the second quarter, Intuit launched TurboTax Live, which leverages one-way video technology to give customers access to an expert. It also built an end-to-end expert platform that enables about 2,000 certified public accountants and enrolled agents to serve customers.Intuit also launched Turbo, which provides customers a full view of their overall financial health by combining a credit score, verified income data, and a debt-to-income ratio.During the quarter, Intuit announced its plans to acquire automated time tracking and scheduling platform TSheets for $340 million. TSheets has raised $15 million in Series A funding. Already integrated with Intuit's small business offering, TSheets has more than 35,000 customers and manages more than 500,000 workers through its platform.Intuit will use TSheets to provide customers a simplified way to quickly and accurately track their time, send invoices, run payroll, and understand profitability by project. This acquisition is an acknowledgement of the growth in freelancers in the economy and the forecast. The Gig economy is expected to grow from 34% of the workforce in 2017 to 43% by 2020. It's a smart move.Intuit's competitors include The Sage Group for desktop products, Xero and FreshBooks for online accounting products, ADP, Paychex, and Gusto for payroll products, First Data, Elavon, Global Payments, FIS, PayPal, Square, and large financial institutions for merchant services, H&R Block, Blucora's TaxAct, and Credit Karma in the Consumer Tax segment, and CCH, Thomson Reuters, and DRake in professional tax offerings.Another concern for Intuit is the price pressure from free and low-priced online tax and accounting offerings.And a final concern is the US government's intention to streamline tax filing. Apparently, in 2016, Intuit and H&R Block spent $2 million and $3 million, respectively, on lobbying against it. Intuit had provided about 1.2 million free federal returns in 2016 as a member of the Free File Alliance.One area that's gaining in popularity is online lending. Intuit last year launched an offering in this realm called QuickBooks Capital to provide faster access to lower-rate small business loans of up to $35,000 with rates ranging from 2.6% to 6.8%. In 2015, it had partnered with OnDeck to launch the QuickBooks Financing Line of Credit backed by a $100 million fund. I see this as a high potential growth area.According to a recent SBA Loan Performance Report, overall volume of small business loans recorded 20% growth in Q1 2018 and is expected to grow even higher. There's no reason to limit the lending to small ticket sizes. For credible companies, Intuit could very well lend $500k or $1M, and that skill could turn the QuickBooks Financing business to an exciting component in the startup ecosystem. Whereas many small businesses that grow at a linear pace may not qualify for equity financing, they surely could qualify for debt financing. It's a domain well worth exploring at greater depth.Following the strong results, its stock is trading at $172.65 with a market cap of $44.2 billion. It hit a 52-week low of $114.8 a year ago. It hit a 52-week high of $179.3 this month."

I know what it's like to work all the time, and I know what it's like to be the head of human resources, the marketing genius responsible for all campaigns, the employee of the month, and the finance guy at the same time. When I find a service or a product that makes my life easier and saves me some time, I'm on it in a second. This is exactly what Intuit (INTU) offers small business owners with its Quickbooks Online (QBO) suites. The company has created a wide variety of useful products helping millions of self-employed and small business owners manage their finances. As the company has moved its products into the cloud and offers a great product ecosystem, INTU is on its way to double its sales level from 2010. Intuit has everything to grow for the next decade, but is it enough to make you pay a premium price for this stock?Do you want to manage your personal finance or do you care about doing your own tax reports? Are you self-employed or a small business owner looking to manage your business finances without having to pay what Procter & Gamble pays in accounting services each quarter? Then you are probably a good client for Intuit.Founded in 1983 and offering Quicken, a personal finance software, Intuit has now grown to a $5 billion revenue business serving over 42 million clients across the world. INTU is still in the ""DYI finance management"" business and operates in three segments: Small Business, Consumer Tax, and ProConnect.Source: IntuitWhile there is a continuous battle in the software business to help others manage their finances, we can say that INTU has a well-established moat. Their success is based on offering relatively cheap solutions to individuals and small businesses who need help managing their finances, but who can't pay a big firm's price.Source: YchartsINTU is on a serious roll since 2010, when the business went from $3 billion to over $5 billion in revenue. The company grew its revenue through the creation of a product ecosystem, leading one client to purchase multiples services. For example, one of its most important growth vectors is QuickBooks Online. This software helps small businesses keep track of their accounting, but also offers extension toward payroll and payments services. There are several small businesses requiring such services, as they are growing but can't pay a full-service accounting firm to handle this part of their day-to-day business.Another growth vector is the move of Intuit's software toward a cloud-based model. As you can see, the number of online customers keeps increasing year after year:Source: IntuitWhat's great about this business model is that Intuit targets clients that have a particular need, but have limited time and a limited budget. Therefore, there is an important switching cost once you use the INTU product ecosystem. Getting to know and master any accounting or personal finance software is time consuming. Once you are happy with one, the last thing you want to do is to make a switch. This is even more true for small businesses as their owners have lots of other things to take care of besides accounting.Source: YchartsThe company went into some accounting modifications in 2015, pushing EPS down temporarily. INTU registered several million in impairment charges in the value of their ecosystems and discontinued operations. INTU also changed certain desktop software offerings' accounting. Revenue for those offerings is recognized as services are delivered, rather than upfront.I like how INTU built its strategy around a recurring business model.As I mentioned it earlier, INTU product ecosystems offers great cross-selling possibilities. Once a client learns how the platform works, he or she is more inclined to buy extensions for additional services. The whole process makes Intuit products sticky.Looking ahead, Intuit growth perspectives are quite interesting. While it serves 5.4 million clients in the small business/self-employed universe, this market represents 800 million potential customers. There are a least a decade of steady growth in this field.Intuit started paying dividends in late 2011 and has never stopped increasing them since. INTU now shows seven consecutive years with a dividend increase. This makes it only three years from making the elite Dividend Achievers list. The Dividend Achievers Index refers to all public companies that have successfully increased their dividend payments for at least 10 consecutive years. At the time of writing this article, there were 265 companies that achieved this milestone. You can get the complete list of Dividend Achievers with comprehensive metrics here.Source: YchartsI know a 0.90%-1% dividend yield isn't exactly what you are looking for if you are a long-term dividend investor. However, keep in mind that the company more than doubled its payouts in the past seven years and shows a dividend CAGR of 18.02% over the past five years. The best part is that INTU has lots of room to keep future dividend increases coming.Source: YchartsWith such aggressive dividend growth policy, I would expect higher payout ratios. With both cash and payout ratios under 40%, you can definitely expect a double-digit dividend growth rate for the next decade. INTU meets my seven dividend growth investing principles.On top of raising its dividend on a consistent basis, INTU is also looking to reward shareholders through generous stock repurchase programs.Management has committed to share the wealth with its shareholders, and I wouldn't be surprised to see the stock hitting a 2% yield in a few years from now.The main problem with any tech stock is the way services and products evolve rapidly over time. While Intuit is a pioneer in this field, it had to adapt to new internet-based competitors. This is how INTU offers free basic version of many of its products in order to compete against all the free options on the internet.As Intuit tax tools are based on U.S. laws, it's difficult for the company to expand those products offshore. Each country has different tax laws and they all update them on a regular basis. Managing so many movements is limiting INTU growth potential.As is often the case with companies showing strong growth potential, INTU shares have surged over the past five years. In the last 12 months alone, INTU soared by 40% (as of Jan. 10, 2018). The stock gained 162% over the past five years (dividend excluded). This is a bit much to take for any company. You can expect some serious pullback if the market goes in the other direction. Speaking of valuation, INTU seems a bit overvalued right now.Intuit has a tradition of beating earnings expectations. The last time it failed was in 2014. Nonetheless, earnings growth are not enough to justify such a high P/E ratio:Source: YchartsAs a dividend investor, I'm not used to dealing with such a high P/E ratio business. The only other dividend payers showing such a valuation I can think of are Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA). After I reviewed both last year, I can tell you that a 40+ P/E could (surprisingly) make sense.In order to have a better view of the stock value, I tried the double-stage dividend discount model. Yeah, this is a tough one. I was able to get an ""OK"" value (the stock is trading at a 20% premium), with a 13% dividend growth rate for the first 10 years:Please read the Dividend Discount Model limitations to fully understand my calculations.Unfortunately, the stock is trading at an all-time high P/E ratio (disregarding impairment charges in 2015-16) for the past decade, and the DDM calculation doesn't justify the current price as a good entry point.This is definitely too much of a leap for me. At this point, INTU looks like a great company, but it is definitely not a good candidate for my portfolio. To be honest, I wish I had bought the stock a few years ago, but INTU wouldn't have been on my dividend radar for another three or four years anyway. I'll wait for a pullback before considering it for my portfolio.

4150520,103480,2018-02-26T00:14:46-05:00,"Intuit took a stumble after reporting Q2 earnings, with results just barely meeting estimates (unusual for a company that usually has a pattern of big beats).With softness in Q2, Intuit's ever-important Q3 (tax season) could be at risk.EPS guidance for Q3 fell short of expectations, though top-line guidance exceeded consensus.In any given year, Intuit generates nearly all of its operating profits during the Q3 tax season, which is virtually the only time period in which it sells its flagship consumer software.Effects of the new Trump tax bill on consumers' tax prep strategies are still unknown.","For the past year, Intuit (NASDAQ: INTU) has been a bit of a hot air balloon that seemed to go in only one direction: up. When I last wrote on the company, I had pondered taking a bullish position on the premise that the company was a steady gainer with no cause for pause. Q2, however, proved me wrong, when Intuit's soft results sent shares into a mild pullback.There's been a bit of a tacit understanding between Intuit and its investors: trading at a P/E ratio of greater than 30x, Intuit is hardly a cheap stock. But investors have been willing to pay such premium multiples because Intuit has always beaten earnings without fail, and by a wide margin as well. In Q2, however, Intuit barely beat consensus expectations with a dime to spare, leading investors to worry that the same weakness could extend into the company's all-important fiscal Q3, which includes the tax season.This is more than just an idle concern for Intuit investors. As seen from the company's quarterly trends sheet below, in FY17, Intuit generated about half ($2.5 billion) of its total revenues in Q3.Figure 1. Intuit quarterly resultsSource: Intuit investor relationsFurther underlining the financial importance of Q3, Intuit generated more than 100% of its operating income in FY17 in Q3 (every other quarter had been negative), as well as all of its EPS for FY17. As much as Intuit is to be applauded for having diversified its revenue base into more stable enterprise software, it still hinges heavily on consumers in April to drive revenues for its flagship TurboTax product.On the bright side, Intuit did recently announce a major update in introducing TurboTax Live, which allows taxpayers to chat live (hence the name) with a tax assistant. Intuit's game plan, after already being saturated in the DIY tax prep market, is to go after the people who usually file taxes with a CPA by providing live support. While this allows TurboTax an entry point into a different tier of customers (a $20 billion opportunity, according to the earnings call), it's unclear how successful the efforts will be come Q3.The less-than-usual beat in Q2, combined with mixed guidance for Q3 (revenue outlook was okay, but EPS estimates were a quite a bit below Wall Street's targets - considering that Intuit relies on Q3 for almost all of its EPS, this isn't a pretty sign), has investors worried that the stock may be in for a rude awakening as its growth decelerates.Despite the modest ""pullback"" (if you can even call it that) after Q2, Intuit is still up more than 40% over the past twelve months, and in recent trading sessions has recovered most of its lost ground and is back to trading above $170. Though I'm still fundamentally positive on the ubiquity and dominance of Intuit's business, I no longer believe the stock is as attractive with so many unknowns in front of it. A weak Q3 could send the stock into a deep correction; and looking longer term, it's unclear whether the massive tax changes and simplification enacted by President Trump and the Republican Congress will drive more business toward TurboTax or push people away from it. At current trading levels, Intuit's risk-reward profile has become unappealing.INTU data by YChartsHere's a look at Intuit's second quarter results:Figure 1. Intuit investor relationsSource: Intuit investor relationsTotal revenues grew 14% y/y to $1.16 billion, in-line with analyst expectations. The word in-line is a frightful one for growth investors, who are accustomed to seeing a regular pattern of quarterly beats. While Q2 isn't really a significant contributor either to the top line or the bottom line, it's still too close for comfort.The bright spots were in the company's Small Business segment, where Quickbooks saw a 51% y/y increase in subscribers. Given how heavily seasonal Intuit's business is, the continued growth of Quickbooks - which is a year-round stream of subscription revenues - is of crucial importance to the company. But with 2.8 million customers already on QuickBooks Online, it's not clear how much more of a market Intuit has left to go after. Its designated arena is in the SMB space, where Quickbooks towers over nearly every other competitor. Unfortunately, expanding upmarket doesn't seem to be a choice for Intuit, where solutions like Netsuite (now owned by Oracle (NASDAQ: ORCL)), BlackLine (NASDAQ: BL) and SAP (NYSE: SAP) reign supreme. Quickbooks doesn't have the functionality or complexity required for corporate accounting departments, and even if Intuit were to expand into an enterprise-ready ERP/finance suite, its reputation as a small business and consumer software provider will probably mar its chances with buyers in the big leagues.On the bottom line, Intuit came in essentially in-line as well. Pro forma EPS of $0.35 just barely beat consensus of $0.34 by a hair. Again, for a company that's trading at such a rich P/E multiple, investors are looking for much more. Q2 doesn't really make that much of a dent in Intuit's overall bottom-line results, but investors are hoping the softness in Q2 doesn't carry forward into Q3.From Intuit's guidance ranges, however, it appears that the outlook isn't that bright. The company's revenue guidance is fine - it's pointing to a top line of $2.785-$2.835 billion, or a growth range of 10-12%. This is better than the $2.75 billion that investors had penciled in. Note, however, that low double digit growth is still a bit of a bummer for a stock that's trading so richly (we'll check in on valuation shortly).The company's EPS guidance, however, has investors worried. After a quarter in which Intuit's EPS results just barely beat consensus, a soft earnings outlook is disappointing to see. Intuit is forecasting adjusted EPS of $4.57-$4.62 in the quarter, below the $4.68 that analysts were hoping to see.When a stock is trading as richly as Intuit, there's little room for execution hiccups like this quarter. As seen in the chart below, Intuit is currently trading at a forward P/E of 32x and forward EV/revenue multiple of 7.7x.INTU EV to Revenues (Forward) data by YChartsLet's look first at the P/E multiple. 32x is a fine multiple to pay if it came with solid earnings growth. It rather appears, however, that Intuit's earnings growth will disappoint this year. Its full-year FY18 pro forma EPS target of $5.30-$5.40 implies, at the midpoint, only 21% y/y growth over the $4.41 it achieved last year. For a stock with an earnings multiple nearly twice that of the S&P 500 (which is hovering around a 16.5-17x forward P/E), we would expect much better than ~20% earnings growth.Calculating a PEG multiple on Intuit - the 32x P/E divided by 21% earnings growth - yields a PEG of 1.52x, indicating that Intuit is overvalued even when weighing its earnings growth.The revenue multiple conveys a similar story. 7.7x is a common multiple that high-margin software stocks trade for - in fact, companies like Workday (NYSE: WDAY) and Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE) trade closer to 10x forward revenues. But these companies are also generating robust top-line growth on the order of 30% or more, thus warranting such a rich revenue multiple. When Intuit's revenue growth forecast of 10-12% for its most important quarter is only barely above industry averages, it calls to question whether Intuit deserves to trade at a revenue multiple of nearly 8x.After such an extended period of gains in Intuit stock, the stock was ripe for a breather. With Q3 at risk and many unknowns in front of it, I believe Intuit stock will trade sideways for a while.Stocks trading at premium valuations like Intuit need a consistent stream of ""beat-and-raise"" quarters that outperform current quarter targets by a wide margin as well as raise guidance for future quarters. Without the strong underlying performance that growth-chasing investors seek, companies like Intuit lose the justification for their premium multiples.There's no doubt that the tax landscape is changing - the doubled standard deduction will greatly simplify taxes for many Americans and shrink the already-small number of itemizers. But whether this change will drive previously tax-assisted preparers to TurboTax, or drive current TurboTax users away from the software (which, without a special deal, isn't exactly cheap) and onto pen-and-paper, isn't yet clear. Looking longer term, I think Intuit will be fine, but with growth creeping into the single digits and with many near-term uncertainties, the stock will be challenged to continue outperforming the broader market like it did in 2017."
4126912,103480,2017-11-21T14:42:12-05:00,"Intuit has quietly outperformed against expectations for the past year, supporting a 34% YTD rise in its stock.On its small business segment, the company is seeing success growing its Quickbooks Online offering, converting its core customers into cloud subscribers.For consumers, Intuit launched TurboTax Live in September, allowing customers to videochat with tax professionals, helping Intuit to grab share against professional tax preparers.Intuit is forecasting an acceleration in revenue growth through 1H18, and its full-year forecast looks conservative and easily beaten.","As a provider of consumer and small-business software, Intuit (NASDAQ: INTU) doesn't get as much of the spotlight as its enterprise software peers do. For the better part of a year, however, Intuit has been quietly gaining against expectations and executing well against its strategy to attract more subscription revenues, build an ecosystem around its core products, and continue gaining share in the tax prep market. Intuit's core products, QuickBooks and TurboTax, already seem like massive and dominant offerings with little room left to grow, but according to a recent investor deck that Intuit published, professional tax preparers still own 46% of total returns in the U.S. and Canada as well as 69% of the spend. Intuit, on the other hand, captures only 10% of total dollars spent on tax preparation.Intuit's first quarter of FY18 was an affirmation of its growth potential. Revenues grew 14% y/y, beating analyst expectations and accelerating both sequentially over 4Q17's 12% growth rate and over the prior Q1's growth rate of 9%. For a company at Intuit's scale (it generated $5.2 billion in revenue and $1.4 billion in operating income in FY17), the ability to not only grow at double digits, but accelerate growth while not sacrificing profit margins, is a rare feat.Both of the company's key segments, Small Business and Consumer, saw accelerated revenue growth in Q1 and made significant progress toward key strategic initiatives. On the small business side, Intuit managed to grow its QuickBooks Online subscribers 42% y/y to 3.4 million subscribers, in-line with its strategy to shift more customers away from its ephemeral desktop offering and more toward its recurring, hosted online version. On the consumer side, the company's September launch of TurboTax Live - which allows customers to consult with tax professionals via videochat and get their questions answered live - helps tremendously against Intuit's goal of ""transforming the assisted tax prep"" space and gaining more share against the pro tax preparation industry, which still captures the majority of spend during tax season.By no means is Intuit a cheap or substantially undervalued stock; it's a growth play. Based on the company's FY18 revenue guidance of $5.64 - $5.74 billion in revenue (+10% y/y at the midpoint) and EPS guidance of $4.00 - $4.05, the company trades at 7.1x EV/FY18 revenues and 38.5x FY18 EPS. The stock, as shown in the year-to-date chart below, is already up 34% this year:INTU data by YChartsIntuit, however, is an execution story that deserves its premium valuation. There's no reason why, given 14% y/y revenue growth in Q1 and a forecast for 14-16% y/y growth in Q2, that the company's full-year revenue guidance should only call for 9% to 11% y/y growth. Its expectations look understated, leaving room for outperformance as the company reaches past muted goals.For the unfamiliar, Intuit operates in two primary segments, Small Business and Consumer. QuickBooks is the flagship product in the small business segment, which combines bookkeeping software along with payroll solutions and payment processing capabilities. For consumers, TurboTax is the primary Intuit offering, which helps individuals to maximize deduction and e-file their taxes.As seen in the table below from Intuit's most recent 10-K, the company derived a roughly even split of revenues between the two segments, with 50% owing to small business and 42% owing to consumer. The remaining 8% derives from Intuit's ProConnect software, aimed directly at professional accountants:Figure 1. Intuit segment mixSource: Intuit 10-KSmall business revenues grew 17% y/y in Q1 (an acceleration over 12% y/y growth in 1Q17) and consumer revenues grew 7% y/y in Q1 (an acceleration over flat growth in 1Q17) And despite market-leading presences for QuickBooks and TurboTax, Intuit believes there's still plenty of room for growth.In the small business segment, Intuit's primary focus is transitioning to an online, cloud-based subscription model and becoming more of an integrated SaaS accounting offering, much like Netsuite is for larger enterprises. This offering is marketed as ""QuickBooks Online,"" (QBO) and total subscribers to QBO grew 56% y/y in Q1 to 2.55 million. According to Intuit's investor deck, nine of ten QBO customers are completely new to Intuit offerings, suggesting that its push into cloud isn't just about converting existing customers, but also opens doors into a greenfield, untapped market opportunity for customers who need an agile, cloud-based offering.Intuit is also seeing success with extending QuickBooks' capabilities and becoming more of a platform offering, with additional capabilities beyond simple bookkeeping - making QuickBooks resemble more of an enterprise software offering with multiple extensions, instead of a simple, single-use case product. PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL), Shopify (NYSE: SHOP), Square (NASDAQ: SQ) and Bill.com all provide third-party applications built for Quickbooks, and the company is opening up its platform to encourage additional developer extensions. Creating an ecosystem around the QuickBooks brand solidifies its position as a cloud offering that ""plays well"" with other applications, inducing customers to stay subscribed on the platform.On the consumer side, TurboTax is already the leading software product for the DIY consumers, but as shown in the chart below, the majority of returns (and spending on tax preparation) is still captured by professional tax preparers:Figure 2. TurboTax market shareSource: Intuit investor deckIntuit's September 2017 launch of TurboTax Live is a huge step at beginning to crack some of the ""pro"" market, highlighted in green above. Many consumers - especially those with more complicated needs at tax time - will never let go of having in-person conversations to discuss tax topics, and are uncomfortable with simply having TurboTax's software figure everything out behind the scenes. As seen on the right side of the chart, TurboTax's live tax sessions have increased dramatically since the launch, enabling Intuit to go after these types of customers and extend beyond its current 10% share of tax spending. The company believes this strategic initiative of ""transform assisted,"" or changing the way consumers interact with tax preparers, is its largest opportunity for growth.Overall, when combining the small business and consumer segments as well as factoring in international opportunities (in FY17, international revenue represented less than 5% of the total revenue base), Intuit believes its total TAM to be $145 billion. At its current forecast of $5.64 billion to $5.74 billion in revenues for FY18, the company is less than 5% penetrated.Intuit started fiscal 2018 strong, posting total revenues of $886 million (+14% y/y), a four-point beat over Wall Street consensus of $856 million (+10% y/y). As previously mentioned, this an acceleration over the previous quarter's 12% growth and the prior year Q1 growth of 9%. The chart below, taken from Intuit's earnings press release, shows the company's quarterly growth trajectory:Figure 3. Intuit quarterly growth trendsSource: Intuit investor relationsThe small business (QuickBooks) segment remains the biggest driver of growth, with revenues of $694 million up 17% y/y. QuickBooks Online subscribers grew to 2.55 million, up 56% y/y. Consumers (TurboTax), despite being in the off-season and not contributing too much to the top line, also saw accelerated 7% y/y growth to $78 million in Q1 revenues.The company was also able to slightly expand its operating margin - pro forma operating income of $43 million, which adds back stock comp and one-time items to GAAP net income, represented a 5% margin, up slightly over 1Q17 margin of 4%.Pro forma EPS of $0.11 was also a substantial beat over Wall Street consensus of $0.05.Intuit also maintains a relatively clean balance sheet, with cash and investments of $808 million as of Q1 balancing out debt of $825 million. The company spent $170 million on buybacks in Q1 and announced a dividend of $0.39 per share (+15% y/y) for Q2, amounting to an approximately 1% yield.Despite this quarter's beat, Intuit stock fell ~2% in post-market trading after its earnings release, as guidance largely fell in-line with expectations. The company is forecasting FY18 revenue of $5.64 - $5.74 billion, implying 10% y/y growth at the midpoint and exactly in-line with consensus of $5.69 billion.Intuit is also guiding to pro forma operating income of $1.885 - $1.935 billion and pro forma EPS of $4.90 - $5.00, a 12% jump over FY17 pro forma EPS of $4.41.There are two key notes to observe on this quarter's guidance: first, it's true that full-year guidance is only in-line, but it appears starkly conservative. Intuit achieved 14% y/y revenue growth in Q1 and is guiding to Q2 revenues of $1.16 - $1.18 billion, up 15% y/y at the midpoint. After two consecutive quarters of revenue acceleration in the first half of FY18, is it really realistic for Intuit to be guiding to 9-11% y/y growth for FY18? Hitting that guidance would imply severe deceleration in the back half of the year, which runs completely contrary to historical comps. As seen in the quarterly growth chart above, Intuit saw the biggest growth numbers in the back half of FY17, during peak tax season for the consumer business. Growth in 3Q17 and 4Q17 were 10% and 12%, respectively, up from 9% growth in 1Q17 and 10% growth in 2Q17. If Intuit can repeat this pattern this year and hold its 14-15% growth rate in the second half, it's bound to overachieve relative to muted guidance that calls for only 10% growth at the midpoint.With the launch of TurboTax Live, it's more than likely that Intuit will make progress toward its goal of taking more share from the professional tax prep market and see a meaningful bump in its consumer revenues in Q3. Intuit, as many companies do, is setting easy hurdles to jump over. Investors shouldn't react negatively and sell off the stock.The second important note to mention: based on Intuit's pro forma operating income guidance for FY18, it's implying a 34% operating margin (at the midpoint of the guidance range) on 10% of revenue growth (which, as just discussed, may be overly conservative). Intuit's ""growth plus margin"" is 44%, exceeding the so-called ""Rule of 40"" that governs the profitability relative to growth of software stocks. Companies whose growth percentage plus operating margin exceeds 40, like Intuit, are generally considered superior investment choices and worth premium multiples.The pullback in Intuit's stock post-Q1 earnings is one of the classic well-timed opportunities to buy into growth stock. There's no reason for Intuit to be declining on the back of a strong earnings beat and in-line guidance that appears extremely conservative and easily beatable. The company is more likely to achieve 12-13% revenue growth in FY18 than the 9-11% it guided, if growth trends hold.Given the progress seen in both of Intuit's major product lines, QuickBooks and TurboTax, outperformance seems to be the more likely outcome. QuickBooks' increase in Online subscriptions brings a lot of customers who are entirely new to the platform, and new business is also being driven by QuickBooks' new extensions to third-party applications. TurboTax Live is also a major update to the consumer side of the Intuit business, allowing the company to begin weaning off customers who insist on live consultations with tax preparers during tax season and bring them into the TurboTax fold.At present, Intuit is a ~$6 billion top-line company, but with revenue growth showing strong double-digit growth and accelerating over FY17, Intuit has clearly marked a path to $10 billion and beyond - especially as its TAM analysis shows that it's less than 5% penetrated when considering international expansion, which, to date, hasn't been aggressively pursued yet. When combining Intuit's growth opportunities along with its history of strong execution as well as 30%-plus operating margins, Intuit checks off all the boxes of a solid software investment, as the Rule of 40 would suggest. While the stock has already yielded impressive gains in 2017, 1Q18 earnings affirm the thesis that Intuit is set up for a continued run in FY18, and the stock should continue to enjoy superior gains relative to the broader market."
4101173,52852,2017-08-23T03:11:05-04:00,"FY4Q17 earnings are strong across the board.However, FY1Q18 guidance was disappointing, and FY18 EPS missed, offset by better-than-consensus FY18 revenue guidance.Net, I think investors will overlook the mixed guidance given the bullish commentaries given during the call.","Intuit (INTU) reported FY4Q17 earnings on 8/22, after the close. While the quarter was strong, guidance is more mixed. However, judging from the bullish metrics provided during the call, and the fact that the EPS shortfall is likely driven by increased investments in the business, I believe investors will largely overlook the FY EPS guidance ""miss"".Revenue for the quarter was $842.0M vs $809.2M consensus, while EPS came in at $0.20, which beat consensus by 3 cents. Looking at revenues, every segment beat consensus except for Online Ecosystems, which came in at $223M vs consensus of $235.3M - not a material thing in my view. The quarter posted non-GAAP operating margin of 9.3%, which is a meaningful 120 bps above consensus estimates. Ending QuickBooks online subscribers came in slightly ahead of consensus at 2.38M, beating consensus by 0.04M, and implying a 58% y/y growth rate -- if you are not familiar with the stock, this is an important metric and thus an important beat.However, guidance is disappointing. FY1Q18 revenue was guided to $840M-$860M vs consensus of $850.9M, just missing at the mid point. FY1Q18 EPS guidance missed by a larger margin at $0.03-$0.05 vs $0.11 consensus. FY18 EPS was guided to $4.90-$5.00 vs $5.03 consensus, while revenue was guided to $5.64B-$5.74B vs $5.57B consensus.In a separate press release, INTU announced that its long-time CFO (since January 2008) will step down in January 2018 -- he will be replaced by someone internal.The CallIn the call, management had a lot of great things to say about QuickBooks Online (QBO). For example, improvements to QBO experiences lead to a 22 point improvement in net promoter score - impressive. Investors also enjoyed accelerating growth as subscriber growth accelerated to 58% this quarter vs. 41% last year. The acceleration is also broad based as US sub growth accelerated to +53% from 41% last year, and international accelerated to a whopping 75% from 45% last year. Obviously they are doing something right as net promoter score also improved in every country.Importantly, management said that they continue QBO to grow ""north of 40% , and we now expect online ecosystem revenue to grow more than 30% over the next few years. That is up from our previous guidance of 25% to 30%."" Wow!The company said they will increase investments in the business, which at least partially responsible for the shortfall in the FY EPS guide. In the call, the CFO said:This commentary, combined with strong QBO performance, suggests that INTU is increasing investments to go after a strong market. Investors should take this as bullish commentary, although it is difficult to predict the market's reaction as we saw in the case of Amazon.Another thing that I found interesting was the CEO's commentary that ""Self-Employed is one of the more exciting things I've seen in my 15 years here."" In my view, new technologies, business services and online platforms have really reached a critical mass that will likely drive an acceleration in self-employment, creating a relatively new investment theme investors should keep in mind. Here is a decent June 2017 Forbes article on why self-employment is accelerating. Of course, one of the key beneficiaries of this emerging trend will be INTU. (Follow me as I plan to write about this emerging theme in the near future.)I think the quarter was quite strong across the board. I'm impressed by the accelerating QBO growth and improvement in net promoter score. FY18 guidance was more mixed since it will be more back end loaded than expected (given both FY1Q18 revenue and EPS guidance missed consensus) and FY18 EPS is a bit below consensus, which is offset by better revenue guidance. However, the call made it clear that the market is very strong and that INTU is investing to strengthen its technology and operations. Investors should welcome more investments, especially given management's bullish outlook for growth over the next 3 years. I like what I see! Remember, Investor Day is on October 3rd, 2017, which could be another catalyst for the stock."
4101682,33291,2017-08-24T14:01:00-04:00,Intuit has just released its fiscal Q4 and fiscal 2017 earnings reports and we discuss the results as well as our thoughts on the stock at present levels.We evaluatate segment performance and critical metrics to determine if the valuation is justified.The company is taking several steps to boost shareholder value to offset the reduced pace of earnings growth.We discuss why we believe you should wait for a better price as earnings growth is not keeping pace with the multiple expansion.,"Intuit (INTU) has just reported earnings and the Street is having a mixed reaction, first buying the news, and now selling it. The stock has had a good run year, rising 30% in this time, but is trading at a very expensive 40 times trailing earnings. Such a premium valuation is fine, so long as the growth in earnings is there to support such a valuation. We are of the opinion that the stock is definitely not a bargain here, as guidance, while decent for fiscal 2018, does not necessarily justify this valuation. We would want to see this stock fall before recommending any buying. That said, segment performance has been strong. Are better days ahead? Let's check in on the name to see where we are at.The truth is that performance is generally stellar for the name. A cursory glance at the last few years of earnings show that the company historically beats on the top and bottom line almost every single quarter with just a few exceptions. That helps drive the premium. It simply delivers results, pays a little dividend, and continues to offer growth. It is quietly one of the better performers in 2017. That said, to justify the valuation, one need to ensure that we have growth. Well, here in Q2, we saw revenues climb. Revenue as a whole came in at $842 billion, and this beat estimates by $37 million. However, this was also up 11.7% year-over-year, continuing a string of winning quarters on the top line. In addition, the pace of rising revenues seems to be picking up steam.The company’s two segments performed exceptionally in the fiscal year. The Small Business Segment is a real winner and saw its subscriber base grow 53% in the U.S, while Quickbooks subscriptions rose 75% internationally. These facts drove the segment's revenues up 14% in the quarter and 13% on year over year basis. As for the consumer tax revenue, it grew by 9%. Outstanding!While sales were a strong, operating income really impressed. I was pleased to see that adjusted operating income grew to $78 million up from $36 million a year ago. This is a solid 117% increase. What drove this increase? Well, the 12% boost in revenues was strong but expenses were well controlled. Total costs and expenses were just $852 million compared to $810 million last year, rising just 5%. Clearly, the revenue growth outpaced expense growth and that is a very positive sign. Keep an eye on that going forward.In terms of cash flow, Intuit produced $1.6 billion from operations in the year, rising from $1.4 billion last year. The company ended the quarter with a cash balance of $529 million. This was the only small blemish on the quarter, as cash was down from $638 million a year ago. Factoring everything in, the company saw earnings of $0.20 per share. This actually beat estimates by $0.03.The ultimate question of course is where do we go from here? Now it is time to look ahead. We feel that share prices have limited upside, mainly due to what we note in figure 1. The name is performing admirably, but the valuation is now stretched. As you can see share price has grown, as have earnings and the multiple, but the multiple has grown at the greatest rate. This means the name is priced for perfection, and that any mistake could send the name marked lower.Figure 1. 5 Year Share Price, Earnings, and Multiple Expansion of Intuit.Source: Historical earnings and author calculations in excelAs you can see, the company' stock has continued to rise. While the earnings bars aren't that prominent the labels indicate the growth. We have added a trend line to demonstrate the overall expanding multiple. 2015 was a bit of a blip year as shown in the earnings, but the key here is that the multiple has expanded as earnings have grown. But looking ahead, the company is going to see the pace of earnings slow. Some of this is made up for by management attempting to be shareholder friendly.To boost value, the company has been buying back shares and bought $360 million worth in Q4 alone. The company may be overpaying here, but it does drive earnings higher. A dividend of $0.39 was declared for fiscal Q1, so investors get that dividend In addition to growth. Looking ahead, for fiscal 2018, sales should grow another 9 to 11%, with adjusted earnings per share growing 11% to 13%. While that is impressive, the stock is still pricey for that level of growth. We had been seeing strong double digit percentage growth in the last two years, now the growth will slow to possibly single digits if there is a slow quarter or two. The valuation makes a buy call here unjustifiable right now. One bad quarter could derail the momentum. Let the name pull back under $125 before considering buying.Quad 7 Capital has been a leading contributor with Seeking Alpha since early 2012.

Today is a good day because I have unearthed a great business that I wish I would have bought last year. Intuit Inc (NASDAQ:INTU) (reporting tomorrow after the close) is a growing business that develops financial software targeted at simplifying the life of consumers and small business owners. Intuit's mission per their latest 10-K annual report:Their growth strategy is to be the operating system behind small business success and do taxes in the US and Canada. Intuit is organized under three reportable segments: Small Business, Consumer Tax and ProConnect.Taking data from their fact sheet, I summarized some relevant facts below.In the first quarter segment revenue grew 9% over the prior year quarter and segment income grew 4%. Quickbooks online subscribers grew 41%. The second quarter guidance reflects another 41% year over year growth in subscribers.The yellow column I created above is based on a conservative target provided in the fact sheet with my own estimate by segment. This implies a 13% growth in segment revenue and 13% growth in total segment operating income.source: Yahoo Finance.I think that analysts are a bit conservative on the expected earnings growth considering the rate of subscribers growth and the revenue guidance provided.While the second quarter is relevant, the third quarter is what is really important due to the seasonality of the consumer tax business. The fiscal year end is July 31st, and thus the third quarter ends April 30th. For the last three fiscal years the total revenue in the third quarter represented nearly half the total revenue for those years. The negative operating income in the consumer tax group in the first quarter should not cause alarm. The previous fiscal year tells the story of how the second and third quarters drive the results of this segment.My outlook is another strong turbotax unit growth rate in fiscal year 2017 based on the best in class offering. Per the turbotax website, I found the reviews overall very positive. I've also used the software and found it extremely user friendly. Their offering also includes expert live help and 24/7 support. The opportunity remains getting more people to use the turbotax software and step away from mom-and-pop and other traditional accounting services which continue to make up the majority of returns. Quickbooks also is dominant in the market with the only major competitor being Peachtree.A quick competitive analysis demonstrates that INTU justifiably trades at a premium valuation. First consider the return on invested capital versus peers H&R Block (NYSE:HRB) and Liberty Tax (NASDAQ:TAX-OLD).data source: MorningstarAlso, if you consider the free-cash flow generation, INTU outshines peers as well. The drop in 2016 was due to a large increase in capital spending.data source: MorningstarThe challenge going forward and what to watch out for is building more trust with clients, holding a high retention rate, and taking people who work with pencil and paper and transitioning them into the turbotax software. A large opportunity remains for this growth stock. INTU has outperformed peers in just about every measurable category other than valuation, and I expect their outperformance to continue into the foreseeable future.

4100640,103537,2017-08-21T09:57:34-04:00,Outperforming the market by investing in tax preparation.Reviewing industry trends and company financials.Examining industry and company risks.,"Tax preparation and accounting stocks have had a nice run in recent years with solid demand as economies remain stable, small businesses expand, low unemployment rate and a solid population expansion in developing countries.Digital efforts for online income tax preparation have taken off in recent years with millions of individuals looking for the best and cheapest way to report income and other taxes.2 notable players, Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) and H&R Block (NYSE:HRB), have seen consistent growth over the years and are poised to continue that trend. Both companies report their quarterly earnings in the next 2 weeks.These companies, focused on customer expansion, cost management and operational efficiency have solid growth and value prospects that we believe will outperform the overall market in years to come. Over the past 5 years, both Intuit and H&R Block have outperformed the S&P500.The company operates in 3 segments: Small Business, Consumer Tax and ProConnect. Its small business segment includes financial accounting and payroll services, consumer tax includes its TurboTax product to allow individuals to submit their tax forms and ProConnect offers accounting and tax services for professional accountant in the United States and Canada.(Note: 1 year price chart for INTU, Money.net)The company has seen substantial and consistent growth over the past several years on behalf of its continued product innovation and offerings alongside rising employment in its consumer tax segment which generates 42% of revenues, rising over 10% year over year. Its international expansion has further aided market share growth and recent acquisitions are boosting inorganic sales and profit within the SMB (Small Business) segment.Notably, the company's online tax preparation software, QuickBooks Online for businesses and QuickBook Self-Employed for self-employed individuals, grew sequentially at a rapid pace of 59% and 100%, respectively.Intuit's market share capture and rapid growth in the self-employed market estimated to cover over 9M people, according to the Department of Labor Statistics, is a key growth driver and allows it to stay ahead of smaller players and ward off some competitors with customer retention.A look into Intuit's sales growth over the years alongside expectations for 2017 and 2018 shows a solid growth rate holding strong:Earnings growth shows a very similar picture with a solid uptick since 2015 and upbeat projections heading to FY 2018.Operation income should remain under some pressure in the upcoming quarters due to higher operating expenses on higher promotional, acquisition and expansion costs. The company expects, however, that higher revenues and cost cutting should minimize the effects on operating income.The company provides income tax return assistance for individuals and digital do-it-yourself services. The company operates in the United States, Canada, Australia and their respective territories.(Note: 1 year price chart for HRB, Money.net)The company is consistently working on enhancing its client base by expanding its product portfolio and its DIY (Do-It-Yourself) category. New digital initiatives should enhance monetization for its digital offerings and push solid sales growth as seen by historical sales figures and future expectations:A look at the company's profitability paints a slightly more optimistic picture:The company is working to aggressively lower costs and enhance operational efficiency through different initiatives which should help boost earnings growth over the long run.A major risk for the overall industry is stiff competition. With the likes of Paycom Software (NYSE:PAYC) and Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP), market share growth will be limited over the long run with client retention efforts and promotional activity to draw new customers.A further risk is the nature of the accounting business where sales are determined by client relations. Intuit has done a fine job maintaining good relationships over the years but we expect other companies to focus heavily on this retention aspect and create a higher degree of competition.Looking at sales and earnings growth alone, we see that Intuit is enjoying a stronger market share in the SMB and individual consumer tax segments, a trend that will likely continue throughout the upcoming years.A further compelling argument for Intuit is its low debt (~$500M) with a healthy cash flow vs. H&R Block which holds $1.49B in long term debt, paying roughly $22M in interest expense quarterly. This will hurt cash flows in the long run and create an unsustainable shareholder value environment. Intuit should continue to enjoy a healthy cash flow and shareholder value offering.Overall, we believe Intuit will generate solid returns through the upcoming years and outperform market benchmarks and peers with a solid online presence, inorganic growth and diverse business."
4038093,21933,2017-01-19T17:28:48-05:00,"Intuit moving into a services-based, subscription model.Intuit has divested Quicken.CEO Smith continues to shine.","Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) held its annual shareholder meeting on January 19, 2017. As always, Intuit's meeting is one of the best to attend in the Bay Area because of CEO Brad Smith's preparation and ambassador-like demeanor. This year, Intuit's food spread included a delicious coffee brand I'd never seen before - Equator Coffees and Teas - literally a nice perk.CEO Smith's presentation followed his pattern of guiding Intuit - a 34-year old company ""born in the era of DOS"" - into his long-term vision of becoming a services-based, global company. The company's focus continues to be in the U.S. and Canada, where 95% of the profits are generated. Of all the goals in Intuit's game plan, this figure is disappointing after hearing for years of Intuit's desire to expand internationally. Its technical staff continues to be based primarily in California and India (pp. 19, 10K), but it seems unable to get a business foothold in other countries. CEO Smith, ever the optimist, said Intuit continues to be ""constructively dissatisfied"" and is ""starting to get momentum outside the U.S.""Curiously, on February 1, 2016, Intuit gained access to a five-year credit line of $1.5 billion, leaving $1 billion in ""ammunition"" after retiring debentures issued in 2007 (pp. 23, 10K). On this particular banking deal, Intuit did very well - its 5.75% bonds are being retired with a 2% credit line (about 0.5% above LIBOR). I predict Intuit will buy a smaller company, perhaps Palo Alto-based Adaptive Insights, or a private company specializing in machine learning. It currently has the option of leasing IBM products for machine learning without disclosing PII to third parties, but if all of their other algorithms are in-house, it seems Intuit would want its machine learning (i.e., ""personal, anticipate, populate"") and business intelligence programs to be wholly owned as well. The most interesting data point I heard this year was that the chances of a small business surviving in its first few years increases by 89% if the business owner is linked to an accountant.Intuit's goal of moving into a services-based, subscription model also seems to require it to boost its accounting expertise portfolio, especially with regards to improving Quickbooks Online. (""As we continue to transition our business to more connected services, we become more dependent on the continuing operation and availability of our information technology and communication systems and those of our external service providers."" - pp. 15, 10K.) Intuit's transition to the ""cloud"" (rather than just CD-ROMs sold through third-party retailers) has led it to divest Quicken - which was only about 2% of its profits - and focus on integrating all of its products across platforms within a broad, diverse ecosystem.The Q&A session was excellent. CEO Smith did not limit people who asked questions and involved members of his executive team when appropriate. One person asked why he had to pay an additional 20 to 30 dollars to file his state taxes when the transmission cost of his federal return was zero to the federal government.It turns out that the cost goes directly to Intuit, not a third-party transmitter or entity. Why? Complying with each state's tax rules involves new work for Intuit. CEO Smith explained that 44 states had their own tax codes, and the value came from Intuit's work trying to maximize tax credits and deductions based on each state's individual tax codes - which change each year.I was concerned about privacy and third-party security in the era of ""big data."" I asked what Intuit did with customer data, and whether it shared that data with third parties without full anonymizing. I expected to hear that Intuit sold some of the insights it gained from its data to third parties because doing so would be highly profitable. However, CEO Smith firmly stated that Intuit did not sell any customer data and did not share any customer data without express permission. It's ""not our data, it's the customer's"" and Intuit does ""not sell that data."" Moreover, it complies not only with U.S. laws but also EU laws relating to privacy coming from Brussels.I wanted to be absolutely sure CEO Smith wasn't putting me on, even though his statements were unequivocally pro-consumer and pro-privacy. (Data is the new gold in Silicon Valley, after all.) I asked a similar question about privacy and data sharing in a follow-up question. He reiterated his stance, and then asked Intuit's general counsel, Laura Fennell, to confirm that no third parties gain access to Intuit's data without express user consent. She immediately confirmed his statements and later explained to me after the meeting that although IBM's Watson was mentioned during the presentation, Intuit can rent IBM's Watson and extract its own insights without sharing any data with IBM.My final question related to the Free File Alliance, an agreement with the federal government. Intuit's 10K makes this program sound as if it's preventing the IRS from directly competing with Intuit's software: ""The current agreement with the Free File Alliance is scheduled to expire in October 2020. We anticipate that governmental encroachment at both the federal and state levels may present a continued competitive threat to our business for the foreseeable future"" (pp. 14, 10K). However, when I asked CEO Smith about the Alliance (no Star Wars figures included, unfortunately), he said it was merely a way to get taxpayers below a certain income threshold a way to get online and do their taxes more efficiently. ""Voluntary compliance"" is the goal from Intuit's standpoint, and it is working with IRS to assist taxpayers who would otherwise use pen and paper or not file at all. He added that the idea of assisting lower income taxpayers fits into Intuit's mission, which is to serve the community and the nation. Stirring words, indeed, but I suspect there's much more behind the scenes between state government tax agencies and Intuit. Many years ago, I remember seeing a former CEO become almost frothy when asked about the government's encroachment into Intuit's business.Overall, Intuit continues to focus on serving consumers and adapting to technological change. Having beaten Microsoft's attempts to win away its customers, its biggest challenge now is adapting to the cloud and its new ways of doing business - at least until it figures out how to expand internationally at a faster pace.Disclosures: I like Intuit's corporate culture and may apply for employment. As of January 20, 2017, I own an insignificant number of Intuit shares, but my holdings may change at any time. Nothing herein constitutes investment advice. You are responsible for your own due diligence."
3991531,97486,2016-07-26T12:00:24-04:00,"Enterprise software maker SGPYY has always impressed me. but does its U.S. rival, INTU, have the same appeal?Using my five free cash flow tests I see whether INTU is an appealing investment for more in-depth research.INTU passes all except the valuation tests, suggesting it is a high-quality company but one that could use a price drop to make it a compelling buy.","It has been a couple of months since my last ""FCF 5"" review. This has been mostly due to the fact that my attention has been heavily focused on companies with which I am largely already familiar. Yet recently a ""new"" company (at least from an analysis perspective) came into my view: Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU).Intuit is no doubt familiar to many of you. As the producer of financial software like QuickBooks and TurboTax a large number of you may well be frequent users of its products. I am not a user at present. Yet I am for one of its main rivals: British-peer The Sage Group (OTCPK:SGPYY).I have been watching Sage Group for many years now. Yet so far I have not found what I considered a good point to open a holding despite its clear quality. Nonetheless, Sage Group's attractions have focused my attention upon the potential appeals of Intuit. Here I will see whether Intuit is worthy of this attention by running my five FCF tests.These five FCF tests form the first steps in my analysis of a company. Although far from exhaustive, they give me a good indication of its competitive advantages, its FCF health and efficiency as well as the debt and dividend position. Fair value based on FCF alone is also calculated. These tests merely mark the first step in what may develop into a more thorough analysis of the business in the future.So how does Intuit do? Let's take a look.A Little About IntuitLet's start with a little more about the company. Intuit derives most of its revenue from three segments: small business (QuickBooks), consumer tax (TurboTax) and professional tax (ProSeries). Their small business and consumer tax segments headed by their QuickBooks and TurboTax software dominates their revenue streams:Unlike Sage Group, however, over 95% of Intuit's revenue is derived from the US market alone. International revenue in countries such as the UK, Singapore, Canada, Australia and India contribute only a little to top or bottom line performance.Increasingly Intuit has shifted its business from selling its products as a one-off purchase of a product to a more service-based, online ""cloud"" subscription model:This has, importantly, resulted in revenues becoming even more transparent as now nearly three-quarters of revenues come from subscriptions. All told, this is an attractive long-term shift from the company. It operates a business which delivers software which simplifies people's lives, maintains loyalty through the modest learning curve required in their use and which encourages customers to pay to use their software on a rolling subscription basis. There is little not to like in that.So how does it fare against our tests?1: Positive Free Cash FlowFirst off is a simple one. All I want to see is that Intuit has managed to generate positive FCF consistently over the last decade. So how does Intuit do? Very well indeed:With strong OCF (operating cash flow) and low CapEx (capital expenditure) due to its capital light nature as a software company, it presents a compelling FCF record. Indeed, Intuit has seen its FCF grow at a CAGR of about 9.1% over the last decade. Very impressive. More encouragingly still, up to Q3 2016 it looked as though Intuit should easily generate FCF at least as good as in previous years.A simple start, maybe, but an impressive PASS to get Intuit off the mark.2: CROIC: Cash Return on Invested CapitalNext we get a little more in-depth. Here we turn to Intuit's CROIC-that is, cash return on invested capital. This we calculate by taking the FCF and dividing it by the sum of its invested capital (that is, total debt and shareholders' equity).What we want to see is a CROIC above 10%. A CROIC of 10% would mean that for every $100 of invested capital, the company would generate $10 in FCF. This would represent an attractive return. In the case of Intuit, it easily surpasses this target:Indeed, the average over the last decade sits at 26.7%. What is more, as you can see, in the last few years it has been generating FCF even more efficiently than that and in coming years I'd expect to see that average lift higher into the 30%+ area. Indeed at Q3 time, their CROIC suggested that despite an increase in debt the FY2016 CROIC figure will be in-line with last years number.Again, Intuit puts together a compelling PASS here.3: FCF to Debt RatioNext it is time to give the debt levels a little more thought. Chiefly I want to see debt levels which are generously covered by FCF. I am, therefore, looking for a FCF/Debt ratio of 25% or more. What this would mean is that, theoretically, Intuit could repay its entire debt load in about four years using only FCF. In practice, this is unlikely as they have other demands on FCF such as dividends and interest repayments. Nonetheless, it gives us a nice indication of the strength of the balance sheet.So how does Intuit do? Very well indeed:In 2015 their FCF covered their debt nearly 2.5 times. In other words, with a little under 5 months of FCF Intuit could pay off the entirety of its total debt. Very impressive.Since FY2015, however, Intuit's debt has doubled to $1 billion. Clearly this impacts its FCF/Debt ratio. Assuming a similar FCF figure as 2015, this would still leave debt covered about 1.25 times by FCF. Less, certainly, but still meaning that it would take less than 10 months of FCF to pay off the debt load.Intuit therefore puts together another comprehensive PASS.4: FCF YieldIntuit has never been a high-yielder. It only started to pay a dividend in 2012 and since then, the yield has hovered around the 1% mark despite growing at a rate of about 13.5% per year:However, what concerns me most here is the health of the dividend and the potential for future growth. What I am looking for, therefore, is a FCF yield (that is, the dividend yield if they paid out their entire FCF) of 3.5% or more. Also, I would like to see the FCF payout ratio of 75% or less. Here Intuit again does very well:Again, it is hard to argue against Intuit. Sure its starting yield based on 2015's distribution is currently low at 0.88%. However, based on the likely $1.20 dividend for 2016 (three $0.30 dividends have already been paid) the yield remains around the 1.05% mark.Yet with a very low payout ratio of less than 25% there is plenty of scope for rapid growth in the future.Intuit leaves this test with a comfortable PASS once again.5: FCF ValuationNow we come to the all-important valuation point. Here I use the EV/FCF (enterprise value to FCF) ratio instead of the PE to ascertain fair value. All I ask is for the current share price to sit below the FCF fair value generated from this.First off we need to ascertain what the EV/FCF average has been over the last decade:In this case it is running at 18. As there are no outliers (years either 1.5 times greater or 0.5 times lower than the average) this figure becomes our fair value EV/FCF ratio.We now have to predict the FCF figure for the next two years. I have provided a more detailed explanation on how I work this out elsewhere. Using this method suggests FCF figures of $1.36 billion and $1.48 billion in FCF in 2016 and 2017, respectively. I then average these two FCF figures (making $1.42 billion) and feed this back into the EV/FCF calculation at the historic multiple of 18.Doing so provides us with a EV/FCF fair value of around $92 per share. That is a quite remarkable 22% below the current share price of $113. As a result, on this basis Intuit FAILED the FCF value test.ConclusionComing into this analysis I had expected good things from Intuit based on my experience following its peer Sage Group for so long. Intuit certainly did not disappoint. It is clearly a high-quality company with a strong cash-generation history. It passed all but the FCF valuation test comfortably revealing it to be a company that is well worth watching.Even if the share price was at $92 the likely 2016 full year dividend of $1.20 would still only amount to a yield of 1.3%. Intuit has certainly earned a place on my watchlist. It is a compelling company with remarkable dividend growth potential as well as what seems to be significant potential for growth outside of its core, home market of the US.The only sticking point for me is its valuation. Right now, in light of its quality and impressive ability to continue to produce robust growth in tough markets I would perhaps tentatively revise the fair value figure to ~20 suggesting that a price closer to $100 with a yield of 1.2% would be tempting. With the release of their FY2016 results shortly this may provide a catalyst for revising the fair value price higher still.Right now, however, of the two Sage Group probably still tempts me more. Though also running ahead of its historic valuation it remains equally compelling from a fundamental basis as Intuit yet with a higher current yield and greater geographical diversification. After taking a first look at Intuit here, however, I'd find it hard to argue against looking to add both to my portfolio.

The beat supports Intuit as a value play - meeting standards such as double-digit revenue growth, a healthy dividend track record, and a positive earnings outlook.INTU data by YChartsIntuit reported solid financial results, as revenue came in at $2.541 billion, up 10% year over year, finishing in the high end of management's guidance and beating analyst estimates. Operating income was reported at $1.4 billion, resulting in non-GAAP EPS of $3.90, up from $3.43 in the same quarter in 2016. The company expects full-year guidance to rise 10% year over year, as revenues hit $5.14 billion with GAAP operating income of $1.36 billion.The beat was a result of growth in Intuit's small business solutions via QuickBooks Online and QuickBooks Self-Employed. Both segments received double-digit subscription growth. QuickBooks Online subscribers grew 59% during the third quarter, as this segment now boasts some 2.2 million total subscribers. The second bright spot came from Intuit's offering to the self-employed demographic, which grew by 100% year over year to a total of 360,000 subscribers. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, over 10% of total U.S. employment meets the guidelines of being self-employed. This comes to a total of 9.5 million people, of which 6 out of 10 are still unincorporated. Becoming incorporated allows for tax incentives for owners. This segment is still a largely untapped market for Intuit as the subscriber growth first hit 180,000 total users in 2016.One issue of concern to Intuit's business is the overall growth in the number of tax returns filed with the IRS. Intuit's Chief Operating Officer Brad Smith addressed this issue during the conference call:Despite the stagnate growth in total tax returns, Intuit was able to deliver double-digit revenue growth as its Consumer Tax segment grew 10% year over year. This was achieved by technological innovations and international expansion.The company has enabled itself to deliver its software applications over the cloud with a subscription-based business model. Online customers have increased 12% on compound annual growth rate from 2012 to 2016, while desktop customer growth has decreased 1% during the same period. Intuit has also been able to grow its market in Consumer Tax via its software offering TurboTax. Currently, 60 million U.S. individuals use software to file their taxes. Of this, Intuit has expanded its market share to 65% over the past three years, while its competitors have lost some ground.Growth is due to continued innovation in areas such as artificial intelligence. Recently, Intuit partnered with NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) to allow users to engage with professional accountants to cut out the need to go to physical locations. This is a value add and plays into the Intuit's do-it-yourself strategy.Management has also increased value to shareholders via its capital allocation strategy with share buybacks. During the third quarter, management repurchased $88 million of stock, with an additional $1.9 billion pending in the plan. The corporate balance sheet continues to improve with $1.35 billion in cash and cash equivalents, up from $638 million a year ago. Long-term debt decreased to $450 million from $488 million in the same period, proving that growth is not coming from the taking on of additional debt.Management approved a $0.34 dividend, or $1.36 annualized, payable to shareholders July 18, 2017. With EPS at $3.90, coupled with the above-mentioned cash on hand, investors can feel secure with respect to management's ability to meet future dividend obligations. The dividend has grown from $0.60 in FY'2012, which is the sort of consistent growth one expects from a value play.The company continued to meet several standards as a value play with double-digit revenue growth, a solid 5-year dividend track record, and an active management team. Investors should look forward to future growth in emerging markets such as Singapore and Hong Kong. The 10% move higher is supported by a solid earnings beat and solid forward-looking results."
4101417,22148,2017-08-23T14:53:05-04:00,Intuit beat FQ4 analyst estimates.The company discussed increasing investment during FY18.EPS growth will face headwinds pressuring the stock this year.,"After the close yesterday, Intuit (INTU) reported another strong quarter. The stock is down today as the company discussed some investments in the future that will hurt short-term profits.Investing for the future is the right move, but the stock might struggle this year for that reason. The market was already pricing Intuit for perfection so any headwinds will cause the stock to stumble.The financial software company continued a string of solid quarterly revenues as subscription totals for QuickBooks Online soared. These customers provide consistent revenue streams and strong cash flows that the market likes.As usual, the FQ4 ending in July provides little in the way of financial profits for the year so these quarterly results aren't entirely meaningful. The company obtains the majority of revenues and profits during the crucial tax season of FQ3.The ability to grow QuickBooks Online customers by 58% in the year to 2.4 million is very bullish long term. Intuit forecasts another large growth rate in FY18 to reach around 3.3 million total customers.Noteworthy is that the company lists a potential global market of 800 million small businesses so the market is far from saturated, though competition is strong. Key markets like Canada, the U.K. and Australia expanded beyond 100,000 subs showing strong growth beyond the U.S. market. The non-U.S. market is only 500,000 total subs providing a long growth runway.The investment headwinds though were mentioned on the earnings call as follows:In essence, the company is spending more on engineering and global marketing to capture the total addressable market opportunity around the world. The costs are some short-term spending and a shift away from stock buybacks that juice earnings.As the CFO mentioned, the company has spent over 100% of free cash flow over the last 5 years on capital returns. The end result is that cash and investment balances are only roughly $800 million for a stock with a market cap of $35 billion. Without taking on debt, Intuit can't spend $830 million on share buybacks this year like last year, though the current PE ratio of some 27x EPS guidance doesn't support aggressive buybacks in the first place.The end result is that FY18 EPS guidance of $4.90 to $5.00 is highly disappointing in comparison to estimates up at $5.03. Worth noting is that FY17 guidance back a year ago was $4.30 to $4.40 per share. Intuit ended up reporting a yearly EPS of $4.01 suggesting a similar result for this fiscal year would have the company roughly hitting current analyst estimates.The key investor takeaway is that Intuit is absolutely making the correct move to invest in engineering and global marketing while pulling back on share buybacks. The moves though will cause headwinds to EPS growth. Investors should allow Intuit to pullback to at least $125 and possibly even lower before a $5 EPS stream turns appealing."
3920766,98656,2016-02-23T13:44:39-05:00,"Intuit is trading at 66 times trailing earnings and 36 times forward earnings.These multiples are far beyond historical averages, and we feel the share price will correct soon.We believe the level of growth required to sustain such a P/E ratio is beyond the company.Intuit could be at risk of losing market share to H&R Block and slower growth with QuickBooks.","Following our recent article on H&R Block (NYSE:HRB) we have turned our attention to what we consider to be its number one competitor: Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU). If you have read our thoughts on H&R Block you'd know how bullish we are on the company. So far this year we've had a great return from its shares, but continue to hold for long-term gains and expect this tax season to be a profitable one.We like the tax industry because of its consistency and a certain level of sustainability it provides. After all, nothing can be said to be certain, but death and taxes according to Benjamin Franklin.Among other software, Intuit is the provider of the popular TurboTax software, which allows consumers to prepare and file their income taxes online. It's a great bit of software and quite comparable to H&R Block's own software offering. The real difference lies in the fact that Intuit is a software-only company, whereas H&R Block provides both online and in-person solutions. As of the last financial year, tax made up 50% of Intuit's revenue, with 43% coming in from Consumer Tax and Professional Tax contributing 7% of revenue.The fact that H&R Block provides both is partly the reason why we have a preference for it, but it's not the full reason. Intuit's software is great, but for us the valuation just isn't. Priced at approximately 66 times trailing earnings, or 36 times forward earnings makes the shares just a little too rich for our blood. Especially at a time when we feel H&R Block could be stealing market share away from Intuit following the TurboTax incident last year, which saw a forced halt to tax filing through it on the back of fraudulent use.Yes, we realize software companies often trade at high multiples. One needs only to look at salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) (trading at 195 times trailing earnings). But Intuit has never traded at this level previously. As shown on the chart above you can see the general forward price-to-earnings ratio it trades at is around 25. If we were to look at 25 times the forward consensus earnings estimate of $3.48 per share, it would give us a fair price of $87.00. A full 11.5% lower than where it is last closed at $98.25. Management did offer guidance in the first quarter for full year earnings per share in the region of $3.45 to $3.50, but with three quarters to come, there is a lot of time between now and then for things to change. We actually anticipate earnings coming in below guidance at around $3.38 per share. Based on 25 times forward earnings, this would give us a fair price now of $84.50. Looking at the last ten years, we see a fair price-to-earnings ratio as 28 times earnings, which gives us a one-year target price of $94.64.If the company could produce earnings growth that supported paying such a premium for the shares, then we might be able to justify it, but we just don't quite see where they are going to pull this growth from.Intuit is, of course, more than just tax. It has the very popular QuickBooks accounting software, which falls into the Small Business segment and makes up the remaining 50% of revenue. The evolution of QuickBooks into cloud-based accounting software is a great move, as was its link-up with salesforce.com, but we need to see hard evidence that the growth we have seen is sustainable before making an investment. Impressively, QuickBooks Online users grew by 57% in the last quarter, but the whole Small Business segment only grew revenue by 5%. So it is going to need to sustain this high level of user growth to be able to grow the top line as significantly as the market is expecting in our view. It is worth noting also that the launch of Block Advisors from H&R Block could have the potential to steal away some of its QuickBooks customers, which could stifle growth.Intuit announces its earnings on Thursday. We would never recommend trading around earnings because of the high levels of volatility they can bring. So we would hold off shorting the stock until the earnings release has been fully digested. But we cannot help but feel the market has incredibly high expectations for these shares, which won't unfortunately be delivered on.As mentioned earlier, we do have a current fair price of $84.50 on Intuit and a one-year target price of $94.64, but stress that we will not be taking on a short position until after the earnings release on Thursday. If the company reports outstanding earnings we may have to reevaluate our view accordingly, but we have a strong belief that the shares are going to lose value this year. In our opinion, the catalysts will be a loss of market share to H&R Block, slowing QuickBooks growth and an apparent overvaluation.We expect the shares to drop below $90 this year, which would then make them an interesting long option. Thursday's earnings release could potentially make this a reality."
4075495,24823,2017-05-23T01:54:37-04:00,Our overall buy signal - Intuit.Our technical buy signal - Intuit.Our overall sell signal - AutoZone.Our technical sell signal - AutoZone.,"AutoZone (NYSE:AZO) and Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) are scheduled to report earnings on Tuesday, and we have buy signals for Intuit and sell signals for AutoZone. Now we want to examine the fundamentals and technicals so we are prepared to act after earnings. (Of course, in the case of overwhelming evidence, we can make a decision before earnings.) Also, we want to be ready for any possible reversal in our signals, and we want to look for any evidence of that happening.Let's start with AZO, because it reports earnings before the open. Take a look at our proprietary signals below the chart.Our overall grade of 15 out of 100 is rock-bottom bearish and includes both technical and fundamental factors. (We will drill down on the fundamentals looking for any evidence of a positive surprise.) Our Supply indicator at the bottom of the chart shows sellers leaning on price. Our computer program is calculating a 7.8% Implied Return, but that could all change as a result of earnings. As you can see on the chart, all price trends are down and the pattern is lower lows and lower highs. At the top of the chart is the underperformer downtrend. AZO closed at $659, retesting the bottom at the close on Monday.First, we like to find what analysts are saying just before earnings to see if any are brave enough to call a bottom. Flashratings.com shows one analyst posting a target of $753. The consensus analyst target on Nasdaq.com is $867 for 15 analysts, so if one analyst just before earnings is any indication, there may be more analysts downgrading their targets after earnings. Recent analysts are downgrading earnings estimates below consensus at $45.27 for the year and $12 for the quarter. That leads me to expect the analysts' low forecasts of $45 and $11.66.A quick check on Finviz shows the fundamentals are okay, but the FPE and PEG are hoping the earnings forecasts will hold. The chart and the shorts are looking for lower growth and lower earnings and that recent analyst target of $753. This target implies the price should go lower. My guess would be $700. A P/E of 15 on a $45 target gives me a price of $675. But if there is any positive surprise, there will be a short squeeze pop in price and perhaps the start of a bottoming process.INTU, on the other hand, has a chart showing nice uptrends and positive signals expecting an attempt at a new high after earnings.Our overall buy signal, which includes fundamental factors, is looking for this, as well as our technical buy signal. Unfortunately, our computer calculation of Implied Return is too low for us to buy at 2.1%. So we have to take a hard look at the fundamentals to see why the price is running ahead of our calculation based on analyst targets and ratings.The April targets of only 2 analysts were $124 and $140, while the consensus is $122. INTU closed at $127.16, already above the 12-month target. That is usually a bearish sign, unless there is an indication of a positive surprise. The chart and analyst $140 target is looking for that surprise. There are no recent analyst upgrades in earnings that I see, so I will have to go with the consensus quarterly earnings of $3.65.The P/E, FPE and high PEG identify INTU as probably overvalued. This is the quarter where the company makes most of its earnings because of the tax season, so it is possible to have a positive surprise. But even if you go out to next year's earnings, the price does not make much sense to me. There is no large short position, which I find to be strange, but this is probably because this is the company's best quarter.ConclusionIt is always easier to call price movements in the coming months rather than today. I expect both AZO and INTU to come down in price down the road. Short term, it is probable that AZO will continue down and INTU will reach for a new high. I think the AZO consensus target is much too high and analysts have to downgrade their targets. In the case of INTU, the consensus target tells me that the price will eventually have a reality check, if not today.Disclaimer: We never recommend securities because we are not a broker/financial adviser, but a Newsletter publisher.

3704686,22148,2015-11-22T11:58:16-05:00,Intuit continues to make progress shifting to the cloud though the company remains reliant on desktop revenues.Payments and payroll services aren't gaining traction to warrant paying up for the stock.The stock remains relatively expensive especially considering the company signaled the stock at over $100 is relatively expensive to repurchase shares.,"With the stock surging over $100 on solid FQ1 earnings, the question regarding Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) is whether investors want to chase the stock higher. One of the original fintech firms is making excellent progress shifting business to the cloud, but the company is still highly reliant on desktop revenues.In hindsight, the time to buy Intuit was back in 2011 when the company was starting the transition to the cloud. Both QuickBooks Online and TurboTax are becoming mainstream services for small businesses and consumers around the world. The original switch to subscription services impacted revenues, but now the question is whether the stock isn't pricing in too much of a rebound.Market OpportunityIntuit forecasts a total addressable market of some 65 million small businesses in target markets. The base target is over 40 million customers in the US and UK suggesting the current 1.2 million QuickBooks Online customers represent minimal market share.The online ecosystem though remains a minor portion of the total business. Despite the strong shift to cloud services, stable desktop revenues at $378 million left FQ1 revenues at over 70% of the small business related revenue.The shift away from consumer tax to small business revenue and more importantly the subscription online services including payroll and payments helps stabilize quarterly revenues. Intuit actually achieved a FQ1 profit for the first time as the company was able to finally overcome the consumer tax lull.On the downside, payments volumes are stalling and total payments income was down over last FQ1. In addition, the promising payroll service isn't making much advancement either. Intuit clearly needs to advance those products as small businesses are clearly finding service from new up and coming payments processors and cloud software services as more appealing.The important note is that outside of the $64 million jump in ProTax revenues, total revenues were only up roughly 5% to $603 million. The shift to steady subscription revenues is no doubt appealing, but the stock does now trade at over 24x FY17 (April) earnings.Limited CashIntuit made a very smart stock buyback during FQ1. The stock plunged during the quarter allowing the company to purchase $1.3 billion worth of stock at an average price of only $88.50. The purchase of roughly 5% of the outstanding shares at a clearly attractive price has several meaningful impacts.First and foremost, the reduction of the share count by 5% is an immediate equivalent boost to EPS numbers gong forward. Second, the company signals the stock was attractive on dips, but the lack of aggressive buying when Intuit traded around $105 in the previous quarter signals that a price over $100 is expensive. Third, Intuit only has $474 million in cash and $850 million in debt making for net debt of $376 million.INTU data by YChartsTakeawayThe key takeaway is that Intuit has a solid business model and a strong foothold on the future of business financial services in the cloud. The stock though is relatively expensive and the solid management team of the company in effect told the market that very fact via the buyback purchase pattern of the last couple of years.At over $100 and trading at a multiple that far exceeds expected revenue growth, Intuit isn't a stock to chase. If a market provides another opportunity like in August, an investor should wisely scoop up the stock alongside the dip buying buyback plan of the company."
3967017,101632,2016-04-21T13:23:29-04:00,"H&R Block and Intuit, Turbo Tax are compared by their performance and services offered.The brick & mortar aspect of H&R Block may pull their weight through tax season, but will it be enough to match Intuit’s development for the remainder of the year?Intuit looks to be taking the lead for profits in 2016 thus far and is expected to continue to do so.With H&R Block's history of operating at a loss throughout non-tax season, Intuit looks to be the clear choice when it comes to long-term investment.Block Advisors could lead H&R Block to equate to the services that Intuit has to offer year round.","With tax season closed and extensions filed, every consumer is ready to go back to their regular routine of business as usual. They have made it through tax season, hopefully with a little refund in their wallets. The perfect spot for them to put it is in Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) Stock!Following the recent articles on H&R Block (NYSE:HRB) and Intuit from Collective Investment Co, it is clear that consumers are taking tax preparation and business service companies into consideration for their stock portfolios this season. Investors of stocks such as Intuit and H&R Block know that these are investments that should be held for the long-term game instead of the short-term. This is simply because their earnings fluctuate, typically showing the most gains in tax season. The problem is that one of these companies earnings may be so low, even just after tax season, that investors should get out now. This is looking to be the case with H&R Block. Intuit, on the other hand, looks to be on the horizon of seeing profitable numbers for the entire year.Intuit is seen as H&R Block's number one competitor in the industry. Both companies provide services that allow consumers to prepare and file income taxes online. However, aside from the in-person services that H&R Block provides, it has not had much to offer in comparison to Intuit, who provides various financial services for consumers, with a diverse selection of online products and software programs, that are offered year round.However:This could be a strong addition to the company as a whole, now that they have the tools to compete with the services that Intuit provides. This could prove so in their earnings after tax season for each year to come. With an addition like this, Intuit may need to step up its game in order to compete, especially after their Turbo Tax incident last year.Nonetheless, the current earnings for H&R Block do not look to be reflecting the revenue influx that they normally expect at the time of year.H&R Block's stock price has been on a steady decline since the beginning of the year. The outlook on H&R Block is already off to a poor start since this time of year is supposed to show some of H&R Blocks largest earnings. The company anticipated far more customers to file last minute tax returns, but it is clear that instead they choose to file with their leading competitor.HRB data by YChartsWhat is this to say about their stock price in the future? Well, if customers are not choosing them during their most stressful time of the year, why should they choose them for the remainder of it to handle their businesses and day to day needs?Intuit's stock prices have seen a repetitive cycle, equating the similar prices compared to last year. Even better, the stock and its earnings seem to be on the rise, especially after taking into account Intuit's current strive for innovation. With rising numbers such as these, the company looks to have a very positive future ahead of them.INTU data by YChartsNow that virtual customer relationships are the main form of service, financial institutions need to be able to provide connected banking experiences for customers! Larger institutions such as banks and credit card companies have partnered up with Intuit to provide these higher quality services! This is especially critical with online banking and bill payment use growing at an all time high. Intuit provides the most connected and highly personalized services to all of its customers.Intuit has proven to be the leading Tax Titan thus far this year. Along with providing competitive tax services, Intuit has the tools to carry its weight year round. Since the company is developing better and better software and services each year, their earning will continue to be on the rise!Unless H&R Block's Block Advisors program begins to pick up immediately, they are not going to see the numbers that are required for them to maintain the pace that Intuit is climbing at. This is the first time in 60 years that the company has make a major change to the services that it provides. Perhaps they are unfit to manage a full year of tax planning and small business services. They also have a lot of changes to make if they plan on competing with Intuit's innovative and personalized services. It is highly doubtful that they will be able to achieve this in a matter of months. Based on the earnings seen thus far in 2016, it looks like H&R Block is headed for a much worse non-tax season than ever before."
3523336,39011,2015-09-21T07:34:34-04:00,"Intuit announced some bold restructuring changes during its last earnings report, and the stock has been punished.But the changes should build value for the company over time as it moves away from non-core businesses.I like Intuit here, but I think technical damage done to the stock will cause more near-term pain before a bottom is found.","To say that software provider Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) is in a period of transition would be an understatement. The company that has traditionally offered various financial services to individuals and businesses has been in a state of flux with the onset of competitors to certain varieties of its offerings. Importantly, management is not standing idly by and watching the ship sink; important changes have been made recently that I believe will set INTU up for a brighter future.INTU's recent Q4 report was eventful, to say the least. Not only did the company report 7% revenue growth and a strong beat on EPS, but it announced a slew of strategic moves as well. These moves, it seems, spooked investors, because since the changes were announced, the stock has been hammered.Many things are moving right now for INTU, including a wholesale change in its model from taking upfront payments for software and transitioning to a subscription model. This is a painful process that can take a long time, and it would seem to me perhaps investors are unsure of just how successful INTU can be here. But QuickBooks Online is adding subs at a rapid rate, and management is forecasting some very impressive growth numbers for the sub base into fiscal 2017. Given the dominance QuickBooks enjoys in its niche, I'm a little taken aback by the lack of confidence in the subscription model from investors. I think it's a terrific move, and one that will ultimately build value for the stock over time.In addition to the continued move to a subscription service for INTU's core offerings, it also announced that the company will be divesting the Demandforce, Quicken and QuickBase businesses, as they (apparently) no longer fit into INTU's long-term strategic plans. These businesses are significant in size and will certainly crimp revenue and EPS numbers over the short term, and perhaps that is the source of investor angst. INTU is trying to morph itself into a subscription-based recurring revenue powerhouse, and part of the pain in that process is getting rid of lines that don't fit the mold. Its Quicken product, for instance, can be essentially replaced by any number of free apps on your tablet or phone, so at least in this instance, perhaps INTU is getting out ""while the getting is good"", so to speak. The fact is that INTU is keeping its crown jewel businesses and shedding the ones that are ""also-rans"" in the software space. Yes, the move is painful in the near term, but it is the right thing to do. I certainly would prefer this kind of move to watching these businesses shrink and reduce the company's profitability over the long term.One note of caution I would provide is on INTU's chart; the recent sell-off from the earnings report has hammered the stock. After cresting $105, the stock is now trading at just $85, or 19.5 times depressed forward earnings estimates. In addition to estimates coming way down, I think some pretty significant technical damage has been done to the stock with the recent sell-off. INTU had a very clear, multi-year uptrend that was easily identified until the stock began to flatten out earlier this summer. The earnings report and general market sell-off created conditions for that uptrend to break, and when it broke, it broke in a big way.The stock is now trading well below all of its major moving averages, and by a fairly wide margin as well. In addition to that, the 50-DMA will cross under the 200-DMA in the next week or two, in a sign that the uptrend is over and done with. That means there will likely be a period of sideways- or downward-trending price action as INTU tries to find a bottom somewhere. That makes me think that despite the fact that I like INTU's strategic moves, you may get a chance to buy it lower than it is today. The action we've seen since the uptrend broke doesn't yet look like a bottom, so I'm very hesitant to buy here. I like the fundamentals, but the chart is really ugly, and that makes me think we'll get a chance to accumulate at lower levels. Time will tell what those levels may end up being, but for now, I'm on the sidelines pending some more constructive action in the stock.INTU is in a period of what essentially amounts to a turnaround; it is fundamentally changing not only the structure of the company, but also the way it earns its revenue. I do believe in the changes, and that they will end up being very positive for INTU in the long run, but it appears the near-term pain may not be done just yet. I'd like to see INTU come in some more and form a sustainable base in the stock; it is bouncing around too much right now for a base to have formed. But I'll be looking to add INTU to my portfolio once that happens; I just don't know when that will be."

(NASDAQ:INTU) has shown stable earnings over the last few years, which may garner some attention from prospective investors. For example, Seeking Alpha contributor Nunez Enterprises wrote a piece exploring the company's strategy for growth, and Aaron Faulkner expects the long-term growth to overcome the short-term loss. These are great qualitative considerations to keep in mind, but it is critical to first conduct a quantitative analysis of the company.Benjamin Graham, the father of value investing, taught that the most important aspect to consider is whether the company is trading at a discount relative to its intrinsic value. It is through a thorough fundamental analysis that the investor is able to make a determination about a potential investment's merits.The model is inspired by the teachings of Benjamin Graham and considers numerous metrics intended to help the investor reduce risk levels. The first part of the analysis is to determine whether the company is suitable for the very conservative Defensive Investor or the less conservative Enterprising Investor, who is willing to spend a greater amount of time conducting further research.In addition, Graham strongly suggested that investors avoid speculation in order to remove the subjective elements of emotion. This is best achieved by utilizing a systematic approach to analysis that will provide investors with a sense of how a specific company compares to another. By using the ModernGraham method, one can review a company's historical accomplishments and determine an intrinsic value that can be compared across industries.Defensive Investor - Must pass at least 6 of the following 7 tests: Score = 3/7Enterprising Investor - Must pass at least 4 of the following 5 tests to be suitable for a Defensive Investor: Score = 4/5Valuation SummaryKey DataBalance Sheet - April 2015Earnings Per ShareEarnings Per Share - ModernGrahamDividend HistoryConclusionIntuit Inc. passes the initial requirements of the Enterprising Investor but not those of the Defensive Investor.

As a result, all Enterprising Investors should feel very comfortable proceeding to the next part of the analysis, which is a determination of the company's intrinsic value.When it comes to that valuation, it is critical to consider the company's earnings history. In this case, it has grown its EPSmg (normalized earnings) from $1.68 in 2011 to an estimated $2.24 for 2015. This level of demonstrated growth does not support the market's implied estimate for annual earnings growth of 19.8% over the next 7-10 years.In recent years, the company's actual growth in EPSmg has averaged around 6.7% annually, and the ModernGraham valuation model reduces the actual growth to an even more conservative figure when making an estimate. Therefore the model returns an estimate of intrinsic value well below the current price, indicating that Intuit Inc. is overvalued at the present time."
3206336,63483,2015-05-22T13:52:55-04:00,"Expect to see declining revenues in the near-term as Intuit's transition to cloud offerings continues to see great progress.Further enhancements to tax offerings should support future growth.Slight acceleration in the tax segments is possible, aided by comforting macro factors.Intuit's offerings are beginning to gain traction internationally, providing additional markets for growth.Despite many positives, investors are advised to wait for a pullback due to margin of safety concerns.","Earnings ReviewIntuit (NASDAQ:INTU) continues to see great progress in its transition to the cloud. As a quick reminder, the company has opted to move its offerings online, which is not surprising given the many advantages of the cloud. Due to the gradual change in the company's revenue model, expect to see declining revenues in the near-term. However, these declining revenues are not representative of the company's performance - subscriber count and other related figures are better metrics to assess operating performance during this time.Intuit continues to make further enhancements to its tax offerings, which should support future growth. In addition, comforting macro factors should allow tax segments to experience a slight acceleration. Internationally, INTU's offerings are beginning to gain traction as non-US subscriptions continue to grow. Despite many positives, I'm of the opinion that an investor should hold off buying INTU for now on margin of safety concerns.Continued great progress with respect to cloud transitionDuring the third quarter, total paying QuickBooks Online subscribers (a sub-segment of Small Business, which is the largest operating segment, contributing approximately 50% to the top-line) grew to 965K (+120K or 14% sequentially), from 845K. I alluded to this cloud transition in a prior article on the stock. Essentially, the company's strategy to move to the cloud is one that brings many benefits. A few years back, INTU sold its software and solutions the traditional way. By replicating its offerings on the cloud, the company gains more predictable and recurring revenue streams, which should allow for greater financial flexibility. Other sub-segments of Small Business, such as payments and payroll, experienced similar double-digit growth. Strong secular tailwinds in cloud industries should allow further double-digit growth in the following quarters.Enhancements to tax offerings should support future growthOne of the crucial improvements to the company's tax offerings is the company's mobile innovation. In a nutshell, the company has made its tax solutions available on any mobile device, whether they are tablets, smartphones or laptops. In the current era, consumers are increasingly preferring solutions that can be deployed on-the-go, as evident by the continued growth in smartphone shipments year after year. By catering to changing customer preferences, future growth in this area should remain intact going forward.Slight acceleration in tax segments is possible, aided by comforting macro factorsA key driver of INTU's tax-related revenues is the number of tax returns filed to the IRS every year. The US job market continues to strengthen, with the unemployment level falling to a historic low of 5.4%. Said another way, there's a larger base of potential customers to cater to. Couple this with the ease-of-use of INTU's tax solutions, a slight acceleration in tax segments is possible.Offerings gaining traction internationallyINTU has historically been dependent on the US for its success. Globally, the US is a mature market - the APAC regions are the places experiencing relatively rapid growth. The company has made several moves to gain a foothold in international markets. Most notably, INTU's non-US QuickBooks Online subscribers grew 140% to 150k during the quarter. In a nutshell, the company has been able to gain traction internationally - expect these triple-digit growth rates for the non-US segment to persist for the time being.Many positives, but margin of safety concerns should give investors pauseAs seen in the above DCF model, I have updated my assumptions since my prior article. Previously, I had grossly underestimated the speed at which the company could carry out its cloud transition - I expected it to be quick, but not as quick as the numbers are showing. As a result, I had projected positive single-digit growth rates for the top-line. However, in light of this new information, revenue projections have been adjusted downward, with the company's top-line declining 2% for the FY15/16 (in-line with FY15 guidance) as it continues transitioning into a subscription-based model. Nearing the end of the projection period, growth should stabilize at low single-digits as seen in the model.Despite the many positives INTU has got going for it, which I have detailed in earlier paragraphs, the company remains slightly overvalued as indicated by my model (approximately 14% downside from current levels). I'm of the firm belief that investors should always invest with a reasonable margin of safety, subject to each investor's individual risk appetite, and it is clear that in this case the margin of safety is non-existent. Hence, investors are advised to avoid INTU until a significant pullback occurs."

Turbo Tax Online also benefited with a 13% growth in subscribers. The favorable results triggered an increase in the company's guidance for full year 2015 in a few metrics including net revenue and online subscribers.The company's balance sheet remains healthy- For the first nine months of Fiscal Year 2015; it ended the quarter with $2.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents. Outstanding debt stands at $500 million.The combination of the favorable financial results, increase in guidance, and fairly healthy financials made this an attractive company to analyze as a possible profitable investment. In this report, I discuss the pros and cons of my findings.The Business/ProductsThe company's portfolio of services covers a vast spectrum of do-it-yourself accounting and personal finance management software. Intuit separates the company in to three reportable segments: Small Business, which encompasses all QuickBooks products; Consumer segment, which includes personal finance management software such as Turbo Tax, Quicken, and Mint; and the Professional tax division which includes more sophisticated software for accountants, CPAs, and tax preparers. Products include Lacerte, ProSeries and Intuit Tax Online.As per the 2014 annual report, and for several years, the most profitable division has been the Small Business segment which accounted for 50%, 49%, and 47% of total net revenue in fiscal years 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.Factors that Make Intuit a Good InvestmentWith a meticulous focus on product offerings, the company keeps up with changing times by increasing their focus on revamping products with a mobile-first, mobile-only design. The Turbo Tax Solutions, for instance, allows individuals to file their entire tax return in virtually any way the choose-online, tablet, mobile phone, or desktop computer.The trend towards connected services has become Intuit's primary focus as well as the main driver of revenue and growth going forward. This is something the company has been strategically focusing on for several years. Customers from connected services have grown faster than traditional desktop software offerings and generated $3 Billion, or 66%, of total revenue for fiscal year 2014.The open source platforms allow developers as well as small business and consumers all over the world localize, configure, and add value to the software as needed.Finally, the company leverages the immense amount of data that comes from users to create an environment that can greatly benefit the user and add value by saving time and effort. Studying the data and using it to improve the user experience, delivers better products and services including eliminating the need to enter data- allowing the client to improve transactions and interactions.Factors To Keep In Mind: A closer look at industry-specific riskValuationIntuit's valuation is not one to ignore. Current P/E stands at a staggering 93.5x earnings with 5 yr MA of 26.4x. P/E based on forward earnings is currently at 27.6x. Making a comparison to similar companies within the industry, for instance, makes Intuit numbers look even more eye-opening.Although most of us can probably agree that Intuit does offer some unique products and services; for comparison purposes, below are some of the companies that are comparable:*Data adapted from information on Yahoo! finance and Morningstar.Bottom LineConsidering the pricey valuation and the company being about 4% from its 52-week high, I would advise current and prospective shareholders to wait on the sidelines for a market/stock price pull back before adding to or initiating a position in Intuit.After examining the financial reports, I am confident that the company has what it takes to remain ahead of the game within its industry. Despite the outlined risks, I feel the company's competitive advantage and their ability to keep up with changing times, far outweigh any headwinds they may be facing or may face in the future.The stock is up about 16% since January of 2015 and with a annual dividend yield of 1%. Although the company raised guidance for fiscal 2015; I feel this announcement is already baked in to the stock price as we speak. Hence, why I'd wait for a pull back of around 5%-8% if possible. It is currently trading at $104.76, as of the writing of this report.Going forward, I would keep an eye on the continuous growth in their online business including continued increases in subscribers as well as profit margins and net revenue growth year over year. I'll also keep a very close eye on IRS regulations and any effects they may have on some of Intuit's segments, specially the customer division which includes tax products.If the company's moat remains intact, they continue with their strategic investments and initiatives, and there are no issues with tax regulations in the future- I definitely see this company as a valuable investment opportunity for the long term."

(NASDAQ:INTU) may initially attract many value investors due to the earnings growth in recent years along with the popularity of its products. However, Benjamin Graham, the father of value investing, taught that looking at the price cannot be the sole factor in investment decisions, as the most important aspect to consider is whether the company is trading at a discount relative to its intrinsic value. It is through a thorough fundamental analysis that the investor is able to make a determination about a potential investment's merits. Here is an updated look at how the company fares in the ModernGraham valuation model.The model is inspired by the teachings of Benjamin Graham, and considers numerous metrics intended to help the investor reduce risk levels. The first part of the analysis is to determine whether the company is suitable for the very conservative Defensive Investor, or the less conservative Enterprising Investor who is willing to spend a greater amount of time conducting further research.In addition, Graham strongly suggested that investors avoid speculation in order to remove the subjective elements of emotion. This is best achieved by utilizing a systematic approach to analysis that will provide investors with a sense of how a specific company compares to another. By using the ModernGraham method, one can review a company's historical accomplishments and determine an intrinsic value that can be compared across industries.INTU data by YChartsDefensive Investor - Must pass at least 6 of the following 7 tests: Score = 3/7Enterprising Investor - Must pass at least 4 of the following 5 tests, or be suitable for a Defensive Investor: Score = 4/5Valuation SummaryKey DataBalance Sheet - January 2015Earnings Per ShareEarnings Per Share - ModernGrahamDividend HistoryINTU Dividend data by YChartsConclusionIntuit Inc. is suitable for the Enterprising Investor, but not for the more conservative Defensive Investor, who is concerned about the low current ratio, short dividend history, and the high PEmg and PB ratios. The Enterprising Investor, on the other hand, is only initially concerned by the low current ratio. As a result, all Enterprising Investors should feel very comfortable proceeding to the next part of the analysis, which is a determination of the company's intrinsic value.When it comes to valuation, it is critical to consider the company's earnings history. In this case, the company has grown its EPSmg (normalized earnings) from $1.68 in 2011 to an estimated $2.49 for 2015. This level of demonstrated growth does not support the market's implied estimate for earnings growth of 15.4% over the next 7-10 years. Therefore, the model returns an estimate of intrinsic value falling below the current price, indicating the company is overvalued at the present time."

This will deepen EPS losses by nearly $0.12 and may inspire uneasiness as Intuit Director Greene sells $3,141,000 in shares.The prolific bookkeeping company has invested in a stock buyback program.The long-term growth should give ample opportunity for investors to capture growth at a value, as well as give short interest a 20% potential downfall.","Time to be bearish?Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) may be slipping away from its current price. The company recently reported third-quarter revenue of $2.2 billion that came in above previously set guidance. Driven by many financial events, Intuit's recent gains have come at a time when the company is delivering poorer than average QoQ results.The company has weaved a successful story, demonstrating excellent management and their ability to increase earnings with little turbulence. Shares have crossed their previous all-time high during interday trading in anticipation of future growth.*Most Recent INTUIT Data: 2015 Fact Sheet / 8-KDue to a bill payment strategy shift in the ""Consumer Ecosystem Group"" during the third quarter, Intuit took $263 million in GAAP losses. Although small business online ecosystem revenue increased 20%, with customer acquisition behind the growth, operating income from this group has fallen behind guidance.This may be due in part to small business revenue declining 5% for the quarter. This was in line with expectations and reflected the anticipated changes in desktop offerings that resulted in ratable revenue recognition. Consumer tax revenue grew 4% in the third quarter and 9% year to date. In comparison, the company's ProTax offering felt a 61% decline revenue.Inuit ended the third quarter with $2.1 billion in cash and investments. The company also indicated a buyback program for the common stock, repurchasing $568 million in shares in Q3. Board members agreed to an additional $2 billion in buyback authorization. The company now has $2.6 billion in authorization remaining.To fuel short-term fears, for the current fourth quarter, Intuit expects a far deeper loss of $0.10-$0.12 per share. Also expected to be bleak, revenue will decline to levels between $720 million-$745 million.The company may be buying back shares at a much lower price than current market conditions have afforded. Although the company remains a strong competitor to its peers, the recent losses may drive the price of shares down 22%.How crowded is the cloud? Cloud-based services have been the focus for much of the company's future growth. Intuit's online business grew 13% during the last tax season, along with 9% from U.S. TurboTax customers. Online payments volume grew 19%. This was said to be due to an increase in charge volume per customer.The service group now boasts 965,000 paying subscribers worldwide. QuickBooks totaling paying customers grew 20%. Now with over 150,000 QuickBooks online subscribers outside the United States, this customer base has jumped 140%.Comparable Companies: Yahoo Finance(Assuming the same growth rates and discount rate)To compare the rate of growth for Intuit, I am using the current TTM EPS of $1.16. I also represent a fixed 10-year earnings growth rate of 13.90%. This model applies a 4% terminal growth rate and a discount rate of 12%. Data for calculations from: Gurufocus.comPreviously, Intuit was demonstrating a trend of strong EPS growth. This has given rise to a fundamentally sound company. A strong 5-year average return on shareholder equity, significantly better than the industry.(Gurufocus)ValuationIn order to valuate INTU, consideration must be to given using conservative models of future forward-looking guidance. During the Q3 earnings event, the company reiterated revenue guidance for the fourth quarter and raised revenue guidance for 2015. In regards to the best value for returns on future earnings, I have adjusted my entry target based on the likelihood of a number of bearish events that could occur during the next revenue generation cycle.Growth Value: $48.32Terminal Value: $35.42Target Entry: $86.3Current Price Margin Of Safety: -22%At the time of writing, the market price matched my valuation metric almost to the dollar. I believe this is a sign that the stock is due for a pullback. For example, for the fiscal year 2015, Intuit expects revenue of $4.395 billion-$4.420 billion, a slight increase compared to previous guidance. To reflect the current growth, I have adjusted this variable in my calculations.This leads me to believe that the market has already priced these earnings in at the rate of expected growth:10-Year Growth Value 37.90X = $42.910-Year Terminal Value 4X = $62.65Estimated Current Value: $105.56Margin Of Safety: 0%Conclusion: I feel that the best value in the future growth of the company will come to the patient investor. A pullback to $85 per share could justify an entry for a long position, if the company continues to outperform its peers.I do feel that the current share price is resting on a particularly risky transition point. I estimate that the EPS is overvalued by at least $0.01. I use the same method to determine the current share price and discover Intuit trades well above what I believe is the fair value. Today's price of INTU seems to be heavily vested in future returns.PS Ratio (3 years Avg)4.982 × Sales per Share15.91 = PS Method Valuation 79.26Some indications point to a future that expects EPS to double by April of next year. The company has risked shareholder equity in the form of stock buybacks. Though this may seem like an opportunity to short the stock, the strong financial history mixed with the intended share buyback is a signal the company expects to outperform its peers. A period of some correction could be expected in the near-term future, as the expected earnings have already been priced into INTU.25.58 × Earnings per Share2.768 = PE Method Valuation 70.82Yet in another interesting turn of events, at the time of writing, a surge of insider sales was reported.(Yahoo)I expect that any setback in achieving preset guidance may incite bearish sentiment. This, however, will give excellent value to investors seeking long-term gains. My logic being that when calculated with the most optimistic EPS estimates for 2017 ($4.04), future losses will bring pressure to the shares. This may threaten shareholder equity nearly 20%.The company expects that the short-term effect of the upcoming Q4 report to be bearish. Guidance indicated that the company expects GAAP diluted EPS of $0.88 to $0.90, a significant loss versus previous guidance of $1.70 to $1.75.This is in contrast to Non-GAAP diluted EPS, where guidance grew slightly, $2.50 to $2.52, versus previous guidance of $2.45 to $2.50.The expected growth of Intuit's cloud services, through its recent acquisition and cloud-based user growth, leaves reason to believe that there is little to capture but short-term downside at the current market level.Growth investors will appreciate that in comparison to the industry, Intuit's current ROE is up more than 10% from its 5-year average.Because of the company's strong history and solid book sheet, I anticipate that any shares purchased near $85 will give value-focused investors an excellent entry. However, until the stock returns to a more conservative level, I believe INTU is a ""two-leg"" trade. This has presented investors with the opportunity to short on the idea that the company is currently overvalued."
3045366,63483,2015-04-01T12:27:15-04:00,"Intuit recently made several announcements detailing its new partnerships with Shopify and BigCommerce.These partnerships are a boon to Intuit, providing the company with an expanding user base, cross-selling opportunities and increased recognition.I reiterate my slightly-bullish stance.","Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) recently made two announcements that I believe are material to the company. The company has partnered with two e-commerce companies, Shopify and BigCommerce. I believe these partnerships are a boon to Intuit as it will provide the company with opportunities to expand its user base, increase its cross-sell opportunities, achieve increased recognition and further diversification of its revenue base.Opportunities to expand user baseAs detailed in an earlier article, Intuit offers IT solutions its clients. Therefore, it goes without saying that expanding the company's user base is paramount to growth. With the Shopify partnership, Intuit has the potential to increase its user base by a large amount - over 150,000 merchants that carry out their business using the Shopify platform. Furthermore, given the fact that Intuit's solutions - in this case QuickBooks Online, will be integrated with the Shopify e-commerce platform, this allows the company to benefit from the growth of the Shopify platform as well. With e-commerce booming in recent years, I believe this is a smart move by Intuit to increase its user base. In addition, due to the nature of the partnership where Intuit's QuickBooks Online is integrated on the Shopify platform, this allows the company to continue adding users to its growing user base at incrementally lower cost.Cross-selling opportunitiesBesides the opportunity to expand its user base, these partnerships also allow Intuit to increase its cross-selling opportunities. In my earlier article, I explained that Intuit also offers tax and payment processing solutions to its customers. Given that these solutions complement the current accounting solution (QuickBooks Online) that Intuit brings to both partnerships, I expect the company to be able to increase its profit per user, as it introduces its complementary solutions to the merchants on Shopify and BigCommerce. This will naturally be a help to the company's top-line.Increased recognitionThese partnerships also allow Intuit to gain increased recognition from the public. Throughout most of the company's history, the company sold to small businesses, consumers and accounting professionals. The growth in the number of customers from these segments is paltry compared to the growth of online merchants. Therefore, I believe that with these partnerships, Intuit would be able to garner recognition at a quicker pace, thanks to the faster growth in users of e-commerce compared to users in its core business segments.ConclusionAs I detailed in earlier paragraphs, the partnerships with Shopify and BigCommerce provide Intuit with three main things - opportunities to expand its user base at a rapid pace, cross-selling opportunities and increased recognition. I believe that supports my positive outlook for the company's future. Similar to my earlier article on the stock, I reiterate my bullish stance."

We've all dealt with the headache and stress of surviving tax season in the United States, where 150 million people file their returns and receive more than $300 billion in refunds. But maybe not all of us have heard of Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU), a company that aims to help people accurately and efficiently manage their finances and their tax filing through one of life's certainties. As investors and the market move into 2015, Intuit's business will come into focus as tax season rears its ugly head. The company is expanding on a global scale, and is investing heavily in R&D to keep pace with customers on a range of online and mobile platforms. In an economy filled with dense regulation and continued uncertainty, more and more small businesses, tax professionals and general consumers are turning to Intuit to keep their finances simple and flexible. Investors should take this opportunity to own a high-quality company that is well positioned to capitalize on a recovering economy and its effect on the consumer finance industry.OverviewIntuit is a technology company focused on creating financial management solutions that help consumers, small businesses and accounting professionals simplify their research and their decisions. The company manages a portfolio of products that are tailored to this pursuit, which includes:These products complement each other to provide customers with a complete financial tool to tackle their personal, business and taxation needs. Intuit takes advantage of the impact these products provide to create an ecosystem with its current customer base. This ecosystem is what drives consistent business for the company - customers who try an Intuit product get used to the interface and the quality of service and can't imagine using anything different. This leads to an implementation of other company products in customer routine and creates full use and reliance on INTU's services to enhance financial life.At its core, Intuit's ecosystem strategy is what's made the company so successful. INTU drives customer growth by sticking to three main factors:Moving forward, Intuit plans to leverage its growing ecosystem to engage with more consumers domestically and abroad and stay ahead of new technologies and government regulation.Q1 2015 EarningsWhen Intuit reported earnings on November 20th, management gave an update to the company's point in the product cycle as well as its plans for the upcoming tax season, where TurboTax will move into the spotlight with customers. The company beat expectations on both the top and bottom line and saw momentum building in its online ecosystem. QuickBooks Online, a product designed to give small businesses functionality anywhere they can find an Internet connection, grew subscribers by 43% in the first quarter. This brings total online subscriber numbers to 739,000 globally, with 103,000 coming from businesses overseas. Intuit sees global expansion of QuickBooks Online as a primary growth driver going forward, with some signs of this already being seen - non-U.S subscribers grew by 170% in Q1 alone.On its earnings call, Intuit also talked about the Affordable Care Act and how implementation of this policy affects business. Overall, increased government regulation can be seen as a net positive for Intuit's business model. As filing taxes and doing business in the United States becomes more cumbersome, more consumers and companies will look to Intuit to cut through the mess and provide the ease and security they need. With regard to the ACA, management cited confidence in being able to navigate situations involving the law and helping customers do business in spite of increased red tape and paperwork.On the other hand, if Congress does decide to simplify the tax code, wouldn't that mean less reliance on Intuit's service? Not as much as people may believe. In a situation where Congress overhauls the tax system for the benefit of American citizens (highly unlikely), regulation will still exist in the tax code that will require a helping hand in sorting it out. Intuit invests heavily in staying flexible when reacting to government and technology changes and will respond accordingly to any simplification in the tax code. A simpler way to file taxes might even mean cost savings for INTU, which could translate to the bottom line. Intuit's ecosystem also would show its strength in this situation, where customers already satisfied with company products might choose to stick with their current routine rather than spend time and money figuring a simpler tax code out themselves. Either way, a bet on Intuit is a bet on a complex regulatory environment in the United States and a Congress that won't do anything drastic to change it.ValuationWhen looking at shares of INTU, investors can see how the performance of the business can be reflected in the stock price and valuation. Intuit currently trades at a multiple of around 32, which shows how investors are pricing in success of the company in the near and medium term. A multiple this lofty can be justified by the company's EPS growth in the past, and how that translates to future growth:INTU EPS Diluted (TTM) data by YChartsWith 25% annual earnings growth over the past 10 years, it doesn't seem out of the ordinary for a stock with this kind of track record to be valued with a 30+ multiple, especially for a company in the technology sector with so much R&D investment. Investors are banking on INTU growing earnings at a similar or even faster clip to its 10-year average, and 2015 should be able to prove them right as global growth sends earnings higher.Another positive pillar that should factor into investor's analysis is INTU's implementation of a dividend and its capability to pay and raise that dividend for years to come. Intuit started paying a dividend in late 2011, and has consistently raised it from $.15 per share to $.25 by 2014. Intuit's cash position supports this kind of dividend growth, with a payout ratio of only 35. This payout ratio means that only 35% of Intuit's earnings are paid out in the form of dividends, which leaves a lot of room for growth despite INTU's need to spend heavily on R&D. As earnings rise with fundamental business growth, look for future dividend raises to send shares higher as income minded and dividend growth investors give INTU a look.ConclusionAs the economy picks up, consumer and small business confidence is sure to rise with GDP steadily increasing and equities near all-time highs. Intuit should benefit from this economic growth down the road, with high-quality products that help businesses perform at their best. Intuit's strong ecosystem, global growth initiatives and strong regulatory knowledge should drive customers to its products and money into its coffers. Investors should take advantage of an opportunity to own Intuit as a 2015 growth story and as an economic recovery beneficiary for many tax seasons to come."

The author John Brooks paints an intriguing picture of the latter situation in chapter 3 of Business Adventures.We can bet demand for tax-related services is perennial. And we can bet that accounting services are also perennial. Accounting is, after all, explicitly mentioned in the 3800-year old Hammurabi code. And we can bet that the established firms have an advantage due to their age -- after all, tax laws build on tax laws.Under our microscope today is Intuit, Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) the maker of QuickBooks, TurboTax, Lacerte, ProSeries and Quicken (among others). Intuit has an enormous customer base of some 45 million, with 30 million using web and mobile products.Intuit is a fantastic business. We like most everything about it. Whether it is an inexpensive purchase in today's markets is a whole different matter. We can hardly hold our nose and like anything at all in these markets. Prices are simply too high for any degree of confidence in common stock commitments (excluding, I suppose, some of the mega-cap corporations). Therefore, we will abstain from saying whether it is too high or too low -- which is pretty much another way of saying ""fairly valued."" But the business is laudable, and we hope to be shareholders at some unknown date. Let us, therefore, laud.Historical PerformanceCheck out the revenue growth:The company increased revenues by 250% in the last ten years, or about 9.5% per annum. Here is the corporation's revenue breakdown by segment (please try our Filings Reader for Android!):(2013 10-K, p. 5; source: Time & Model's Filings Reader)They are about half in accounting and half in tax. Take a look at the profits and free cash flow:Very pretty. Take a look at shares outstanding:These two trends cause a beautiful effect in EPS when combined -- just check it out:Whereas revenue grew 9.5% per annum and net income grew 11.5% per annum, EPS grew 14.6% per annum over the last ten years. Thank you buybacks.Most importantly, however, we have our ROE:That is basically ten years of ROEs above 18.75% -- and much of the time, the ROE was higher than that. TTM ROE is 31%.All these things suggest we are dealing with a first-class business. Furthermore, we know its market is nearly perpetual -- our current system wouldn't work without the income tax. Further, our entire system is itself shaped by the tax (as John Brooks explains so well).So we know that (1) demand is constant and not going away, (2) the return on capital is excellent, (3) the company has been piggy-backing on technological trends (such as the marketing and technical phenomenon known as ""cloud"") and (4) the company's historical exhibit is excellent.So let's address a few questions. First, the business would be attractive today if the growth of the past could be assured -- and hence, we need to evaluate forward-looking prospects. Next, what would a fair price for Intuit be?Let's keep in mind that we don't want to ""explain"" the current share price when we address that question. We want to come up with a price which allows for future growth, but puts us in the conservative position of not falling for the most classic of investment errors: paying for growth ahead of time. In the worst cases, people pay for growth which never even happens, and they, of course, end up with losses. We would argue this latter mistake is presently going on at scale today. The stock market is remarkable in its ability to act as if it lacks a history.Future GrowthThe conference call goes on to say:In other words, not only does the cloud offering have a theoretically better gross margin than desktop, it also seems to offer a better revenue picture. This will be an interesting trend to watch, and it could create some serious whiz-bang upside.Growth will likely be driven by new customer adoption of Intuit's cloud offerings. This offering, by the way, further begs the question why Intuit is so ""cheap"" compared to other cloud providers? Surely, Intuit has a more credible business model. The word ""cheap,"" of course, is a relative term given the extreme overvaluation of the sector. Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY), for example, is selling for $16 billion, or 71% of INTU's price, but WDAY has only 15% of INTU's sales and exactly 0% of INTU's profits. But we will leave this digression for someone else.If we projected 9.5% revenue growth (and corresponding net income growth), we would have a security which is likely undervalued. E.g., this would be its future exhibit:Assuming that the stock sold at its bond coupon long-term -- which implies a PE of 17.3 -- the corporation would be worth more than today's prices within a year, valuing the corporation from free cash flow.If we used GAAP net income, the stock looks a little ahead of itself. However, we believe, some hybrid of the two profitability measures might be appropriate in this specific case. FCF is overstated due to stock-based compensation and due to ""usually low"" (management's words) capital expenditures; net income is understated due to amortization of intangibles and working capital improvements. Assuming some hybrid of those two measures, and assuming a PE of 17.3 is correct long-term, the corporation would easily grow into its valuation in a few years.But of course, anyone looking at this can clearly see that if the corporation is able to continue to grow long-term, an investment will likely work out quite well in due course -- especially since EPS will be helped along by operating leverage and share repurchases.However, for us, we want the odds to be better than this. An investment in Intuit would likely fare better over the next 5 years than many other available investments. But this is due to the quality of the underlying business. On the whole, Intuit is valued similarly as many other firms in the market. Many other firms valued at Intuit's level, however, don't deserve the premium. That is, on a relative basis -- a basis we at Time & Model do not use -- Intuit is attractive. But Intuit is only good from this point of view because the market is not being very discriminating. On an absolute value basis, there is little margin of safety for the conservative investor.Margin of SafetyOne way of thinking of the margin of safety is to compare the earnings yield with the market yield on the bonds. The ""margin of safety"" in this definition, borrowed from an essay of Graham's, is the yield of the common divided by the yield on the bonds.Currently, we have a free cash flow yield of 5.16% and an earnings yield of 3.73%. Compare this with the 2017 bonds' current yield of 5.2%, and one can see that the common is clearly viewed as more attractive than the bonds. This might be fair given the growth rate and the rate of inflation -- i.e., the real coupon rate on the bonds is only 3.2%, assuming 2% inflation. But what is clear is that it is at the high end of the value spectrum.There are some other fancy formulas we could apply. For instance, Graham once created a formula for growth stocks which takes into account the current bond yields. Here is the definition, with earnings being the mid-point between net income and free cash flow:Don't ask me how Graham came up with the ""8.8"" or the ""37.5"" above -- I believe he just selected figures which gave reasonably answers given his historical experience.From this point of view the common equity is undervalued by 10%, and we personally would not be surprised to see the security selling at that level.However, we should again recall the ""margin of safety"" concept. The concept is to ensure good long-term results over many market cycles. The whole point is to introduce additional selectivity to enhance the probabilities of investment success. In our opinion, we should look to purchase Intuit at about 66% of the formula figure above -- or about $17.2 billion.At 66% of the ""fair value,"" we would be able to secure an upside of approximately 50% and a current yield of 6%+. For a business as good as Intuit, purchasing at higher valuations will probably still work out if the security is held long enough.Positioning and MarketingIntuit beat its own predictions when it came to sales on the individual tax side. This is due to an improved product approach. Have a read of this exchange from an Q&A on September 3rd, 2014:And hence, it achieved better revenue than it expected, since it got better pricing. The higher pricing achieved could be a one-off -- unless there is a broader trend towards specific product specifications which could serve to improve revenues by diversifying the product line into areas where pricing power is yet untapped. Very good move, if this proves to be the case.For some basic filers, TurboTax recently offered a mobile product called SnapTax, where customers could simply take a photo of their W-2 and about 80% of their taxes were finished. Products like this proved the mobile channel as a possible means of addressing taxes. Both of these are indications that Intuit's management is watering their garden and nurturing young innovation, which may drive revenue in the future -- or at the very least, improve their moat.Priorities on the tax side are, in order: (1) customer growth, (2) revenue growth and (3) operating income growth.In many respects, it seems that market share becomes more important over time in the software field. Just as people lack time for two newspapers a daily, people lack the time to learn multiple software systems. Therefore, people can get trapped in a software ecosystem whose incremental improvements are tolerable. This is an enormous barrier to exit and, further, really cements the franchise in the customers' mind. Software franchises, like other brands, are very valuable if taken care of.The company also owns Mint.com. Long-term, Mint may connect our entire financial lives and do our taxes. Pretty fabulous future vision. Mint must protect its information and be the most secure platform. Its long-term reputation is important, and a security failure would negatively affect the value of this brand.Important Trends & Accounting ChangesWe may get an opportunity to purchase the shares in the near-term, since the corporation expects to report lower revenues in the near term. In reality, its revenues will likely grow a bit slower than last year but slow growth is very different from a revenue decline.If speculators react superficially -- as they frequently do -- we could see better pricing in the shares. So why are they changing the company's accounting?The actual labor within old desktop releases was before they shipped. Hence, revenue was recognized up-front. With cloud software, the coding is located on remote servers, and therefore, the company can update the code whenever it wants. It is entirely under its control. Furthermore, apps on the iOS or Android ecosystem update automatically, which also creates the effect of ""ongoing development.""This ""software updating"" trend is now affecting desktop software too, specifically QuickBooks, Pro-Tax and Quicken. Due to the fact that revenues under a continually updating system are tied to ongoing expenses, it makes sense to recognize revenue over time, rather than all at once. Hence, revenue will no longer be recognized immediately after the sale of desktop systems, but over three years. This obviously creates the effect of a decline in near-term revenue (although, just to stress the point, the cash flowing through the door is the same as it was before).Due to these ongoing expenses, it also makes sense in general to distribute software on a SaaS basis so that software can fund its continual improvement. (This is also, I might add, what Time & Model would like to do with its current and future products.)This change in accounting will mostly affect GAAP revenue and GAAP net income. Revenue, therefore, is expected to decline 3% to a range of $4.275 billion to $4.375 billion for FY 2014. Net income will also decline, but cash flows will likely remain very similar to today -- the disconnect between net income and cash flows will be able to be seen in the ""deferred revenue"" line item on future cash flow statements.Long-Term TargetsThe company has some corporate targets for 2017:ConclusionIntuit is a fabulous business with a fabulous return on capital. We would expect purchases, except those done at extremely high valuations, to work out favorably for the purchaser if they plan to hold the security long enough. In the long run, Intuit is very attractive. But we want to purchase at advantageous levels, wherein a margin of safety can be mathematically demonstrated in one way or the other. We believe this is possible with ""growth securities,"" provided they have some describable moat.We advocate very conservative buying. Despite the quality of the business, today's prices do not offer a margin of safety which assures investment success. Perhaps the accounting change mentioned above will lower the valuation of the shares, thereby offering an opportunity for intelligent investors.Good luck.

These solutions allow customers to be more efficient and effective in managing their finances and businesses.The company recently extended its focus to the cloud, allowing Intuit to capitalize on the fast-growing cloud industry. The strong outlook for ecommerce will continue to act as a tailwind, driving the company's top line. These two factors will drive growth in the company's largest segment - small business. As a result of the increasing complexity of U.S. tax laws, the company's tax solutions will continue to be in high demand. However, there are compatibility issues with the company's offerings that will hinder its international expansion. Furthermore, the company operates within a highly competitive industry, leaving little room for margin expansion.Increasing focus on the cloud will be a key growth driver in the near-termAccording to a MarketAndMarkets press release, the global cloud applications market is expected to grow from $30.43b in 2014 to $66.44b in 2019, representing an estimated CAGR of 16.9% from 2014 to 2019. This growth is driven by increased demand for businesses, individuals and governments to adopt cost-efficient solutions to store, analyze and interpret their data. In the context of financial applications, the demand for cloud solutions also is increasing as businesses look to upgrade and modernize outdated applications. In recent years, Intuit has begun shifting its accounting services, QuickBooks, to the cloud. The company's online offerings include QuickBooks Simple Start Online and QuickBooks Online Accountant which allow accounting professionals to perform accounting functions online and share their work with their colleagues. The company also partnered up with major players within the cloud industry - most notably Box. This partnership with Box allows Intuit to offer cloud and document collaboration directly within QuickBooks Online Accountant. Intuit continues to make major moves within the cloud applications industry, which allows the company to continue gaining ground. I expect the company's subscription revenue to increase in the near-term as it continues shifting its solutions to the cloud in order to capitalize on the growth of the cloud application industry.Strong outlook for eCommerce will Acts as an additional tailwindAccording to eMarketer, ecommerce is estimated to account for 8.8% of the global retail market in 2018, up from 5.9% in 2014. This surge in ecommerce is driven by changing consumer preferences - consumers are increasingly turning to the online marketplace to purchase products and services due to its convenience. Intuit is poised to benefit from the growth of ecommerce through its small business segment. Within this segment, Intuit's online payment solutions offer a full range of merchant services to small businesses that include credit/debit card processing, electronic benefits, gift card processing services, automated clearing house services and many more. The company also recently launched GoPayment which allows users to accept credit card payments with either a smartphone or tablet. Intuit's Payment Network also allows small businesses to send secure online payments to their vendors and receive payments from their customers. Due to the rise in ecommerce, and the fact that Intuit offers very relevant solutions to players within the online retail market, the company is well-positioned to benefit from the growth of the online retail industry.The company's small business segment includes its cloud accounting and ecommerce services - both of which account for half of its revenues in FY14. Given the tailwinds detailed earlier, I expect the company's top line to do very well in the near-term, driven by this segment.Increasing complexity of U.S. tax lawsIt is no secret the U.S. tax laws are incredibly complex. Last I checked, the U.S. federal tax law has grown to over 70,000 pages. The Washington Post estimates that it takes the average American taxpayer 13 hours to comply with the tax code, gather receipts and fill out the required IRS forms. As a whole, the tax code forces Americans to spend an estimated $168b and 6 billion hours to comply with the rules. Clearly, demand for easy-to-use tax solutions that save time is not going anywhere. Intuit's consumer tax solutions include TurboTax, which is designed to enable individuals to prepare and file their own federal and state personal income tax returns quickly and accurately. Though I'm not an American, as an anecdote, I have heard many rave reviews regarding how easy it is to use TurboTax and how much time it saves. On the professional side, the company offers Lacerte, ProSeries and Intuit Tax Online. Each of these offerings caters to different clients, depending on the complexity and seasonality of the client's work.Given the breadth and depth of the market that Intuit's tax products penetrates, the company is poised to benefit from the continued demand for tax solutions. However, I anticipate that the company will face difficulty in expanding its tax offerings internationally. This is due to one simple reason - the U.S. tax code differs greatly from the tax code of other countries. In recent years, the company has embarked on expanding their international presence. However this initiative has not achieved much success - the company still derives over 90% of its revenues from the U.S. I expect the company to continue facing difficulty in expanding its international presence due to the compatibility issues of its solutions - primarily its tax offerings.Intense competition leaves little room for margin expansionIntuit operates within a highly competitive industry and competes against some of the largest and most established players in the industry. For example, the company's QuickBooks solutions face competition from Sage Group, which offers similar products and targets the same market Intuit does - small business. In its payroll business, the company competes with the data processing giant ADP. In its merchant and payment processing business, the company not only competes directly with large financial institutions such as Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), but also with companies such as PayPal and First Data.However, the nature of Intuit's solutions allows it to generate recurring revenue. This is due to the simple fact that once a user has familiarized himself with Intuit's solutions, it becomes not only a hassle, but also costly to switch to another platform. As a result, I expect the company to be able to maintain its margins. Given that Intuit is significantly smaller than the major players in the industries it operates in, the company will not be able to raise the prices of its product offerings and hence there will be little room for margin expansion.ValuationAs seen in the above DCF model, revenues are projected to increase by 7% in FY15, slowing to a steady growth rate of 3% at the end of the five-year projection. This growth in revenue is supported by the company's increasing focus on the fast-growing cloud applications industry, positive ecommerce outlook and increasing complexity of U.S. tax laws. I have assumed that the company reaches a steady growth rate of 3%, which might seem a tad low given Intuit's size, but the main reason for this is due to the fact that I continue to anticipate the company's difficulty in expanding into higher-growth international markets. EBITDA margins are projected to be maintained at 33%, given the nature of the business Intuit operates and intense competition from much larger players, which leave little room for margin expansion. The company currently trades at 18.6x EV/LTM EBITDA. Using this figure along with a 9% discount rate, the model produces a fair value of $107 for Intuit, indicating that the company is undervalued by approximately 10%. My outlook on Intuit is hence slightly bullish."
2232043,25120,2014-05-22T01:58:21-04:00,"Intuit just finished a solid tax season.
        Yet the outlook for the already seasonally weak fourth quarter is soft.
        Shares relied on multiple expansion in recent years for their returns, outpacing operational growth.","Intuit (INTU) the provider of financial management solutions for small businesses, consumers and financial providers released its so-important third quarter results which cover the tax season on Tuesday after the market close.The results were largely in line with consensus estimates both in terms of revenues and earnings as a weak guidance for the already seasonally soft fourth quarter put pressure on shares.Third Quarter HeadlinesIntuit reported third quarter revenues of $2.39 billion which is up 14% compared to last year.Reported net earnings improved by nearly 20% to $984 million, coming in just shy of a billion. Thanks to modest share repurchases, the growth in earnings per share was more pronounced. Earnings per share advanced by 25% to $3.47 per share.Strong Tax SeasonIntuit reported 8% sales growth for its small business operations, driven by the performance of the management solutions subdivision.The consumer side of the business fared even better with a reported 13% revenue growth. The number of TurboTax units being delivered online rose by 14%.The professional tax business was the best performing business, displaying a 32% jump in revenues thanks to aggressive customer acquisition strategies.A Peak Into The Final QuarterFor the current fourth quarter, Intuit anticipates revenues of $683 to $713 million and foresees GAAP operating losses between $26 and $46 million. This implies that losses are seen between $0.10 and $0.12 per share.This guidance is quite weak as Intuit previously anticipated a loss of just $0.02 to $0.04 per share on revenues of $710 to $720 million.Based on the revised fourth quarter outlook, annual revenues are foreseen between $4.475 and $4.505 billion which would represent a 7-8% growth rate. GAAP operating earnings are seen at $1.325 to $1.345 billion which translates into GAAP earnings between $3.08 and $3.12 per share.Valuing The BusinessIntuit ended the quarter with $2.6 billion in cash, equivalents and investments. Total debt stands at $0.5 billion, resulting in a net cash position of $2.1 billion. Note that due to the seasonality of the business cash holdings tend to peak in the third quarter.At $74 per share, Intuit is valued at $21 billion. This values operating assets at roughly $20 billion, the equivalent of 4.4 times annual revenues and 22-23 times GAAP earnings.Intuit pays a quarterly dividend of $0.19 per share for a yield of merely 1.0%.Waiting For Good TimesIntuit's business typically peaks in the second and in particular the third quarter as consumers and small businesses prepare their tax filings ahead of the deadline.Intuit's offerings including TurboTax aid those individuals in preparing their tax filing as well as identifying tax savings. Potential savings and simplicity of the software outweigh the costs for consumers who file their taxes through TurboTax or seek a professional adviser.Yet with the tax filing season being over, Intuit is facing slow months again as the business continues to lose money ahead of the next tax filing season.Concerns about softness to come is the main overhang of the earnings release despite the marketing talk of the company's successful transition to the cloud as well as outpacing growth in non-tax related businesses.The company has a long term track record of growing its revenues in a profitable manner while retiring its share base gradually. While shares traded in a $20-$30 range between 2004 and 2009, shares have tripled ever since. This made shares too expensive to my taste trading at earnings multiples in their low twenties.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

The company's current ratio is too low, the dividend record too short, and the PEmg and PB ratios too high for the Defensive Investor. The Enterprising Investor's only gripe with the company is the low current ratio, but the overall debt level remains acceptable. As a result, the Enterprising Investor following the ModernGraham approach based on Benjamin Graham's methods should feel comfortable proceeding with further research into the company through a comparison to ModernGraham's valuation of Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP) and 5 Low PEmg Companies for the Enterprising Investor. From a valuation side of things, the company appears to be fairly valued after growing its EPSmg (normalized earnings) from $1.42 in 2010 to an estimated $2.62 for 2014. This demonstrated level of growth supports the market's implied estimate of 10.46% earnings growth and leads the ModernGraham valuation model to return an estimate of intrinsic value that falls within a margin of safety relative to the price.The next part of the analysis is up to individual investors, and requires discussion of the company's prospects.

Over the past several years, the widespread availability of the Internet, mobile devices, and the explosion of social media have stepped up the pace of change and revolutionized the way that customers learn about, evaluate, and purchase products and services.About the CompanyIntuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) is a leading provider of business and financial management solutions for small businesses, consumers, accounting professionals, and financial institutions primarily in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, India, and Singapore. Its flagship products and services include QuickBooks, Quicken, Mint.com, and TurboTax, which simplify small business management and payroll processing, personal finance, and tax preparation/filing. ProSeries and Lacerte are the company's leading tax preparation offerings for professional accountants.Business Segmentation:The company's products and services are divided into seven business segments including financial management solutions (17 percent), employee management solutions (12 percent), payment solutions (10 Percent), consumer tax (35 percent), accounting professionals (10 percent) and financial services (9 percent), respectively.AnalysisRising trend in Revenues:This graph shows the company's revenues and its operating margins since 2008. As you can see, Intel has experienced a constant growth in revenues over the years, indicated by a linear line, with a CAGR of 6.18 percent. Over the years the company has managed to grow its operating margins from 21 percent in 2008 to 28.4 percent in 2012, respectively. The company has also managed to increase its revenues through successful acquisitions in recent years.DuPont Analysis:The DuPont analysis indicates that the ROE is viewing an upward trend in the long run, presented by the linear line, and it is majorly supported by net margins. The company has managed to grow its ROE by reducing its financial risk, which is reflected by the decreasing financial leverage ratio of the company and increasing its asset turnover. The increase in asset turnover is also a good sign for investors, which shows that the company is efficiently utilizing its assets to generate its revenues.Dividends and share buyback:Before fiscal year 2012, the company paid no cash dividends to its stockholders. In fiscal year 2012, the company paid its first ever cash dividends, which totaled $0.60 per share of outstanding common stock, or $178 million. In August 2012, after a period of one year, the company raised its quarterly cash dividend by 13.33 percent to $0.17 per share. The company has consistently repurchased its shares under a plan announced on August 18, 2011-$2 billion in stock over the three-year period ending on August 15, 2014. At the end of July, 2012 the Board of Directors added up to $1.7 billion to the program. The increase in dividends is a sign of company's confidence in its financial strength and its future cash flows. On the other hand, a company usually begins repurchasing shares when it believes its share price is undervalued.Multiple Analysis:The table above indicates a comparison among valuation metrics of Intuit, the respective industry, and the S&P 500, along with Intuit's own five-year average. We can clearly see that the stock price of the company seems to be undervalued across P/E and P/cash flow measures, compared to its competitors and the industry. Compared to its five-year average, the company stock price also evidently indicates that it is currently trading below its five-year average and will begin to increase in the near future.Forward-looking Guidance:For the fiscal year 2013 the company expects 10 to 12 percent growth in revenues ($4.55 billion to $4.65 billion), and an EPS of $2.76 to $2.82, for a total growth of 6 to 8 percent. By business segments, the company expects its small business group revenues to grow by 16 percent, consumer tax to grow by 9 percent, accounting professionals by 6 percent, financial services by 7 percent and other businesses by 2 percent, respectively.Conclusion:The company is doing business in a very competitive market in which entry barriers are very low, but most of its competitors are offering limited services to its customers. The company has a strong products and services portfolio that not a single competitor can match, which is a huge competitive edge. As mentioned above, the company generates most of its revenues from its consumer tax segment, which is seasonal in nature. But with the help of its strong business segments, it can easily manage this seasonal effect. An important point to note here is that the company's financial performance was not affected by the 2008 crisis, which indicates its business strengths, globally. With its strong financial position, compelling portfolio and increasing dividends, I recommend a buy rating to this stock.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Both companies admitted it was a rough tax season (Really? Because the rest of America loves tax season!) H&R Block reported .9% fewer filings than last year, at 22 million. H&R Block did report that its online filings increased by 10%, which is why Intuit's Turbo Tax saw declining numbers. Intuit had projected Turbo Tax filings to increase by 4%, but instead saw a 2% decrease. Intuit, which had similar growth in the last year to the S&P 500, saw most of its gains lost in one day as shares dropped 11% on Thursday.On April 15, I wrote that it was probably time to dump H&R Block given its tendency to see its stock price drop this time of year, regardless of the report. Last week's news about H&R Block shouldn't be surprising, and I think that is why the stock bounced back on Friday. However, the news from Intuit is surprising, which is why it dropped so dramatically.Take a look at the following charts. H&R Block does not display the growth and increase you want to see in sales, net income or EPS. Meanwhile over the last decade, Intuit has had steady and consistent improvements in each area.If you bought H&R Block before January, I congratulate you. Take those gains, along with your tax refund (and the $25 gift card you got from H&R Block if you experienced delays) and enjoy yourself! As for Intuit, it may be a good time to buy on the overreaction of last week.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2042963,20411,2014-02-24T10:16:49-05:00,,"Stock Traders Daily has selected Intuit (INTU) as the Stock of the Week this week. According to Stock Traders Daily, the increase in the stock last week after positive announcements from the company propelled the stock to levels at which inflection points exist.Although the announcements from the company were not negative, and instead the earnings and revenue projections have positive connotations, those announcements were not enough to propel the stock to much higher levels immediately (not higher than already seen). In fact, on Friday clear selling pressure was visible after the stock reached its intraday highs.According to the real time trading report for INTU offered by Stock Traders Daily, the stock is at important inflection levels now and the ability or the inability of the stock to hold inflection will be the determining factor in the performance of the stock from here. The Stock of the Week selection is not to buy Intuit, but instead the Stock of the Week selection is to short Intuit if the stock remains below this longer-term inflection level.In summary, the positive news that propelled the stock last week, primarily concerning the online subscription rates for TurboTax and QuickBooks, is not enough for us to consider the stock to be a buy at current levels. To the contrary, unless the stock is capable of increasing beyond the important inflection levels it is testing, the stock is instead a short.This Stock of the Week selection is based on price, with a fundamental kicker. The news simply was not good enough in our opinion to warrant higher levels.The Stock of the Week is a Strategy that has been in place since December, 2007, the beginning of the credit crisis, and it is designed to trade one stock every week proactively, with integrated risk controls.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: By Thomas H.

1038091,24906,2012-11-30T11:29:51-05:00,,"Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) has been a wonderful growth company this decade. Over the past six years, sales have kept a CAGR of 8%, EBIT margins have grown from 24% in FY 2007 to 28% in FY 2012, and cash flow as a multiple of net income has been consistent at a strong 1.5 times. In addition to value created from profits, shares have been repurchased every year since FY 2007, with the FY 2007 share count exceeding FY 2012 shares outstanding by 14%.Despite a 22 times earnings multiple, I find INTU to be sharply undervalued for three main reasons: 1) the consumer tax market for software use is largely untapped, and the customer base for the consumer tax and accounting markets will continue to grow beyond market expectations; 2) free cash flow growth will allow continued share repurchase programs in the near future (in addition to the current one); and 3) margins will continue to expand as INTU's business solutions products grow share, and consumer tax and accounting products expand their already dominant position in the industry.As described above, the market has rewarded INTU's growth and consistently stronger sales. I will outline why the price of INTU stock should be at least 20%-30% higher than the current price. Every piece of data and information, unless otherwise noted as a forecast or estimate, is from publicly shared sources. Also, all figures are in millions aside from per unit figures. Below are a few valuation metrics for Intuit:Summary of IntuitIntuit offers tax and accounting products, financial services products, and business solution products (i.e., small business accounting), the last of which include financial, employee, and payment management solutions. Intuit's software product breakdown is as follows, including as a percentage of sales and EBIT:Click to enlarge images.Generally, since the tax software products make up the majority of EBIT, overall profits and cash flows tend to be very seasonal, making annual figures the most useful. I believe this has drawn some investors away from investment or at least stayed investment until the beginning of the year.1. The consumer tax market is currently untapped, and the customer base for the consumer tax and accounting markets will continue to grow beyond market expectations.Income tax filers can file taxes either by pen/paper or they can file electronically. If they file electronically, tax filers can either use government e-filing services online or they can purchase consumer tax software. The latter include companies like Intuit, TaxACT (acquired in January 2012 by Blucora (NASDAQ:BCOR) from 2nd Story Software), or H&R Block (NYSE:HRB). These three companies make up roughly 88% of the electronic tax filing market, with Intuit commanding about 64% market share. In addition, in 2005, the IRS estimated that 64 million people filed taxes by pen and paper and 68 million filed taxes electronically, 48% and 52%, respectively, of tax-paying individuals. Since then, electronic tax filers have jumped to about 72% of market shares. That implies that the decrease year over year in pen-and-paper filings is around 5.5% a year.A market share table can be found below:Based on the information here, there is still a huge market potential for INTU. With 43 million pen-and-paper filers and nearly half still using the government e-filing system, there remains a largely untapped market for INTU to take slices from.Intuit's market-leader position will give it the lion's share of new workers that begin paying taxes, older workers switching from pen-and-paper methods, and others seeking a better service than the government e-filing system. For every one of these groups entering the e-filing consumer market, INTU will acquire roughly 64% of them. Below you can see how the market has grown in e-filers and shrunk in pen-and-paper filers, implying a residual for ""new filer"" growth (had neither been a pen-and-paper filer nor an e-filer).Before moving on, I want to note the importance of the business model here on consumer tax revenues. Other than being a subscription-based software model, like most of Intuit's products are, TurboTax has an inherently defensible business model. When you file taxes on TurboTax the first year, it becomes much easier for you to file again with TurboTax the next year. There is little or no reason to switch because all of your prior-year information is stored electronically, such as your W-2s. You'll also be more familiar with a very easy-to-use software that helps you to minimize the amount of income taxes you have to pay as they guide you through deductions.2. Strong free cash flow growth.Aside from growing revenue base and profitability from expansion, INTU earns a very healthy amount of free cash flow, which continues to grow in excess of net income. Earning nearly 1.5 times net income and almost 25% of revenues in free cash flow, INTU will have more cash for acquisitions (i.e., Mint.com) that allow it to market its other financial products (i.e., Quickbooks and Quicken) to consumers. At a 5.6% LFCF yield, INTU's FCF is not necessarily cheap, but nor is it at all expensive considering the growth of its products and product markets.3. Margin expansion as products become more defensible.Since FY 2007, INTU EBIT margins have grown from 24% (bottoming at 22% in FY 2008) to 28% in FY 2012. Because so much of Intuit's revenue growth is based on the sale of software products and much less on services (like HRB), INTU maintains great economies of scale. This allows INTU an increased return on smaller increases in cost, and why I expect margins to be 30% by FY 2015.The keys to margin growth will be increased revenue in Consumer Tax/Accounting and Small Business Group product markets and acquisitions of other high margin companies (such as PayCycle for INTU's Employee Management Solutions segment in 2009). Potential limiting factors on margin growth will be INTU's Free Tax Advice offering for the Consumer Tax segment. Intuit is using the Free Tax Advice program to market itself to consumers and teach them about proper filing methods and techniques. I think this service will be a long-run benefit for Intuit if it succeeds in getting enough potential software users to use TurboTax or Quickbooks.A Re-ValuationBased on the facts and figures listed above, I have forecast INTU financials to FY 2015. In order to focus more on the mispricing of the company and growth of at least half of INTU's EBIT, I will not elaborate on Intuit's other product markets, many of which have also seen strong growth in the past five years. A table deconstructing INTU's product lines and margins can be found below:Using the facts and figures from above, we can build the Consumer Tax segment revenue that is highlighted in the above table:Furthermore, using the revenue EBIT margin forecasts, we can predict FY 2015 net income and EPS:The resulting price appreciation is substantial. If we assume that INTU completes their share repurchasing program ($1.6 billion left) by FY 2015, the target price is $90 (a 53% appreciation). On the other hand, if we assume a lower earnings multiple than today's 22 times, say 20 times, we're looking at a target price of $65 (a price appreciation of 11%). With the repurchasing program, this lower-multiple pricing becomes $72 (appreciation of 22%). These scenarios imply that some completion of the purchasing program and continued growth beyond the next two to three years will reap at least a 20%-30% rise in share price. Since there is still a large percentage of the market left to grow even after FY 2015 in terms of pen-and-paper filers remaining and new filers entering, I don't see much downside in the multiple in the near term.ConclusionStrong brand names, recurring revenue sources, pricing power from dominant market share, competitive advantages across product lines, and high and expanding margins make Intuit a buy and hold.Disclosure: I am long INTU. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article."

The consensus estimate is $2.48 for EPS and $1.96B for revenue, according to First Call. The company is looking to beat analyst estimates for the third quarter in a row. Guidance provided by management for Q3 is EPS of $2.47-$2.51 on revenue of $1.95B-$1.99B. Management also reaffirmed its FY12 guidance on April 20 for EPS of $2.90-$2.97 and revenue of $4.185B-$4.285B. Citigroup said that Q1 results and guidance a foregone conclusion. Its Q1 estimate of $2.47 on revenue of $1.96B is in-line with the Street and the firm expects a narrowing of guidance as tax outcome is now certain, but none of this should be a surprise. Citigroup believes that the tax uncertainty needs to be cleared up and double-digit forward growth endorsed for shares to work near term. The firm expects Intuit to attempt to do this on the earnings call but it may take until the analyst meeting in September. Despite tax concerns, emerging concerns in enterprise and Europe may make Intuit an attractive defensive long trade as the company is 95%+ U.S.-exposed."
557211,29361,2012-05-03T16:15:37-04:00,,"Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU), one of small business' best friends, performed well across all its segments in fiscal 2011 (July)With fixed costs under control, revenue growth of 11.5% translated into operating profits jumping 14% and net income increasing 18% to $ 634 Mn.Best known for TurboTax and QuickBooks (market leaders by wide margins in their respective markets), Intuit is well positioned to take advantage of the migration of small business onto cloud and online services. It should grow earnings about 17% each year over the next three years on these growth factors…Cross selling - Intuit's main products, QuickBooks, TurboTax, Intuit Payroll, PayCycle, and credit card processing are integrated with each other and provide great opportunities to cross sell to the same customer at a lower cost.Online FocusKey to Intuit's growth is their online and cloud focus. Their fastest grower in 2011 was QuickBooks Online, which grew 35% from a small base of 350,000 users, a fraction of 4 Mn QuickBooks users. Quick books online also brought in a larger number of new customers to Intuit in 2011 - a non traditional source of newer generation, small businesses attracted to the mobility and flexibility of online accounting. Besides QB online, Intuit also saw better growth of 22% at PayCycle (Online Payroll) a company it bought a few years back to complement its payroll service offering, usually sold through QuickBooks as a Payroll module. Intuit is a small player in this segment compared to ADP (NASDAQ:ADP) and Paychex (NASDAQ:PAYX), but the online focus is a step in the right direction. Intuit also wide acceptance for Snap Tax Mobile and Turbo Tax for the IPAD this year.Recurring Revenue StreamsUnlike desktop versions of QuickBooks - QuickBooks online users are charged a monthly fee. Intuit estimates that it makes 20% more this way over the lifetime of the product.Similarly, Intuit's Credit Card Processing service also earns monthly subscription and transaction charges. GoPayment, its mobile payment platform drove growth in this segment.Growing abroadIntuit grew its other segment business by 15% mainly due to forays into Canada, U.K, Singapore and India.ChallengesThe QuickBooks Online version is very weak compared to the desktop one and unless there is substantial improvement on this front I don't see enough businesses transitiong online.I agree with Robert Broen's assessment that Intuit's purchase of Demandforce was expensive. My take is that the average business user of QuickBooks would not spend $200 to $300 a month extra on customer communication. I think Intuit should focus well within its domains of accounting, payroll, taxes and business processing. Distractions could be expensive and a waste of capital.ValuationConsensus estimates call for earnings of $2.59 for July 12, $ 2.96 for July 13 and $ 3.34 for July 14. I'm slightly more bullish and expect $ 3.05 and $ 3.50 in July 13 and July 14. With a forward (July 12) PE of 22, Intuit is a tad on the expensive side. However, given its market leadership, huge cash generation from its flagship, TurboTax and the regularity with which it has been introducing new products in line with market trends, I would invest for the long term and buy in increments between $55 and $60.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
1620842,23469,2013-08-08T17:29:34-04:00,,"OverviewIntuit (NASDAQ:INTU) is a stock with upside due to strong financial health, strong profitability, solid cash flow and efficiency, and a lot of growth potential. Intuit has a simple and well thought-out growth plan that could tap into billions of dollars of opportunities that it has identified. We see the company as having around 38% upside in the next twelve months with our $88 price target.ValueINTU has decent value that is a little below positive. The stock's future PE is 21.8, and we look for value below 15. So this ratio is a little high but INTU's future PE at 17.4 indicates growth and comes closer to the 15 mark we look for. We can find the most positive ratios in Price/FCF and Price/OCF. These strong ratios indicate the company has good cash flow, a huge plus for INTU.INTU's Price/Sales is very weak. We tend to look for value under 1.0. The company though is at 4.2. The company's Price/Book ratio is also very weak at 5.3. We do have to note that this ratio can be misleading. Price/Book only takes into account tangible assets. INTU has $2,413 million in intangible assets that are not being considered in the Price/Book ratio.The company's PEG ratio is important at 1.6 as it shows decent value as well. PEG shows a company's value in comparison to its growth capabilities. At 1, the company is very valuable in comparison to growth. PEG does a good job of showing overall value, so this is a strong point for INTU.The company shows good value in EV/Sales and its future PE as well. EV/Sales is a solid comparison of the company's market capitalization to annual sales. The ratio allows us to see how much it costs to buy the company's sales. The low EV/Sales ratio shows that it is not expensive to buy out the company, which is very positive for INTU.Finally, INTU presently has fairly high debt levels. In later sections we will look at the details of this debt and how the company is managing it. All in all the company has good value that isn't being priced in too strongly at this point.GrowthGrowth is very strong for INTU. When we look back at YoY and five-year growth percentages we see positive numbers across the board. Even projected 2013 and 2014 growth ratios are strong. Let's look at what INTU has to say about its growth record and future prospects.In the company's Q3 earnings report INTU reports its third-quarter revenue at $2.178 billion, up 13% YoY. The company attributes this mainly to promotion of Small Business Group revenues, up 17% for the quarter, through strong growth in online sales. The company introduced QuickBooks Online for the iPad, designed for small businesses that need to be mobile. INTU also launched Intuit Pay in the UK, making itself the first company to market mobile payment solutions in that region. During Q3, the company also doubled QuickBooks Online-paying customers to 27,000 in more than 100 countries outside the US.In this report Brad Smith, INTU's president and CEO, stated, ""We continue to see strong progress delivering on our connected services strategy across our businesses in the third quarter. TurboTax paid units increased 4 percent, and we expect TurboTax revenue growth of about 4 percent for the fiscal year. While it was a challenging tax season overall, we made progress in several key areas, growing new customers including first time and former tax store customers, and significantly increasing mobile adoption. Activity is already well underway for next year, with an intense focus on product and customer experience.""We will look at the details of INTU's growth initiatives later in the ""Catalyst"" section of this article.We see a steady amount of growth in INTU's recent financial history and believe that the company is making the right decisions to continue that growth in the coming fiscal year.ProfitabilityProfitability is very strong for INTU. Let's see how the company compares to the competition.The company's closest competition is H&R Block, Inc. (NYSE:HRB), Sage Group plc (OTCPK:SGPYY) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). Operating margins for INTU are very high at 27.6%. How does that compare to HRM, SGPYY and MSFT? The companies have operating margins at 24.0%, 12.5% and 34.4%, respectively. We can see that INTU is very strong for the industry but is beat out by MSFT. When we look at gross margins, the companies have ratios at 44.8%, 93.9% and 74.0%, respectively. Again INTU lands at the higher end of the competition but is beat out this time by SGPYY. These numbers tell us that elevated margins are standard for the application software industry.One thing that could be holding INTU's margins back, even though they are excellent as they stand, are its SG&A costs. In the company's Q3 earnings report, INTU shows a 15% increase YoY in selling and marketing, a 9% increase research and development, and a 9% increase in general and administrative costs. While it did experience a 33% increase in costs YoY, the company's overall revenue during this time period only increased 8%.One of the weakest ratios in this category for INTU is Asset Turnover. This measurement tells us the amount of sales being generated for every dollar's worth of assets. INTU's Asset Turnover is not incredibly strong, although INTU's ROA is a much stronger number.Cash Flow And EfficiencyCash flow and efficiency is a plus for INTU. The company scores very high and is in the Positive area, and we believe this indicator is one of the best for future potential. For one, the company is now offering a strong dividend with a 1.1% yield. For investors, they want to know that the dividend is safe. Several indicators make us think that it is.First, the company has great OCF/Sales at over 31%, and it has seen 66% growth in operating cash flow in the last five years. OCF is important to dividends because it is what is used to pay off dividends. FCF is important to see to believe that dividend hikes can occur. The company is also strong in its FCF/Sales ratio at 26.1%, and the company has seen 121.4% rise in free cash flow in the past five years, which is very positive.Solid cash flow is also helpful to pay off debt levels and improve the business without taking on more debt, which can help improve profitability.Let's see how INTU compares to HRB, SGPYY and MSFT in days sales outstanding, days inventory and the cash conversion cycle. HRB sits with 17.4, N/A and N/A, respectively. SGPYY is at 87.9 for days sales outstanding, 11.1 for days inventory and -1028.2 for cash conversion cycle. For MSFT, the company has 78.0 days sales outstanding, 27.7 days in inventory and 24.6 cash conversion cycle.As we can see efficiency ratios are a little different for application software companies. Often its products are intangible so we cannot measure the shelf life of products or how quickly they are sold. What we can deduce from these ratios is that HRB is INTU's best comparison though, and it does have a better days sales outstanding ratio.As we discussed briefly previously, INTU's asset turnover is decent but the company is not making a great deal of money off of its assets. That compares to 0.6 at HRB, 0.6 at SGPYY, and 0.6 at MSFT. In this comparison we see INTU is doing better than its competitors in asset turnover.Financial HealthFinancial Health is very strong for INTU. The company's current ratio at 1.8 is above the 1.0 threshold we look at for financial health, and the quick ratio at 1.5 is well above the level we look at before we see a major red flag at 0.5. How do these ratios compare to INTU's competition?HRB has a current ratio at 0.8 and quick ratio at 0.7. SGPYY has a current ratio at 0.5 and quick ratio at 0.5. Finally, MSFT has a current ratio at 2.9 and quick ratio at 2.7. We see that INTU beats out all the competition except MSFT, which has outstanding current and quick ratios.We see debt-to-equity at 8.6, which is very high. What's wrong with such a high debt-to-equity ratio? High debt levels versus equity levels can affect the company's ability to generate earnings as a result of high interest payments. How can INTU have such good financial health with high levels of debt?We use interest coverage ratio to measure how much a company is burdened by interest expenses. A ratio under 1.0 means the company is having problems generating enough cash flow to pay its interest expenses. Ideally we want the ratio to be over 1.5. At 39.8 INTU is having no problems with its interest expenses.Earlier we saw that INTU has relatively high debt levels. Here we see that the company is making its interest payments without a problem, and also that the current liabilities are low compared to other important metrics like gross profit, operating cash flow and cash and cash equivalents. While the company may have debt, it is managing it very well.CatalystIn a recent investor presentation, INTU outlined its growth strategies and priorities for fiscal years 2013-2015. The company breaks it down into five different categories: Amazing 1st Use Experience, Reimagining Mobile 1st/Mobile Only, Solving Multi-Sided Problems Well, Expanding Globally, and Enabling Customer Data. INTU is working to deliver a great customer experience from the first use. INTU wants to expand and innovate the mobile experience, which has continually been a cornerstone of the company's product. How exactly does INTU plan to do this?First of all, INTU has identified the company's Small Business Group segment as one of the greatest opportunities. INTU's QuickBooks product is what it can offer, and the company has identified a $5B opportunity in this area. QuickBooks solves small business payments needs through QuickBooks payments, retail payments and mobile payments anywhere, with any payment type, on any device. If Intuit can tap into this area, it could mean huge growth for the company.Another opportunity INTU has identified is growing its consumer base for its product: Demandforce. This product helps SMBs thrive in an evolving and increasingly complex, connected world. Users will benefit from automated marketing and communications solutions. INTU sees this as a value proposition based on generating 3x ROI each month. Again, the growth opportunity here is huge.The next area of opportunity INTU identifies is consumer tax. As of 2012 its product TurboTax was only making up 21% of total tax returns, and 7% of revenue for INTU. The company sees this as an opportunity for long-term growth. In a comparison with other accounting options, INTU shows that its TurboTax software is far more affordable than a CPA or Franchise. It then shows that INTU's biggest percentage of TurboTax customers is its retained pre-existing customers. So it shows that the product TurboTax, once a customer uses it, does a great job of keeping those customers coming back. Given all this information INTU has announced its plan to grow TurboTax revenues to reacquire and retain customers. With this new goal in mind, INTU has projected 8-9% revenue growth guidance for the full 2013 fiscal year.All in all INTU's growth plan is simple. For all of the software mentioned the company's goal is to attract and acquire new users, retain existing users and increase its offerings to each user to insure maintained profits and increased revenues during the 2013-2015 fiscal years.Price Target AnalysisStep 1.Project operating income, taxes, depreciation, capex and working capital for five years. Calculate cash flow available by taking operating income - taxes + depreciation - capital expenditures - working capital.Step 2.Calculate present value of available cash flow (PV factor of WACC * available cash flow). You can calculate WACC, but we have given this number to you. The PV factor of WACC is calculated by taking 1 / [(1 + WACC)^# of FY years away from current]. For example, 2016 would be 1 / [(1 + WACC)^4 (2016-2012). WACC for INTU: 7.1%Step 3.For the fifth year, we calculate a residual calculation. Taking the fifth year available cash flow and dividing by the cap rate, which is calculated by WACC subtracting out residual growth rate, calculate this number. Companies with high levels of growth have higher residual growth, while companies with lower growth levels have lower residual growth. Cap Rate for INTU: 4.1%Step 4.Calculate Equity Value - add PV of residual value, available cash flow PVs, current cash, and subtract debt:Step 5.Divide equity value by shares outstanding:ConclusionWith a lot of potential upside from new products and growth opportunities, we believe INTU is a very solid growth name with good value and solid financial health. On top of that, the company delivers a dividend to investors as an added bonus. With around 30% potential in the next twelve months, we like INTU as a low-risk buy.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.

Other Businesses revenue  grew 6.0% on the back of Intuit’s global business.Operating ResultsReported gross margin fell 130 basis points (bps) from the year-ago  quarter to 89.6%. The margin contraction was mainly due to the Consumer  Tax segment, partially offset by some cost minimization efforts.Operating margin in the quarter fell 50 bps year over year to 56.9%.  Though total operating expenses increased 2.7%, the percentage on total  revenue contracted.GAAP net income was $734.0 million or $2.42 per share, compared with  $688.0 million or $2.20 per share delivered in the year-ago quarter.  Excluding amortization expenses but including stock-based compensation  expenses, the adjusted net income in the quarter was $735.4 million or  $2.43 per share versus $699.1 million or $2.23 in the year-ago quarter.Balance Sheet & Cash FlowIntuit ended the quarter with cash, equivalents and investments of  $1.52 billion, up from $959.0 million in the previous quarter. Accounts  receivables were $294.0 million compared with $592.0 million in the  previous quarter. As of April 30, 2011, long-term debt was $499.0  million, down from $999.0 million in the prior quarter.Intuit had $1.28 billion of operating cash in the third quarter versus  $260.0 million in the prior quarter. Capital expenditure was $33.0  million. During the quarter, Intuit repurchased shares worth $207.0  million and paid off $500.0 million of debt and $45.0 million in  dividend.OutlookFor the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, the company expects revenues in  the range of $647 million to $662.0 million. GAAP operating loss is  expected in the range of $25.0 million to $15.0 million. Non-GAAP  operating income is estimated in the $30.0 million to $40.0 million  range. GAAP loss per share is projected in the range of 7 cents to 5  cents. The company also expects non-GAAP diluted EPS in the 5 cents to 7  cents range.For fiscal 2012, the company expects revenues in the $4.205 billion to  $4.220 billion range (previously $4.185 billion to $4.285 billion),  representing growth of 9.0% to 10.0%. GAAP operating income is estimated  between $1.180 billion and $1.190 billion (previously $1.190–$1.215  billion), reflecting growth of 17% to 18%. Non-GAAP operating income is  projected at $1.400–$1.410 billion (previously $1.405–$1.430 billion),  representing growth of 12.0% to 13.0%. GAAP diluted EPS is expected to  grow in the range of 22.0–25.0% to $2.44–$2.49 (previously $2.43 to  $2.50). Non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected between $2.92 and $2.97  (previously $2.90 to $2.97), indicating a growth of 16.0% to 18.0%.Management also mentioned at the conference call that Intuit’s fiscal  2012 earnings could slightly be diluted for the acquisition of  Demandforce, earlier this month. But at the same time, it mentioned that  the additional unit will add modestly to fiscal 2013 earnings.Our TakeIntuit is a leading provider of business and financial management  solutions to small and medium-sized businesses, consumers, accounting  professionals and financial institutions. The company delivered modest  third quarter results, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimates on the  bottom line but missing the same on the top line. We are concerned about  fiscal 2012 guidance lowering.But we believe that there is ample scope for the increase of Intuit’s  SMB exposure. Intuit recorded 11.0% year-over-year revenue growth in its  SMB group in its second quarter 2012 results, and expects to witness  healthy year-over-year growth of 10.0–12.0% in fiscal 2012. The  acquisition of Demandforce is a perfect fit for Intuit’s SMB business  segment. Upon closure, Demandforce will be included as a new sub-segment  in Intuit’s SMB Group.However, we remain concerned due to the seasonality of Intuit’s tax  business and ongoing uncertainty in the economy at large. Moreover, we  think that Intuit is going to face stiff competition from the leading  payroll solution provider Paychex Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX)  in the SMB (small and medium business) sector as the latter introduced  certain tools that aim at solving certain tax credit related problems  for SMBs.Currently, Intuit has a Zacks #4 Rank, which translates into a short-term Sell rating."

The all cash deal which is subject to regulatory approval is expected to close in May 2012. The acquisition is expected to add between one or two points to Intuit's revenue growth for the fiscal year of 2013 and is neutral to slightly dilutive for earnings per share.DemandforceSan Francisco based Demandforce generated $37.5 million in sales last year. The company which was founded as recent as 2003 employs 300 employees who will move over to Intuit. The company's services allows small businesses to improve their communication with customers by scheduling online appointments. The monthly subscription rates of $200-$300 are far above the rates of Intuit's own services. Intuit hopes to successfully increase cross-selling between its own services and those of Demandforce in an attempt to boost growth and margins.Acquisition Based strategyUnder the lead of CEO Brad Smith Intuit has been acquiring companies in order to expand into the mobile payments and health care industry. Known from its tax-preparation software including Quicken and TurboTax, Intuit previously acquired mobile based AisleBuyer LLC for an unknown amount. The company's strategy is based on a convergence of tax preparation and payroll software converging in an online and mobile environment.ValuationIntuit ended its fiscal year 2011 with $959 million in cash and equivalents and operates with $999 million in short and long term debt for a small debt position of $40 million. Shares of Intuit trade at an annual revenue mulitple of 4.4 times and 27 times 2011's annual earnings, based on a current valuation of $17 billion. This compares to revenue multiples of 5.4 times for Paychex (NASDAQ:PAYX) and 2.8 times for Automated Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP).Currently the company pays a quarterly dividend of $0.15 for an annual dividend yield of 1.0%Investment ThesisShares of Intuit trade just shy of all time highs of $62 per share set earlier this month, but have fallen some 6% ever since. Despite the little setback shares have returned over 150% in merely three years as the company has shown accelerating revenue growth accompanied with margins peaking at 16.5%The addition of Demandforce which is rather expensive does increase the overall growth profile of Intuit and fits within the strategy of convergence of payroll and tax software and more mobile based strategies. Despite strong revenue growth and high margins I am not a buyer as the valuation already reflects these positive developments.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

(NASDAQ:INTU) with a market capitalization of just $16.25 billion will be reporting its first quarter fiscal 2012 results on November 17.Fourth Quarter OverviewThe company had a bad fourth quarter, with adjusted loss of 11 cents  per share, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate for a loss of 10  cents.Intuit reported revenues of $593.0 million in the reported quarter, up  10.4% from $537.0 million in the prior-year quarter. Reported revenues  surpassed management’s guidance range of $567.0 million to $587.0  million.The GAAP operating loss was $61.0 million compared with $64.0 million  in the year-ago quarter. Excluding special items, non-GAAP operating  income was $25.0 million compared with a loss of $9.0 million in the  year-ago quarter.GuidanceFor the first quarter of fiscal 2012, the company expects revenues of  $575.0 million to $585.0 million, up 8.0% to 10.0%. GAAP operating loss  is expected in the range of $95.0 million to $105.0 million, compared  with a loss of $104.0 million in the year-ago quarter. Non-GAAP  operating loss is projected between $40.0 million and $50.0 million,  compared with a loss of $53.0 million in the year-ago quarter.GAAP net loss per share is estimated in the range of 24 cents to 26  cents, compared with a loss of 22 cents in the year-ago quarter.  Non-GAAP net loss per share is expected in the range of 11 cent to 13  cent, compared with a loss of 12 cents in the year-ago quarter.Agreement of AnalystsOut of the 8 analysts providing estimates for the first quarter, none  revised estimates in the last 30 days. For the second quarter, only one  analyst made a downward revision in the estimate. For fiscal year 2012  too, there have been no changes in analyst estimates. Again for fiscal  year 2013, only one analyst has revised its estimate downward over the  last 30 days.Some analysts are of the opinion that with SMB indicators turning  slightly positive, Intuit’s focus on the SBG (small business group)  should work in the company’s favor.. The SMB segment remains essentially  flat with July and the Small Business Employment Index improved  sequentially by 1.0%.Again, the release of QuickBooks 2012 during the quarter had a positive  impact on the analyst estimate. As a result, some analysts are  projecting Financial Management revenue of $169.0 million (projecting a  growth of 10.0% on a year-over-year basis). This apart, the analysts are  positive on the other segments, thereby projecting the Employee  Management revenue of $119.0 million (growth of 11.0% on a  year-over-year basis) and Payment Solutions at $89.0 million (growth of  11.0% on a year-over-year basis).Magnitude of Estimate RevisionsFor the past 30 days, there was no revision in first quarter estimates,  while over a period of 60 days, the company increased its loss per  share by 2 cents to 20 cents. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate  increased by 5 cents to $2.57 in the past 60 days.Again, for the fiscal year 2013, the earnings improved by 6 cents to $2.94, over the last 90 days.RecommendationManagement is confident about gaining market share in its Small  Business Group and Consumer Tax business, and has provided decent first  quarter guidance. Moreover, the improvements in SMB indicators may  impact result in a positive way.On the other hand, the analysts remain concerned about the challenges  faced by the company in this recent economic turmoil. They expect slow  recovery in business activity. However, we believe that the company’s  effort to drive double-digit revenue growth by improving its core  fundamentals will lead to decent first quarter results.Currently, Intuit has a short-term Hold recommendation, as indicated by the Zacks #3 Rank.DELL INC: Free Stock Analysis ReportHEWLETT PACKARD: Free Stock Analysis ReportINTUIT INC: Free Stock Analysis ReportZacks Investment Research"

From Apple, to Google, to Cisco, these companies all change their industries, and make our lives easier. The company we are highlighting today is another child of Silicon Valley, Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU).Intuit, founded in 1983, provides a range of financial software and solutions to ordinary people, small businesses, and large scale financial institutions. Its Quicken and TurboTax products are synonymous with consumer finance, and TurboTax has helped close many tax-preparation businesses over the years, all while rewarding shareholders along the way. Since its IPO in 1993, Intuit has returned over 1,700%, trouncing the S&P 500's 168% advance. What is interesting about Intuit is that it did not reach its all time high during the dot-com bubble, but rather this year.We feel that Intuit has more room to grow, and the company has several growth initiatives, including:Intuit has been committed to growing its business, and has not held back in investing in initiatives such as Intuit Health and Mint. All this investment has been funded with internal cash, and Intuit's balance sheet has just $500 million of debt. What is more impressive is that Intuit has been able to do this while consistently buying back stock. Intuit has repurchased $1.4 billion in stock this fiscal year and has authorized a new buyback program totaling another $2 billion. But what has us most excited and confident about Intuit's future is that they have initiated a quarterly dividend of 15 cents, which yields about 1.2%, which shows that management is truly confident in Intuit's future prospects, for dividends are initiated only during prosperous times for a business. We feel that Intuit is a great investment due to the continued migration to the cloud, as well as the international expansion of its accounting and financial products. Intuit is committed to both investing in growth and rewarding shareholders. We feel that the prospects for future growth at Intuit are bright, and feel that now is a great time to add to or initiate a position in a leading software company that, in our opinion, is just beginning to realize its true potential.Disclosure: I am long INTU."
539881,22829,2012-04-29T04:58:21-04:00,,"by Ben KoladaIntuit (NASDAQ:INTU) on Friday announced its largest M&A move in six years, acquiring SMB-focused marketing automation startup Demandforce for $423.5m. The deal, and Demandforce's valuation, was primarily driven by the target's market traction. The company, founded just in 2003, has amassed a customer roster of more than 35,000 SMBs. The transaction also demonstrates the accounting and tax giant's desire to further penetrate this market with additional products and services - this is its first major play in marketing automation.The Demandforce acquisition complements Intuit's QuickBooks software and expands its offerings for SMBs. (We'd note that Intuit already offers a marketing management product called QuickBase.) Demandforce provides marketing automation SaaS and helps businesses maintain an online profile and better communicate with their customers. The company has grown considerably over its short lifetime. According to Inc.com's annual survey of the fastest-growing companies, Demandforce generated $15.3m in revenue in 2010, up from $6.4m in 2009. Continuing that growth rate would put its 2011 revenue at roughly $25-30m.Intuit is handing over $423.5m in cash for Demandforce, making this deal Intuit's largest since it forked over $1.35bn for transaction processor Digital Insight in 2006. Demandforce's growth certainly factored into its valuation. Assuming that Demandforce maintained historical growth rates, Intuit's offer would value the target at a whopping 15-20 times trailing sales. If our initial estimates are correct, that valuation is double and even triple some precedent valuations. For example, in 2010, IBM (NYSE:IBM) bought Unica for 4.4x sales. Unica had flatlined during its final years as a public company, with revenue remaining in the $100m ballpark for the four years before its sale. The valuation is also double Teradata's (NYSE:TDC) Aprimo acquisition, also announced in 2010. Teradata paid $525m for Aprimo, or 6.3x sales."

281599,24276,2011-07-25T15:36:05-04:00,,"By most measures Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) is a winner.It has a dominant position in its niche of financial software. Institutions own 87% of the stock, which has a P/E of over 23.The company has gotten through the open source era unscathed – millions of people still download regular updates to its proprietary Quicken program despite having lots of open source alternatives. The cloud may only accelerate this growth, although unless you listen very closely you may not hear it.Anything with a substantial online presence is now happy to assert they're a cloud play. Thus if you believe the hype Intuit is a cloud play. Much of what it does is not provided as a service, not as software you buy in a store or download.These include its Financial Services unit, which offers services to customers through banks, and its Intuit Health unit, which already has 4 million people in its patient portal.These are fast-growing niches, and Intuit is in a sweet spot, albeit hidden behind others' brand names. But when your bank suddenly offers you more online services, chances are they're coming from Intuit. And when your hospital suddenly starts offering you new services, that may well be coming from Intuit, too.More specifically, those services are probably coming out of Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure cloud, because the two companies have been collaborating closely since early last year. By integrating its online offerings through Azure, Intuit has been able to quickly adapt its product line to tablets and smart phones.Microsoft is not the only cloud Intuit is playing on. It's following its customers. With millions of smaller businesses doing their customer relationship management on Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM), Intuit has made an alliance with them.What a lot of these deals have in common is Intuit going to market under others' brand names. That reduces its marketing costs while still increasing its business. So if you only evaluate the company's earnings and prospects based on things like Quicken or QuickBooks, you may be missing most of the earnings iceberg, and its momentum.Which may be why so many analysts give Intuit a buy or overweight rating, with the average price target of $60 for a company currently trading at under $48.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

The consensus estimate is (12c) for EPS and $580.66M for revenue, according to First Call. Intuit is expected to report another loss in Q1, which is always its weakest quarter. Due to its tax and financial software focus, Intuit always posts its strongest results in fiscal Q2 and Q3. Management previously provided Q1 revenue guidance of $575M-$585M, representing a year-over-year increase of 8%-10%. Non-GAAP Q1 operating loss is projected to come in between $40M-$50M, and (11c)-(13c) per share. Commentary about the upcoming tax season following the company's Q1 results is considered to be more important than the topline number for Q1. After speaking with Intuit's QuickBook partners, Citigroup believes that small business demand is sound, with adoption of ancillary services accelerating. Citigroup expects Intuit's Q1 results to be towards the high-end of guidance, consistent with the firm's $583M revenue estimate, which is ahead of the consensus estimate. A significant ramp in hiring by Intuit during the past few months suggests earnings is more likely to be at the low-end of guidance, although EPS this quarter is less meaningful than at other times of the year, Citigroup notes. The firm is expecting Intuit's Q2 guidance to be in-line with the consensus estimate of EPS of 43c on $1.0B in revenue, although the firm's bias is to the upside. Investors will focus on: 1) Commentary around 2011 tax season; 2) The macro/SMB outlook; 3) Competitive dynamic within the tax sector after the acquisition of TaxAct by H&R Block (NYSE:HRB) was halted by the Department of Justice. 4) QuickBooks metrics such as unit growth and online transition. Management is not expected to revise its prior FY12 guidance of $4.185B-$4.285B in revenue, operating income of $1.400B-$1.425B and FY12 EPS of $2.85-$2.94"

253631,22421,2011-02-17T17:51:36-05:00,,"Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) said today that second quarter revenue, while up 5  percent year-over-year, fell short of expectations - and the company  placed some of the blame on the IRS, which was not accepting certain  e-filed tax returns until mid-February.For the quarter ending Jan. 31, the maker of Quicken and TurboTax  financial software, reported non-GAAP earnings of 32 cents on revenue of  $878 million. Wall Street analysts had been expecting earnings of 34  cents on revenue of $884 million. (Statement)In a statement, company president and CEO Brad Smith said the trend  in do-it-yourself tax preparation is continuing and that Intuit is  “competing effectively” for market share and has a solid plan for the  remainder of the tax season. He said:Looking ahead, the company said it expects third-quarter revenue to  grow between 10-14 percent to $1.76 billion to $1.83 billion and expects  non-GAAAP earnings of $2.22 to $2.30 per share, an increase of 17-22  percent.The company also reiterated its full-year guidance of revenue growth  between 8-11 percent to $3.74 billion to $3.84 billion and non-GAAP EPS  of $2.41 to $2.48 per share, a jump of 14 percent to 18 percent.CFO Neil Williams said:By the numbers:"
270443,20568,2011-05-17T15:46:34-04:00,,"Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) is scheduled to announce its third quarter fiscal 2011 results on May 19, and we see some upward estimate revisions at this point reflecting a positive sentiment on the stock.Second Quarter OverviewIntuit reported a modest second quarter, missing our estimates both in terms of revenue and earnings per share (EPS). The quarter's EPS of 25 cents was also lower than 31 cents reported in the year-ago quarter. The miss was due to weak contributions from the Consumer Tax and Accounting Professional segments.Intuit delivered a 4.9% year-over-year growth in revenue but missed the company's guidance range. The growth in revenue was attributable to year-over-year improvements of 1.9% in Product revenues and 8.0% in Services and Other revenues, partially offset by a tax revenue push-out of roughly $60.0 million to the third quarter.During the quarter, most of the operating segments generated solid year-over-year growth, while contributions from Consumer Tax and Accounting Professionals segments were muted.The quarter's revenue lag also pulled down the margins.GuidanceFor the third quarter of fiscal 2011, Intuit expects revenues to range between $1.76 billion and $1.83 billion. Operating income is projected in the range of $1.0–$1.05 billion on a GAAP basis and $1.05–$1.10 billion on a non-GAAP basis. GAAP EPS is projected at between $2.10 and $2.18 and non-GAAP EPS between $2.22 and $2.30.Intuit reiterated its revenue and operating income guidance for fiscal 2011. The company expects revenues to range between $3.74 billion and $3.84 billion. Operating income is projected in the range of $980.0 million to $1.015 billion on a GAAP basis and $1.22 billion to $1.25 billion on a non-GAAP basis. GAAP loss per share is now projected within the $1.93–$2.00 range, which is higher than the previous expectation of $1.88–$1.95. Non-GAAP loss per share is expected to be between $2.41 and $2.48 versus the previous expectation of $2.36 to $2.43. The improved earnings outlook reflects a lower tax rate due to the extension of the research and development tax credit.On a segmental basis, Intuit still expects the Small Business Group to grow 8% to 12% year over year in fiscal 2011. The projected year-over-year growth rates are 10% to 13% (previously 8% to 12%) for the Consumer Tax business, 4% to 7% (reiterated) for Accounting Professional, roughly 7% (previously 4% to 7%) for Financial Services and 11% to 16% (reiterated) for Other businesses.Agreement of AnalystsOut of the 10 and 11 analysts providing estimates for the third quarter and fiscal 2011, only 1 made an upward revision in the last 30 days.The analysts are positive about Intuit's tax revenue update, which reflects more than 12% total paid unit growth and is higher than the analysts' expectations. Moreover, some analysts believe that Intuit is also gaining market share based on strong brand recognition and a secular shift toward “do-it-yourself” tax preparation.Magnitude of Estimate RevisionsThe magnitude of revisions for the third quarter has been minimal in the last 30 days, but was significant since the company reported its second quarter results. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the upcoming quarter has gone up a penny to $2.19 per share in the last 30 days. But the estimate was higher than $2.10 in the past 90 days.For fiscal 2011, estimates jumped from $2.08 90 days ago to $2.14. However, over the past 30 days, estimates increased by a penny. For 2012, estimates went up from $2.42 90 days ago to $2.47, with a marginal variation noticed over the last 30 days.RecommendationIntuit is a leading provider of business and financial management solutions for small and medium-sized businesses, consumers, accounting professionals and financial institutions. Management is confident about gaining market share in its Small Business group and Consumer Tax business, aided by accelerating customer growth and improving revenue per customer. We believe that strong contribution from the Consumer Tax segment will allow Intuit to outperform in the third quarter.The analysts remain positive about stabilization in SMB fundamentals, an expected cyclical recovery and the possibility of a market pull-back.However, stiff competition from H&R Block Inc. (NYSE:HRB) is a concern.Currently, Intuit has a short-term Buy recommendation, as indicated by the Zacks #2 Rank."

The adjusted EPS excludes amortization of intangible assets and tax gains, but includes stock-based compensation expenses.Historically, Intuit has reported losses in its first and fourth quarters, when revenue from the tax business is minimal and operating expense remain unchanged. (See conference call transcript here.)RevenueIntuit reported revenues of $532.0 million in the fourth quarter, up 12.2% from $474.0 million in the prior-year quarter. The quarter’s result also surpassed management’s guidance range of $515.0–$525.0 million and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $521.0 million.Product revenues increased 5.4% year over year to $216.0 million, while Services and Other revenues surged 17.5% from the prior-year quarter to $316.0 million.Overall growth in revenues could be attributable to the strong customer growth in the Small Business Group and prove to be another reason for the uptick.Consumer Tax, the largest segment, witnessed a 314.3% year-over-year growth in revenues, driven by the increase in total TurboTax units and TurboTax Online units.The Financial Services segment grew 1% year over year due to the increase in Internet banking and bill-pay users.Revenues from the Accounting Professionals segment surged 15% compared to the year-ago quarter.The Small Business Group revenue surged 12% year over year, driven by the double digit revenue growth in Financial Management Solutions and Employee Management Solutions.Financial Management Solutions (the second largest segment) registered 15% growth from the year-ago quarter, driven by growth in Intuit’s Websites’ customer base and higher QuickBooks Online subscriptions. Employee Management Solutions (formerly referred to as Payroll) was up 11%, especially helped by share growth online.Payment Solutions posted 7% year over year growth in the quarter based on a 15% merchant growth. However, transaction volumes per merchant suffered a bit due to lower consumer spending.Other businesses grew 27% from the year-ago quarter, driven by strong Quicken sales and healthy contribution from Small Business units in Canada and the U.K.Operating ResultsGAAP operating loss was $104.0 million, compared to a loss of $100.0 million in the year-earlier quarter. Excluding special items, non-GAAP operating loss was $53.0 million, compared to $40.0 million in the year-earlier quarter.GAAP net loss in the quarter was $70.0 million, or 22 cents per share, compared to a loss of $68.0 million, or 21 cents in the comparable period last year. Excluding stock based compensation as well as other special items, net loss on a non-GAAP basis was $39.0 million, or 12 cents per share, compared to $32.0 million, or 10 cents per share in the year-earlier period. The results were hurt by higher overall costs and operating expenses and lower revenue due to seasonality.However, including stock-based compensation, the adjusted loss per share in the quarter was 19 cents.Balance Sheet and Cash FlowIntuit ended the quarter with cash, equivalents and investments of $1.17 billion, down from $1.62 billion in the previous quarter. Accounts receivable was $147.0 million, compared to $135.0 million in the previous quarter. As of October 31, 2010, long-term debt also remained flat at $998.0 million.Intuit used up $211.0 million of operating cash in the first quarter, compared to $140.0 million in the prior-year quarter. Capital expenditure increased $19.0 million from the year-earlier quarter to $51.0 million.Share RepurchaseDuring the quarter, Intuit repurchased shares worth $330.0 million and had $1.67 billion remaining on its current share repurchase authorization at quarter-end. During the fourth quarter, the company received a new authorization from its board to buy back $2.0 billion of its common stock over the next three years, which will terminate in August 2013.OutlookFor fiscal year 2011, Intuit expects revenues to range between $3.74 billion and $3.84 billion. Operating income is expected to be in the range of $980.0 million to $1.015 billion on a GAAP basis and $1.22–$1.25 billion on a non-GAAP basis. GAAP loss per share is projected to be within $1.88–$1.95, and non-GAAP loss per share is between $2.36 and $2.43.On segmental basis, Intuit expects the Small Business Group to grow 8% to 12% year over year in fiscal 2011. The Consumer Tax business is expected to increase 8% to 12%, Accounting, Professional and Financial Services each to grow 4% to 7%, and Other businesses to grow 11% to 16% year over year.For the second quarter of fiscal 2011, Intuit expects revenues to range between $920.0 million and $940.0 million.

222442,22421,2010-08-26T11:08:21-04:00,,"For more than a year, Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) has been giving small business owners a tool to collect credit card payments remotely - a service called GoPayment that’s ideal for mobile professions, such as plumbers, electricians and tow-truck drivers.Now, the company has teamed with a small company called Morphie to enhance the credit card payment acceptance policy with a card reader and cover for the iPhone, called Complete Card Solution. The device itself, which will be available at Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) retail stores, will sell for $180. The updated version of the GoPayment app for iPhone is free but the service itself is $13 a month. There’s no contract and the company boasts a complete set-up time of about 15 minutes.The reader/cover is a sleek piece of hardware that’s also powerful enough to ensure that the encryption of data happens during the swiping of a credit card. The new offering also includes touch technology that allows customers to authorize a transaction by signing the iPhone’s touchscreen with a finger.I was a little rough on the companies during a briefing because the offering is only for the iPhone. In fact, it’s not even available for the iPhone 4, only the older iPhone 3G and 3Gs models. My argument was that small businesses might not necessarily be iPhone users. I pointed to recent trends surrounding sales of Android devices or the market lead still held by Blackberry.It’s important to note, the companies said, that the GoPayment service itself works across platforms. It’s only the new reader and app that’s iPhone only. Why? Because there’s only one shape and size of an iPhone. Because Android devices come in so many shapes and sizes, it would be too hard - the company’s word, not mine - to develop a reader for it.I was really expecting the companies to tell me something about how research found that owners of small businesses tend to be iPhone users or something like that. But that wasn’t the case. The companies were rewarding the iPhone for having no variety to its look, for being a one-size-fits-all kind of smartphone. The idea that it would be too hard to develop for other form factors felt like a bit like an excuse instead of a reason.I won’t take away from the technology that’s been developed here because it will change the way that mobile workers can instantly collect for their services, instead of having to deal with paper checks or invoices back at the office. And Intuit was quick to point out that there are Bluetooth card readers on the market to deliver a similar service on other formats.I’d like to think that the life of a product such as the one being offered by Intuit and Mophie is a stepping-stone product, one that won’t be needed someday and is only a short-term solution until technology comes in to make it obsolete. I can’t help but think of the early Palm docks that were connected to a computer with a wire to sync the mobile device and how Bluetooth technology and over-the-air sync technology turned the docks into flea market junk.Eventually, mobile devices will likely have some sort of card scanner - maybe using the camera of the device - to make swiping a credit card feel so very 2010. Until then, this comes across as a convenient temporary bridge until the technology evolves enough to make a stand-alone reader something that’s no longer necessary.Original post"

(NASDAQ:INTU) is scheduled to announce its first quarter fiscal 2011 results on November 18, and the limited estimate revisions up to this point reflect cautious sentiments on the stock.Fourth Quarter OverviewIntuit reported fourth quarter fiscal 2010 adjusted loss per share of 11 cents, which was better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 17 cents.

The growth in revenue was attributable to solid customer growth and business momentum in the Small & Medium Business (BATS:SMB) group.Operating loss in the quarter was $64.0 million, compared to $118.0 million in the earlier-year quarter. Operating expenses surged 4.5% from the year-ago quarter and was 111.9% of the total revenue.Intuit exited the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $1.62 billion, down from $1.35 billion in the prior-year quarter. Cash used in operations was $151.0 million, compared to $66.0 million in the year-ago quarter.GuidanceFor fiscal 2011, Intuit expects revenues to range between $3.74 billion and $3.84 billion. Operating income is expected to be in the range of $980.0 million to $1.015 billion on a GAAP basis and $1.22 billion to $1.25 billion on a non-GAAP basis.

GAAP loss per share is projected at between 25 cents and 23 cents and non-GAAP loss per share between 13 cents and 11 cents.Agreement of AnalystsNone of the 12 analysts providing estimates for first quarter 2011 and 13 analysts providing estimates for fiscal 2011 made any revisions to estimates.The analysts are of the opinion that Intuit’s October quarter is a seasonally smaller contributor to full-year results. They expect in line to slightly better results in the first quarter, driven by continued strength in the QuickBooks segment and a stabilizing SMB backdrop.Magnitude of Estimate RevisionsThe magnitude of revisions for the first quarter has also been minimal since the company reported its fourth quarter results. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the upcoming quarter has gone down from a loss per share of 17 cents ninety days ago to 19 cents, although remaining constant over the last thirty days.For fiscal 2011, estimates jumped from $2.03 ninety days ago to $2.10.

Consequently, the Zacks Rank for the stock is currently #4, implying a short-term Sell recommendation."

Management stated that the company gained share in both the desktop and web-based platforms. The Accounting Professional segment also benefited, with revenues of $205.0 million, representing a year-over-year increase of 15.0% due to a revenue shift of $9 million that was pushed out from the second quarter into the third quarter. Excluding this shift, revenue would have increased 10.0%. The Financial Institutions segment benefited from a strong season, as well as the introduction of Turbo Tax Online Banking during the quarter, which alone contributed 12 points of growth. Intuit integrated its TurboTax Online product with Digital Insight’s online banking platform, making it easier for financial institution customers to offer online tax preparation to their customers. The rest of the offerings are typically targeted at the small business market. Within this category, Financial Management Solutions (the second largest segment) registered 16% growth from the year-ago quarter. Management stated that the average revenue per user (ARPU) was helped by a better mix and lower promotional discounts. Employee Management Solutions (formerly referred to as Payroll) was up 13%, especially helped by share growth in online. The Other Business segment posted a revenue growth of 20.0% in the third quarter, driven primarily by strength in personal finance and currency tailwinds from Canada and the U.K. The personal finance business is benefiting from a strong new Quicken desktop release and the Mint.com acquisition.Operating Results Non-GAAP operating margin was 56.3%, was flattish compared to 56.5% reported in the year-ago quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding one-time income and charges, but including stock-based compensation expenses, net earnings was $586.0 million or $1.81 cents per share versus $508.5 million or $1.55 cents per share last year. EPS exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.74 cents by 7 cents. During the quarter, the company generated $1.04 billion of cash from operations, compared to $935.0 million last quarter. The company ended the quarter with cash and equivalents of $430.0 million, down from $679.0 million in the year-ago quarter. As of April 30, 2010, long-term debt remained unchanged at $998.0 million.Share Repurchase During the quarter, Intuit repurchased shares worth $200.0 million, with $150 million remaining authorized under the current share repurchase program.Outlook Based on a strong quarter’s results, particularly in the tax business, Intuit raised its full-year revenue, margins and earnings guidance.  For fiscal year 2010, Intuit now expects revenue to grow around 10.0% implying a revenue guidance of $3.41 billion – $3.43 billion. The company earlier expected revenues to grow around 6% – 9%. GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $840.0 million to $850.0 million, up from previously the expected range of $785.0 million to $825.0 million. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $1.065 billion to $1.075 billion, up from the previously expected range of $1.01 billion to $1.05 billion. GAAP EPS is projected at between $1.69 and $1.72, up from the previous projection of $1.63 to $1.70. Non-GAAP EPS is projected between $2.03 and $2.06, up from the previous projection of $1.97 to $2.04. The fourth quarter is a seasonally weak one for the company. For the fourth-quarter, Intuit expects revenues of between $492.0 million and $507.0 million. GAAP loss per share is forecasted at between $0.21 and $0.20, and non-GAAP loss per share is forecasted at between $0.11 and $0.10.Our Recommendation Intuit is a leading provider of business and financial management solutions for small and medium-sized businesses, consumers, accounting professionals and financial institutions. The company is seeing momentum in the business. However, we are concerned about margins going forward, given management’s strategy of bringing customers on board through a “free” program, to be subsequently transferred onto a “paid” platform. Moreover, we see limited momentum in the shares, given the run-up in prices since the beginning of the year. Consequently, the Zacks rank for the stock is currently #3, implying a short-term Hold recommendation."

Last month, Intuit said use of TurboTax rose 10% through the end of the tax season. MacMillan noted that he also sees potential in QuickBooks, Intuit's small business accounting software. He noted that employment is growing and small business spending is improving. Intuit's small business payments unit also has potential for significant acceleration as the economy picks up as does its employee management software business.Other bright spots for Intuit are its Mint.com unit, which has already posted impressive growth, international opportunities and its health care division. Intuit said last week it will buy Medfusion, a company that makes software that enables doctors and patients to communicate. MacMillan expects Intuit to post Q3 EPS of $1.84, on $1.56B in revenue.Separately, Janney Capital Markets analyst Sasa Zorovic raised his price target by $1 to $40 and reiterated a Buy rating.

CEO  Brad Smith was his usual effervescent, charismatic self and handled the  informal presentation.Several items stood out:During the Q&A session, Smith explained that his  team had chosen to focus on the PC version of Quicken after Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) woes  many years ago.  Recently, however, Intuit developed a Quicken for Mac  version from scratch called Quicken Essentials.  This new software is  only a few months old, and Smith said he hoped customers would  understand the difference between Quicken for PC -- which has decades'  worth of improvements -- and Quicken Essentials for Mac, which is a work  in progress.I asked how the government was helping and hindering Intuit. Smith said that  he hoped for a mutually beneficial partnership with the government, but noted that at  the same time, the government can be a hindrance when it seeks to  provide tax preparation directly to consumers, which is not the  government's core competency.  Each side should stick with what it does  best, said Smith.On another note, I  was really happy to get the opportunity to briefly chat with Intuit  co-founder Scott Cook after the meeting.  Cook, lest we forget,  helped Intuit beat Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) during its heyday years when it tried to  foist Microsoft Money on the public. In an ironic twist, Microsoft's  software ventures outside of its dominant operating system software have  been failures, primarily because it keeps trying to compete with other  natural/quasi-natural-monopolies like Intuit.I  mentioned to Cook that I wasn't so keen on the idea of looking for  growth and profitability in India; its very fragmented consumer  marketplace makes it very difficult for any company to establish a  dominant foothold (which harms a company's ability to increase its  margins), and it also has poor infrastructure. Most analysts who focus on  India use financial projections based on overly optimistic macro  factors (i.e., multiply anything by a billion and it looks like you can  make lots of money). Cook politely explained that the first step  was to generate revenue, and then profits.Disclosure: I own an insignificant number of Intuit (INTU) shares.

Vista Equity Partners is a leading private equity firm with more than $2.5 billion in committed equity capital, focused on investments in software and technology-enabled businesses. Intuit Real Estate Solutions revenue totaled approximately $74 million in fiscal year 2009 and was expected to be approximately $80 million in fiscal year 2010.  Management still expects its fiscal year 2010 revenue to grow between 4% and 8%, excluding IRES. Intuit does not expect this sale to have a meaningful impact on operating income or earnings per share guidance. IRES contributed $4 million to 2009 operating income and was expected to contribute approximately $8 million in fiscal 2010.  Intuit expects that the approximately 2-cent reduction in earnings per share resulting from the sale of IRES will be offset by other savings. Earlier, the company reported an in-line first quarter but provided a disappointing forecast for the second quarter. The company is yet to find a significant improvement in business sentiment among small business customers who use the company’s flagship products such as QuickBooks software and Turbo Tax programs.  Management expects revenues between $3.3 billion and $3.43 billion in fiscal 2010, up 4% – 8%. Earnings per share are projected between 29 cents and 32 cents.

But the message seems to be coming through loud and clear: Intuit has no plans to mess with Mint.Inuit CEO Scott Cook first said it a couple of weeks ago and yesterday, Mint CEO and founder Aaron Patzer repeated it. But with a company like Intuit behind it, we should expect to see some changes. In a video with Silicon Alley Insider posted yesterday, Patzer talked about plans to grow internationally, to incorporate billpay features and, of course, work hand-in-hand with Intuit products like Turbo Tax. Expect Mint to stay free, he said.For me, a guy with a couple of bank accounts, a car loan, some credit cards and a modest portfolio of investment accounts, Mint is a great way to keep track of life’s finances.But it’s no checkbook register.OK, maybe I’m a little bit old school when it comes to my accounts, but I still like to reconcile them at the end of the statement period. Yes, I sit down and compare my records to those of the bank. Nine times out of 10, if there’s a problem, it’s because I forgot to account for something or even counted a deposit twice. But, on rare occasions, I have found bank mistakes, too. In recent months, since I’ve been using Mint and allowing it to import my transactions from my bank account into the software, I’ve gotten lazy at tracking my card-swipes. I’ve started to just trust that the information that the bank is sending to Mint is accurate.Given the state of the economy and how we got here, trusting a bank is probably the last thing I should be doing.As a Mint user, I want to be able to input the rare paper check I might write, a swipe of the card at the gas station or even the rare in-branch deposit. Today, I can’t do that - but I’m hoping that parent company Intuit takes some of the basic banking features from Quicken (such as manual importing of transactions) and incorporate them into Mint.In my eyes, that’s not a case of Intuit changing something that’s already good. In this case, Intuit would be making it better."

Apparently, I’m not alone.I was in attendance when Mint.com launched at Tech Crunch two years ago (2 years ago people!) and thought it was neat but not the top startup, nice to see how much I knew… by the way.But all in all, I am pretty sure their VCs didn’t want to sell. They had invested $31M in capital as recently as a few months ago at a valuation of $140. I think Mint.com sold because their twenty-something CEO just thought it would be best to cash out.  However, I think that VCs need to “clear the decks” and having invested at some lofty valuations before the market correction, any liquidity transaction is welcome. But suggesting that Aaron was forced seems crazy.Ultimately, Mint.com seems like a cool product to sign up for but I did read about some users that lost interest. Either way, their spike in net users did enough to pique Quicken’s interest and honestly, Aaron and his backers deserve a lot of props.Amazing story, as well, by Tech Crunch on how Mint.com bought the URL for $2M in equity (I always wondered how much they paid for that URL).

Intuit will hand over $170m in cash for Mint, which we understand was running at less than $10m in revenue. (Although we should add that Mint had only just begun looking for ways to make money from its growing 1.5-million user base.)More than revenue, we suspect this deal was driven by Intuit’s desire to get into a new market, online money management and budgeting, as well as the fear of the prospects of a much smaller but rapidly growing competitor. (Intuit and Mint have been talking for most of this year, according to one source.) In that way, Intuit’s latest acquisition has some distinct echoes of its previous  buy, that of online payroll service PayCycle. For starters, the purchase price of both PayCycle and Mint totaled $170m. And even more unusually, bulge bracket biggie Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) advised Intuit on both of these summertime deals.

The consensus estimate is (16c) for EPS and $487.69M for revenue, according to First Call. At it's investor meeting September 23, Intuit management reaffirmed Q1 and FY10 guidance that was provided previously on their Q4 earnings call. Intuit sees Q1 EPS (15c)-(19c) and revenue flat to up 2%. The company also sees FY10 EPS $1.89-$1.96, and revenue up 4%-8%. In spite of cautious guidance, Wedbush believes Intuit will return to double-digit Consumer Tax growth in FY10 and overall double-digit growth upon economic recovery. For FQ1, Wedbush expects EPS of (17c) and revenue of $491M. They expect management to maintain FY10 guidance for EPS, and that guidance reflects management’s reluctance to stray from caution given the economic environment. Also, they think Intuit has the levers to generate double-digit bottom-line growth in 2010. Wedbush--although management has stuck to its conservative 2010 Consumer Tax guidance for growth of 5-9%--believes the elimination of the e-file headwind, the first-time availability of TurboTax to clients of Intuit’s 1600 financial institution base, as well as opportunities such as using Mint.com’s savings engine within TurboTax’ customer base, could allow Consumer Tax to return to double-digit growth next year. Also, Wedbush believes that the fact that Intuit’s small business segments did not decline as much as peers during the downturn is more a sign of share gains as opposed to lack of cyclicality. Hence, they believe that as the economy recovers, these segments --especially payment and payroll--are in a position to return to double digit growth."

The company, like so many others these days, is unveiling an app store of its own and opening its API to developers who want to free the financial data of Quickbooks 2010 into custom apps.But instead of just putting it out there for customers, the company is embedding a button link to the apps marketplace into the desktop product. It’s an interesting approach - putting a “cloud” element in desktop software - but execs at Intuit say that their customers are taking baby steps into the cloud and aren’t necessarily interested into full-swing jump into Web-based software.The company is quick to point out that it’s not automatically sending anyone’s financial data into the cloud. Nor is this some sort of sign that Intuit is trying to move its customers from client-based software to cloud-based apps. But it does offer those who might be interested in testing the cloud a way to do just that.In some ways, it struck me that Intuit is offering something competitive to what Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) is offering with its AppExchange program, which allows developers to build custom apps and upload them to the salesforce app marketplace. That becomes even more obvious when you consider that many Quickbooks users also it to manage their customer lists and relationships - something that salesforce was built to do.Developers are creative enough and smart enough to build apps that take advantage of the Intuit’s open API and then put integrate them with salesforce. Intuit gets that. But it also thinks it has a unique marketplace for small businesses and that many of them can benefit from it.During an interview, I also talked to Intuit execs about the potential consumer market around custom apps for programs such as Quicken and TurboTax. After all, Intuit’s software has revolutionized personal finance software and consumers are far more savvy about their own finances, especially after some of the lessons we’ve learned from the economic downturn, than they were a decade or so agoFor now, Intuit is focused on Quickbooks and small businesses - but if the apps take off for that market, it’s not a big reach to explore the same concept for consumers. For anyone who’s trying to re-take control of their personal finances in these tough economic times, a push into consumer could be welcomed with open arms."

It reminds me of similar discussions about the sale of Zappos to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) a while back.I left a comment on that post to the effect that while I have no inside information, I highly doubt that the VCs forced the sale.But this is a good opportunity to talk about who does decide when to exit. Here are some rules that I've learned over the years:1) When the founders and management want to sell, the VCs ought to go along (within reason) because blocking a sale and having angry and unhappy founders and management running the business is a bad outcome.2) VCs often impact the price and terms of an exit but they rarely drive the exit itself when the founder is still actively running the business.3) When a company is doing really well, the investors rarely want to sell. VCs make all of their money on a few investments per fund. When a company is in that group, they don't like to see an early exit.4) When a founder owns a large stake in the business and is still running it, it is very likely that the founder drove the decision to sell and the sale process and was advised by the investors and board.5) If the founders are no longer involved in the business and the management was hired by the VCs, and the VCs control the business, then it is likely that the investors drove the sale process and the decision to sell.6) If the company is not doing well, then the decision to sell was likely forced by the VCs.Of course, like all rules, there are exceptions from time to time. But when you see an exit, you can parse the data by this set of rules and you can pretty easily predict what happened, who made the decision, and who drove the process."

Intuit will keep Mint.com and its Quicken Online site and put Aaron Patzer, Mint’s CEO, in charge of its personal finance group.According to a statement, Mint.com will give Intuit “another fast-growing consumer brand and a highly successful Software as a Service (SaaS) offering.” TechCrunch first reported the deal, which has garnered a good bit of buzz.Intuit CEO Brad Smith has been aiming to become a leading SaaS company so it can spread its bets across multiple platforms including the desktop and mobile.Mint.com founder and Patzer says the big appeal for the company was combining its user interface with Intuit’s market heft. Intuit said “Mint.com’s innovative capabilities can be applied broadly to millions of Intuit consumer and small business customers.”Smart Planet: Why Intuit’s purchase of Mint.com is so smartThe two parties appear to be a good match. Intuit can take Mint’s ‘ways to save’ feature and apply it across its network. Mint.com can benefit from Intuit’s relationships with financial institutions for better integration.The companies said that Intuit will keep both Mint.com and Quicken Online since they serve different audiences. Here’s the breakdown:That approach lends credence to the theory that the Mint.com purchase is about two things:When the deal is done, in the fourth quarter Mint.com will be lumped into Intuit’s consumer group. Patzer will become general manager of the personal finance group reporting to Dan Maurer, senior vice president of Intuit’s consumer group.Intuit expects the Mint.com purchase to cut its non-GAAP earnings for fiscal 2010 by 2 cents a share. GAAP earnings will be cut by 3 cents.My take: Overall, I like the deal from a strategic perspective. Here’s why it’s smart for both sides:"
161413,20991,2009-09-14T13:49:01-04:00,,"Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) is buying Mint.com for a whopping $170 million. That’s a lot of money for a company which has yet to make a dollar in profit — indeed, it found itself in need of an extra $14 million in equity capital only last month.So what makes Mint worth so much? The website basically has two main possible revenue sources. The first is the way it’s making money right now (or getting revenues, anyway): armed with its users’ financial information, it can act as a broker, introducing them to offers from financial-services companies which might be a good deal. And like any broker, it gets to keep a commission.There’s also what Mike Arrington calls “a goldmine of user data” — incredibly granular information on the saving, spending and borrowing habits of 1.4 million registered users who between them account for $175 billion in transactions, and $47 billion in assets. If that information is added to the information which Intuit already holds, it could provide unprecedented insight into how Americans deal with money.The problem is that while Mint is generally much-loved, Intuit is generally much-hated. Mint is free; Intuit is constantly trying to squeeze every marginal dollar out of its customers. Mint’s user experience is a joy; Intuit’s is gruesomely bad. (And is possibly responsible for the whole nightmare that was Tim Geithner’s tax situation.) Mint is trusted; Intuit isn’t.The fear is that Intuit will stop showing Mint’s customers the offers which are best for them, and will start showing Mint’s customers the offers that are best for Intuit, even if those offers are predatory or otherwise unsuitable. And as for the money which Intuit might squeeze out of those users’ personal financial data — again, while I trusted Mint not to do anything evil, I don’t have the same feelings about Intuit.I do have a Mint account, but I don’t use it very much, and it’s a bit glitchy. I think I’ll probably deactivate it now. Better safe than sorry."
162256,23414,2009-09-18T09:25:22-04:00,,"Valuation SummaryOur 5 years discounted cash-flow (DCF) analysis and comparables lead to a target price in the range of $35 - $40 for the WACC between 11% and 13.5%. This price takes into account the long-term forecast of the company. Intuit is seeking new ways of increasing sale and improve its business model. Even though Intuit’s (NASDAQ:INTU) Small Business segment has been growing, we are concerned about the future growth prospects of this segment, primarily due to increased competition from larger players like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). We are comfortable with our quarterly revenue estimate based on current performance. Intuit is on track for the coming five years to maintain 7%-9% YoY revenue growth with solid performance from its growth drivers: QuickBooks, Payroll and Financial Institutions. We believe in the medium term however that Intuit will reach a growth plateau and the growth rate will slow.  Our valuation is in line with the consensus estimate of $1.78 to $1.89 for EPS and $1.56B for fourth quarter revenue.Business OverviewIntuit provides software solutions for small and medium sized businesses, financial institutions, consumers and accounting professionals. The company’s flagship products and services include QuickBooks, Quicken and TurboTax. These products simplify small business management and payroll processing, personal finance, and tax preparation and filing. Intuit has major presence in the US, Canada, India, and the UK. The company operates through six segments: consumer tax, QuickBooks, payroll and payments, accounting professionals, financial institutions and other businesses.Application software industry outlookThe current recession is sparing few sectors, as companies continue to slash their spending budgets in an attempt to improve 2009 bottom lines, software purchases have been reduced significantly. Financial management and tax solutions software - categories that have held up much better during 2008 than the rest - are also experiencing decreased spending going forward. But we believe as the economy is bottoming up and inventories at a lowest level, companies will start to increase spending in software solutions in Q1’10. The second trend in the industry is the fierce competition with players such as H&R Block (NYSE:HRB), Mint.com, JACKSON HEWITT TAX, and Microsoft (MSFT). This competition increases pressure on Intuit to maintain its market share and margin going forward. Investment RecommendationGiven Intuit’s proven track record of margin expansion since FY2000, we think the company has reached a plateau. Operating margin above 27% from 2005 to 2008 has remained at that level (on a yearly basis). We expect operating margin in the same range from 2009 to 2014. In April 2009, the operating margin came in at a robust 58% as more customers migrate to the company’s higher-margin online filing. Intuit will continue to pursue a well defined and aggressive strategy. This shows readiness of management to quickly adapt to the changing environments. The company has tried to diversify by increasing its presence in UK, Canada and India. Aggressive acquisition strategy of competitors: Intuit acquired PayCycle in July, 2009. But the competition is fierce in the software solution industry. Intuit faced challenges in its Digital Insight, QuickBooks and other businesses. Jefferies downgraded Intuit to a Hold rating, mentioning the company will see a second consecutive year of declining ASPs in its consumer tax business, as well as unit share losses to its biggest competitors, H&R Block, JACKSON HEWITT TAX, and Microsoft. In our valuation model, the company’s drivers still look promising and comparables are at the above average level of the industry. Considering the competitive environment, we see an upside capped at 20% relative to the current stock price. Below $30 we recommend a buy and above 35$ a sell of the stock. Intuit is a medium term 2-3 year’s long position in portfolio. After this horizon there are few catalysts for growth.Valuation measures                                                                                                                               StrengthsThrough its vertical and horizontal integration, Intuit Inc. increased its customer base, particularly in Enterprise solutions, and the company increased its investments in R&D. Finally, for a long period, the company shows strong performance but the increased competition has increased the downside risk for Intuit. Opportunities Intuit should take advantage of its financial strength and acquire companies providing alternative solutions. The company should take advantage of the new tax policy as this is the opportunity to considerably increase its business activity as many entities will need adjustments in their tax forms.Challenges"

INTU)  provides business and financial management solutions for small and medium sized businesses, financial institutions, consumers and accounting professionals. Their flagship products include QuickBooks, Quicken and TurboTax software. Intuit also enables small businesses with payroll processing plus tax preparation and filing.The company announced FY 2009 Q4 results that were slightly ahead of analyst estimates while guiding FY 2010 estimates to a range of $1.89 - $1.96 versus consensus views for $2.00. [FYs end July 31st].On a non-GAAP, continuing operations basis Intuit hit new all-time highs for both sales and earnings. The company’s newly released views for the year ahead would also represent best ever results.What was the market’s reaction to this relatively good news? The shares are down 7.5% to $28.50 /share! That smells like opportunity to me.Here are Intuit’s (split-adjusted) per share numbers from continuing operations as reported by Value Line:At the current quote of $28.50 these shares are offered at about 15x year ahead projections (at management’ s low-end assessment). Compare that multiple to all the historical levels from the chart above.Their 10-year median P/E has been 26x while the past 5-year average multiple fell to 19.5x including the 2008-2009 market collapse. A rebound to even a seventeen multiple would lead to a 12-month target price of > $32 share. That’s in line with S&P’s 1-year goal price of $33/share.In fact, Intuit shares have traded for greater than $30 /share in each calendar year 2006-2007-2008 and 2009 to date. With no bad news I see no reason why these shares won’t regain that $30 mark in the reasonable future.The balance sheet is solid. Value Line rates INTU as ‘above average’ for safety and lists their financial strength as ‘A’. They also note an 85th percentile ranking for ‘stock price stability’ and an almost perfect 95th percentile ranking for ‘earnings predictability’. Treasury cash exceeds total debt.Here’s a great way to play that thesis with low risk yet fine potential gains.If Intuit shares rise to at least $30 (+5.3%) by Jan. 21, 2011:That’s a best-case scenario profit of $9,900 / $20,100 = 49.2% achieved in 17 months on shares that only needed to go up 5.3% from the trade’s  inception price.What’s the risk?If Intuit remains below $30 through the Jan. 2011 expiration date:What’s the break-even price on the whole trade? On the original 1000 shares it’s their $28.50 purchase price less the $3.70 /share call premium = $24.80 /share.On the ‘put’ shares it’s the $30 strike price less the $4.70 /share put premium = $25.30 /share.Your overall break-even would be $25.05 /share.Intuit shares could fall by as much as $3.45 (-12.1%) without causing a loss on this trade.Summary:  Intuit is a good-quality stock that has been slammed by an irrational over-reaction to less than bad news. The buy/write combination described here would return over 49% (cash-on-cash) on any increase in INTU shares of at least 5.3% over the 17 month term of the trade.Disclosure: Author is long INTU shares and short INTU options."

Intuit suffered a non-GAAP loss in the quarter of 10 cents a share, two cents better than the Street consensus estimate of a loss of 12 cents.For FY Q1, Intuit sees revenue of $479 million to $493 million, with a non-GAAP loss of 15-19 cents a share.

121839,20468,2009-02-21T14:24:58-05:00,,"Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) delivered second quarter results that illustrate that it is recession resistant, but a lot of the game plan revolves around cost cutting and innovating in a downturn. The rub: Intuit CEO Brad Smith doesn’t consider the economic landscape a downturn per se, but a “new normal.”On a the company’s earnings conference call (statement), Smith said:Smith outlined the five parts of its grand plan: Play offense and focus on customers; cut spending; commit to growth; innovate; and acquire companies that make sense. What Smith was really getting at is Intuit’s killer instinct. The tech sector is becoming a fascinating study in the survival of the fittest. Many companies are taking aim at each other for market share and the financial spoils. You’re beginning to see examples every day. Citrix (NASDAQ:CTXS) and Red Hat (NYSE:RHT) joining forces with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) to hit VMware (NYSE:VMW) hard is a prime example. HP cutting pay instead of employees so it can give [[Dell]] and IBM fits. Intuit offering Coghead customers an out to add to its Quickbase roster of clients. (Coghead, which went out of business, was scooped up by SAP).Intuit is clearly now in the recession resistant club and it’s likely to take on established rivals like HR Block and thwart upcomers like Mint by offering a nice exit strategy. In other words, Intuit has what it takes to simply buy its threats. And it will because it has a decent mix of established products it can milk for cash, new growth services and discipline to cut expenses to keep Wall Street happy. Here’s a look at those moving parts:Established products: TurboTax and QuickBooks can fund new businesses for Intuit. The company reported earnings per share of 26 cents a share on revenue of $791 million, down 5 percent from a year ago. Revenue would have been up 2 percent if revenue weren’t shifted for Intuit’s tax products. Excluding charges, Intuit would have had earnings of 34 cents a share, 7 cents better than Wall Street estimates. As is customary with Intuit TurboTax pays the bills in the fiscal second and third quarters. Here’s where Intuit stands with TurboTax as it shifts the product from the desktop to the Web. QuickBooks, however, is under economic pressure. Smith said:Add it up and Intuit still has a solid stable of products that generate a lot of cash. Growth services: Intuit has been adding extensions off of its QuickBook juggernaut and some of these businesses are showing solid growth in a downturn. Intuit’s payroll and payments revenue in the second quarter was $158 million, up 14 percent from a year ago. Accounting professional software revenue was $133 million, up 14 percent. Meanwhile, SaaS efforts such as Intuit’s Quickbase tools aren’t material to report, but will benefit from growing from a small base. Financial heft: Sure, Intuit cut its outlook. For the third quarter, Intuit projected revenue of $1.38 billion to $1.46 billion, up 5 percent to 11 percent. Operating income will be $723 million to $778 million, up 7 percent to 15 percent. That tally equates to $1.38 to $1.49 a share for the third quarter. Excluding charges and other items, Intuit’s third quarter earnings are expected to be $1.57 to $1.68 a share. Wall Street was expecting earnings of $1.67 a share excluding items. For fiscal 2009, Intuit projected revenue of $3.13 billion to $3.25 billion, up 2 percent to 6 percent. Intuit had projected growth of 6 percent to 10 percent. Operating income excluding items will be $917 million to $970 million, or $1.78 a share to $1.89 a share. Wall Street was looking for 2009 earnings of $1.79 a share. Amid the weaker-than-expected outlook, Intuit said it is slowing hiring, evaluating compensation programs, monitoring marketing costs and cutting spending and “taking a hard look at what is truly necessary,” said Intuit CFO R. Neil Williams.Add it up and Intuit seems to be navigating the downturn–or the new normal–well. Intuit ended the second quarter with $802 million in cash and investments and expects to generate $900 million in operating cash in fiscal 2009. Add it up and Intuit has more than enough to play offense and defense as needed."

On the company's last earnings call management provided lower Q3 guidance of $1.57 to $1.68 in EPS, and $1.38B to $1.46B in revenue. Guidance for FY09 was also lowered by the company relative to Street expectations to a range of $1.78 to $1.89 in EPS, and $3.13B to $3.25B in revenue. The company was facing challenges in its Digital Insight, QuickBooks and other businesses. Last month Jefferies downgraded Intuit to a Hold rating, saying the company will see a second consecutive year of declining ASPs in its consumer tax business, as well as unit share losses to its biggest competitor, H&R Block (NYSE:HRB). Jefferies said that “given ongoing cyclical pressures in the company’s QuickBooks business,” there “few alternative catalysts for the shares over coming months.” But Credit Suisse is currently comfortable with their Q3 revenue estimate of $1.40B, and EPS of $1.60. While the consumer tax season was slightly softer than expected, Credit Suisse believes that Intuit remains on track for its full year guidance of 2%-6% Y/Y revenue growth with solid performance from its growth drivers, including QuickBooks, Payroll and Financial Institutions. With another solid tax season behind Intuit, albeit at modestly lower revenue growth, Credit Suisse believes the company is set up well for solid performance going forward.

Back on May 20, Management had narrowed its guidance range for FY09 when it released its last earnings report, calling for non-GAAP diluted earnings of $1.78-$1.82 and revenue of $3.155B-$3.185B. The company has a history of beating the consensus, and some expect Intuit to lose less money than what the analysts are estimating. Wedbush expects Q4 EPS of (13c) and revenue of $487M, which includes dilution from the PayCycle acquisition. Looking froward, Wedbush expects the company's tax guidance to be above expectations. The firm believes that Intuit will grow its Consumer Tax business by double digits in FY10 and is therefore likely to guide to 8%-12% for this business. Wedbush believe Consumer Tax can resume double-digit growth in spite of 6% growth in FY09, given the non-recurring impact of e-file on last season’s results and recent IRS and competitor data. Based on comments and guidance from competitors in the non-tax businesses, Wedbush believes that trends in those businesses have not improved, leading to what is expected to be cautious and reduced guidance in some cases. However, the firm continues to believe that these non-tax businesses can return to double-digit growth upon cyclical recovery and maintain positive growth until then. Wedbush's estimates for Q1 and FY10 are: (2c)/$499M and $2.03/$3.38B. Consensus is (8c)/$488.52M and $2.00/$3.35B."

The devices allow for instant payments to be processed simply by swiping a credit card into it.Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU), the maker of QuickBooks software for small businesses, is announcing a new service Thursday, called Intuit GoPayment, that will put credit-card processing technology into most cell phones, paving the way for electricians, tow-truck drivers or any other mobile workers who normally depend on sending a bill, collecting a check or sticking to a cash-only model to collect immediate payment.But the system does more than just allow mobile workers to collect payment. It also allows users to tap back into their Quickbooks accounts to input different types of information, such as invoicing or estimate information and synchronize it with the Quickbooks data back at the home office.In some cases, that involves a mobile Web connection. But the company said that it’s also enabling other features with familiar tools such as SMS text messaging to quickly look up a quick price or maybe estimated delivery day, information that might be found in Quickbooks.The new service is part of Intuit’s mobile strategy for small businesses. A survey by the company found that overdue payments in the Account Receivables file is a growing concern. In addition, nearly 40 percent of the respondents said they saw an increase in sales after giving customers the option to pay by credit card.The company is also offering optional Bluetooth equipment that will connect to cell phones wirelessly, allowing users to swipe a credit card, instead of just inputting in the information, and even print a receipt."
121922,20521,2009-02-22T08:14:36-05:00,,"On Thursday, Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ: INTU), the tax preparation and small business accounting software maker with annual revenue of $3.1 billion, reported mixed second quarter results that beat earnings estimates. We recently looked at the latest U.S. employment statistics reported by ADP. Intuit is another company that provides a fair idea about the health of the economy, so let’s take a closer look at its results.Q2 revenue was down 5% to $791 million. GAAP operating income was $110 million or $0.26 per share, down from $174 million or $0.34 per share in Q208. Non-GAAP operating income was $172 million or $0.34 per share. Analysts expected earnings of $0.27 per share on revenue of $796.2 million.Deferred revenue was $472.0 million, up $135.0 million from Q208, mainly due to the deferral of revenue from Q2 to Q3 for the e-file bundling and growth in its subscription-based businesses. Intuit usually makes a profit in the second and third quarters leading up to the tax filing deadline in April. However, it doesn’t recognize payment for its TurboTax program (sold online) until customers submit returns. Without the timing changes of $58 million between Q2 and Q3, total revenue would have grown 2%.Intuit bought back shares worth $35 million in the quarter and has $400 million left in the current authorization for share repurchases. It ended the second quarter with $802 million in cash and investments. It expects to generate about $900 million in operating cash for the fiscal year. Capital expenditures were $50 million, which is in line with expectations and is on track for its estimate of $200 million capital spending for the year. To achieve this, it has slowed hiring, adjusted performance-based compensation, shifted marketing dollars and cut back on travel and off-site meetings.By segment, revenue from Payroll and Payments increased 14% to $158 million, Accounting Professionals grew 14% to $133 million, and Financial Institutions revenue (including Digital Insight) grew 5% to $76 million. On the other hand, QuickBooks revenue declined 2% to $164 million as the recession hurt small businesses. Consumer Tax revenue declined 25% to $187 million, and without the deferral of $70 million to Q3 related to federal e-filing, revenue for this segment would have grown 4%. Other Businesses revenue was down 21% to $73 million. In the total Small Business segment, second quarter revenue was $322 million, up 5%. Adjusting for the acquisitions of Homestead and ECHO in FY2008, revenue would have been flat for Q2.Intuit also reported that demand for its web-based TurboTax software has increased 39% year-to-date while the desktop software has declined 14%.For the third quarter, Intuit expects revenue of $1.38 to $1.46 billion, or growth of 5% to 11%. GAAP operating income is expected in the range of $723 to $778 million, or growth of 7% to 15% or EPS between $1.38 and $1.49. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be between $1.57 and $1.68, or growth of 13% to 21%. Analysts expect a profit of $1.67 per share on revenue of $1.48 billion.Based on its performance in QuickBooks, Real Estate Solutions and Quicken, Intuit has also cut its outlook for 2009. Revenue is expected in the range of $3.13 to $3.25 billion, or growth of 2 to 6%. Earlier outlook was for growth of 6 to 10%. The company expects GAAP operating income between $682 to $735 million, or growth of 5% to 13% and GAAP EPS of $1.32 to $1.43, or a decline of 6% to growth of 1%. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be between $1.78 and $1.89, or growth of 11 to 18%.Intel also says it would be on the lookout to invest its cash in inorganic growth opportunities that make good strategic and financial sense. As I pointed out last quarter, SaaS acquisitions would make excellent sense and some options the company can consider include Paycycle, Bill.com, Everest and Intacct from the Deal Radar Series.At the time of writing, the stock was trading around $21 with a market cap of around $7 billion. It hit a 52-week low of $20.18 on December 1.Intuit is sitting on a significant pile of cash, and there is every indication, that in its customer base, SaaS is gaining ground. Does it really take a rocket scientist to figure out that Intuit should go acquire some SaaS companies? There are more than 500 of them, and surely, Intuit’s product marketing and corporate development teams can go do a deep dive into the segment to identify the best fits?Disclosure: None"

The consensus estimate is 27c for EPS and $796.97M for revenue, according to First Call. On the company's last earnings call management provided lower guidance for Q2 of 40c-42c on sales of $860M-$880M, and for FY09 EPS of $1.82-$1.89 on sales of $3.26B-$3.38B. Much of the lower guidance had appeared to be already priced into the company stock and as analysts said, the maker of tax preparation software may benefit from consumers switching to its products from paid accountants in this tough economy. Many analysts believe that Intuit's TurboTax will perform well during the upcoming tax season and see the shares as a defensive play in this economy. In an interview with SmartMoney Magazine on Feb. 12, CEO Brad Smith said that two-thirds of the company's growth areas are reasonably recession-proof — the tax business and financial services. And about half of its small-business line helps with payroll and payment services, which is pretty resilient. The area the company is seeing an impact is in its QuickBooks bookkeeping software.

It may also be an early indicator of the potential power of Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) as a key player in this rapidly evolving marketplace.In a previous blog post, I suggested that two of the most important competitive advantages which leading Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) must display are,Intuit easily qualifies as a potentially powerful PaaS candidate based on both of these criteria. It is a solid software vendor that has built an enormously strong base of small- and mid-size businesses (SMBs), as well as households who take advantage of its financial management applications.More than two hundred current and aspiring software developers attended Intuit’s forum this week. They were interested in getting insight about the overall SaaS and cloud computing market from a combination venture capitalists and CEOs, including Scott Cook of Intuit who provided his perspectives about building a successful software business in today’s rapidly changing market. The attendees were also curious about Intuit’s PaaS capabilities.The organizers took advantage of the opportunity to showcase Intuit’s rapidly evolving development platform which should appeal to many aspiring SaaS/cloud computing developers that wants to deliver B2B solutions aimed at SMBs, or even B2C solutions aimed at households using Intuit products.Intuit’s recent acquisitions clearly demonstrate its determination to be a major player in the SaaS and cloud computing marketplace. And, the turnout at last week’s event illustrates that there are plenty of entrepreneurs and software developers who are interested in leveraging Intuit’s position in the market.Of course, Intuit will have to provide these developers with the right tools at the right price to fulfill its potential as a major PaaS player."

Intuit picked up the payroll services startup earlier this week for $170m in cash. We understand that PayCycle generated only about $30m over the previous four quarters, meaning Intuit paid an estimated 5.7x sales. (Granted, by looking solely at revenue, we’re arguably shortchanging PayCycle. The company, which has some 85,000 customers, sells its payroll services on a subscription basis, meaning revenue substantially lags actual contracts it has billed.) In a somewhat unusual mandate, Goldman Sachs advised Intuit, while Lane, Berry & Co., now owned by Raymond James & Associates, advised PayCycle.There are a number of connections between Intuit and PayCycle. The Palo Alto, California-based startup was founded by a pair of former Intuit executives (Martin Gates and Rene Lacerte) who then turned the company over to Jim Heeger, Intuit’s former chief financial officer. Also, board member David Hornik of August Capital formerly drew a paycheck from Intuit, as did fellow investor Tom Blaisdale of DCM."

In fact, they were so bewildered by Mint’s claims of gaining 3,000 new users a day and jumping from 600,000 to 850,000 users in a matter of months that they decided to send a threatening letter demanding an explanation for this apparently inconceivable feat.  We’ve obtained copies of both Intuit’s letter and Mint’s reply, which we’ve embedded below. From Intuit’s letter:Note that the letter says that Intuit doesn’t “wish to suggest that Mint is engaging in false advertising”, despite the fact that that was the entire purpose of the letter. Nice.  Aside from Mint’s remarkable growth rate, Intuit’s concerns focus on the startup’s definition of “users”. Mint’s reply states that the company considers anyone who has filled in an Email address, Zip code, and password to be a “user”, regardless of whether they’ve ever actually linked their bank account to their Mint user name. This figure obviously overstates the number of people who actually use Mint on a day-to-day basis, but it’s also a fairly standard way to define “users” for most web services. As an outside check, Comscore counts 416,000 monthly unique visitors worldwide, and growing rapidly (see chart below). That said, Mint’s definition of “user” raised some concerns for me - I suspected that after entering their Email information and getting counted as a new member, many of them would jump ship when they realized they’d need to enter their bank account information. But CEO Aaron Patzer says that as of today around 680,000 of 934,000 registered users (over 70%) have linked at least one bank account to Mint, with most of them linking between 5-6 of their financial accounts. Frankly this number is far higher than I was expecting, and indicates that most people visit Mint with the full intention of entering their account information. Patzer also notes that while those users who haven’t linked their bank accounts to Mint will have access to less functionality, they still receive regular offers from Mint’s partners.  Could Mint have been more transparent with its user numbers? Probably, but their methodology for measuring user stats is par for the course here - certainly nothing worthy of Quicken’s demanding letter. The bottom line here is that Mint is growing so quickly (it will soon pass one million users—no doubt spurred by the bad economy and tax season), that its competitors literally can’t believe it. And for any startup, that’s not such a bad thing.Here are the two letters: Letter 1, Letter 2Original post"

And the flap over Geithner’s confirmation hearings, his back taxes and his mention of TurboTax highlights two common problems in IT: Users vs. software and the “garbage in, garbage out” conundrum.Last week, there was a flurry of news reports about Geithner’s comments about TurboTax. As background, Geithner’s confirmation hearings were Jan. 21 and Jan. 22 and he was grilled about paying more than $34,000 in back taxes. Geithner had self employment taxes he didn’t claim while he was an employee of the International Monetary Fund. Geithner worked at the IMF between 2001-2004. He was ultimately confirmed, but Geithner’s standing has been diminished.Geithner said he “mistakenly believed” he was meeting his tax obligations. When asked about what tax prep software he used, Geithner noted that the taxes were his responsibility, “but I used TurboTax to prepare my returns.”This incident–see the Wall Street Journal’s live blog and Senate Finance Committee video (TurboTax mention comes at the 48 minute mark on Jan. 21 video) shows highlights the never-ending user error vs. software tug-of-war in IT. Was it your ERP applications that was screwy or your data you failed to input? Were Geithner’s tax problems the result of TurboTax’s failure to flag potential issues–like unpaid self-employment taxes–or the new Treasury Secretary’s failure to cough up critical information.Intuit was real clear about where it stood. In a statement, Intuit said:Advantage Intuit. No one watching Geithner’s testimony is likely to buy the blame the software routine. Clearly, this fiasco is a garbage in, garbage out issue. Geithner didn’t provide the necessary data.The larger question is whether a guy that wrestles with TurboTax should realistically be expected to oversee the IRS and fork over $350 billion in bailout money. I’ll leave that for you to decide since that answer goes well beyond the scope of my blog. I’d hate to add yet another IT problem–scope creep–to this post."

The consensus estimate is for a loss (12c) for EPS and revenue of $484.15M, according to First Call. The company historically posts a small loss during the lull, the September quarter, so it's hard to expect anything else. Wall Street will focus more on forward guidance. At the Sept. 24 analyst day, Intuit provided Q1 guidance of a loss (14c) to a loss of (11c), on revenue of $480M to $492M. Intuit also provided FY09 guidance of $1.90 on revenue growth of 9% to 12%. Citigroup expects Q1 results in-line with its loss (11c) and $485M estimates, for Intuit's seasonally smallest quarter. However, Citigroup says it's questionable whether the company is ""still comfortable"" with its prior outlook ""given the worsening macro picture."" Intuit's business is ""relatively shielded"" from the economic downturn, said Citigroup, since less than 5% of revenue comes from outside the U.S. and the tax business is ""relatively anti-recessionary."" Citigroup also said that its QuickBooks products and payments processing division are both ""tied to the health of U.S. small businesses."" The firm believes there's a limit to how much strong sales of TurboTax might help offset weakness in that area, noting that recent promotions launched for QuickBooks and its online payroll product ""raises concerns."" Looking forward Citigroup says their FY09 QuickBooks revenue growth forecast of 9% could be at risk should the recession deepen; INTU had already experienced weakness in F2Q08, which led to lowered segment guidance for FY08. Citigroup says, low QuickBooks unit sale can also hurt the Payroll business. The firms FY09 estimates are towards the low-end of company guidance around $3.35B and $1.84."

Q4 revenue grew 11% to $478 million, beating the Street estimate of $470 million. In the seasonally slow quarter, net loss was $61.9 million or $0.19 per share, more than four times last year’s loss of $13.64 million. The increase was mainly due to the $23 million charge for severance and closure of facilities. Excluding charges, loss per share was $0.08, in line with analyst estimates.For the full year 2008, revenue grew 15% to $3.1 billion driven by the acquisition of Digital Insight, an online banking services provider for mid-market banks and credit unions, and strong performance in Intuit’s tax business. Net income was $476.76 million, up from $440 million last year. Excluding the contribution from acquisitions, net income grew 11% organically.By segment, annual revenue from Consumer Tax grew 14% y-o-y to $929 million; the QuickBooks segment, which now includes QuickBase, was up 6% y-o-y to $622 million; Accounting Professionals (formerly Professional Tax) grew 4% y-o-y to $327 million; and Payroll and Payments revenue grew 9% y-o-y to $561 million. Financial Institutions revenue (including Digital Insight) was $299 million. The Homestead (provider of web site and web store solutions for small businesses) and ECHO (credit card processor) acquisitions contributed revenue of $30 million.I earlier argued that Intuit needs an aggressive SaaS strategy and needs to shift to the subscription business model. The company is finally making some progress on that front with the recent announcement of its Small Business Connected Strategy. In the next 18-24 months, the company can acquire a fantastic portfolio of SaaS businesses because the sector has received enormous entrepreneurial energy and venture capital investment, and there are so many options open to the company.The company’s focus, however, is on the blend of software and connected services, as stressed by CEO Brad Smith in the earnings call. In consumer tax, for example, driven by 37% growth in online units, Intuit increased both its online share and its retail share.For 2009, Intuit expects revenue between $3.35 and $3.43 billion and non-GAAP EPS between $1.86 and $1.90. Analysts were expecting earnings of $1.86 on revenue of $3.34 billion. For the seasonally slow Q1, it expects revenue of $480 to $492 million and non-GAAP net loss per share of $0.14 to $0.11. It is currently trading around $30, picking up well from its 52-week low of $25.08 on March 17, and has a  market cap is about $10 billion. It is still a great company with lots of headroom.Disclosure: None"

Because Intuit typically posts an operating loss for the July quarter, most analysts are focused on the company's guidance for its 2009 fiscal year. After posting Q3 results that reflected strong seasonal sales of its TurboTax software and sales growth for its QuickBooks software, in June, Intuit said it would cut 7% of its work force as part of a restructuring to focus on its ""Connected Services"" strategy. Intuit said it expects to take a charge of 4c per share related to the restructuring in Q4. Intuit expects to launch the Connected Services program this fall. During the quarter, Intuit rolled out several new products, including an online payroll program that integrates with QuickBooks, and Quicken Beam, a service that works on cell phones and mobile devices to give consumers access to their bank accounts. Intuit expects to report a loss of 18c to 20c for Q4, or a loss of 7c to 9c adjusting for one-time items. UBS expects to see results reflect ""an aggressive share buyback in the quarter"" that could lift results above Wall Street's forecasts, but they kept a ""Neutral"" rating on the stock because of concerns about how the economic slowdown will effect sales in coming months. Soleil Securities is hoping the company will provide more details on its ""Connected Services"" efforts, and expects guidance for double-digit revenue growth and mid-teens profit growth. The firm noted Intuit has historically felt little impact during economic downturns. Looking forward, Wedbush said that with consensus set at 9% growth for FY09 and management consistently communicating double-digit long-term organic growth expectations, they believe there is potential for guidance at-or-above consensus on the August conference call.

But Intuit will now have a new CEO Brad Smith, and a new CFO, Neil Williams. Last week, Intuit Inc.

ECHO is a leading provider of electronic payment processing solutions, including check, debit card and credit card processing. Homestead is a leader in Web site creation products and e-commerce solutions for small businesses. On the financial front, Intuit reported earnings for Q1 2008 that ended October 31. Revenue was $444.9 million (up 27% y-o-y and up 3% q-o-q) driven by strong performance in the Small Business and the Digital Insight acquisition. Traditionally a slow quarter, GAAP net loss was $20.8 million ($0.06 per share), compared with a net loss of $58.9 million ($0.17 per share) in Q1 2007. It spent $215 million in the quarter to buy 8.1 million shares of its stock. Segment-wise the revenue is as follows: For the second quarter, revenue is expected to be between $833 million and $848 million, or growth of 11 to 13%. GAAP operating income is expected to $136 to $146 million, or a y-o-y decline of 37 to 32%. Non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be $0.34 to $0.36, down from $0.44 in Q2 2007. Excluding the impact of the acquisition of Digital Insight, the sale of outsourced payroll assets to Automatic Data Processing Inc. (NASDAQ:ADP), discontinuation of the Pro Series Express product, and the deferral of approximately $23 million of revenue from Q2 to Q3, Q2 revenue growth would have been expected to be 8 to 10%, and non-GAAP diluted EPS between $0.40 and $0.42. Its stock is trading around $32, and the company has a market cap is around $5.61 billion. Against the backdrop of the recent NetSuite IPO which has surged from the opening price of $26 to almost $46 in 2 days, before settling down at $38.75, Intuit is in an interesting situation. Clearly, SaaS is in, as far as the market is concerned. The significantly smaller company’s valuation is now $7.34 billion, in what many consider an inflated situation. Nonetheless, whether or not NetSuite’s valuation is artificial (we will discuss that later), the fact that Intuit needs a far more aggressive SaaS strategy is very clear. I have suggested that Paychex (NASDAQ:PAYX) and ADP could be consolidators in the SaaS space. Intuit should also consider a much more aggressive SaaS strategy."

who has discussed Intuit’s historical strategy in a fair bit of detail.
In this post, I will look at Intuit’s current financials and strategy
in more detail.Intuit (Nasdaq: INTU) is the leading provider of
accounting and tax solutions in the SME space with a lion’s share of
the market, revenue of $2.67 billion, market cap of $10.62 billion, and
8,200 employees in fiscal 2007. Founded in 1983 and based in
California, its business is organized into six segments: QuickBooks,
Payroll and Payments, Consumer Tax, Professional Tax, Financial
Institutions and Other Businesses.Its core products are
QuickBooks, Quicken, and TurboTax. For professional accountants, it
offers tax preparation software suites, ProSeries and Lacerte. Its
web-based products include QuickBooks Online Edition, QuickBooks Online
Payroll, QuickBooks Assisted Payroll Service, Complete web-based
Payroll, Turbo Tax Online, consumer and professional electronic tax
filing services, Quicken.com, QuickBase, and Digital Insight outsourced
online banking applications and services.In February 2007,
Intuit acquired Digital Insight Corporation for $1.34 billion. This
acquisition of an outsourced online banking applications and services
to mid-sized financial institutions and credit unions will help Intuit
establish itself in the Software-As-A-Service (SaaS) market, a segment
where the company is under some threat from competitors like PayCycle,
led by former Intuit executives. In fact, for a while, PayCycle
provided Intuit’s web-based payroll solution, but now that service is
bring offered directly by Intuit. The market for web-based Payroll offered as a SaaS is extremely compelling.Fiscal
2007 also saw it selling certain assets in its Complete Payroll and
Premier Payroll Service businesses to ADP for $135 million. In August,
it sold its Intuit Distribution Management Solutions (IDMS) business
for $100 million.On the financial front, Intuit reported a 17%
increase of $379.9 million in its annual revenue in fiscal 2007 mainly
due to its Digital Insight acquisition and revenue growth in its
Consumer Tax segment. Net income from continuing operations was 443.5
million, an increase of $62.5 million or 16%. Diluted net income per
share from continuing operations increased 18% to $1.25. In fiscal
2007, Intuit provided around 1.5 million free web-based federal returns
under the Intuit Tax Freedom Project.Segment wise, Financial
Institutions segment, which includes Digital Insight, had revenue of
$150.4 million in fiscal 2007, increasing 516% from just $24.4 million
in 2006. Consumer Tax revenue increased 15% to $106.8 million due to
growth in federal online units. QuickBooks segment revenue increased
11% to $59.3 million due to unit growth and favorable product mix.
Payroll and Payments revenue increased 12% to $54.6 million due to
growth in the QuickBooks Payroll and the Payments customer bases,
favorable Payroll product mix and higher transaction volume per
customer in its Payments business.For the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2007, Intuit reported revenue of $432.7 million, a 31% y-o-y
increase. GAAP net loss was $13.6 million, compared with $18.9 million
in Q4 2006. Losses are the norm in the fourth quarter ending in July
and also the first quarter ending in October as there is little revenue
from its tax businesses. Its stock also fluctuates seasonally.In
fiscal 2007, it repurchased 17.1 million shares of its common stock for
$506.6 million. It has $800 million in funds for future stock
repurchases. In July 2006, its stock underwent a two-for-one split. Its
stock is currently trading around $31.While Intuit has enjoyed a
position of relatively undisputed leadership in the small business
financial software and services arena that includes accounting, tax,
and payroll, with ADP and PayChex presenting some competition in the
Payroll area, I am interested in seeing an International strategy from
the company. With entrepreneurship booming in China and India, I would
like to see Intuit acquire companies (if they exist) to solve these
basic problems of running small businesses in those geographies. If
such companies don’t quite exist yet, then these are ripe
entrepreneurship opportunities for entrepreneurs in India and China,
and it is quite possible that Intuit could become a desirable corporate
investor in that endeavor.I like the SaaS bets, but I want to see an International strategy from the company."

Intuit reported revenue of $1.15 billion and pro forma EPS of $1.13 a share; the Street had expected $1.11 billion and $1.08 a share. The company said growth was driven by “a strong tax season, excellent performance in QuickBooks and the acquisition of Digital Insight.”
The company said it isn’t changing its fiscal fourth quarter guidance, but based on the strong third quarter raised its targets for the fiscal year ending July 31. Revenue is now expected to be $2.685 million to $2.7 billion, up from $2.625 billion to $2.675 billion. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $1.38 to $1.40, up from $1.33 to $1.37.
The company also announced a new $800 million three-year stock buyback authorization. The previous $500 million authorization was completed in the latest quarter.
Intuit shares are up $2.43 to $30.15 in after hours trading."
66491,20521,2008-02-28T09:37:31-05:00,,"Last week, Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ: INTU) reported its financial results. Earlier coverage is available here and here, where I discussed that Intuit needs to move to a SaaS model, and get more of an International business going. Revenue for the traditionally strong second quarter grew 11% y-o-y and 87% sequentially to $835 million driven by the Digital Insight acquisition and strong performance in Consumer Tax. GAAP net income was however $115.2 million or $0.34 per diluted share, down 21% y-o-y. The decline in net income reflects the increased costs related to Digital Insight acquisition and marketing of Consumer Tax products as well as the deferral of ProTax revenue of $23 million to Q3. Segment-wise, revenue from Consumer Tax grew 11% y-o-y to $248.3 million, QuickBooks rose 5% y-o-y to $175.4 million, and Professional Tax was down 19% y-o-y to $105.4 million (affected by the deferral). Payroll and Payments revenue was flat at $138 million, and excluding the impact of the ADP sale saw a growth of 16% y-o-y. Financial Institutions revenue (including Digital Insight) was $72.3 million. The economic slowdown has slowed down the sales in QuickBooks, leading Intuit to revise its guidance. For fiscal 2008, it expects QuickBooks segment to grow between 5% and 7% (down from earlier estimate of 8% to 12%). Revenue for 2008 is expected to be in the range of $3.0 to $3.05 billion, or growth of 12% to 14%. 2008 GAAP EPS guidance has been reduced to $1.38 to $1.40 accounting for the Homestead acquisition, and the non-renewal of R&D tax credit. For Q3, Intuit expects revenue between $1.268 and $1.293 billion or y-o-y growth of 11% to 14%, and GAAP diluted EPS between $1.23 and $1.26. For Q4, it expects revenue of $466 to $471 million or 8% to 9% y-o-y growth, and a GAAP loss per share of $0.14 to $0.12. The revision in the guidance sent its stock to a 52-week low of $25.86 on February 22. It is currently trading around $28, and its market cap is around $9.3 billion. I maintain my recommendation that the core business model at Intuit needs to shift to SaaS to give its stock the benefit of predictability that other pureplay SaaS vendors are enjoying. Today, it is still much more of a packaged software business, and in the small business customer base, this lack of visibility and predictability makes life complicated. Of course, it won’t be an easy shift, but over the long-term perspective, it is definitely worthwhile. Concur (NASDAQ:CNQR) made the shift, and is now reaping the benefits. You can read about that experience in my conversation with Steve Singh, Concur’s CEO. Similarly, if and when Intuit would have moved to a subscription model altogether, the company’s otherwise strong value proposition, customer-base, brand recognition - all assets of enviable magnitude - would make it a great investment, not just a great company. In the interim, the instant gratification and predictability driven Wall Street will continue to punish the company, especially if the weakening economy causes them further headaches."

Furthermore, the full-year guidance offered was ahead of expectations for $1.36 in EPS on $2.66 billion in sales: I tried to get excited about the news, which sent the shares up 10% after market hours. But the thing is, I don’t think the news had anything to do with the rally. As I’ve pointed out time and time again, share returns for Intuit are nearly as predictable as the passage of time. In fact, about the only variable one apparently needs to know is whether it is April (buy) or November (sell). Anything in between should use the signal as a reference point to know whether there may still be a play. It’s enough to send Eugene Fama into fits. I, on the other hand, am laughing all the way to the bank. Disclosure: at time of publication author is long Intuit (INTU) call options.  INTU 1-yr chart:"

However, we have maintained all along that neither of those theses are what drives Intuit stock. Instead, it tends to perform seasonally. Here’s the chart of monthly stock performance for the last 10 years, according to Thompson.    Very consistent underperformance during tax season, which ironically is the best time for their fundamentals (sales and profits). In February we said: So far the stock has been performing exactly as the seasonal script lays out.  We just bought some call options in hope that that continues.

Find out how you can get the best content on Seeking Alpha here.We like little companies like Identiv (INVE), companies that excel in their niche with state of the art solutions. We think the shares are still a buy because some parts (like their RFID business) are on fire and they have little exposure to the hardest hit sectors in the pandemic. Management still expects a profit this year and also expects to exit the year generating positive free cash flow. There is room for a gradual increase in software and recurring revenue, and operational leverage. Growth stalled in Q1 both sequentially and y/y due to the pandemic headwinds. As growth stalled more in the premises segment where margins are considerably higher due to the substantial software component, overall gross margin and EBITDA disappointed. What are the main drivers of growth? From the June 2020 IR presentation:We see a number of growth drivers:The gradual shift towards software and especially the recurring part of this is very gradual, recurring revenues were 9% of revenues of revenues in the last 12 months (up 100bp from the previous period) and 11% in Q1. Revenues of the company's identity segment (comprising 55% of revenues) declined by 3% y/y and 4% sequentially to $9.9M on softness in smart card readers and access card products. This was offset by rampant demand for their RFID products.The company's RFID business is on fire growing 66% y/y in Q1. Management believes that this growth is sustainable as they provide the best high-frequency solution in the market and also believes that the product (and in particular NFC) is on the brink of mass adoption. The latter comes through innovative uses like:These are just some of the things the company is working on with clients, and this is a future wave that is yet to come. At present, demand for the company's RFID solutions is already exploding higher due to the adoption of second generation products, the departure of a competitor and their competitive position. Their backlog in RFID is already over 120% of their RFID plan in backlog for delivery in Q2 and over 2/3 of their base plan for the entire H2 and that is even excluding the development work they are doing for one large customer whose volumes are expected to ramp in H2. Apparently this project is of such magnitude that they embarked on a special short-term financing deal for this project consisting of an interest-free $4M subordinated promissory note due and payable in Q1 of 2021, and 275,000 warrants with a 3 year time to expiration and $3.50 exercise price. The prospects seem to be pretty good (Q1CC):The company's smart card business profited from the work from home explosion and generated over $1M in additional demand in Q1 which the company wasn't even able to ship so 2/3 of their plans for this business are already in backlog. Another area which received a boost from the pandemic is their acquired Thursby secure mobility app, not only from US military demand, but the direct online sales to individual service people has tripled to 400 a week. No surprise that after a promising start demand (for stuff like video, Phone entry, and the like) has started to wane in certain categories due to the lockdown. The premises segment constitutes 45% of company revenue and demand declined by 12% y/y and 4% sequentially to $8.2M. However, some 85% of the companies business here is from government (including education), which limits the risks to a considerable degree (Q1CC):Management even expects a strong federal government year-end purchasing cycle which could create additional demand. And there are other upsides (Q1CC):The company is innovative here, for instance it developed a contract tracing app for their access control system, which helps identify places to disinfect and employees who should quarantaine when someone gets infected within a premise. For now, it's a free download for existing clients to help them go back to work. From the earnings deck:Management believes that it has visibility to $86M-$90M of revenues in Q2 already and was more confident on H2. This is above the $83.75M of last year and equals their previous guidance, so management is expecting growth to return. It also believes it will return to non-GAAP positive free cash flow exiting Q4. An interesting slide from the company's June 2020 IR presentation introduces investors to their long-term operating model, which not only provides that, it provides the latest guidance also for EBITDA and net income:While gross margin is already in the long-term model territory, there is still work to be done to get OpEx there. This should come mainly from operational leverage, revenues growing faster than operational cost. That isn't really happening yet.From the earnings deck:Overall margins suffered a bit as demand shifted from higher margin (57%) premises business to lower margin (32%) Identity business. Software products like Thursby mitigated this as a large deployment of Thursby was recognized in Q1 at 70%+ gross margin.Management is going to adjust their operating expenses, but details weren't yet available at the time of the Q1CC. The decline in Q1 is mainly the result of a $3.2M increase in working capital (half of which caused by an increase in receivables). The company had $8.7M of cash and equivalents on the book at the end of Q1, but they also raised some cash:There has been considerable dilution the last five years:This isn't all that surprising given that the company uses M&A as a growth strategy with for instance:And in both cases the company paid part in shares (426K shares for Thusby and 419K shares for Viscount).Analysts expect EPS to come in at -$0.18, rising to a profit of $0.15 next year, but these figures are subject to greater than usual uncertainties, needless to say. And management disagrees with that $0.18 EPS loss for this year, in its latest guidance, from the June 2020 IR presentation, it guides EPS at a positive $0.06-$0.12, which is quite a difference from the analyst take. It's possible analysts haven't updated their models (or if they had, it might not have filtered through to financial websites who publish these estimates). We like the stock for a number of reasons:There are also risks, which mainly come from the possibility of another lockdown of a substantial part of the US and continuing bad economy."
4286140,101801,2019-08-15T20:49:09-04:00,"Today, we look at Identiv, Inc. has acquired three companies in the past 18 months to complete the core components of its platform with the goal of digitizing physical security.The company posted second quarter results last week triggering some positive analyst commentary.The shares also saw some small insider buying in June.  A full analysis is presented in the paragraphs below.","Today, we take a look at a small tech concern that posted second quarter results last week. The shares also saw some small insider buying in June, the first insider purchases of the year.Identiv, Inc. (NASDAQ:INVE) is a Freemont, California-based provider of physical security and secure identification to 5,000+ customers encompassing the government, healthcare, banking, education, retail, and transportation sectors. The company was initially founded in Munich, Germany in 1990 and went public in 1997, raising net proceeds of $43.7 million at a split adjusted price of $130 per share. To maintain its NASDAQ listing Identiv effected a one-for-ten reverse stock split in 2014. It currently employs 300+ and commands a market cap of ~$80 million.Source: Company PresentationThe small security software firm generates 28% of its net revenue from its top ten customers and has two reporting segments: Premises and Identity.Premises consists of access control, video surveillance, analytics, and customer experience for the government and enterprise sectors. Products are either sold as individual components or as bundled solutions and include edge controllers (e.g. gated property access), Federal Identity, Credential and Access Management (FICAM) compliant architecture access readers, access cards, multi-door panels, software, and IoT devices. This segment was responsible for 2018 net revenue of $34.6 million and gross profit of $19.4 million, or 44% and 58% of totals, respectively.The company's Identity division comprises products and solutions that enable secure access to information serving the logical access and cyber security market and protecting assets in the IoT with RFID. It secures transactions across PCs, mobile devices, email, login, secure payments, and printers via its suite of smart card reader offerings and transponder products. Identity accounted for 2018 net revenue of $43.6 million and gross profit of $14.0 million, or 56% and 42% of totals, respectively.Identiv's approach is to leverage its decades of experience and its wide array of cutting-edge technology offerings to be the industry's most comprehensive single vendor solution. With security becoming less of a physical issue and more of an IT issue, Identiv, with its comprehensive platform, can access not only the security channel of a client but also its IT channel. As this transformation is occurring, Identiv believes its suite of offerings allows clients to adopt security solutions at their own pace, engendering customer loyalty. With 2018 total net revenue of $78.1 million in a $140 billion industry, there is plenty of space for the company to grow.Management believes its comprehensive solutions platform is complete (for now) thanks to a three-company buying spree over the past 18 months.In February 2018, Identiv purchased 3VR Security, Inc., a video security and analytics company with ~170 banks as clients. For 3VR's projected revenue stream of $10-11 million, Identiv paid a total consideration of $6.2 million, consisting of $1.6 million in cash; $2 million in subordinated promissory notes (which were paid off in February 2019); and $2.6 million in stock. 3VR was eligible to receive earn-outs based on achieving specific milestones in 2018 and 2019, but the likelihood of eclipsing those thresholds is remote. The acquiree was folded into the company's Premises segment.Then, in November 2018, Identiv purchased Thursby Software Systems, Inc. (TSS), a provider of security software primarily for government-issued Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) mobile devices for a total consideration of $3.1 million, consisting of $0.6 million of cash and $2.5 million in stock. Additionally, TSS can receive earn-outs totaling $7.5 million in stock over the next two years. TSS is now part of Identiv's Identity division.The company's most recent acquisition occurred in February 2019, when it bought the Freedom, Liberty, and Enterphone MESH product lines of Canadian concern Viscount Systems, Inc. (VSYS). Aggregate consideration totaled $2.9 million consisting of $1.3 million in cash and $1.6 million in stock. Viscount can receive up to a maximum of $3.5 million in additional compensation payable in stock contingent upon the achievement of revenue goals in 2019 and 2020. The product lines will fortify Identiv's Premises segment with complementary solutions for small-to-medium sized businesses that are scalable to the enterprise level.With these three additions, Identiv believes that it has assembled all the core components to its platform, which can digitize the physical world with cloud, IT-centric, and mobile-enabled digital access.On August 8th, the company posted mixed Q2 results. Identiv posted a one cent a share profit, three cents a share above consensus. Revenues rose smartly on a year-over-year basis to $22.7 million, just missing expectations. The company listed these second quarter highlights on the press release accompanying quarterly results.As of end of the first half of 2019, Identiv held $11.1 million in cash compared to $8.9 million of cash it had on hand at the end of the first quarter. The company also had $11.9 million out on a revolving credit facility, and held $1.5 million in remaining obligations stemming from a 2009 acquisition.The company's balance sheet is a bit complicated. In a two-tranche private placement executed in December 2017 and May 2018, Identiv raised gross proceeds of $20 million through the issuance of 5 million shares of Series B preferred stock at $4 per share. These shares accrue an in-kind dividend of 5% over their first five years and 3% thereafter. The company has the option to pay a cash dividend after year 10. The preferred shares are convertible into common shares on a one-for-one basis at the holder's discretion on or after the sixth anniversary of their issuance; or any time after Identiv common stock trades above $10 per share for three consecutive days. The accrued in-kind dividend is payable upon conversion. There are other contingencies in the agreement that would make it uneconomical for Identiv to issue common stock in a secondary offering below $4 per share. The current amount of common stock issuable upon conversion is 5.27 million shares, although that will rise to over 7.54 million shares assuming no conversion before the year 10.There are also warrants outstanding that are convertible into 705,000 shares of stock, 620,000 of which are exercisable at $3.64 a share or lower and expire in 2022.The Street has begun to take notice of this micro-cap concern as National Securities ($8 price target), Maxim Group ($9 price target) and Northland Securities ($11 price target) all reissuing Buy ratings right after Q2 results were disclosed.There has also been recent insider activity with board member Gary Kremen buying 24,166 shares at an average price of $4.96 on June 10-12, 2019. The company's CEO then bought nearly $50,000 in shares on June 14th. This was the first insider activity so far in 2019.The company does not break out its organic and inorganic growth, making it difficult to evaluate its acquisitions. Either way, Identiv is poised to grow its top-line 20% in 2019 after growing it 33% in 2018. Adj. EBITDA is prepared to grow 40% this year after more than doubling it in 2018. Identiv is growing company in a growing industry and deserves to trade higher than ~.85x's 2019E net revenue.The preferred financing could cap the stock at $10 for the foreseeable future, but the stock is more than reasonably valued on a price to sales basis especially if it can effectively integrate its recent acquisitions. There was another article on Identiv recently on SA for those that want additional information around the company and its prospects.This seems to be a solid name for longer term investors. Given recent volatility in the markets, I would accumulate in chunks on dips in the market or execute a buy-write strategy to establish a small position. The stock has been range-bound for the last six months and currently trades near the bottom of that range.Bret Jensen is the Founder of and authors articles for the Biotech Forum, Busted IPO Forum and Insiders Forum"
4217625,101421,2018-11-02T13:22:08-04:00,"Identiv has closed its acquisition of Thursby Software Systems.Thursby provides Apple mobile and desktop device security solutions to government and enterprises.The deal bolster Identiv's existing government security segment, will be accretive to its financial results and is a smart use of its higher priced stock to continue strong revenue growth.","Identiv (INVE) announced and has subsequently closed on the acquisition of Thursby Software Systems for up to $12.5 million in total potential consideration.Thursby Software Systems operates as enterprise mobile integration, management, and security company.INVE has been beating analyst targets on revenue increases, and the deal for Thursby promises to continue that trend and further its government and Apple-based enterprise security capabilities.Arlington, Texas-based Thursby Software was founded in 1986 to provide government agencies and commercial enterprises with Apple iPad, iPhone, and Mac integration, management, and security solutions.Management is headed by Founder and PresidentWilliam Thursby, who was previously Internet Software Account Manager at Digital Equipment Corporation.Thursby’s primary offerings include:Company partners or major customers include:According to a market research report by Allied Market Research, the global mobile security market was valued at $3.4 billion in 2014 and is projected to reach $34.8 billion by 2020.This represents an extremely robust CAGR of 40.8% between 2014 and 2020.The main driver for this expected growth is the increasing adoption of Bring Your Own Device practices among small, medium and large organizations.Identiv originally disclosed the acquisition price and terms as up to $12.5 million including potential earnouts, as described below:(Source: Identiv 8-K)Identiv subsequently filed an 8-K disclosing that it had closed the transaction. Management expects to discuss the acquisition on its November 8, 2018, Q3 conference call.A review of the firm’s most recent 10-Q filing indicates that as of June 30, 2018, Identiv had $18 million in cash and equivalents and $35 million in total liabilities.Free cash flow during the six months ended June 30, 2018, was a negative ($2.8 million).Identiv acquired Thursby primarily for its government grade Apple product security capabilities.As Identiv CEO Steven Humphreys stated in the deal announcement,In the past 12 months, INVE’s stock price has risen 94% vs. the S&P 500 Index 3.5%, as the chart below indicates:(Source: Seeking Alpha)It’s been an unusual stock price dynamic for INVE. The firm has recently had a spotty record when it comes to negative earnings surprises, as shown below:(Source: Seeking Alpha)However, the reason for the stock price jump has been due to recent revenue surprises to the upside:(Source: Seeking Alpha)As a result, analyst recommendations have followed suit, with now four analysts recommending a Strong Buy for the stock. The recommendations correlate to the recent stock price jump:(Source: Seeking Alpha)The consensus price target for INVE stock now stands at $8.75 and the stock has recently traded (Nov. 2, 2018) around $6.00.With the acquisition of Thursby, management appears to be pushing deeper into the government vertical. We won’t know about the detail numbers from the acquisition until the November 8 earnings call, but Identiv CEO Humphreys said the deal was an ‘accretive acquisition,’ we don’t know if he was referring to margin, EBITDA, or earnings.Regardless, it appears INVE management is partially using its stock price runup to assist in acquiring Thursby, so we will find out how much INVE, and shareholders, expect to get in return for the dilutive purchase.With the deal, INVE is poised to continue showing strong revenue growth, even if inorganically, as it seeks to improve its presence in the government and enterprise Apple-based BYOD markets.In my view, for the stock to move up appreciably from here, management will need to show continued top-line revenue growth and better earnings visibility and predictability.Editor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks.

3449206,92396,2015-08-18T15:29:00-04:00,"Identiv is a micro-cap company that has experienced a series of negative events resulting in a 79% share price decline from its 52-week high of $21.31.A poorly-executed follow-on offering created excess selling pressure for a stock with limited liquidity, precipitating the decline and compounding the effect of negative news.However, the $31.6mm net proceeds from that offering still sit on Identiv’s balance sheet and comprise most of the company's tangible net book value of $2.74/share.The current share price implies very little value for Identiv's operating business, creating substantial upside potential - at 3.0x TEV/LTM revenue multiple of its peers, INVE shares would trade at $23.Now that short-term investors have sold their stock, near-term catalysts have the potential to restore the company as an attractive long-term growth investment in the security technology industry.","Company and Situation BackgroundIdentiv (NASDAQ:INVE) is an established security technology company operating primarily in three product categories: (1) physical security access for buildings, (2) enterprise security for information networks, and (3) security solutions for everyday connected items, including Internet of Things (""IoT"") devices and applications. The first category, physical security (or ""premises"" in Identiv filings), is the company's oldest and highest-margin (~60%) operating segment and still comprises almost half of its gross profit. Identiv's business plan has been to leverage cash flow from this more established product line to reinvest into the growth of its other two segments, in particular R&D for its IoT security solutions. This is a difficult strategy to undertake as a public company. The challenges of executing on this growth plan in a timely manner combined with the setbacks discussed below have caused investors to abandon the stock and resulted in a 79% price decline from its 52-week high of $21.31 in September 2014.In general, there is very little summary information available about Identiv, given limited Wall Street research analyst coverage and an absence of company investor presentations. Further, a Seeking Alpha article hasn't been written on the company since December 2014, so below is a brief timeline of key events for INVE to provide some context:After Identiv's poorly-executed follow-on offering, the stock struggled to recover to pre-offering levels. The offering attracted mostly short-term investors looking to arbitrage the substantial 23% discount and flip their shares, which created excess selling pressure for a security with limited liquidity. The table below shows INVE's ownership history sorted by position increases after the offering to isolate purchases. As you can see, more than half of the follow-on issuance appears to have been purchased by investors, primarily hedge funds, who liquidated their positions within the next three months.Meanwhile, news/rumors of an activist investor advocating for a sale of Identiv, as well as a strategic partnership with Cisco Systems, failed to produce lasting share price recoveries. With this supply-demand imbalance as a backdrop, recent setbacks experienced by the company have resulted in dramatic share price declines totaling 63% in just four months.First a legal complaint from a prior employee spurred an internal investigation into expense reimbursements and caused Identiv's auditors to hold off on approving subsequent financial filings. Then, a slowdown in revenue, partly due to delays in government spending (potentially a timing of revenue vs. amount of revenue issue) and partly due to the company shifting its focus away from its more established Premises business line toward future growth opportunities (its stated strategy), resulted in two downward guidance revisions for full-year 2015 revenue.Within the past two weeks, the downward spiral for INVE shares appears to have finally ended. Identiv's share price has stabilized in the mid $4 range, which presents an attractive investment opportunity.Downside ProtectionThe proceeds from Identiv's follow-on offering remain largely unused on the company's balance sheet. Identiv has had negative operating cash flow of $3.9mm in Q1 2015 and $4.2mm in Q2 2015. However, management recently announced cost-cutting initiatives and is guiding to positive adjusted EBITDA by Q4 of this year. Identiv's substantial cash balance not only provides a liquidity cushion for the company, but it also constitutes a valuable balance sheet asset at current INVE share price levels.Excluding any value for Identiv's existing operating business, including a large patent portfolio of over 70 inventions or future growth prospects in the IoT industry, the company's balance sheet assets net of liabilities comprise $2.74/share in net tangible equity value. This represents roughly 60% of INVE's current stock price and should provide a floor on the share price should excess selling pressure resume in the short term.Potential Upside ValueAt Identiv's current $4.56 share price, the implied value of the company's operating business, after subtracting the $30mm of net tangible balance sheet equity value from above, is less than $2 per share, or ~$20mm in total. This implies that the stock is trading at ~0.3x in-place revenue (0.27x LTM, 0.32x Q2 2015 annualized, 0.30x midpoint of management's revised 2015 guidance).Peers in the security solutions industry currently trade at over three times LTM revenue. Of the public peers listed below, SuperCom (NASDAQ:SPCB) at 4.55x is the most comparable as it also operates in the traditional security tracking and physical access sectors, as well as in the digital identity solutions space, specifically in the mobile payments arena. Similarly, SuperCom has a sizable government customer base and also is a micro-cap company.Given that Identiv's business is still in transition and subject to more risk than its peers, INVE shares should trade at a discount in the short term, but not of this magnitude. Even a conservative 1.0x LTM revenue multiple would imply a share price of $9 - a 2.0x multiple would imply a share price of $16 and a 3.0x multiple would imply a share price of $23.Note that prior to downgrading the company on 8/5/2015 and changing its valuation methodology to book value, Cowen & Co. set its price target for INVE based on a 3.0x forward revenue multiple:Path ForwardThere are a number of issues that Identiv has to overcome in the next several quarters; however, the market's perspective that is priced into INVE shares appears to be overly draconian. Below is a discussion of certain potential risks and possible paths for the company to resolve these issues. In many cases, the range of scenarios for reasonable outcomes may provide a positive catalyst for INVE shares.Complaint Filed by Former EmployeeThe former executive assistant to Identiv's CEO filed a complaint on 4/2/2015 alleging age and disability discrimination, retaliation and harassment under the California labor code and infliction of emotional distress in connection with her employment and termination by the company earlier this year. She sought a jury trial to award her lost wages, punitive damages, attorney's fees and other legal costs.In the write-up of the background to her complaint, she alleges that Identiv's CEO submitted inappropriate expenses for reimbursement by the company and that the CFO was aware of these expenses. The expenses included servers, travel, meals, entertainment and gift cards, among other things, and total $167,544 based on what was enumerated in her complaint. These allegations are presumably what (1) caused Identiv to form a special committee of its board and retain the independent counsel to conduct an investigation and (2) caused Identiv's auditors to temporarily refrain from issuing new opinions on the company's financial filings.After months of additional legal filings and procedures, on 7/30/2015, the Alameda County judge for this case ruled in favor of Identiv to compel arbitration of the claims. Copied below is a screenshot of the last page of the ruling:(Note that all the court records are available at the Alameda County website under case number HG15764795; however, its website charges an administrative fee to view or download documents, so I cannot provide direct links).While this in no way resolves the case, it's a win for the company and may establish some negotiating leverage for Identiv's lawyers to reach a settlement, which would be a great near-term outcome for the stock. Nevertheless, an arbitration decision could be expected in early 2016, which would remove the overhang of uncertainty related to this issue. If the claims are in fact found to be accurate, the independent committee of the board would likely replace the CEO and CFO, which may actually be well received by shareholders as it could compel a sale of the company. Of note, a sale of INVE still remains a distinct standalone possibility. Cisco could be a likely acquirer if its strategic partnership is successful, as it would cost less to simply buy Identiv than to continue purchasing its products in perpetuity.NASDAQ Non-Compliance for Failing to File Audited FinancialsIdentiv received a non-compliance letter from the NASDAQ on 5/21/2015 for failing to timely file audited financials for 1Q 2015. The company had already filed its unaudited 10-Q for the first quarter, but its auditors have not certified the filing due to the potential expense reimbursement issue raised in the complaint discussed above. NASDAQ provided a 7/20/2015 deadline for Identiv to respond and request an exception of 180 days (until 11/16/2015), which presumably the company did as that date has now passed and a delisting did not occur.Unless Identiv seeks further extensions from NASDAQ, the special committee of the board would likely plan to resolve its investigation of the expense reimbursement issue in advance of the November deadline so that the company's financials can be certified or restated, as the case may be. In the event of a restatement, any changes to Identiv's earnings should be immaterial given the relatively small amount of the total alleged improper expense reimbursement. As discussed above, settling the complaint also would likely lead to an expeditious certification of the company's financials, bringing it back into compliance with NASDAQ rules.Revenue and Earnings MissesSequential revenue guidance downgrades for the past two quarters have eroded shareholder confidence in management's forecasts for substantial growth. However, meeting or exceeding the now lowered expectations could create substantial momentum for a recovery in INVE's share price. There are several factors working in the company's favor that could make this an achievable outcome.First, Identiv's primary existing product segment is largely driven by U.S. government contract business, the spending for which is most often awarded in the third quarter as agencies seek to allocate budgeted funds prior to their 9/30 fiscal year-end. Second, the new partnership with Cisco is scheduled to begin generating some sales in the second half of 2015, with a larger impact in 2016, and on its Q2 earnings call, the company provided a list of 10 sizable new customer relationships, including Cisco, that are close to beginning to generate revenue. Lastly, revenue softness in Europe and the negative impact from declines in the EUR:USD exchange rate should dissipate as that economy and the Euro stabilize after a Greek exit was recently avoided.ConclusionIdentiv is an attractive business that combines an established and productive product line with a new, high-growth suite of security solutions products for the Internet of Things. The company's stock price has collapsed recently under an overwhelming amount of selling pressure from short-term-oriented investors and now trades at levels that imply very little value for its operating business. Identiv's sizeable cash balance provides downside protection on the stock price and the upside potential is dramatic if the company recovers to trade at multiples anywhere near those of its public peers. This risk/reward tradeoff is supplemented by a potential series of positive near-term events that may support a turnaround in the stock.Editor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks.

4270604,21815,2019-06-17T10:30:08-04:00,"The company is facing market changes with a shift towards more networked and integrated IoT-type solutions.Smart acquisitions and cooperation with other companies have enabled the company to be well positioned to take advantage, and the disproportionate growth in software and services testifies to this.The company enjoys solid revenue and margin growth and is close to becoming profitable.","Identiv (NASDAQ:INVE), a provider of identity credentials and secure access solutions, has gone through some lean times, but the company is now emerging in better shape, absorbing three acquisitions. Our investment thesis is based on:The company has two divisions, Premises and Identity, providing a host of security and identity credential products and services:The company offers a wide range of physical and logical access control, video and data analytics, door readers, identity cards, visitor management, mobile security, telephone entry, and radio-frequency identification (RFID) and near-field communication (NFC) solutions for physical and IT-secured businesses.Revenue is growing again, although much of this comes from acquisitions. GAAP earnings haven't suffered all that much from these acquisitions, which is an encouraging sign:The Premises segment, good for 48% of revenue in Q1, grew by 25% y/y (and contrary to normal seasonal downdraft, it was actually up 5% sequentially as well), whilst the Identity segment grew by 13%.Software and services grew a really brisk +68% y/y and is now 14% of revenue (up from 10% a year ago). This brings both recurring revenues and higher margins. Here is where some of that growth is coming from (Q1CC):The company acquired Viscount this year, and there is a useful example in the Q1CC demonstrating how far access technology has come. With the help of Viscount mobile access, people can:This is just one example of how increasingly sophisticated these security and identity verification solutions work, but think the wider applicability in many, if not most, industries and the public sector, and it will become instantly clear how big a market this is; much of this already is or will soon become IoT stuff, which also explains the fast-growing software and services part.Identification and location tracking of people and assets can not only improve security, but it can also in many cases really boost productivity and efficiency. From the Q1CC:Knowing which product is where, how many you have in stock, etc. all in real-time allows for enormous gains. The company has been partnering with NXP (NXPI) of the Netherlands to develop some high-tech RFID solutions (PR):Apparently these cost just $0.05 (per order of 20,000). For readers interested in a host of other sophisticated solutions, there is a really nice short summary of some stuff it presented at the big ISC West Convention (and here for some more of its recent RFID tech).The market is both growing and undergoing some fundamental technological shifts. From IFSEC Global:Growing roughly at a CARG of 7%, but the quote also nicely captures the evolving technology, which is also emphasized by Help Net Security:And the merge into the wider IoT market:This is where the market is moving, and the company has been aggressively positioning itself for this through acquisitions and partnering with other companies.These added considerable products and technologies. For instance, Thursby (from the PR):This shows the additional markets and technologies that Identiv will be able to service, but also nicely captures its vision of the single infrastructure platform. The company provided a presentation for the $6.9M 3VR Video Analytics acquisition, from which the following slide sums up the rationale:And in a little more detail:That is, these acquisitions not only enable the company to gain cost synergies and cross-selling opportunities, but the more important part also is the broadening of its offerings en route to becoming a more comprehensive and integrated solutions provider, which will enable it to enter new verticals.It isn't surprising there are many new companies emerging in an industry experiencing a rapid pace of technological evolution, but Identiv is partnering with many of them in a two-way process (using its technology and solutions as well as letting some of these use Identiv solutions). From the Q1CC:The company is wise to work with others. With the expansion into IoT market capabilities, it comes into contact with a host of wider solutions and platforms (not necessarily tailored for the security market), and why not leverage these? Which is why the company is partnering with Cisco (CSCO), for instance:On the Thursby acquisition, see the article from SA contributor Donovan Jones.Gross margin has expanded by 400bp y/y (even if it was down sequentially due to seasonality) to 45% (46% on a non-GAAP basis, increasing 500bp y/y). A large Air Force order and software and services growth contribute to margin expansion.Operating expenses increased from $8.3M a year ago to $9.1M in Q1 ($6.6M and $7.9M on a non-GAAP basis respectively) with S&M being responsible for the increase because of:The company achieved positive adjusted EBITDA of $1.2M, and this is the 11th consecutive quarter of positive EBITDA.Cash flow is still negative on a 12-month trailing basis, but it's moving in the right direction and turned positive in Q1 ($1.5M):The company had $9M in cash and nearly $18M in debt, on which it paid $245K in interest, and it repaid $2M in notes in the quarter.Acquisitions tend to come with dilution (and so does burning cash), but stock-based compensation has decreased despite the acquisitions:The company also bought back $288K of its own shares in Q1. Note that it has Series B preferred stock on which it pays the dividend ($300K in Q1) which goes at the expense of net profits.Valuation is fairly modest under 1x sales, and analysts expect the company to produce a fairly minimal loss of $0.03 per share this year, but move to profitability next year with an EPS of $0.17.At least one insider certainly seems to think the shares are undervalued. From FinViz:There are competitors like Johnson Controls (JCI), Tyco, and NAPCO (NSSC), but management argues that it is growing faster and enjoys higher margins:We're not entirely convinced as the acquisitions certainly helped with the revenue growth. What about the margins?But the competition is surely valued considerably higher; in the case of NAPCO, much higher:In the case of NAPCO, that isn't surprising, as the company is solidly profitable and the shares doubled this year. Having similar gross margins as NAPCO, it should not be impossible for Identiv to become profitable either (which is indeed what analysts expect for next year).The market for security and identity is both growing and undergoing a fundamental shift in the direction of more comprehensive, networked IoT type of solutions and platforms.After expanding its offerings through a series of acquisitions, Identiv seems well positioned to thrive in this environment. In fact, its growth rate (especially that in software and services) and gross margins suggest that the company is already doing just that and profitability isn't far off."
2763285,25268,2014-12-17T15:09:00-05:00,"Identiv's Chief financial officer Brian Nelson last week went on the record to confirm that Identiv has been supplying NFC technology for Disney Infinity toys.Our due diligence lead us to believe this fact many months ago, but the company had not confirmed for a fact that it's behind the NFC technology for the toys.We have since learned through our research that the company is likely to provide the same NFC technology for Disney's upcoming Star Wars infinity toys in 2015.We have included the entire investor conference where Brian Nelson goes on record about the infinity toys along with additional information.","Written by Scott MatusowOn Thursday December 11th, Identiv (NASDAQ:INVE) revealed that it is indeed supplying NFC technology for Disney's (NYSE:DIS) Infinity line of toys. We have mentioned this several times in the past, but the company's CFO, Brian Nelson, admitted this fact on December 11. We have provided his audio presentation here in its entirety accompanied by the investor slide show.Additionally, through our due diligence, we have learned that Identiv will likely play a major role with Disney's Star Wars infinity toys. These are set to be released toward the end of next year in conjunction with the new film in the series, ""Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens."" We feel the new Star Wars infinity toys will see blockbuster sales as the original Star Wars toys saw back in 1977, which should add a substantial amount of exposure for the company and revenue toward its top line growth next year and into 2016.Also, in the conference Brian explains in part how Identiv handles Cisco's (NASDAQ:CSCO) internal security for the company. We see this development as a potential branch out for Identiv as Cisco has been gearing up more towards ""The Internet of Things ((IoT)),"" and Identity as a service (IDaaS).In September of this year, Identive won the Security Products 2014 New Product of the Year Award for Near Field Communication (NFC) Devices, so it's obvious why Disney and others have been choosing Identiv for its NFC needs.Opus Bank has recently doubled Identiv's line of credit from $20M to $40M, and has moved the first payment on this loan from 2015 to 2017, which is highly significant as it provides additional leverage for the company moving forward. Over the years and under old management, the company has racked up nearly $400M in deficit, which is very attractive for the right suitor to acquire the company. This allows an acquiring company with the correct means to enjoy tax free profits up to $400M, which we estimate adds about $100M in acquisition premium for the company.We predict that Identiv will be acquired next year for at least $400M, provided the overall market is stable and no unexpected events occur that would potentially crash the market.With a current market cap coming in around $150M, we feel Identiv is up to 3x undervalued against comparable companies of its size and in its segment. According to many analysts, the IoT segment alone will reach a peak value of $7.1 trillion by the year 2020.Identiv also has a strong deal in place with Verizon (NYSE:VZ), and has been growing by winning additional deals. According to the company's CEO Jason Hart, these will be announced as soon as the deals ""roll out."" Additionally, we have learned that Identiv plans to hire a reputable IR firm after the first of the year and commence a road show, so we expect the stock to continue its slow rise and reach near its fair value by the end of Q1 2015.In our estimation, this is the only reason the company has remained undervalued and under the radar. The company has been relying on internal IR since late last year, when Hart and his team took over the company. This was done to cut costs and transition the company from near insolvency and a weak position to a company with a strong credit line, cash position and leverage.We think Identiv provides a good opportunity for those who enjoy the risks associated with a small-cap company. With the revelation of Disney as one of its clients, legitimate IR, and its current growth rate, we think 2015 will be a break out year for the company.Identiv Imperial Capital Conference Presentation from Scott Matusow on Vimeo."
2743785,25268,2014-12-10T09:01:00-05:00,"Apple's iPhone 6 institutes Near Field Communication (NFC) for its payment system.Before Apple adopted NFC for this use, the technology was seen as being in a kind of limbo.Identiv is in a prime position to capitalize on the reinvigoration of NFC.Identiv is one of the largest suppliers of NFC tags in the world, and provides these same tags for Disney's line of Infinity toys.","Written by Michael KovarIn our most recent article regarding Identiv (NASDAQ:INVE), we introduced the company and its potential revenue streams related to the post-password-era and numerous recent data breaches. We compared some metrics and valuation to its competitors demonstrating a confusing disparity and likely poor investor relations job. Today, we will continue with the most recent developments for the company along with its NFC capabilities and how Apple indirectly helped them by adopting the technology in its newest iPhone.At the time of our previous article a few weeks back, Identiv's stock was trading around $9/share. It has already made some progress since then. However, it has a long way to go to receive a fair valuation that we commented in the first article as $27/share. Even if $27/share was achieved, it would still be a lower valuation than the CEO's opinion as of the Q2 2014 earnings call when he said, ""I've often commented internally that Identiv is a $400 million company.""Upcoming Events:With several potential catalysts upcoming, at least a portion of the current valuation gap may be closing. During the Q3 earnings call in November, CEO Jason Hart mentioned that it has started to negotiate ""PR clauses"" in its contracts, giving the company the ability to let the market know more. This would be the opposite of the typical detective work necessary to gain information about its partners and customers that has clearly frustrated shareholders. Hart said there were two major customers at that time who had signed off on those types of contracts, and the market would know once the roll out begins. There is some anticipation regarding when this will happen and who these new customers or partners will be.In addition to the potential press releases upcoming regarding these new partners or customers, the company will attend and present at a conference this week. This security investor conference is located at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in New York City. This is a good opportunity for the company to meet with the right kind of institutional investors.Recent Fund Interest and CoverageWith regard to institutional investors, an interesting SEC filing came out last week showing at least one group that has been accumulating a lot of Identiv shares. Royce & Associates, LLC, out of New York City, was required to file a 13G form since the fund now owns over 5% of Identiv's stock. Within the filing, we see that Royce now has 826,263 shares of Identiv, representing 7.76% of the company. With $33 billion in assets, clearly Identiv has attracted the attention of at least one successful fund.Along with the SEC filing, new analyst coverage also was announced in the past week. Northland Securities gave an ""outperform"" rating to Identiv stock, with a price target of $21/share. This new rating accompanies the October target increase by Cowen and Associates to $24/share. The positive sentiment for Identiv appears to be steadily catching on with fund managers and analysts. We expect more to join in as word spreads about the partnerships Identiv has cemented as well as the profitable and aggressive growth expectation for the company and sector.uTrust and Identity as a ServiceIdentiv has already gained quite a lot of traction recently with its uTrust platform which encompasses Identity as a Service (IaaS).Some of the characteristics of uTrust are:A video demonstrating this credential solution demonstrates cloud-based deployment while giving the user convenience and flexibility when completing actions such as adding new employees or removing termed ones quickly. With these products now having the Verizon (NYSE:VZ) stamp of approval, it has already created additional deals for Identiv.Another customer that has been introduced within this category of products is Cisco (CSCO). Although the details haven't been made public on how this deal will impact Identiv, speculation is that the uTrust and IaaS products will be used for all or a majority of Cisco's 72,000-plus employees.NFC impact to IdentivWhile Identiv has already landed partnerships with large companies such as Cisco and Verizon in one area of product offerings, the company also has many opportunities in the Internet of Things (IoT) and near-field communication (NFC).One thing the technology does is allow smartphones to communicate wirelessly with other devices such as point-of-sale terminals. Proponents believe it is ideal for secure payment systems and could eventually replace credit cards. At an event in September, Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook demonstrated Apple Pay, which uses NFC chips built into the company's iPhone 6 and Apple Watch.While NFC technology will impact payment systems, it also can create communication with everyday items such as toys, medicines and consumer products. This allows item tracking and quality control to verify product authenticity. A self-powered ultra slim NFC tag can be integrated into any item.For Identiv, at least one way the company has used NFC tag sales is to enrich the electronic toy and gaming user experience. At a recent conference in Boston, the company showed Disney (DIS) Infinity Toys as its ""customer example,"" related to IoT and NFC. According to an August article by TMC.NET, more than half of the 200 million NFC tags Identiv shipped in 2013 likely went to Disney:With the adoption of NFC in the iPhone 6, we feel it will help change the game for Identiv. Because Apple is a trend setter, we think adoption will slowly gravitate toward mainstream acceptance for this technology along with other companies trying to keep up and follow the leader. When Apple Pay was rolled out, many credit card companies and banks immediately came on board to partner with Apple, including Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) and Capital One (NYSE:COF). Along with companies coming on board to keep up with the technology, consumer information security will be a key element. All of these areas are opportunities for Identiv along with what they have already invested its resources in providing.ConclusionIdentiv leverages a broad patent portfolio in the security and identification space to offer its integrated solutions across premises, information and IoT. The company has over seventy-five patents in key areas across readers, smart cards, RFID, NFC, authentication and access control. We feel the proprietary technology and internal knowledge enables Identiv to offer a broader, more unified solution than competitors.We will see how the adoption of NFC goes with regard to payment systems. Regardless if it catches on there, the Internet of Things has already become a strong revenue stream for many companies and will continue to do so. Identiv is well positioned to be a player within this space and continues to attract large customers. We think the Cowen price target of $24 is more fair than Northland's $21 as we assign a $27 target for the stock in addition to believing Identiv has a good shot to be acquired within the next year. Some of the bigger names in the industry continue to invest copious amounts of money into IoT which should lead to consolidation within the segment."
2689845,25268,2014-11-18T10:01:00-05:00,"Lately, we have seen many headlines about how large companies are experiencing security breaches that have resulted in sensitive customer information being exposed to theft.Breaches included passwords that were hacked, and/or cyber thieves finding security weaknesses in companies' internal networks. Identiv offers best-in-class solutions to combat these types of security breaches.In this article, we review the tech and Identiv's recent Q3 earnings, and show why the company is grossly undervalued and has strong upside potential.","Written By Michael Kovar and Scott MatusowIn yet in another string of security breaches, JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) revealed in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that the contact information for 76 million households and seven million businesses was compromised.The compromised information included names, addresses, phone numbers and e-mail address, as well as internal JPMorgan Chase information about the users, according to the filing. The bank did say, however, that the more sensitive information such as bank account numbers and credit cards was not impacted.In another recent security breach, Home Depot (NYSE:HD) said on September 8th of this year, cyber thieves compromised the financial information of its customers. According to the company:Thankfully, it appears the cyber thieves in this case have been using the information to buy small insignificant everyday items such as beverages and meals at McDonald's, so it's likely the thieves in this case were just a bunch of bored kids, otherwise the damage would have been much greater by now.Cyber thieves used stolen/guessed passwords recently to ""steal"" nude pictures of actress Jenifer Lawrence and model/actress Kate Upton from Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) cloud storage system. Representatives for both Upton and Lawrence had to work very hard to stop the spread of these personal pictures, and the theft has left users of Apple's cloud feeling rather insecure about their personal items stored there.Target (NYSE:TGT) had a data breach occur around Thanksgiving of 2013. In that case, it appears that cyber thieves installed malware into one of Target's internal servers that stores customer credit card data. In fact, it's believed the Home Depot breach occurred in the same way.It's really only a matter of time when more sophisticated cyber thieves will get the type of financial information in their hands that could lead to a potential financial crisis for both the businesses affected and their respective customers.We believe a small company headquartered in the California Bay Area, Identiv (NASDAQ:INVE), has solutions that businesses and investors need to be aware of.The cyber thieves were able to install malware in servers of Home Depot and Target that still use passwords for authentication. This had access to the credit cards prior to encrypted storage. In simple terms, a credit card is swiped at the time/point of sale. Afterwards, it's stored and encrypted internally before being charged by the credit card company. What the thieves did was intercept the credit card numbers using malware installed on the internal servers, which directed the card numbers to be sent to them.Identiv's solution is geared for the internal server of a business. Passwords to gain authentication are not used, so Identiv's solution is part of the ""post-password era.""Identiv produces and manages strong two-factor authentication credentials. The company provides a service that issues and manages the life cycle of the credential (smart card or other form factor). The credential and the processor on the device are used to generate private keys inside the hardware itself. The service works with managed PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) providers like Symantec or Verizon, as well as an in-house PKI system to provide the customers with one of the strongest methods we have to protect identity.The complexity of smart credentials has always been in how they are managed. Typically, complex expensive Card Management Systems and Public Key Infrastructure are used. Identiv's solutions allow customers to take advantage of a secure credential without having to install the complex and expensive system to manage them. The credential can be used with managed or in-house PKI systems.With the Identiv cloud-based service for issuing trusted credentials for its customers, the company provides a service-based solution to a lot of difficult questions, such as:All of these questions can be answered with one thing - a trusted credential that can be used to securely access the systems that have the most valuable data on them.An Identiv Utrust Credential works like an ATM card. You insert the card into a reader and use a PIN to verify your identity to the credential. The credential then identifies you to the host using standard digital certificates-based authentication that is built into every browser on the planet. This type of authentication is built into a Windows operating echo system as a native method, meaning you do not need to install any software to use these credentials.The solution does not require a company to make a large investment into the infrastructure to deploy and manage these credentials. This is what the Identiv idOnDemand service provides. This is a cloud-based solution to design what the credential is going to look like physically and logically. The built-in badge and workflow designers allow customers to create workflows defining the steps used to onboard users, as well as a custom card design that can be physically printed on identification cards.With Identiv's solution, you do not have to deploy client software. It is built into the browser or native in the operating system and in email clients like Outlook or Thunderbird. You can do all of this without the complexity or the overhead of a Credential Management System or Complex PKI.For all of the reasons, cyber thieves cannot install malware on a company's internal server, because they cannot obtain access unless they have the required smart card and the encrypted digital certification.Q3 Earnings CallThe clarity and investor relations efforts that are necessary for any company are now imminent for Identiv for the first time under current management.In the recent third-quarter conference call on 11/13/14, Identiv Chief Executive Officer, Jason Hart stressed that in the past year, he had to be narrowly focused on execution, as the company had many challenges to dramatically change, including restructuring its executive team and sales organization. In the long term, this is the correct approach, which is evident from several improvements.The company is now in a better position because of a much stronger balance sheet, new favorable credit agreements with its suppliers and Opus Bank (the Opus credit line doubled from $20M to $40M, with lump sum payment due in 2017 rather than 2015), growth delivery, and the ability to focus on new strategic partners such as Verizon.Hart said the next phase starting now will include a greater focus on investor relations, press releases of significant events, and an added focus on marketing.Hart stated:So, Hart refers to two major customers who have such agreements in place and have not been revealed to-date. Prior to this, approval was not granted by some of its customers. Customers have been hesitant to allow this because the nature of the business involved security - something that has frustrated shareholders.With the business now stabilized, the focus is now on rapid growth. Hart directly addressed the stock performance and repurchase plan as well. He also stated:Identiv CustomersWhen we took a look at a customer slide the company used at a conference in Boston, it was easy to see the diversification present for Identiv. The company has customers in numerous sectors, including oil, telecom, universities, world and U.S. governments, and others.The list includes; Verizon (NYSE:VZ), Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), Nokia (NYSE:NOK), Hewlett-Packard Company (NYSE:HPQ) and twenty different segments of the U.S. government such as the IRS and NASA.One customer whom Jason Hart has spoken about in previous calls is Verizon. As touched on previously, some frustration has been voiced from shareholders trying to find further details of this partnership. Although the financial terms have yet to be released, Hart did at least clear up some speculation surrounding Verizon:Within this video, a credential solution is displayed and provides cloud-based deployment, while giving the user convenience and flexibility when completing actions such as adding new employees or removing termed ones quickly. With these products now having the Verizon stamp of approval, it has already created additional deals for Identiv. The global reach of this program will be interesting to watch develop as it expands worldwide.VoIP comparisonHart has compared the current situation with authentication and data breaches with the early adoption of Voice over IP (VoIP). In the early 2000s, most every company was rushing to change its phone system to the new technology of VoIP. This is essentially the ability to speak to co-workers and others anywhere without paying long distance fees, because of the internet. The cost savings was very clear to implement VoIP for virtually every major organization, and the companies providing these services had as much work as they had the ability to handle.This is perhaps an underrated statement because people unfamiliar with the telecom industry may not understand the context of it. However, this comparison is the reason the company expects aggressive growth. He is seeing the demand come in and comments that the company's pipeline has doubled in the past two quarters.To give some color on this, a pipeline consists of opportunities the company has identified as just ""potential customers,"" with the associated revenue impact. So, the hypothetical and just potential revenue in the pipeline is a long list with a large total for even small organizations. For a company such as Identiv with approximately $85M in sales this year, the pipeline doubling in such a short amount of time is rather impressive, and tells us that the sales organization restructure has made a fast impact.Obviously, closing deals in the pipeline is now the focus, while continuing to build it to replace deals that are already closed or missed.Comparing Identiv to its competitorsAs referred to in the conference call, Hart believes company is substantially undervalued in comparison to competitors. So, let's take a look at a couple of these companies and the valuations compared with Identiv's.As shown, the third quarter for Identiv produced sales of $22.7M with a positive EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) of about $1M. Year-to-date, the company reported $61.8M in revenue.One of Identiv's competitors is Imprivata, a leading provider of authentication and access management solutions for the healthcare industry. For the full year, Imprivata expects revenue between $94-$95M and adjusted EBITDA to be a loss of $14-13M.Although Imprivata has a higher cash reserve and a little bit higher revenue guidance for full-year 2014, Identiv has a considerable edge regarding profitability and differentiation of customers. Imprivata mainly focuses on healthcare solutions, while Identiv is well-rounded in terms of customer mix. A more diverse customer mix should result in stronger growth for Identiv over Imprivata.Another competitor is Cyber-Arc, a company which recently reported $28M in third-quarter revenue. $4.8M of that was a result of deferred revenue from previous quarters. Cyber-Arc recently had an IPO which created a lot of buzz for the company. Having successful banks such as JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank (NYSE:DB) behind the IPO and providing analysis on the quarterly calls helps a great deal.One key that has helped Cyber-Ark achieve such strong profitability is in the area of maintenance after initial install. This is a key for residual revenue, along with the fact that it is generally very profitable. Additionally, companies buying Cyber-Ark products appreciate that they know exactly what will be spent and can accurately budget that amount.Regardless, if any problems come up, companies pay the same flat rate, while it's nice profit for the providers - a win-win scenario.Identiv has a similar opportunity creating repeatable revenue via its Razor model approach. Another good thing about maintenance contracts is it gives you a much better ability to project a company's repeatable revenue for the future. Organizations selling large volumes of maintenance are attractive in the area of acquisitions because of guaranteed future income streams.Clearly, Cyber-Ark has a nice business model to produce very high profitability. However, with the yearly revenue guidance in line with what Identiv will produce, the disparity in valuation is absurd.In the near future, we think Identiv's management will change this disparity with the new directives regarding investment relations mentioned in the quarterly call. A healthy investor relations department is an imperative stock price driver. We have talked in depth with Jason Hart about this matter, and he agrees that the time has come for Identiv to take stronger action in this area.Conclusion and forward guidanceFor the year 2015, the guidance is for a minimum of 20% growth. This is the budgeted amount, although we think the company can do better considering the new management has been very cautious with guidance. Hart did say factually that Identiv will see revenue grow next year, based on interest the company is getting.All of the breaches in the news have raised awareness for strong post-password authentication. In addition to all of the industries focused on so far, law enforcement initiatives promote the need for accessing confidential data as there are more attacks on personal information. According to Hart via the Q3 earnings call, the company has seen new customer wins in this area, as it's a worldwide issue which translates to global opportunities.The turnkey approach makes Identiv unique and gives the company an edge over many competitors.With the company's share buyback program, it has consciously looked to stabilize the stock. Now that the quarterly report has been made public, insider knowledge is behind the CEO and CFO. Therefore, Identiv has said it will instruct its brokers to continue the buyback strategy at the appropriate times.With the restructuring largely in the rear-view mirror for the company, Hart stated:Cyber security is a growing concern. As we demonstrate at the beginning of this write-up, various large and well-known companies have had several major security breaches over the last year or so.The new management team at Identiv led by Jason Hart is taking the right approach. Investors have been a bit frustrated with the Identiv share price performance lately. However, we strongly feel that the tide is turning here, as the company is in a much stronger position to tell its story (which Hart guided Identiv will), which should attract more institutions and a stronger investor base.We think Identiv is grossly undervalued here, with current market cap coming in just under $100M. We feel the main reason that the company is undervalued is due to its lack of press releases that detail its overall story and new deals it has won. Simply stated, not enough people know about Identiv and its current and future fundamentals.Over the last year, the company did not have the proper leverage to insert clauses in its deals to allow it to press release deals with larger companies.But, as Hart mentioned in the Q3 earnings call, this has now changed, so we expect press releases for at least the two significant deals to be forthcoming. Undoubtedly, we see this development as a strong price per share driver moving forward.Additionally, we expect its deal with Verizon to bring in substantially increased revenues over the next few quarters as it takes the Identiv product global.We believe Identiv should be trading at a much higher valuation now, as demonstrated when comparing it to industry peers. Based on our comparison, a $300M valuation (around $26 a share) would fairly price Identiv. This would represent roughly three times the current price. This puts our valuation mostly in line with the Cowen and Company analyst who has assigned a $24 one-year price target for the company.Identiv offers physical access solutions, as well as solutions for near field communications (NFC), both which are also gaining traction. In our next write-up on Identiv, we will cover both of these.Editor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks. Please be aware of the risks associated with these stocks."
2382715,25268,2014-08-05T13:06:00-04:00,"The “Internet of things” is forecast to become a $7 to $10 trillion market by 2020. Also know as “IoT,” these three letters excite those in the tech field.The riskiest, yet most rewarding investments in the market are small-cap companies with the potential to become much larger caps in time.Microsoft, Apple and others started out as small-cap companies and became true investments which took many years for those who were vested to realize the large gains.We believe we have found at least one company we feel will be a long-term winner because first and foremost it has new top-notch management captaining the ship.","Written by Scott Matusow and Michael KovarMention ""The Internet of things"" (IOT) to those who work in technology and watch them get instantly excited. IoT has been a concept for years which is just now becoming a reality. Several large-cap tech companies are investing billions into it and several unheard of small-cap companies will end up growing or getting acquired by the large companies in the segment.Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) defines IoE as bringing together people, process, data and things to make networked connections more relevant and valuable than ever before - turning information into actions that create new capabilities, richer experiences and unprecedented economic opportunity for businesses, individuals and countries.Last year, Cisco announced a definitive agreement to acquire Sourcefire, a leader in intelligent cybersecurity solutions, for $2.7 billion. It also launched its global re-branding campaign with its ""TOMORROW starts here"" and ""Internet of Everything"" advertising campaigns.In May of this year, Cisco announced Toronto, Ontario, as the location for its new $100 million Internet of Everything research center. Judging by the acquisition and investment in this facility, Cisco is being very aggressive pursuing the opportunities IoT is bringing - it is not alone.Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is another large company that is already bringing in significant revenue via the Internet of Things. While many companies are more in the beginning stages of IoT, Intel is well beyond that. During the 2013 fiscal year, its Internet of Things group had $1.8 billion in sales while generating $550 million in operating income.Investing in companies like Cisco and Intel is certainly a good proposition because of the forward-looking mentality both are currently displaying.With the huge market caps and revenue streams in other areas already existing for these companies, the percentage gains in these already successful stocks could be limited.So, we have turned to the small-cap stock world and have been searching for a company with the kind of management that we feel could transition a small-cap company into an eventual large-cap one.The company we have made an investment in and have begun to cover is Identiv Inc. (NASDAQ:INVE). We feel Identiv has great upside potential since it has been off the radar for some time due to prior management's poor execution.However, late last year all but one member of senior management was replaced, led by Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Jason Hart. Hart has 25 years of experience in this particular segment, He has been recognized for his software expertise in the past, and was named Australian Young Entrepreneur of the Year by Ernst & Young in 2002.We have personally spoken with senior management at Identiv, and we like what we have heard. For starters, the company has little focus on stock promotion at this time. We think stock promotion when telling a truthful and honest story is a good thing, but far too many small-cap companies are more concerned telling stories to ""pump"" their stock price rather than focusing on business execution - one of the biggest reasons why small-cap companies fail.Jason and his management team made an agreement amongst themselves when taking over at Indentiv not to focus on press releases and investor relations at first. Rather, it will focus on turning around Identiv and positioning it to take advantage of the incredible growth that the IoT segment is currently experiencing and will experience moving forward.When we first heard of Identiv from activist investor David Callan, we were of course skeptical. We have been used to Callan being combative and critical of management and engaging in strong anti-management activism. To hear him say ""this is the most impressed I have been with a management team in years"" certainly caught our attention.Some might recognize David Callan's name. David was involved in successful activism by helping see both Obagi Medical and Solta become acquisitions. Callan has been accumulating Identiv stock for some time now, although we do not know how many shares he currently owns. So after talking with Callan, we decided to listen to the company's last earnings call.Some highlights we noted from Identiv's last earning's call:Also, as we continue to dig deeper into the Identiv story, we came across a YouTube video with Jason Hart speaking at the ISC West 2014 conference. In this video, Hart states that Identiv will see positive earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA).Additionally in the video, Hart speaks about IoT and demonstrates how some of the technology works using a Disney (NYSE:DIS) Infinity toy as an example. Disney has begun to ultilize the technology Hart speaks about in the video, and is rumored to be working with Identiv in the area.The technology spoken of is Identiv's ""Trust Your World"" platform which will be the company's primary focus moving forward. There is just too much to explain in words here for this article exactly what this platform is, but there is a YouTube video that demonstrates this platform in simple to understand terms.Basically, this platform has the ability to serve a multitude of companies, from the smallest of them to the largest of them. This is one of the main reasons we have made an investment in Identiv as we believe this is an important part of the IoT future - to provide security for this emerging platform.This kind of technology can prevent or greatly reduce many security concerns like the recent ones experienced by eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) and Target (NYSE:TGT), which have miffed customers while making negative headlines. A central ID that is not user/password based, but rather hardware authenticated identity based would have prevented the eBay issue which revolved around usernames and passwords, and could have prevented the Target issue, where customer information was stolen by hackers accessing information directly from Target's own computers. In the future, retailers such as Target will not store this type of credit card information on their own servers. Rather, they will be stored in the cloud - much harder to track and hack.Frustration may lead to consumers avoiding doing business with companies who suffer these security breaches, at least for the short-term if not permanently. This scenario can cost the companies and cost shareholders significant loss of money and shareholder equity.Additionally, David Callan informed us that Jason Hart intends to ""road show"" the company in mid Q3 and Q4 of this year as the company expects to have the ammunition in hand to attract institutional investors. This factor is why we especially like Identiv - the stock is currently being valued based on poor past performance, which was almost entirely on the old senior management team and the 140-plus employees laid off.The market simply does not know the developing story going on at Identiv and assumes the company will continue to lag. It does not know that an entirely new management team has been brought onboard, nor does it know about the company's focus and vision concerning IoT.We believe if Identiv was a brand new initial public offering (IPO), it would probably be valued over $600M based on its current sales ($90M x 5 sales + growth + EBIDTA positive) and expected growth in the IoT segment.Near Field Communication (NFC), an integral part of IoTJason Hart recently told the NFC times that Identiv will be heavily focused in the NFC tag space, which Hart believes will be a large area of growth now and in the future.NFC technology is a short-range, low power wireless link that uses radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology.This technology can transfer small data between two devices held a few centimeters from each other. Owners of Samsung's Galaxy line of phones have this feature built into their phone, and it's rumored that Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone 6 will offer this feature as well.Additionally, NFC does not need a pairing code like Bluetooth utilizes, and the tech uses very little power so a phone's battery is barely used.Examples of NFC usage include, but are not limited to:A virtually unlimited amount of goods and services can take advantage of this technology, and have already begun to. What makes NFC attractive to large corporations is their ability to use the tech to discover your personal preferences and shopping habits. This will allow them to specifically target consumers, which equates to big earnings for these companies.Additionally, after speaking with the company, we have learned they are working on new technology which for obvious reasons they cannot tell me the specifics of.Identiv has a valuation of 1x sales and at least two strong partnerships already in place with Verizon (utilizing NFC) and ""the largest security company in the country,"" according to what Hart remarked on in the last earnings call. We are impressed with these developments and expect to see more press releases on these types of partnerships in the future.However, as mentioned prior, far too many companies and some investors are over focused on press releases and stock promotion rather than valuation, earnings, guidance and potential earnings growth.Identiv's new management team is about developing business results first, which is the way it should be. Personally, this is the most impressed we have been with a small-cap management team in all my years in the market.In the case of eBay's recent data scare, it requested up to 145M customers to change their passwords as a precautionary measure. While eBay stated that no customer information was compromised, the very thought to hackers being able to potentially access customer critical data is alarming.The future of IoT will encompass users moving away from simple passwords and toward a more integrated and streamlined identity management system. If such a system was in place for eBay, it's likely this attack and potential data compromise would have not taken place.Identiv seeks to provide these companies services to avoid the pitfalls of minor and major security breaches. Physical access credentials, logical access credentials and multi- function IDs are but a part of what Identiv currently offers and is working on to keep up with future security developments.The above is just a small fraction of the IoT field, so we can see why some analysts believe the market will be in excess of $7 trillion by 2020. We believe that in time, the strong management team will lead Identiv to a lot of success.However, we want to caution investors not to expect the stock to just ""take off"" and be a huge multi-gainer in short order. As bullish as we are with Identiv's future prospects, nothing is a guarantee in business. We know this first-hand by covering small-cap biotech for years, and always think it's a good idea for investors to allocate their funds wisely in the stock market.Obviously, we believe Identiv will be a solid success in the long-term. We have demonstrated that if Identiv was a new IPO, the likely market cap would be over $600M based on 5x sales, expected growth of IoT and the positive EBITDA statement by Hart. Considering the current market cap is around $80M, this would represent a 7x increase over the current stock price.However, with all the stock promotion and ""pump and dump"" out there, we do not want investors to get the wrong idea here. Just because the stock price should be 7x greater now, does not mean it will be greater now. We have demonstrated that Identiv at its current price is extremely undervalued, and undervalued in a segment that many analysts believe will be in excess of $7 trillion by 2020.A small-cap company like Identiv carries a lot of risk, and any major misstep by management can have a serious adverse effect on the stock price. We certainly do not believe this will happen, and Dave Callan does not believe this will happen either.Identiv is currently being valued looking backwards and not forward. Looking backwards, we see the poor job former management did. Looking forward, we see top-notch new management and explosive growth in the IoT segment. As mentioned, unless management engages in a serious misstep here, we see a very limited downside here.With a market cap under $100M, we currently see Identiv as a strong positive risk to reward ratio moving forward.In all our due diligence, we strongly believe Identiv will be a long-term winner with potential large percentage gains. Therefore, we have made a considerable bet on its future. We think investors should engage in deep due diligence with Identiv. We have no doubt that once they do, they will agree with both us and Dave Callan.Disclosure: The author is long INVE. The author wrote this article themselves, and it expresses their own opinions.

2282513,25268,2014-06-24T08:32:00-04:00,"These days we hear about shareholder activism almost daily. It is next to impossible to watch CNBC and not hear discussions about some form of activism.Watch Carl Icahn, Dan Loeb, Bill Ackman, George Soros or any of other familiar names that have become famous for challenging public companies and board members.On a much smaller scale and using his own private funds, David Callan has been no exception to that group.He has been successful as an activist in his last four public campaigns to explore strategic alternatives including the sale of the companies.For a refreshing change, Callan is on the other side of the table as an investor in a company he feels will yield large returns over time.","Written by Scott Matusow and Kyle DennisThe company David Callan has been buying shares for a long-term investment is Identiv (NASDAQ:INVE), which he considers a well-executed turnaround story in the making.Identiv is a technology company that focuses on developing products to provide secure identification. These products include radio frequency identification, smart card-based security, cloud-based service delivery, and near-field communication.Top-Notch ManagementCallan has informed us that he is giving his support to the current CEO and board of directors. He personally informed me that ""Identiv has the most impressive CEO I have come across in years."" Hearing this from Callan is certainly strange for me as he normally deals with poor management and CEOs. Most of the time he successfully ousts or forces these groups to sell their respective companies because of poor execution that costs shareholders a lot of capital and heartache.Callan has been in contact with Identiv and its new CEO, Jason Hart, watching closely as he orchestrates a major overhaul of Identiv to position the company for future growth and success. While this company is outside of the medical device field that Callan typically focuses on, recognizing strong management and solid growth platforms are commonplace for him.When it comes to investing in a small-cap company, the first rule we live by is ""bet on the jockey before betting on the horse."" Like Callan, we are most impressed with Jason Hart, who is the kind of jockey we bet on. In fact, Hart chose not to press release the company's partnerships with Verizon (NYSE:VZ), but rather spoke of this development on Identiv's last earnings call from Quarter One, 2014.The details of the Verizon deal are not fully known. There is a likely reason for this: Many large companies simply do not want potential criminals to know exactly what type of security they are using to protect their infrastructure. Also, Verizon may have requested the details of this deal not to be made public.Additionally, we were impressed with the call and felt Hart was clear and precise on what his management team has been doing to ensure current and future company success.Callan Building a Position in IdentivCallan recently spoke with CEO Jason Hart along with Chief of Staff (COS) Lennart Streibel, and described this conversation as possibly one of the best calls he has ever had with a public company. In fact, he informed us it was the first time in years he actually enjoyed listening to management because of its quality versus the excuses that he hears regularly from companies with poor management.Hart and his team have been consolidating and integrating what used to be 37 businesses (many from acquisitions) into one elite and streamlined company with a clear focus - a sign of good management. Callan feels that Hart and his team are executing at levels that even exceeded his expectations and stated to us:Following his last call with the company, Callan told us he instructed his broker to ""keep buying shares until his arm hurt."" So, again Callan is amassing a sizable position for himself in a company. This time it's not to apply pressure to get a company to sell, but rather to be a long-term investor.We have been doing our own research and due diligence on Identiv and we like what we see. It is clear that Opus Bank likes what it sees as well considering it has recently extended a $20M round of financing that carries an interest rate of almost half the previous facility. Mr. Hart has adopted a single-focused strategic initiative in this turnaround and has kept most of the story out of public eye in terms of ""promoting"" Identiv stock.Hart has been consolidating Identiv divisions into a more streamlined approach which include, but are not limited to:An example of how Hart and his team have been executing the ""Trust Your World"" theme has been by bringing product awareness to the marketplace and engaging workshops that are designed to educate potential clients on cyber security issues the world is facing today and in the future. This is a cost-effective way for Hart to both land clients and bring name recognition for Identiv. Far too many small-cap public companies give too much weight to stock price over business execution by overemphasis in stock promotion.Companies with management that engage in stock promotion mainly focused on its price per share often tend to fail in executing its core business initiatives, which is a constant theme we see over and over again. We know that if management has good product and promotes it correctly as we believe Hart has been doing, stock price appreciation will follow suit in time.Hart is expected to begin meeting with the institutional investment community in the third and fourth quarters, which tells us that this company and stock are ready to hit the radar of many market participants. We want to get out in front of this story and put our reputation out there because we believe Identiv has large potential. With its current valuation, we feel the company offers investors who are willing to take the risk on a small-cap company the opportunity to see Identiv turn into a larger cap company over time.The corporate changes being made late in 2013 and 2014 are staging the company for significant upside potential in the years to come. Landing a deal with companies like Verizon and focusing on OEM contracts with major players should just be the beginning of success for Identiv.The Next Big Trend in TechThe ""Internet of Things (IOT)"" is as big a buzzword as you can find in tech today. In fact, author John Naughton remarks:Hart is positioning his company to capitalize on the buzz as it is uniquely positioned to deliver ""trust"" to the Internet of Things with its new ""Trust your World"" vision that focuses on delivering solutions for the rapidly-expanding connected world.For instance, Identiv is focusing on such IoT opportunities as near-field communication (NFC) technology. NFC is a set of standards for smartphones and similar devices to establish radio communication with each other by touching them together or bringing them into proximity, usually no more than a few inches.As CEO Jason Hart remarks in his blog:Such examples would be systems that include a mobile app based on the NFC platform that provides real-time information about a business' inventory. If inventories are running low, a business will know exactly how much inventory is left, and how quickly those inventories are dwindling so that a business can re-order when needed - all in real time.Identiv is focused on three main areas: Trust Solutions for Premises, Trust Solutions for Information, and Trust Solutions for Everyday Items. Its platform for delivering these solutions is Identiv Trust Services (ITS).Such trust services include UHF and HF RFID tags for use in asset identity-management systems across a broad spectrum of industries, such as retail, logistics and healthcare, to name but a few.For instance, eBay's (EBAY) recent data compromise of up to 145M customers, who were then asked to change their passwords as a precautionary measure. While eBay stated that no customer information was compromised, the very thought to hackers being able to potentially access customer critical data is alarming.The future of IoT will encompass users moving away from simple passwords and toward a more integrated and streamlined identity management system. If such a system was in place for eBay, it's likely this attack and potential data compromise would have not taken place. Identiv seeks to in part provide service toward this end.The above is just a small fraction of the IoT field, so we can see why some analysts believe the market will be in excess of $7 trillion by 2020. If Identiv can manage a meager 1% market penetration, it could then realize a substantially higher market cap moving forward, potentially in the billions. It's really simple math here. What is not simple is actually getting the job done. We feel that with good management, Identiv can at least realize a modest market penetration.Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) most recently came forward with its push into the Internet of Things space by introducing Apple Homekit. Homekit acts as an Internet of Things platform, creating a common interface for developers to securely integrate a wide range of home control functions like lights, thermostats, appliances, locks and other devices through the iPhone or iPad and even with Siri.We believe ""the Internet of Things"" is the next trend that investors will take notice of. The big players in the tech industry have already started consolidating assets for this trend. Apple has partnered with Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) and Philips (NYSE:PHG) to work on in-home automation and security. Google (GOOG, GOOGL) also acquired Nest Labs for $3.2B earlier this year.As this trend catches on, we believe Identiv will be attractive to bigger money investors over time.Due to previous management acquisitions, Identiv has a wide array of products. New management has consolidated and streamlined this profile so that the company can become profitable. As mentioned, large companies like Verizon have signed contracts with Identiv and others are sure to take notice. Although it's very early in its journey, we believe that the new management team is positioning the company correctly for future growth. With a market cap under $100M, there is good room for share appreciation.Investing in companies before they become a trending topic is how the biggest gains are made in the stock market. We have seen companies in different sectors do well this year as the sectors they are involved in have gained attention.For example, in 2014, the energy sector has been receiving a lot of attention. One company that has been in the headlines quite a bit lately has been FuelCell Energy (NASDAQ:FCEL). FuelCell is working to develop alternative energies that are economically and environmentally friendly. The technological basis here is the fuel cell. A fuel cell uses chemical energy and converts it into an electrical output. The advantage to these fuel cells is that they are supposed to produce more sustainable energy and reduce our carbon footprint.FuelCell Energy installs and operates fuel cell plants. It manufactures several variations of the batteries and claims its solution is more efficient and ultra clean. FuelCell is highly speculative, but there is no denying that it has gained major investor attention. FuelCell Energy traded as low as $1.30 early this year and rallied to $4.74 in early March. The company may or may not be successful in the long term, but those who identified the energy and alternative energy trend early made huge returns.We get many emails on a daily basis asking us to check out companies that they claim is the ""next big thing."" Just about every company brought to our attention either has poor management, poor financial structure, poor product, and other variables that do not inspire our interest.Identiv is clearly under the radar and is just beginning to capitalize on the IoT trend. We see similar upside for Identiv that FuelCell Energy had earlier this year in terms of stock appreciation, but with stronger appreciation over the long term.Undervalued and Under the RadarAs it stands today, Identiv trades at a market cap below this year's projected sales of $80-90M which we feel is too low of a valuation. Typically, valuations are low because growth is declining, management is failing, or the sector is being phased out. We see the exact opposite with Identiv. The company is well positioned, the market is emerging, and is well managed by Hart and his management team.Risk/Reward Profile For Long-Term Investors Is FavorableObviously, as with any small cap company, Identiv can fail. But, with Hart captaining the ship, we feel the company will be largely successful in time. Additionally, we feel it's likely that when Hart meets with Wall Street firms in the 3rd and 4th quarter of this year, the company will gain support from many of them.We aren't looking at Identiv as simply a short-term or mid-term trade. We have taken a long-term position in the stock and plan to see it through, unless something much unexpected happens.However, nothing is guaranteed, especially when it comes to small-cap companies. Hart could misstep and get too aggressive with cuts and not focus on enough growth. The company can also get irresponsible with its cash position, and it also may not focus enough on making sure its products are up to industry standard compliance.While we do not believe this will happen, we feel we must point out this possibility as other companies in the past who have had a lot of promise simply blew it and failed.ConclusionWe, along with Dave Callan, hope to enjoy the ride in the years to come from Identiv because we believe IoT is where the largest potential will be realized while CEO Hart agrees. The company is in a good position to gain partnerships with some of the biggest players in the business. It ultimately would not surprise us if one of the industry giants would acquire Identiv down the road as to avoid its supply chain from being interrupted or as a strategy to disrupt competitors' dependence on the same technology. However, we do not see an acquisition any time soon. When and if an acquisition does occur, it would likely be at least a couple of years down the road.With David Callan on board, we have to believe that if company management ever engages in activity that is not beneficial to the shareholders, he and his attorneys will be there, demanding the exploration of strategic alternatives. For now, he is extremely content to sit back and not make it his job managing those who run the company. Callan thinks Jason Hart and his management team will take this company and its shareholders to extreme prosperity in time and as indicated to us, he is in Identiv for the long haul.As CEO Hart remarks on the company's Q1 2014 earnings call, ""It's going to take a few quarters,"" meaning new management will need a bit of time to undo the mess the former team left behind. So far, Hart and his associates are ahead of schedule.The new senior management team came into place late last year, replacing all of Identiv's prior senior management along with the laying off 140 employees designed to ""cut the fat."" We like the initial moves Hart has implemented with Identiv, and even more so, we like his vision of consolidating the company's assets into a one-core business model under the premise of IoT.As we mentioned prior, we also like the fact that Hart is not engaged in stock promotion. This is evident by the company not press releasing key partnerships, most notably the Verizon one mentioned on the Q1 2014 earnings call.We see far too many small-cap companies promoting their stock with a lot of hyped up expectations. These companies oftentimes become addicted to the hype, and frequently lose focus on actually executing core business fundamentals properly to realize these expectations.Identiv's Hart is focusing on execution and results, versus hyped up stock promotion. Bigger and smarter money investors want to see this first and foremost, so we believe Hart will be successful in his meetings with bigger firms come the 3rd and 4th quarter of this year.IoT is projected to be a 7 trillion-plus market by 2020, and all Identiv needs is a tiny percentage of this market to eventually achieve a multi-billion dollar market cap over time. The company has the right products to capitalize on IoT, but more importantly, we feel it has the right management to get the job done.We believe patient investors with vision and perseverance will be handsomely rewarded here in the long term.Disclosure: The author is long INVE.

He also stated that they will be very inward-focused-for the foreseeable future because of the torrid rate of change that they expected would occur in several fronts. And he was not kidding. There has been an almost complete vacuum of news and announcements coming from the company since the November 7, 2013 call.Regarding simplification, Indentive Group's CEO Jason Hart commented during the call:""we will continue to divest what I call our non-core assets, I believe we have been doing too much with too little. It's a classic way for us to not perform and we will continue to look at strategic options for a number of these non-performing assets or assets that don't fit in the high growth market segments. I am pleased to announce that we have also bought some new strength to the bench on the executive team with new hires from EMC and Hewlett-Packard to help in that process.""The main objective for these divestitures is to address cash-consumption issues, to reduce labor/overhead costs, reduce liability exposure, addressing short and long term loans and bridging loans, streamlining operating structural expense, and growth issues. In my January 7, 2014 update I discussed some of divestitures that have already taken place to date and were only mentioned in company filings.But what about focus and growth? The company will focus its energy, strong patented technology, and significant expertise to further develop high-growth areas, such as cloud identity/security as well as NFC/RFID products.The high rate of growth in this areas was evident in 3Q 2013. The company reported that revenues from the ID product segment were $13.9 million, up 7% from $13 million in the previous quarter and up 53% from $9.1 million in the same quarter last year. This growth was primarily driven by strong revenues from both RFID and NFC product sales, which increased 131% year-over-year. Revenues from readers and associated card sales also grew by 10% both sequentially and year-over-year.In the only meaningful press release since reporting 3Q 2013 financial results, CEO Hart took advantage of that opportunity to drive the word ""growth"" over and over again when he announced on February 24, 2014 that Gary Kremen was joining the BOD:""Over the past 14 weeks we have substantially simplified the business to create a focused growth platform that leverages our core competencies in delivering unique and patented trust solutions for premises, information and the rapidly growing market of everyday items. The key here is identities moving from analog to digital for billions of connected everyday items. Identive intends to be at the heart of this revolution,"" ….. ""To support and guide this vision, I am extremely pleased to welcome Gary (Kremen) to our board. He is an iconic Silicon Valley technology pioneer who has identified and executed on important trends before others have seen the opportunity.""Harnessing the functionality of existing smartphone technology and integrating it into today's connected world bringing the all-in-one device of tomorrow closer than ever. Near field communications (NFC) and RFID technologies such as those offered by Identive will play a pivotal role in the ever-growing mobile payment market.According to recent report from Strategy Analytics, in 2014 the number of NFC-equipped smartphones will surpass 500 million devices globally. Given the upsurge of NFC-enabled mobile devices there are now a myriad of application taking advantage of NFC/RFID technologies aimed at simplifying more complicated, time-consuming, and costly processes. Take hospitality chains for instance. They've already begun deploying contactless technology to encourage guests to make reservations, check in, check out, access their rooms, enjoy amenities and partake in newly-unveiled loyalty programs - all through their handset.Using NFC-equipped smartphones, guests can check in remotely after a simplified, expedited process that works like this: First, the hotel sends its future guest a link via text message. From there, the guests are provided with the room number for their upcoming stay along with an encrypted key that is sent by SMS over the air to a SIM card. With their digitized room key, guests can forego those daunting lobby lines and head straight up to their rooms. To gain entry, guests merely place their NFC-equipped device in close proximity to the contactless reader on the door and, presto!Louis Modell, , Identive vice president of sales, Americas commented recently, ""Contactless readers replace the ubiquitous standard lock and allows hotel doors to be opened almost magically by simply holding a smartphone to the lock area. There is a major benefit not only to the hotel guest but also to the hotel chain,"" ….. ""RFID technology eliminates the need for traditional cards, keys and eradicates friction all together resulting in overall less maintenance."" Other NFC/RFID applications where Identive is a big player are contactless ticketing for transportation (e.g., metro or subway), amusement parks, ski-passes, etc., contactless ID badge or cards, passports, enabling smartphones for tap-and-go mobile payment, coupon pickup, social media check-in, etc., electronic toy NFC, RFID products, particularly with some strong contracts from at least one gaming company.Another high-growth area with a lot of promise is the company's cloud-based Identity as a Service (IaaS) offering. The company reported several new orders for cloud-based services in 3Q 2013 including a three-year contract to issue and manage trusted credentials for an international government's healthcare program and the expansion of activities with a U.S. based Fortune 100 company. Cloud-based revenues are high-margin and recurrent. Identive is one of the pioneers in this technological area.I will not even attempt to try to guess what revenues and income will be like in 4Q 2013 which will be reported before the end of this month. But my attention will be focused on how CEO Jason Hart will articulate ""The New INVE,"" and what he expects in upcoming quarters and in 2014 and beyond.Many companies focusing on NFC/RFID/M2M/Internet-of-Things markets like SuperCom Ltd. (NASDAQ:SPCB), On Track Innovations (OTIV), Lantronix (NASDAQ:LTRX) and others have much higher valuations than INVE. Investors should note that INVE's expected revenues after restructuring will be much higher than the companies I've just mentioned. Even larger sector player Sierra Wireless (NASDAQ:SWIR) saw its stock price almost tripled to a 52-week high of $26.56 before the recent consolidation. The projected rate of growth in this technology sector is staggering, and companies with a growing presence like INVE are sure to benefit from this windfall.Fortunately there will only be a six week wait after 4Q 2013 financial results are released to see 1Q 2014 consolidated results excluding discontinued operations and showing the true profit potential of ""The New INVE."" I believe that the stock price will leave the under-$1 territory for good real soon. In my opinion delisting fears will be a non-issue because NASDAQ has granted INVE an additional 180 days, or until June 9, 2014, to regain compliance with the minimum bid price rule by maintaining a minimum closing bid price of at least $1.00 for ten consecutive business days.In my opinion INVE is a compelling value under $1 with so much positive information that I expect will come out from 4Q 2013 earnings release and conference call. And if the company is successful in executing its aggressive growth plan, INVE stock price is likely to rally to the $2 to $3 range within a quarter or two. But since no investment in the stock market is free of risks, investors should review all the risks and uncertainties as detailed in the company filings with the SEC.Disclosure: I am long INVE. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).

Normally, this wouldn't have caught my interest, except for in the case of INVE, a $1 closing price signals a potential catalyst (or rather, removal of a negative catalyst) in INVE shares. In particular, INVE received a notice from the NASDAQ Capital Market exchange in December 2013 that if its stock price did not close above $1 for 10 consecutive sessions before June 9, 2014, that it would be delisted from NASDAQ.INVE data by YChartsINVE shares have now closed at or above $1 for the last eight trading sessions on heavy volume; INVE needs only two more closes at or above $1 to remove the potential for delisting from NASDAQ in the interim.

Mr. Hart outlined the simplification process on the most recent earnings call (transcript courtesy of Seeking Alpha):To further simplify the turnaround, management disposed of certain non-core assets and is now focused on three global, growth markets:Mr. Hart discussed these markets on the earnings call as well (transcript courtesy of Seeking Alpha):Stated differently, INVE is undergoing a radical transformation in terms of defining its target operating model and target markets.But because INVE is involved in a number of key themes that are driving business value and stock prices higher - cloud, SaaS, IoT, security - I think INVE shares remain undervalued at the current $74 million market cap. I also believe the market has yet to re-rate INVE based on the turnaround in place, an evolving SaaS operating model and exposure to a growth industry, and that 2014 could be a period of inflection for INVE as it undergoes its transformation.Management Driving Shareholder ValueAnother important development at INVE includes closing a $20 million term loan and line of credit to replace existing credit facilities and provide the funding of INVE's growth strategy. Nothing hurts more when investing in small-cap stocks than a dilutive equity raise. The fact that management was able to tap the credit markets, improve its capital structure through lower cost of debt and preserve shareholder value is a welcome sign for shareholders, and minimizes the risk of a dilutive offering.I understand INVE attracted institutional investor support illustrated by Lincoln Park Capital's $2 million equity purchase at $1.14/share in April 2013, with an agreement that allows INVE to sell up to $18 million in equity securities with certain pricing parameters. Given management tapped the credit markets rather than selling additional securities to Lincoln Park Capital is another reassuring signal that management is interested in creating as much shareholder value as possible through minimizing dilution.Now that INVE improved its working capital and satisfied its cash needs with the new $20 million credit offering, this is another positive indicator that management can now turn to refocusing the business on its growth strategy which is pegged for 10 to 15% revenue expansion in 2014, to an $80 to $90 million revenue run rate at positive EBITDA margins.ValuationTurning now to valuation, given the moving parts in INVE's cost structure, many traditional measures of value are not useful currently. However, there do exist a couple of comparables in which to estimate value for INVE, including: (1) Supercom (NASDAQ:SPCB) and (2) On Track Innovations (OTIV). Both businesses reported solid revenue growth and trade for 3 to 4x sales; meanwhile, INVE is currently priced at about 1x TTM sales, and 0.9x forward sales (based on the midpoint of management's guidance). While there are some differences in target operating models of each, the wide disparity in sales multiples indicates a mispricing. In my view, a 1.5 to 2x multiple on sales is not an unreasonable valuation for INVE, indicating equity value between $125 and $170 million.Turning now to an estimate of INVE's target operating model, I believe, at scale, that INVE can achieve 15% operating margins as it begins to sell higher margin identity services via its cloud-based solutions while it concurrently manages operating expenses and reinvests in higher ROI activities such as sales and marketing. Given the opportunity to cross sell across the on premise, mobile and IoT solutions, I think there is significant opportunity to leverage marketing spend to meaningfully grow revenue over the next several years. If we assign a pro forma 15% EBITDA margin to next year's $80 to $90 million revenue target and apply an 8 to 10x multiple, I estimate equity value to be in the range of $100 to $125 million.Under these scenarios, I'm estimating between 35 and 170% upside. The valuation is very wide and necessarily imprecise given all the moving parts, but I expect that an investment in INVE shares will have a positive expected value given the turnaround in place and the current $74 million valuation.In terms of GAAP profitability, INVE is still probably a year away from booking profits. That said, the company should see resumption to normal government orders after INVE experienced a slow down as a result of the government shutdown in Q4. Additionally, INVE landed a couple of key, long-term SaaS contracts related to its identity-as-a-service (""IDaaS"") offering, providing revenue visibility and some validation to its IDaaS solutions. Finally, INVE also landed agreements with large distribution partners which resulted in a number of contracts, including an order to provide ID products around certain government e-health programs.While GAAP profitability may not occur until 2015, the signs of a turnaround are evident in terms of achieving scale through distribution partnerships, the sale of money losing non-core businesses Multicard and Tagtrail (costing Identive $0.17 EPS in 2013) and transition to selling higher margin SaaS services. When INVE does reach scale, I believe the net earnings power in the model can reach 10 to 15% of sales.CatalystsIn addition to the cost reduction program (e.g., moving corporate HQ from Germany to California, aligning workforce, etc.) and the potential removal of the delisting threat, management indicated that after a quarter (Q4 2013) of inward focused business model reengineering, INVE will turn its attention back to engaging with Wall Street and investors to paint a clearer picture of its turnaround story. In my view, last week which included the introduction of a new cloud-based on premise security service offering and the closing of the $20 million credit facility will be the beginning of a lot of good news coming from INVE.Given the increased focus on shareholder communication, I think INVE could pick up increased institutional interest, especially if the share price manages to trade north of $1 per share. And a rising share price and market cap should be a virtuous cycle for INVE, as there is currently a dearth of analyst coverage.RisksThe key risk I see at INVE is execution risk. Managing such radical change is difficult, but Mr. Hart has extensive experience in the technology industry and is regarded as a solid manager. The proof, though, will be in the pudding over the next several quarters as INVE management updates investors regarding its transformation to a leaner enterprise with a more fulsome and broadened revenue stream. Management has indicated that its committed orders and backlog continues to increase as INVE turns now to building a more effective sales pipeline, including increased focus on CRM, lead generation and collaboration among distribution partners.Other risks include increased competition among established players in its various services offerings, but given the mobile security and IoT market are expected to expand rapidly over the next several years, I expect competition to remain less of a threat to INVE relative to the execution risk that it is currently exposed.ConclusionIdentive Group has a lot of interesting investment characteristics in terms of a radical turnaround that is potentially being misinterpreted by the greater investment community. Combine that with leverage to attractive industries at a reasonable valuation and a decreasing chance of being delisted from the NASDAQ, and INVE has picked up some support for its share price and has meaningful upside if management is able to return to growth and to show investors it is able to manage its cost structure.Event-driven investors should watch the price action on these shares over the next two trading sessions. If INVE closes at or about $1/share, I believe that could be the beginning of an upward trend in the stock quote by removing a negative catalyst related to a delisting from a major exchange.Disclosure: I am long INVE.

2772595,25268,2014-12-22T10:35:00-05:00,"David Callan, a well-known activist who was involved with helping to facilitate the sales of Obagi, Solta, Sound Surgical and others, is now calling for Identiv to shop itself.Callan makes several key points in which many we agree with. We also think now would be a good time for Identiv to explore strategic alternatives.However, we think that Identiv is already in talks with suitors for acquisition and will be acquired soon. Nonetheless, we think it's positive for Callan to push for acquisition now.","Written by Michael Kovar and Scott MatusowIdentiv (NASDAQ:INVE) has been a company we have written a lot about over the last six months. Normally, we only trade small-cap companies and rarely invest in them, but Identiv is one we believe is a worthy investment because of its undervaluation and growth potential.Well-known activist investor David Callan first pointed out Identiv to us as a legitimate small-cap investment and convinced us to do deeper due diligence on the company. We ended up agreeing with Dave, and took position in the stock.In order to be fair with our coverage of Identiv, we want to present Callan's current thoughts on Identiv, many of which we agree on.While Identiv seems intent on improving investor relations as noted by company CEO Jason Hart, activist investor Dave Callan is nonetheless pushing for it to hire an investment banker to pursue a sale of the company.On June 24 of this year, we reported that Callan had taken a position in the company and was supporting management and the officers. This was the opposite of his usual active and aggressive approach to dealing with undervalued investments and its management. He cited Identiv as a great turnaround story in a developing technology space.Additionally, we noted in the article that,So, what has changed his view leading to the belief that it should be sold? Callan continues to believe that Identiv has top notch management in place. His belief that Jason Hart is a top notch Chief Executive Officer (NYSE:CEO) has not changed, and he applauds the impressive turnaround that Jason and his team have accomplished - we agree.Callan sees the company now as streamlined with an expanded customer base with unnecessary costs eliminated. This is combined with a significantly strengthened balance sheet and positive EBITDA results documented in the most recent quarter that has the company well positioned for the future in a growing market space.However, the company remains grossly undervalued in his opinion in which we also agree. Because the company's need for confidentiality regarding a majority of its business (security), Callan believes it will not be able to reach fair market value. Callan also feels that the traditional methods to build shareholder value are ones the company does not have access to as a result of these restraints. As Jason Hart himself has said many times, ""our hands are tied as such that we cannot tell the world who our business partners are and what Identiv has to do with them.""We think Callan has a good point here, but we also note that the company has been interviewing Investment Relations firms (NYSE:IR) and is hoping to have one in place shortly after the first of the year.However, Callan believes that the lack of transparency will hinder Identiv from achieving the valuation it deserves. He told us:We think Callan makes a good point here as we've remarked before in one of our previous articles, shareholder frustration has grown, especially with the company's deal with Verizon (NYSE:VZ). Hart cleared up some of the confusion in the third quarter conference call by admitting that the Verizon product in its recent public video is in fact Identiv's technology.He went on to say that the company is working closely to blend its product with Verizon's into a unique offering that is now being taken globally. However, conference calls and speaking engagements seem to be the only place to find much evidence of these agreements. The SEC filings do not disclose the significant financial impact that this deal may have to Identiv and additionally there have been no press releases covering the big names. In large part, because the company has been relying on internal IR, it has not done a good job in getting the Identiv story out.In our view, hiring a reputable IR firm will help bolster the stock price, as one of the most important tasks an IR firm does is to call funds it has specific contacts with and tell Identiv's story to these funds who would be perspective buyers.In a similar fashion as Hart, CFO Brian Nelson recently spoke at a conference in New York City about its agreement with Disney (DIS) and its well-known Infinity toy collection, including shipments totaling approximately 150 million NFC tags. The terms and potential impact this deal may have for the company is unfortunately still unclear, although sources indicate to us that the company is likely to also provide NFC for Disney's Star Wars Infinity toys - to be released next year when the new Star Wars film comes out.Callan feels this is an ideal time to explore the potential sale of the company, and in many ways, we do agree with him. Management has done a good job getting the books in order and in the hands of a bigger company with greater resources, we feel the company would see explosive growth.As of right now, the growth of the business and endless market opportunities lie in the forefront of the Identiv sales team. The hard work of positioning the company and streamlining it is over as previously mentioned. Now is the time to reap the rewards. In Callan's opinion, the sales team is too small and the market scale is limited as a direct result. Equipped with a long medical device sales background, he feels Identiv's sales force should be several multiples of what it is today in order to properly realize its potential. He commented:In a letter dated November 8, 2014, sent to the board of directors of Identiv from his attorney, Callan cited:The following comments from SmartThings CEO Alex Hutchinson are ones that Callan feels the Identiv board of directors should learn from as he feels the two stories are very similar:According to Callan's point of view, public companies should not be in never-ending blackout periods. Callan feels that a few press releases here and there will not be enough to satisfy the demand for more transparency so investors can make educated decisions while markets fairly reflect the true value of Identiv. We tend to also agree with Callan on this point, but we also believe based on Hart's recent guidance, this is about to change for the positive.Callan thinks that large companies wanting to enter this space will provide a strong interest, as will larger private equity firms. In a sale scenario all of the potential buyers would sign NDAs and be privy to what's behind the curtain. He told us:Callan has had a successful past as an activist, most recently with Solta Medical, Obagi Medical and SRI Surgical. With Identiv now in his sights, we would expect nothing less as his logic for exploring the sale process makes sense to us.Although this was not his original intention when he built his position, he knows how to adapt to the current realities and hopes the board of directors will as well. The company continues to trade a far cry below where CEO and board member Jason Hart expressed the company should fairly trade - $400M, or approximately $31/share based on a fully diluted share count of 13M. We note than Hart did in fact say that he believes the company is worth $400M, so this was not a future or forward looking opinion.We also note that this was said in an earnings call months ago when the company was not as strong as it is today.Also, another view not being considered (the one we take) is that the company being so quiet is because it has been shopping the company and may be getting close to selling it. In fact, we believe this has been Hart's intention from the moment he took over Identiv a little over a year ago.We recently guided our subscribers (Beginning of December) that Volcano Corp (NASDAQ:VOLC) was very close to being acquired for between $15 and $18 a share and assigned a 70% probability for an acquisition to occur before the end of this year. On December 17th, Volcano was acquired by Phillips for $18 a share.We believe based on our due diligence that Identiv is a lot closer to being acquired than many might think. Our recent research indicates that Samsung might be interested and could be one of the currently unrevealed partners Hart referred to in the last earnings call. An added benefit that a large and profitable company such as Samsung would gain from purchasing Identiv is in the form of accumulated deficit. For Identiv, the company has an accumulated deficit of about $332 million as of September 2014.A significant portion of this money would be able to offset future earnings or be written off. So, along with the technology, intellectual property rights, patents and projected sales for next year of about $120 million, Identiv would have this additional leverage when negotiating with a potential suitor.With current industry consolidation taking place, along with Identiv's cleaned up balance sheet, the company seems groomed for a buyout.We think that Identiv can certainly succeed on its own over time, but there are substantial risks for a small company like Identiv to take this route when an acquisition would remove these risks and bring a fair value now for the company's shareholders.We think it's a good thing when companies have activist investors such as David Callan owning a significant stock position. We agree with most of Callan's views, but we also believe Hart's intention all along has been to get the company to this point - groomed and ready for acquisition by a much larger company with the correct leverage to take Identiv to its full potential now rather than years down the road.Therefore, we believe the company will be acquired in Q1 '15, but it appears that Callan will not idly wait and see if this comes to fruition or not as he is taking activist action now.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

1932061,54972,2014-01-07T09:45:22-05:00,,"Several times in December 2013 I was about to send SA a draft update to my original Identive Group (NASDAQ:INVE) article published on November 6, 2013. But Identive kept making announcements in line with its aggressive plan to simplify the company's organizational structure and enhance its focus on high-growth products and markets. After changing the title and content of my update several times, I decided to wait a bit until I could make sure that my article was not obsolete the next day. I am glad I did.Identive is indeed entering 2014 leaner and meaner having sold several non-core, slow-growth assets in recent weeks. The company has not made official announcements about these transactions, but a December 26, 2013 filing provides some details and figures that suggest that the total compensation that Identive will receive could be around $12 million. I expect that when these agreements are signed, sealed, and delivered the company will make formal announcements discussing details of those transactions including the potential implications on revenues and income. The 3Q 2013 earnings release stated that revenues from the divested divisions will range from $5 million to $6 million.In addition to making swift progress on the divestiture end, Identive has been busy streamlining its complex operations in line with Identive's key guiding principles established by recently named CEO Jason Hart: ""Simplification, Focus and Growth."" There is clear evidence that the management team established by Mr. Hart have the passion and energy to create long-term value for shareholders, customers, and company employees.The latest move, announced on December 27, 2013, was the relocation of the company's corporate finance group from its Europe hub in Ismaning, Germany to its corporate headquarters in California. Along with this move, Brian Nelson has been appointed chief financial officer and secretary of the company, effective December 20, 2013. CEO Hart said, ""We continue to make significant progress in simplifying Identive's organizational structure, lowering our cost base and transforming the business from a group of individual silos into a single, unified company focused on delivering identity and trust solutions for the enterprise, consumer and government markets, which is our core strength. Moving our corporate finance activities to the U.S. is a natural step that allows us to centralize all our corporate functions and bring together key members of the management team.""Another significant December announcement was confirmation that NASDAQ had granted INVE an additional 180 days, or until June 9, 2014, to regain compliance with the minimum bid price rule by maintaining a minimum closing bid price of at least $1.00 for ten consecutive business days. I believe that fear of a potential delisting was one of the reasons why the stock dipped momentarily to under 50c in mid-December. The stock price started to recover after this December 18, 2013 announcement.After the divestitures, Identive will continue expanding its broad range of RFID and NFC readers and embedded modules, in addition to an extensive array of RFID/NFC passive transponders and tags. Identive's RFID and NFC products enable a wide range of contactless applications including access, payment, ticketing and asset tracking. Adoption of mobile phone-based point-of-sale, ticketing, security and loyalty systems based on NFC technology is accelerating while contactless technology is proliferating in new applications from closed loop embedded RFID based systems for video gaming platforms, to medical device tracking, to anti-counterfeiting, to field maintenance management and reverse logistics.In the company's 3Q 2013 earnings report, CEO Hart stated: ""Our trusted NFC consumer products enjoyed increasing demand with the popularity of NFC enabled toys for video games. We expect that this trend will continue into Q4 and throughout 2014. Our overall sales backlog has continued to increase and we entered Q4 with committed orders and accounts receivables that represent nearly 40% of our annual revenues, which speaks to the fundamental strength of our sales offerings and pipeline for our trusted solutions.""Market research firm Deloitte projects that 300 million NFC-enabled cellphones, tablets and e-readers will be sold in 2013, and Identive is a pioneer in the advancement of complementary infrastructure-based solutions. This figure is expected to triple by 2015.Another high-growth area with a lot of promise is the company's cloud-based Identity as a Service (IaaS) offering. The company reported several new orders for cloud-based services in 3Q 2013 including a three-year contract to issue and manage trusted credentials for an international government's healthcare program and the expansion of activities with a U.S. based Fortune 100 company. Cloud-based revenues are high-margin and recurrent. Identive is one of the pioneers in this technological area.Companies with presence in high-growth identity, NFC, RFID technological areas are being rewarded handsomely by the market, and it's just a matter of time when INVE's valuation will increase from its lowly 0.45 times sales to larger multiples. Take competitor SuperCom Ltd. (NASDAQ:SPCB) for instance. SPCB's valuation has increased by over 1000% since last year, and much of the gain was after the recent acquisition of On Track Innovations Ltd. SmartID (OTIV) division. But even with the addition of SmartID, SPCB's revenues will only be ¼ of INVE's. But SPCB is a trading at a whopping 7.6 price to sales ratio or 16 times higher than INVE's. This highlights the potential significant upside of INVE's share price if management executes a successful transformation.Value investors are starting to appreciate the potential upside of INVE's share price as reflected by the higher volumes and higher prices in the last two weeks. I fully expect that INVE will regain NSDAQ compliance before the June 9, 2014 deadline. I believe maverick entrepreneur CEO Jason Hart has the drive and passion and now the right team to take INVE to fair-valuation territory of $3 - $4 after a couple of strong quarters in Fiscal 2014.I think it's worth repeating that INVE's CEO Hart, 42, is a 25-year veteran of the technology industry with a substantial track record of innovation and success, including more than 20 years leading security companies. Hart joined Identive in 2011 following the acquisition of idOnDemand, a company he co-founded that pioneered the delivery of smart card-based identity solutions via a cloud service. Prior to idOnDemand, he served as CEO and director of ActivIdentity, a publicly-traded provider of identity assurance and strong authentication solutions. Hart joined Actividentity in 2005 through the acquisition of Protocom Development Systems, Inc., an identity management software security business that he founded and led as CEO. He has been listed in Business Week's Top CEOs Under 40 and was named Ernst & Young 'Entrepreneur of the Year' (2002).I believe that INVE is a compelling value at 69c/share, even with potential risks associated with facing a June 9, 2014 delisting. INVE is a moderate risk/high potential investment. Long-term, the picture is even more attractive as more and more global companies of all sizes are likely to adopt Identive's SaaS/cloud-based ID solutions. These are high-margin recurrent revenues that could turn Identive into a must-have stock in years to come. Investors considering buying INVE stock, or any other stock, should always read carefully the risks and uncertainties as spelled out in the company's 10-K and 10-Q filings.Disclosure: I am long INVE.

2422145,25268,2014-08-14T08:30:40-04:00,"Late last year, Identiv brought in an entirely new senior management team to turn company around.In Q4 2013 and Q1 2014, the company's new management took steps to reorganize its business structure.Identiv's growth strategy is to partner with multiple large companies to unlock shareholder value. After listening to earnings call, I believe company will be acquired at some point in time.Company Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Jason Hart believes the company to be worth $400M now, but has not realized this valuation because of missteps by prior management.","Written by Scott MatusowYesterday after the bell, Identiv Inc (NASDAQ:INVE) reported its Q2, 2014 earnings. As I have remarked previously, the company is under an entirely new senior management team, replacing the old team that lost trust with the market and executed poorly.New management has shown strong progress in restructuring the company's business model as revenues have increased. I had the pleasure of being on the conference call, with CEO Jason Hart answering a few of my questions. I highly encourage small cap investors to listen to the call as I believe there is a very promising investment opportunity here.Some highlights of Identiv's call includes:Identiv is extremely well positioned by the injection of innovation and has been able to partner with some heavy hitting strategic partners. These include some of the larger gaming vendors who have implemented digital tech into their product lines.According to CEO Hart,Hart went on to mention,Hart went on to mention that Identiv is far ahead of its competitors in innovation. This key is important as it's likely companies such as Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) will consolidate the ""Internet of Things ((IoT))"" via acquiring smaller companies with top innovation like Identiv.I agree with Hart when he says Identiv should be a $400M company, and I strongly believe he will ""coach"" the Identiv team to at least that valuation or higher for acquisition in due time.I got a strong sense that this will be the end result for Identiv from carefully listening to the call. Hart knows better than to try to go it alone which would mandate that he hires far too many people for Identiv not only to manage, but to commit capital to. In fact, Hart expressly mentions this factor on the earnings call,By partnering with multiple large companies, when the time is right, Identiv is likely to enjoy multiple bids for the company. I find Hart's strategy here to be a very smart one. Companies like Identiv that are well-managed and posses cutting edge tech are virtually certain to be taken out by the larger players in this field who can lever this tech in the IoT market, estimated to be over $7 trillion by 2020.As I remarked above, Identiv cannot at this time reveal its partnerships for many reasons. The most pertinent being that a few years ago, prior management issued a press release when it partnered with Google for providing some security for ""Google Wallet."" As a result of this, Identiv stock tripled in one trading session, from a pre reverse split adjusted $20 to $60 a share.My sources tell me that Google was upset with the company press releasing its deal without checking with them first. Because of this past event, Identiv is in the process of rebuilding the trust that prior management appeared to have abused.At some point in the not too distant future, Identiv will likely be able to release more in this regard as it regains and builds trust, and/or its partners will press release on these partnerships -- at least in part.Strong sources tell me that Identiv is working with The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) in regards to Disney's Infinity line of toys and its new Magicban. Additionally, my research along with my sources indicate to me that the company is likely directly and/or indirectly involved with Google, Cisco, and Intel. Also, it's likely the company is involved with Apple via its secure mobile payment platform in partnership With First Data, a private company based in Atlanta.The partnership would be involved with Identiv's patent # US 20130061303 A1, ""Authentication System and Method in a Contact-less Environment."" This is identical to the secure One Time Payment (OTP) (contact-less) that Tim Cook was referring to in the recent unveiling of Iphone 6, and its ability to process mobile payments via Near Field Communication (contact-less).Furthermore, Identiv is likely working with, or will work with companies such as MasterCard (MA), Visa (NYSE:V), and American Express (NYSE:AXP) to further implement this technology for a more secure authentication and payment system moving forward.I like how Identiv is managed, and I especially like Jason Hart. He does not pump, yet he sets a conservative and positive tone, and is optimistically cautious. He is well-aware of prior management's mistakes and is setting a tone of conservative guidance -- under promise and over deliver.Compare Identiv's earnings call to another company I have written about before, Volcano Corp. (NASDAQ:VOLC).When StockMatusow team member Michael Kovar and I wrote about Volcano, sources informed us that there was strong interest to acquire the company. At the time, the stock was trading for around $18 a share. Since then, Volcano's stock price has plummeted on poor earnings.On Volcano's earnings call, I mostly heard a lot of excuses and a tone that would likely aggravate even the late Mahatma Gandhi. Subsequently, the following Monday, the company engaged in a conference call laying out its plan to ""turn things around.""However, this plan was laid out in general terms, with nothing specific that would be construed as a positive. As a result, the stock sold off even more, and currently trades around $12.50. This represents a large decline from the $18 level it was at a short time ago.For lack of a better and nicer description, Volcano management stinks and should be removed by shareholders as soon as possible (along with the board of directors) before they further entrench themselves, in my strongest opinion.Good and honest management matters most, because a great horse will not win a race, unless it's being guided by a great jockey. I think Jason Hart is a great jockey, and believe Identiv has the right product at the right time, and think the company is far ahead in making in-roads into the IoT segment.It's my opinion Identiv is a strong buy with a one year price target of $50.I arrive at this valuation based on guidance from the company at $80 to $90M in revenues for this year. This does not consider the explosive growth in the IoT segment, so the revenue numbers moving forward are likely to be higher.Accounting for sales of $85M and using a very conservative 5x sales (10x, and is common for this segment) based on company guidance of neutral to positive EBITDA this year, valuates Identiv at a $400M market cap. This is divided by the outstanding shares of 8M = $50 a share.I'm also expecting an analyst upgrade to come shortly and potentially additional analyst coverage, along with Identiv to ""road show"" the company beginning next month and continuing into next year. Additionally, Hart will likely be meeting with institutional firms, and I believe many of them are likely to make an investment here.Overall, I feel this is a very good opportunity and again, I highly encourage investors to carefully listen to the earnings call -- you may very well like what you hear.Disclosure: The author is long INVE.

With the recent revelations of the Heartbleed Bug and the proliferation of connected devices, Identiv is poised to benefit from securing information in both the physical and digital worlds.Given Identiv's small size and large market opportunity as a provider of trust solutions in a connected world, discerning investors should consider Identiv's ambitious turnaround that is beginning to yield results. While Identiv shares sold off precipitously over the last several weeks, the market appears to be disregarding many important developments that are taking place at Identiv.The developments include:The BusinessThe first thing you have to ask yourself as an investor is, why does this opportunity exist? The answer is undoubtedly that Identiv was terribly mismanaged for many, many years. The declining stock quote illustrates the market's collective recognition of Identiv's value destruction.INVE data by YChartsIf we look across recent financial data, Identiv has not turned in a GAAP profit since 2006. And in that year, Identiv earned only a slim $1 million profit on $33 million in revenue, or about a 3% net profit margin. Those are not the kind of results that inspire confidence.The culprit behind the lackluster performance, like it usually is, was expensive acquisitions, which led to an unwieldy corporate structure and too much fixed overhead. Over that time, G&A expenses averaged in the 25% to 35% range, far too high for Identiv to post profits.Given that backdrop, it is easy to see why Identiv is priced where it is today. However, the market appears to not be picking up on the significant turnaround in progress that the new management team is now embarking on and the bullish news coming out of the recent earnings call.The TurnaroundIn Q3 2013, Identiv ousted its former CEO and installed Mr. Hart, who provided a 12-point plan to turn around Identiv.While still early in the process, investors were provided with an indication of Identiv's restructuring efforts when the company reported in its Q1 results that G&A expenses were down 21%, representing 17% of sales (far lower than historical levels). In my view, G&A spend will continue to be contained as management rationalizes its cost structure, and I expect for G&A to settle into the 10% range over the next couple of years. Note that Identiv is not providing specific guidance on G&A as a percent of sales for 2014, given the many moving parts of its rationalization effort.Further efforts to improve margins, including consolidating production facilities and other back office functions in order to optimize utilization, will take the balance of 2014 to complete. Mr. Hart commented on the earnings call (transcript courtesy of Seeking Alpha):While Identiv entered 2014 as a leaner enterprise, I believe that 2015 could be an inflection year for the Identiv as it completes the restructuring to rationalize the cost base and ramps sales from key partnerships entered in Q1.Growth Through PartnershipsWhen a ~$55-million market cap business partners with a $200-billion telecom giant, I pay attention. While there hasn't been a press release concerning this matter, Mr. Hart indicated on the Q1 earnings call that Identiv has entered into a partnership with Verizon, which has already yielded incremental results -- ""a new tangible order early in Q2.""While it is difficult to estimate the size of the order, the products/services that are subject to the partnership and the near-term impact of the Verizon relationship, it is probable that the partnership will deliver meaningful revenue growth and benefit Identiv asymmetrically.In addition to the Verizon deal, Identiv also expanded its distribution platform by partnering with the ""largest security distributor in the United States."" This partnership covers Identiv's credential products, which include its ""Internet of Things"" RFID tags and NFC solutions. The credential segment represents 44% of Identiv's total sales, and is scaling quickly, with revenues up 36% year-over-year as Identiv sees strong demand for various Internet of Things applications, including electronic gaming and transit ticketing. (Source: 10-Q)Turning now to the premises (also its highest-margin) business, which focuses on physical access control, Identiv saw a significant slowdown (down 30% year-over-year). Part of the reason for reduced demand is frankly that Identiv's products were not up to snuff for its end-users (particularly governmental customers) and various compliance standards. Mr. Hart candidly discussed the issues in the premises business, indicated that Identiv released a new product to meet end-user standards and is in the early innings of reestablishing growth in its highest-margin business.This kind of candid commentary on earnings calls should be given praise, and I believe this sort of behavior will ultimately help Mr. Hart restore Identiv's credibility in the marketplace and on Wall Street. The new premises solution is called uTrust, and provides integrated physical access and IT access control based on a scalable and open standard architecture.When a return to growth is expected for the highest-margin premises business, new sales leads from Verizon and a significantly growing sales channel related to credentialing for ""Internet of Things"" applications is combined with a lower cost base, 2015 could be an inflection year for Identiv, which could see significant earnings leverage and, ultimately, a higher valuation for Identiv shares.At the current $55 million valuation, it appears like there are a lot of levers and optionality embedded to drive shares higher over the coming years. Now that Identiv has also addressed its liquidity issues (discussed below), further downside risk should be limited as the various restructuring activities take hold and as Identiv explores the global markets with its new OEM and distribution partners.In terms of valuation, investors are only required to pay 0.6x sales (using management's midpoint 2014 guidance between $80 and $90 million) at the current quote. Relative to comparables in this space, including SuperCom (NASDAQ:SPCB) and On Track Innovations (OTIV), Identiv trades at much lower valuation in terms of sales while it works to return to profitability.Given the revelations of the partnerships and the progress made by Identiv management in its turnaround efforts, I think Identiv's underlying fundamentals are set to improve over the next couple of years and the value proposition will be less obscured by the financial noise surrounding the turnaround. Moreover, the distressed valuation doesn't take into account Identiv's improved liquidity position from the recent transaction with Opus Bank.Other CatalystsIn addition to the strategic partnerships, Identiv also closed a $20 million round of financing that will significantly reduce its cash interest costs going forward by replacing an onerous 11% interest debt secured from Hercules Technology Capital with a 6% interest credit facility from Opus Bank with better payment terms. This should provide management the necessary working capital to effect the rest of its turnaround and lower cash interest costs, thereby preserving shareholder value by not issuing new shares. While Identiv did file an S-3 to issue up to $50 million in equity securities, I understand the S-3 was filed solely for the purpose that its prior shelf was expiring and that management does not intend to raise equity capital at this time. The fact that Opus Bank was willing to lend on the terms that it did (6% interest) speaks to the resiliency of Identiv's new-and-improved operating model.Finally, as it relates to Nasdaq compliance, it appears likely that Identiv will have to effect a reverse-split to get above the $1 minimum bid requirement. The proposed split will be voted on at the May 22, 2014 shareholder meeting, and I expect it will pass. Once the Nasdaq compliance issue is handled, this could be a catalyst to move shares higher, because Identiv could become investable by institutions that are not able to invest in shares under some certain dollar threshold or with a delisting risk.ConclusionMake no mistake about Identiv. It is a ""workout"" situation which I believe is in the early innings of yielding positive results for shareholders.There still exists significant opacity in the financials and a number of hurdles to jump, including restoring growth in the premises business and further rationalizing the cost base. But Identiv is levered to two attractive themes -- security and the ""Internet of Things"" -- and is now backed by Verizon. Because of that, I think these shares represent a compelling opportunity, but must be sized appropriately.Given all the moving parts, execution risk does remain. However, if Mr. Hart gets it right, I think Identiv shares have multi-bagger upside potential over the next couple of years, coupled with relatively muted risk of permanent capital impairment given the recent Verizon partnership and improved liquidity position.Getting there, though, will be a bumpy ride and not for the faint of heart.Disclosure: I am long INVE.

1811502,54972,2013-11-06T10:37:31-05:00,,"Indentive Group (NASDAQ:INVE) is a global provider of Secure ID solutions utilizing RFID, NFC, Smart Card, and cloud technologies. The company's extensive IP portfolio in these technology areas enables it to deliver robust end-to-end solutions for multiple high-growth end markets. The company is well positioned in key established Secure ID markets including physical and cyber security, as well as emerging hypergrowth technology areas such as SaaS-based ID systems and a myriad of NFC applications.INVE will report its 3Q 2013 financial results after hours on Thursday, November 7, 2013. I expect 3Q to be in-line with analyst's estimates. I also expect strong guidance for 4Q 2013, calling for record quarterly revenues approaching $30 million. This will be the first conference call led by the recently appointed CEO, Jason Hart. When announcing Hart's promotion on September 3, 2013, Ayman S. Ashour, Chairman of the Indentive Board stated, ""Jason is an experienced leader with the skill and acumen to accelerate Identive's focus towards the cloud and mobility era. His ability to deliver innovative technology solutions and profitable growth is key to the company's success going forward.""Hart, 42, is a 25-year veteran of the technology industry with a substantial track record of innovation and success, including more than 20 years leading security companies. Hart joined Identive in 2011 following the acquisition of idOnDemand, a company he co-founded that pioneered the delivery of smart card-based identity solutions via a cloud service. Prior to idOnDemand, he served as CEO and director of ActivIdentity, a publicly-traded provider of identity assurance and strong authentication solutions. Hart joined Actividentity in 2005 through the acquisition of Protocom Development Systems, Inc., an identity management software security business that he founded and led as CEO. He has been listed in Business Week's Top CEOs Under 40 and was named Ernst & Young 'Entrepreneur of the Year' (2002).Indentive Group's advanced technologies are gaining market share in several high-growth areas including contact and contactless smart cards, tokens embedded in mobile phones and tablets, NFC cashless payments and identity as a service, or SaaS or cloud-based identity management solutions aimed at expand its global reach.Sounds impressive? Well, it is. In fact, INVE is not your typical 60c/share company. Revenues for 2013 are expected to top $100 million and to grow to about $115 million, with the company turning profitable in 2014. Probably the primary reason for the low valuation is the uncertainty and the negative effect of the U. S. Federal Government sequester. The government sequester is expected to cause a $7- $10 million hit on 2013 revenues. Surprisingly, the market has not rewarded the company for exceeding the negative effect of its government business by delivering significant growth in its ID Products segment which grew 35% year-over-year in 2Q 2013.The significant 2Q 2013 ID Products growth was due to high demand for NFC transponders for machine-to-machine applications, electronic games, and mobile phone-based applications. The company expects a significant demand for its NFC products in the second half of 2013 for applications in games compatible with Xbox, Playstations, etc. In 2Q 2013 the company reported that they shipped 46 million transponders bringing 1H 2013 shipments on par with full year 2012 shipments.Indentive has announced several large contracts during 3Q 2013 ended September 30, 2013 in places such as Germany, Singapore, and San Diego (security for the newly redesigned Terminal 2 at San Diego International Airport, adding to over a dozen general aviation airports in the U.S. for which Identive is providing integrated physical access and security). During the quarter, the company showcased new access control solutions for business and government at the ASIS International show in Chicago, Illinois September 24-27. The recent incident at LAX has reminded everyone security can never be taken for granted anywhere and anytime.Indentive has made several acquisitions over the last few years and it is just starting to reap the benefits from those investments. The company has quietly beat previous years' GAAP results for 3 straight quarters after 6 consecutive quarterly declines. This is even more remarkable considering that this year it had to deal with the adverse consequences of the government sequester. Revenues for the last three years have been relatively flat (103 million in 2011, $94.6 million in 2012, and projected $100 million for 2013) after experiencing significant yearly growth the previous 3 years. However, 2013 is believed to be an inflection point since new technology growth is expected to accelerate making the sequester factor less relevant. The analyst covering the stock expects 2014 record revenues of $115 million and for the company to post its first yearly profit in the history of the company.Early indications for 3Q 2013 to be reported on November 7 are encouraging. The company has seen increased orders from the government in July and August was looking even better up to the day when 2Q 2013 results were announced. As mentioned before, the company is shipping record volumes of NFC products, a trend that is expected to continue and accelerate. Also mentioned in 2Q earnings is that Indentive entered 3Q 2013 on positive momentum as represented by a record $27 million backlog. Guidance for the quarter is $23 to $25 million revenues compared to $22.9 million the year-ago quarter.During the 2Q 2013 conference call the then CEO Ayman Ashour implied that he expects 4Q 2013 revenues in the $30 million area, or an all-time record despite the weakness of its business with the Federal Government. Mr. Ashour also implied that the worst-case scenario for breakeven is about $24 - $25 million quarterly revenues, further stating ""So once we get above that critical revenue level, the leverage is considerable."" All of this suggests to me that 4Q could turn out to be a blockbuster quarter.One negative factor which could account for the lack of the current interest, and potential fear for not investing in the stock is dilution. The company announced a PIPE deal in August whereby they sold 8.35 million shares at 85c. However, the company contends that this cash infusion is necessary to fund the working capital that will enable the company to capitalize in significant revenue growth in the second half of 2013.I believe that INVE is a compelling value at 64c/share, even with potential risks associated with recent dilution, and those related to meeting NASDAQ listing requirements. On the positive side, the significant growth in all its product lines except the government-related Access Control and Security business makes INVE a moderate risk/high potential investment. Long-term, the picture is even more attractive as more and more global companies of all sizes are likely to adopt Indentive's SaaS/cloud-based ID solutions. These are high-margin recurrent revenues that could turn Indentive into a must-have stock in years to come.Disclosure: I am long INVE. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

265515,24414,2011-04-26T13:14:58-04:00,,"This article is a follow-up to an earlier one I wrote on April 12 on Identive’s (NASDAQ:INVE) ""Exclusive"" Pact with Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) announced two weeks ago. Identive Group subsidiary ACiG Technology had been selected as the exclusive supplier of near field communication (NFC) RFID stickers for the roll out of Google’s marketing campaign for Google Places in Austin, Texas. The stock reacted very strongly to that news, rising from $2.66 at close on the day prior to the news to an intra-day high of $5.90 the next day. Since then, it is still up strongly closing at $3.48 yesterday for a two-week gain of almost 30%, but it is also down significantly from the recent $5.90 high.In the last two weeks, INVE has issued even more positive news. Last week, on Monday the 18th, the company announced that one of its subsidiaries, SCM Microsystems, won an initial order for 10,000 German eHealth terminals to support the launch of the electronic health program in Germany that would support the deployment of more than 80 million electronic health insurance cards to German citizens. Today the company announced that another subsidiary, Hirsch, had delivered an access control solution to New York City’s first supportive housing project to be Silver-LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certified. The company explained that Hirsch’s access control system would provide security for residents and also track and share occupancy data with the building's energy management system, and building systems such as heating and lighting would be automatically turned on or off as residents enter and leave their apartments, reducing energy use and providing protection against appliance-related fires and other accidents.The company has not given any dollar amounts for any of these projects, but of the three only the German eHealth terminals is a regular multi-system order. The ACiG project, although ""exclusive,"" is currently only for the roll-out of Google Places in Austin, Texas, and today’s Hirsch project also seems to be a one-time demonstration project for its technology. Of these three, only the German order, which is only the first order per the company for implementation of the German eHealthcare system, can be estimated. Taking say a range of $100-300 per eHealth terminal, the 10,000 unit order would generate $1 million to 3 million; and it can be assumed that there would be more orders coming as the German eHealthcare system is rolled out and possibly even more were the system successful and sold to more countries.What is probably more important than just the individual dollar amounts of each of these early contracts is probably the implementation of the company’s technologies in building the world’s signature company in secure identification-based technologies. The Identive Group of companies includes seven subsidiaries, each of which deals with different elements of creating that ecosystem. Of these, the first five are product-based companies and the last two are management services based companies:As may be evident, the company has a comprehensive approach to the market for secure identification-based technologies, a trend that is gaining momentum as also explained in my article earlier today on, “White House Sponsored 'Identity Ecosystem' Initiative Provides Investment Opportunities.” Of course, INVE addresses markets much wider than just what the Identity Ecosystem addresses as it also includes livestock and asset tracking among others.Perhaps, the correct way to think about this company is in terms of a ""speculative"" play on an emerging market that will gain momentum in the months and years ahead. The stock may continue to be volatile as there is rightfully two different ways of looking at it; one in terms of the ""pure"" numbers that it is and can deliver in the short-term, and the other in terms of its promise in being a significant player in an emerging market. As usual, one should only put ""speculative"" dollars at work here, as the future of this company is far from certain, but at the same time it also holds promise.Credit: Historical fundamentals including operating metrics and stock ownership information were derived using I-Metrix by Edgar Online, Zacks Investment Research, Thomson Reuters and Briefing.com.

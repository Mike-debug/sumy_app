4330657,104350,2020-03-09T12:39:23-04:00,"ISD is yielding 8.54%, after several boosts over the last year.The latest discount of 8.61% is much less than its 1-year average of -11.56%, this could be explained by a recovering NAV.The discount contraction could also be explained by a changing mandate the fund went through at the beginning of 2019.","Co-produced by Stanford ChemistPGIM High Yield Bond Fund (ISD) enjoyed quite the total market returns in 2019. The fund put up a 28.40% total market return as compared to its total NAV return of 17.47%. That can be explained by the fund boosting its distribution twice in 2019, as well as a mandate change that happened in March of 2019. With this type of return, we also saw a steep drop in the fund's average historical discounts. However, there may still be opportunity left as we see an increasing NAV for the fund and high distribution coverage. ISD also provides diversified exposure by utilization of a wide selection of sectors.ISD is similar to Western Asset High Yield Defined Opportunity Fund Inc. (HYI), except for two key differences. ISD doesn't utilize a term structure like HYI and ISD also utilizes leverage, whereas HYI does not. After recently covering HYI, it is time to take a look at the updated report for ISD as they released around the same time.ISD ""seeks to provide a high level of current income by investing primarily in below-investment-grade fixed income instruments."" Also known as high yield or junk bonds. These types of bonds are issued by companies that are smaller and less financially stable relative to their generally larger counterparts. They will tend to be a bit more volatile during periods of panic. However, ISD holds 239 issues as of December 31st, 2019. The fund also holds issues from 31 different sectors and subsectors. This should provide quite the diversification should we get continued uncertainties going forward. Of course, the latest being the Coronavirus that has given the market quite the volatility over the last several weeks.The fund is a healthy size at about $742 million in total managed assets, composed of $180 million in leverage. This works out to the fund being leveraged at 24.25% levered. Adding leverage to a CEF can help boost overall performance. However, it can also do the opposite when times aren't so good - creating more volatility and further drawdowns. This can be compared to HYI, which utilizes no leverage. If an investor is sensitive to leverage, they may find HYI more appealing.The fund's latest reported expense ratio is 1.15%, which I believe is quite reasonable for an actively managed fund. When we include leverage expenses this climbs to 2.09%. The average interest rate on the $180 million outstanding loans for the period was 2.84%. As expected with the Fed cutting interest rates through 2019, this was a decrease from the average interest rate throughout their fiscal 2019. For their fiscal 2019, they reported average interest rates of 3.11%. I would suspect that this dips even a bit further going forward when the interest rate decreases are fully factored in.Prior to March 8th, 2019, the fund had a mandate of investing higher - but still junk-rated - bond issuances. They also scrapped the mandate of investing in shorter duration and maturity bonds. This allows them greater flexibility. After the announcement, the fund had started to recover its downward trend since inception.This was also helped by a rally in bond prices overall as investors are searching for reliable income. As the higher-rated treasuries and munis have also been rising over the last year - this has pushed investors lower down in the credit spectrum to find yields.Reflected above is the chart for the U.S. 10-year Treasury's rate. We can see a noticeable dive as the Fed had begun cutting rates throughout 2019 based on uncertainties of U.S.-China trade wars. We now have the Coronavirus that has been adding much more uncertainty going forward. Though, it has prodded the Fed to project keeping current rates maintained throughout 2020.ISD is held in our Tactical Income- 100 portfolio at the CEF/ETF Income Laboratory. The fund is currently rated as a 'Hold.' This is based on the fund's current discount of 8.61%. We would be looking to change this to a 'Buy' rating if the fund reached a 12% discount. Though, I have serious reservations that we would see this level without some great volatility in the broader market as a whole. This is especially true as we mentioned that the Fed intends to maintain current interest rates going forward.Briefly touching on the performance for ISD as we already mentioned above, ISD had quite the phenomenal 2019. The fund currently trades for $14.76 per share, with a NAV of $16.15 - good for a steep discount of 8.61%. This is at a time when many funds are trading at even tighter ranges and we have to be selective with the funds worth investing in. With that being said, ISD shows a 1-year average discount of 11.56%. Which is, in fact, steeper than its 5-year average discount that sits at 10.62%. That is interesting to point out as we have witnessed the fund's contraction in its discount since implementing its investment changes last March.(Source - CEFConnect)Over the longer-term, the fund has put up respectable numbers. However, the fund hasn't gone through a severe recession like 2008's GFC. The fund's inception date is 4/26/2012. Though that does mean the fund had gone through the junk bond crisis of 2015 and survived.(Source - CEFConnect)We also have to remember that since the fund's mandate change in early 2019, the past returns should be lower than going forward. At least this is in theory if we had the same projected 5-year performance going forward than the last 5-year period. This is due to the fund extending maturity and duration. Also playing a role is that the fund can go lower down the credit spectrum that should garner potentially higher yields for the fund. Increasing the risk for the fund could also see more volatility than the fund has previously witnessed too.Another factor that probably played a role in the funds contracting discount is the fact that in 2019 we saw the fund increase its distribution twice. The most recent was on August 26th, 2019, which saw a small boost from $0.10 to the current $0.105. That small increase was good for a 5% boost in overall income for shareholders.The larger 17.6% increase came on March 19th, 2019. This was in connection with the fund switching their investing mandate. With that increase, we saw the distribution go from $0.085 to the prior $0.10.The current monthly rate of $0.105 is actually declared on a quarterly basis. That means an investor knows at least what to expect for 3-months at a time. The current rate is also good for a yield of 8.54%. The NAV yield for ISD is 7.80% due to its attractive discount.Even with the fund's distribution raises, we are receiving a lower rate than at inception. However, shares traded higher too as we noted the declining share price basically since inception.(Source - CEFConnect)With that in mind, I wouldn't anticipate a distribution again after looking at the current numbers. The Semi-Annual Report they released for the period ending November 30th, 2019, did show an increase from their fiscal year-end of May 31st, 2019 - based on a projected annualized basis.For the end of their fiscal 2019, we saw they reported $30,112,520 in net investment income. Now for their latest report, we see NII come in at $18,096,350. If they are able to maintain a level rate for another 6-month period we would see this come to $36,192,700 or a tremendous increase of 20.2% in NII!However, even with this significant boost, they paid total distributions to shareholders of $20,452,885. Since this was in November and for a 6-month period prior to November, this would actually be a bit more going forward.(Source - Semi-Annual Report)This gives us NII coverage of 88.48%. This isn't the worst as the fund has been able to capitalize on increasing bond prices. However, this isn't sustainable over the long-term like we might anticipate with an equity fund that can pretty regularly rely on capital gains for paying distributions. Again too, this coverage could drop a bit more too if we calculated out the current distribution rate for the full period.This is an area we will want to keep an eye on as it is quite important that NII can grow from here. Although, over the last 1-year period we did witness a growing NAV that should help the fund maintain the current level. So, I don't necessarily see a cause for concern that there could be a distribution cut soon either.We can briefly breakdown the current holdings of the fund as we alluded to above, the number of holdings and sectors. Additionally, lucky for us, they provide a fact sheet for us ending December 31st, 2019. So we don't have to rely on their November Semi-Annual Report.First, we can take a look at the largest issuers that ISD invests in. We actually see quite a bit of the fund top issuers changed from prior coverage on the fund.(Source - Fact Sheet)With that in mind, we can also see that the fund has expanded its total holdings to 239. Before this, they held 216 positions. I'm not sure if that will help further diversify the fund or not, as already having 200+ holdings is quite a bit to keep track of. Although, they must have seen some relative bargains to take advantage of. Further, we see that not position holds over a 1.9% allocation, this was the case too when we last covered the fund.(Source - Fact Sheet)The fund's changes in issuers have also been reflected in a changing sector allocation. However, we still see significant diversification broadly speaking to looking at the various sectors the fund invests in. Prior, they held the largest allocation to the telecom sector. This has since shifted to energy taking the top stop. We definitely know that the energy equities space had become quite the value - this apparent shift has also seemed to bleed over into the debt markets. Of course, we now have seen significant pressure on oil and natural gas prices since the Coronavirus has been adding uncertainties.One other area I want to focus on is the credit quality compared to the fund's last report, to see if they are moving deeper into junk territory.(Source - Fact Sheet)Here we see the fund hasn't really changed its overall credit quality, even after making several changes since the July 31st, 2019 reporting. A full 6-months later and we still see the highest allocation to B rated names. Though, it had been 46% of the assets and now comes in at 44%, quite a small change in the grand scheme of things. BBB saw a drop of allocation from 7.3% to 4.8%. For BB-rated we have a rise to 37% from 35.8%. CCC-rated debt has a small uptick from 9.7% to 10.2%.The largest increase was actually in their cash component, the fund held 0.5% in cash and this has now climbed to 3%. This isn't anything too significant either, even at a 2.5% differential. It is unlikely to change the fund in a significant manner going forward.ISD has witnessed a contraction in its overall discount over the past 1-year period. However, several factors helped to see this through. These contributors include the mandate change of the fund in 2019, rallying bonds in 2019 and distribution boost throughout 2019.While the fund has contracted its discount, I still feel like ISD is a relative value at an 8.61% discount. At this discount, shareholders receive an 8.54% distribution yield. At the same time, the fund's NAV only has to earn 7.80%. The latest numbers they reported are worth mentioning that its coverage is slightly less than 90%. However, the rising NAV and underlying positions have helped offset this lack of coverage which has allowed the NAV to rise. So, while it is not a cause for panic, we will be keeping an eye on the fund's coverage going forward. We would eventually like to see coverage go to 100%+."
4294131,104350,2019-09-30T09:09:26-04:00,"ISD increased its distribution, and this is the second time in six months.The fund was formerly known as PGIM Short Duration High Yield Fund, and this changed in March 2019.Along with the name change to PGIM High Yield Fund, the investment strategy changed, dropping the ""short duration"" mandate.","This article was first released on September 2nd, 2019.The PGIM High Yield Bond Fund (ISD), formerly known as PGIM Short Duration High Yield Fund, invests in below-investment-grade bonds, more familiarly called high yield junk bonds. These types of bonds are issued by lower-quality companies that have increased risk of defaults, should their financial troubles intensify. The benefit for investors is the higher yields that are presenting with taking these additional risks. Another benefit for an investor that may invest in ISD is the fact that they can gain a wider diversification of holdings. Instead of investing in just one junk bond, an investor can gain access to about 216 underlying issues by investing in ISD. This severely decreases the risks associated with an individual company going bust - due to spreading the risks out over many companies and governments.High yield junk bonds have unique characteristics by not necessarily correlating with their other investment-grade bond counterparts. They have shown to correlate more closely with equities over a period of time. However, it isn't a perfect correlation. Therefore, it could potentially be viewed as a greater diversifier within bonds itself. This presents an investor with yet another diversifier for their portfolio. This correlation is due primarily to the fact that since these companies are more reliant on a strong economy to survive, they end up folding when the economy goes into a slowdown or recessionary mode. Bear in mind though, they still offer some protection associated with bonds. Due to the fact that bonds are still senior in line to common stock during a company bankruptcy.ISD's investment strategy changed earlier this year. The change scrapped the mandate of the fund from shorter-term issuances and added more flexibility overall. Thus, the fund's name change made sense. As the fund was no longer having a shorter-term focus, it dropped the ""short duration"" portion of their name. During this time, it announced a distribution increase too. This would be the first distribution increase after years of cuts since inception. Now, we have just received another distribution increase from the fund. The main cause of the increases is most certainly the fact that the fund can achieve higher yields on the underlying issues. The longer the term of a bond, the higher the compensation that is required to be paid out to an investor. This is because the risk is increased. As terms extend for bond issuances, the risks of interest rate increases (or decreases) affect the potential values of the bonds going forward. Hence, the longer the term, the higher the risks for such interest rate variables to occur.Again, this could potentially be viewed as even another diversifier for an investor. Not only are we supposed to look at different asset classes that move in different manners, but within these asset classes, we need to make sure we are diversified as well. This is whether we are looking at stocks or bonds. With stocks, investors are generally looking for exposure to the broad array of sectors that are available. Well, bonds are similar, with the addition of wanting to make sure you have exposure to different maturities and durations. Maturity means when the bond expires or ""matures."" While duration measures the sensitivity of the portfolio due to changes in interest rates.Overall, this was an important change for the fund, and I hope investors were aware of such change. The higher risks associated with an already higher risk junk fund changes the investments going forward considerably.For ISD, the fund has an investment objective of ""seeking to provide a high level of current income."" Its strategy, ""by investing primarily in below-investment-grade fixed income instruments.""The fund has an inception date of 04/29/2012. The fund utilizes leverage of approximately 24.5%, with $733.885 million in assets, as of 8/30/2019. The fund has an expense ratio of 1.16%, this being quite reasonable, in my opinion. And when including interest expenses, we arrive at a total expense ratio of 2.17%.At CEF/ETF Income Laboratory, we currently have a ""Buy"" rating on the fund. We would be looking to buy shares at a greater-than-12% discount and conversely looking for a swap candidate when/if it hits a 6% discount. The fund is currently held in our Tactical Income - 100 portfolio.As we had previously mentioned, the fund went through changes as of March 2019. This means looking at the fund's longer-term performance isn't really reflective of what we may see going forward. Nor for any fund should this be the decider factor, just that in the case of ISD, it is even more unreliable. This year though, the fund has done well, with a solid 12.21% return on NAV and 16.25% market return.(Source: CEFConnect)More attractive for this fund is the wide discount available. Even after the outperformance this year in market returns over NAV, an investor can buy shares for a 13.27% discount. Of course, its 1-year average discount is 13.69%. However, with the increases in distributions and investment change, this should tighten going forward.Data by YChartsAs we can see overall, the fund has a long history of trading at a significant discount. The 1-year z-score is 0.30, 6-month is -0.80 and 3-month is -0.90. This should mean, at the very least, an investor isn't getting a terrible deal by buying shares at this time.The fund pays on a more appealing monthly schedule. The current rate of the fund, which was just raised 5%, is currently paid out at $0.1050. This gives ISD a distribution rate of 8.73%, with an NAV yield of 7.56%. This wide discrepancy is important to note. As the fund trades at a significant discount, the yield required to maintain the current rate is significantly lower compared to a fund at a premium. ISD only needs to achieve 7.56%, but investors ""earn"" an 8.73% rate if bought today! Just another important reminder of the benefits of buying a CEF at such wide discounts.(Source: CEFConnect)The fund's latest Annual Report is for the period ending May 31, 2019. This is helpful that it includes the turbulent end of 2018 and a good chunk of this year. However, since the fund has changed its investment strategy, it wasn't completely reflected in this report. Actually, only a few months are available with such changes reflected.(Source: Annual Report)For a bond fund, we would like to see a 100% coverage of the distribution from NII. This is because the underlying holdings of ISD aren't likely to show significant capital appreciation. This is in contrast to an equity-focused fund, where we would expect the distribution to include capital appreciation. So, for its latest report, we don't see the best coverage. But, of course, that is because the strategy wasn't fully implemented for the whole period of time.As investors in ISD, we will need to keep an eye out for its next Quarterly Report to see which way the fund is trending in. I would suspect that NII has increased, not only due to the longer-term holdings being incorporated but the fact that the fund just raised the distribution again.For the prior years, the distributions were classified as 100% coming from ordinary income for tax purposes.(Source: Annual Report)ISD has an average maturity of 5.7 years for its holdings. Additionally, it has a leverage adjusted duration of 4.2 years. This maturity length is reflective of the fund's target. ISD shared this positioning target in its Fund Commentary released on June 30, 2019.Some of the top issuances that ISD holds are some well-known companies, some are not so well-known. And we even have a holding from Venezuela that may make investors nervous.(Source: Fund Website)I think the important part to gather from this is the fact that no one holding makes up a significant portion of the fund's assets. Even the top holding is only 1.9% of the portfolio. In total, ISD has 216 holdings as of 7/31/2019. I believe that gives it a good mixture of companies that can help diversify the portfolio to not be swayed by a single holding, which is important in a fund that holds junk.Speaking of junk, we can look next at the breakdown of credit quality in the portfolio.(Source: Fund Website)True to its investment strategy, we are firmly in what would be considered below investment-grade.(Source: S&P Global Ratings)Standard & Poor's defines these types of holdings as ""speculative."" Additionally, they add ""major ongoing uncertainties or exposure to adverse business, financial, or economic conditions that could lead to the obligator's inadequate capacity to meet its financial commitments on the obligation."" Which means what we previously discussed, that should the economic environment go into a recessionary mode, the underlying issuers would have a tough time repaying their obligations.Finally, we can look at the largest sectors that the underlying issues represent.(Source: Fund Website)As we can see, the assets are well-diversified by sector as well. This is another important fact that shouldn't be ignored. Being diversified should help mitigate risks further in the event of a recession.ISD seems to have made the right move for its shareholders in making the fund more attractive. However, it is still suffering at a significant discount. This is likely to continue, as not many investors have caught on the fundamental changes of the fund. While there are higher risks in junk bonds, the fact that the fund is broadly diversified through sectors and the sheer number of holdings, this should be relatively limited.The last two bumps in distributions have been very welcome to see as well. Since the fund is at a considerable discount, investors can buy a fund yielding significantly more than the managers have to actually earn too. This helps provide a further benefit for those that may choose to pick up shares at this time."
4248448,102308,2019-03-13T13:22:52-04:00,"ISD and GHY have relaxed their duration and credit risk mandates in an apparent bid to be able to take on more risk.Given the recent distribution rate increases, we expect the discounts of the two funds to tighten by a few percentage points in line with the rest of the sector.However, because the two funds have not shown a strong ability to generate alpha, we only recommend a tactical position over a relatively short-time span.","As many of our readers know, to make sense of the CEF world, we like to take a sector-based approach. This, generally, works well in explaining how a particular fund respond to different market conditions, whether it is priced attractively and whether it has generated alpha. That is, until a fund leaves the sector! This is exactly what has happened to two PGIM funds which just went from the limited duration to the high yield sector:Source: BWApart from the name change, the announcement says three important things:While we are not familiar with the thought process underlying a decision to potentially add risk in a late-cycle environment, we think it can be justified on a number of grounds. Given the distribution rate increase of the two funds, we expect them to trade more in line with the rest of the high yield sector, meaning their discounts should tighten a few percentage points. Our overall sentiment is muted, however, by the fact that the two funds have not shown strong alpha generation capacity in the past so we would position in these funds in a strictly tactical and short-term way.This move by the funds to move further out along both risk dimensions of credit and duration during what many commentators feel is a late-cycle environment is reminiscent of the comment by Chuck Prince to get up and dance while market liquidity is present. Furthermore, a quick look at the 2s10s Treasury yield curve tells us that the additional spread earned for taking on more duration risk has not been lower since the financial crisis. So, what gives?Source: ADS Analytics LLC, FREDLet's see if we can paint a more positive picture of what could be going on?First, we would argue that an expansion of an investment mandate in-and-of-itself does not tell us what the fund is actually going to do. Yes, the fund is more likely to take on more credit and duration risk but it may be setting itself up for greater opportunities to come in the medium term rather than piling in head first right now.Second, while nominal yields are very low, real yields, which are arguably better indicators of value in duration, are actually fairly attractive and close to 5-year highs.Source: ADS Analytics LLC, FREDThird, CCC credit spreads are well off their tights and could present good tactical opportunities.Source: ADS Analytics LLC, FREDFourth, adding duration to your portfolio is arguably a de-risking move, particularly if the risk comes from factors closer to the equity market such as earnings (rather than than factors closer to the bond market, such as inflation). What happened in December 2018 provides a good example - equities fell but Treasuries rallied, so adding duration to a high-yield portfolio, all else equal, can serve to dampen overall risk.If we ignore the target-date funds in the high yield sector which skew the otherwise good yield / discount relationship, we can see that with both funds' current yields around 8.5%, their discounts should tighten to under 10% from current 12%+ levels. This is not anyone's idea of winning the lottery but it's something. Source: ADS Analytics LLC, TIINGOIf we look at our favorite valuation metric - discount sector spread - we can see that both fund discounts are trading fairly wide to the sector and have actually cheapened in the past few years, even though their yields are now pretty competitive.Source: ADS Analytics LLC, TIINGOSource: ADS Analytics LLC, TIINGOThis is what the limited duration sector looked like prior to losing both ISD and GHY. Even before the loss of the two funds, the sector was one of the smaller sectors we track by number of funds. The sizes of the rectangles shows the relative AUMs while the color indicates relative returns. The chart shows that the two funds were the best performing funds in the past year in the sector while their AUMs were about average.Source: ADS Analytics LLC, TIINGOOn a yield basis, the sector was sandwiched between high yield and loans while being smaller in AUM terms than both sectors.Source: ADS Analytics LLC, TIINGOSince their inception, the two funds have been pretty unexceptional. At its most basic, one thing we want to see is an ability of a closed-end fund to outperform what we think should be its ETF benchmark for the simple reason of added leverage and being an active bond vehicle. Unfortunately, neither fund succeeds on this basis.Source: ADS Analytics LLC, TIINGOSource: ADS Analytics LLC, TIINGOWe gauge alpha by looking at volatility-adjusted NAV performance, particularly 1Y rolling returns in excess of the sector.Source: ADS Analytics LLC, TIINGOSource: ADS Analytics LLC, TIINGOThe two charts above tell us a number of things:Source: ADS Analytics LLC, TIINGOThe recent decision on the part of ISD and GHY management teams to effectively migrate to the high yield sector by relaxing a previous duration and rating cap can seem puzzling at first but we think can be justified on risk and valuation grounds. We think the increase in distribution rates to be more in line with the rest of the high yield sector should allow the fund discounts to tighten by a few percentage points. However, because the two funds have not shown a strong ability to generate alpha, we only recommend tactical positioning on a relatively short-term horizon.Thanks for reading.

Most of these products are designed to provide a steady stream of income, usually on a monthly or quarterly basis, as opposed to the biannual payments provided by individual bonds. And this feature continues to attract market participants even when the overall market looks unstable.In spite of CEFs being mostly of interest to income investors, we have found our path to approach them as active traders and we are constantly monitoring them. As a testament to this, you will be kept up to date with Weekly Reviews such as the one below.The main benchmark of the sector, the iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (HYG) bounced back from its bottom after a $0.81 increase in its price. The ETF finished the week at $81.04 and remains pretty close to its lowest level of the year. However, it seems the credit panic is overcome and the trust in the stock market and respectively high-yield CEFs may return very soon. Source: Barchart, iBoxx $ High Yield Corp Bond iSharesI would like to spend some time covering several advantages of high-yield bonds and closed-end funds, which invest in this asset class. As the high-yield sector generally has a low correlation to other sectors of the fixed-income market, along with less sensitivity to interest rate risk, an allocation to high-yield bonds may provide portfolio diversification benefits. In addition, high-yield bond investments have historically offered similar returns to equity markets but with lower volatility.High-yield bonds are typically evaluated on the difference between their yield and the yield on the US Treasury bond. High-yield spreads are used by investors and market analysts to evaluate the overall credit markets. Higher spreads indicate a higher default risk in junk bonds, and can be a reflection of the overall corporate economy and/or a broader weakening of macroeconomic conditions. On a weekly basis, we notice an increase of 0.26 bps.

Lowest Z-Score:Source: CEFConnect.comAbove, I have plotted potential ""Buy"" candidates based on their Z-score. The purpose of this indicator is to show us how many times the discount/premium deviates from its mean for a specific period. Logically, the positive week for the sector led to a huge increase in the Z-score of the funds.Only a week ago, Apollo Tactical Income Fund, Inc. (AIF) was traded at Z-score of -5.90 points. The closed-end fund finished the week in a green territory and increased its price by 6.64%. Currently, its Z-score is only -1.90 points. I am highlighting the change because I want to prove the power of the Z-score as a statistical indicator and how fast the statistically undervalued funds recover their prices when their sector finds a positive impulse.

At all, the upside potential of the funds is very appetizing for us and we remain focused on seeking reasonable ""Long"" candidates. The average Z-score of the high-yield CEFs is -1.29 points.

Below, we have depicted their discount/premium and their Z-score:  Source: CEFConnect.com 5. Highest 5-year Annualized Return On NAV: Source: CEFConnect.com The average return for the past five years is 4.12% for the sector. As you can see, the current yields on price and net asset value are higher than the historical ones. The situation seems justified because this year we saw two sharp declines in the prices of the funds.Credit Suisse High Yield Bond Fund (DHY) is one of the funds which caught my attention. It has the needed statistical edge and attractive discount. Also, its yield is one of the highest in the sector. 6. Highest Distribution Rate:  Source: CEFConnect.comThe average yield on price for the sector is 8.97% and the average yield on net asset value is 7.87%. The difference between the two values can be easily explained by the spread between the price and the net asset values of the funds.Barings Global Short Duration High Yield Fund (BGH) remains at the first position with its yield on the price of 11.23%. Currently, we find five closed-end funds which have a yield above 10.00%. Source: CEFConnect.com 7. Lowest Effective Leverage: Source: CEFConnect.com We have two funds which are not leveraged and three which use leverage below 10%. The average leverage for the sector is 26.44%. Below, you can see the relationship between the effective leverage of the funds and their yield on net asset value.Source: CEFConnect.com As usual, I am looking for closed-end funds that have all the characteristics to be of interest to us. Based on the current market environment, it is easier to find eventual ""Buys"" rather than reasonable ""Shorts"".Throughout we saw that Prudential Short Duration High Yield Fund (ISD) is one of the funds with the biggest spread between its price and net asset value. Its effective leverage is pretty close to the average for the sector. Below we find a summary of the investment policy of the fund:Source: CEFConnect.comOver the past week, the price of the fund rose by 3.15%, while its net asset value fell by 0.45%.Source: CEFConnect.comWe do have a yield on the price of 7.79% and yield on the net asset value of 6.60%. Probably you will notice that both of them are below the average for the sector but as compensation for that, I could highlight the positive earning coverage ratio and positive UNII balance per share. Source: CEFdata.comSource: CEFAnalyzer.comMost of the investments owned by this CEF are with rating ""BB"" which is very satisfying for that sector. This is another reason why the yields of ISD are lower compared to its peers. A brief overview of the investments shows that the portfolio is mainly comprised of assets from ""Technology"" and ""Media & Entertainment"" sectors. The average maturity is 3.6 years and leveraged adjusted duration is 3.0 years.Source: Fund Sponsor WebsiteSource: Fund Sponsor WebsiteBelow, you can find the statistical comparison between iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF and Prudential Short Duration High Yield Fund.

        Pair trade idea for those interested.","The opportunities in closed-end funds over the last few months caught the eye of many investors. Most of these products are designed to provide a steady stream of income, usually on a monthly or quarterly basis, as opposed to the biannual payments provided by individual bonds. And this feature continues to attract market participants even when the overall market looks unstable.In spite of CEFs being mostly of interest to income investors, we have found our path to approach them as active traders and we are constantly monitoring them. As a testament to this, you will be kept up to date with Weekly Reviews such as the one below.Source: Barchart, iBoxx $ High Yield Corp Bond iSharesThe main index for high-yield closed-end funds is the iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (NYSEARCA:HYG). Since the beginning of the month, we saw an extremely positive performance from the sector. Over the first two weeks, the price of the benchmark shot through the roof. Over the last week, we notice a slight correction of $0.21 which did not allow us to see a test of the psychological level around $86.50.Before starting the review, I would like to introduce several advantages of the high-yield bonds and respectively closed-end funds, which invest in this asset class. They are corporate bonds rated below BBB- or Baa3 by established credit rating agencies, but they can play an important role in your portfolio. As the high-yield sector generally has a low correlation to other sectors of the fixed-income market, along with less sensitivity to interest rate risk, an allocation to high-yield bonds may provide portfolio diversification benefits. In addition, high-yield bond investments have historically offered similar returns to equity markets, but with lower volatility.The spread is simply the compensation a bond investor receives over the risk-free rate, which in this case is the U.S. Treasury rate. On a weekly basis, we notice an increase of 0.08%. As we can see, the current levels are significantly lower compared to the ones of the financial crisis.Source: YCharts, US High Yield Master II Option-Adjusted SpreadBelow, you can find a statistical comparison between the iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF and the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (NYSEARCA:TLT).

It is only 0.32 points for the last 200-day period:Source: Author's softwareSource: Author's softwareSource: Yahoo News, High Yield Closed-End Funds NewsOver the past week, two of the funds published information about their regular monthly distributions:The Apollo Tactical Income Fund, Inc.

Lowest Z-Score:Source: CEFConnect.comWhen I am sorting the table by the lowest one year Z-score, my aim is to find the most statistically undervalued CEFs from the sector. On a weekly basis, we notice a slight increase in the values of the metric which corresponds to the recent uptick of the benchmark. Еven though, based on this criterion we still have several interesting ""Buy"" candidates.Our weekly leader is MFS Intermediate High Income Fund (NYSE:CIF). Only this fund has a Z-score of less than -2.00 points. Its discount is not so impressive but only two months ago the fund was traded at a premium and this is the reason why we have such Z-score here. I think the fund could be reviewed as potential ""Buy"" candidate but if you want to be more conservative just wait for a higher discount. As a reason for that shift, I see the cuts in the distribution rate.Source: CEFConnect.com, MFS Intermediate High Income FundSource: CEFConnect.com, MFS Intermediate High Income Fund2. Highest Z-Score:Source: CEFConnect.comReversely, if we are looking for potential ""Short"" candidates, we need to sort the funds by the highest Z-score. It does not make sense to use the indicator if its value is between 0 and 1 point. In that scenario, we cannot talk about a statistical edge.The leaders of the ranking remain the same. The previous time, the Putnam High Income Securities Fund (NYSE:PCF) had a Z-score of 3.10 points. Currently, we observe a significant decrease in this statistical metric explained by the decrease in the price of the fund. If we see this closed-end fund traded at a premium I think it would be an appropriate ""Short"" candidate.Source: Barchart, Putnam High Income Securities Fund3. Biggest Discount:Source: CEFConnect.comAnother important metric which I always include in my analysis is the spread between the price and the net asset value of the funds. Following the logic, when we are looking for ""Buy"" opportunities, we care about the discount of the closed-end funds. The above table is comprised of funds with an attractive discount and can be used as a starting point of your analysisThis week, the Prudential Global Short Duration High Yield Fund (NYSEMKT:GHY) is stepping down from the leading position.

The Babson Capital Participation Investors (NYSE:MPV) is trading at a premium and it Z-score is close to 2.00 points. Even with these characteristics, I would not consider it as a suitable candidate for my portfolio because this closed-end fund does not meet my liquidity requirements.Source: CEFConnect.com, Babson Capital Participation Investors5. Highest 5-year Annualized Return On NAV:Source: CEFConnect.comIn the table above, you can see the funds from the sector sorted by their highest return on net asset value for the past five years. Usually, I try to combine the return with the discount and the Z-score in order find a fundamental and a statistical reason to review the candidate.Аpparently, it is difficult to find а statistical edge among the funds from the sample. Based on the Discount, only HYT partially satisfies my needs. The prices in the sector went slightly up over the past weeks and this influenced the spread between prices and net asset values of the funds.6. Lowest 5-year Annualized Return On NAV:Source: CEFConnect.comHere, we have the closed-end funds with the lowest return on net asset value. If you are not a fan of the leveraged funds you may decide to review the Western Asset High Income Opportunity Fund (NYSE:HIO). It has an attractive discount and is one of the two funds which are non-leveraged.7. Highest Distribution Rate:Source: CEFConnect.comMost of the investors want to see what is the actual distribution performance of the fund based on its price. The above table provides us with information about the highest distribution rate in the sector. Additionally, I included another important metric: the annualized distribution rate on the net asset value. The ranking is more static, and on a weekly basis, we do not see so many changes.8. Lowest Distribution Rate:Source: CEFConnect.com9. Lowest Effective Leverage:Source: CEFConnect.comFrom an effective leverage perspective, we have two funds, which are not leveraged and four, which use a leverage below 10%.Combining all of the circumstances, we form a landscape in which it is easier to find potential ""Buy"" candidates rather than reasonable ""Shorts"". I will keep your attention only on the closed-end funds where you can consider taking a ""Long"" position.The CEF which I am going to review today is Prudential Short Duration High Yield Fund (NYSE:ISD).

4249468,66263,2019-03-18T11:53:06-04:00,"ISD and GHY removed ""short duration"" requirement from their high-yield portfolio.Limits on CCC or below securities are also relaxed.Distribution increase may provide possible catalyst for discount contraction.An example of a CEF rotation trade we executed for our members, and an illustration of how valuation divergence can produce real profits.","PGIM High Yield Bond Fund (ISD) and PGIM Global High Yield Fund (GHY)'s investment mandate change may offer a potential catalyst for discount narrowing.On March 8, 2019, PGIM High Yield Bond Fund (formerly PGIM Short Duration High Yield Fund) and PGIM Global High Yield Fund (formerly PGIM Global Short Duration High Yield Fund) announced that effective immediately, the funds have changed investment policies to permit investments of instruments of any duration or maturity and to remove the limit on investments in lower rating categories (Caa1/CCC+ or lower). Starting this month, ISD and GHY also boosted their monthly distributions by 1.5 cents (+17.6%) and 1.75 cents (+21.2%) respectively. Both funds now pay $0.10/month, and yield 8.44% and 8.60% respectively.The full press release can be found in the following link.GHY closed last week with a discount of -13.13% and a z-score of +1.8, while ISD closed with a discount of -12.44% and a z-score of +1.6. Despite their relatively high z-scores, these two funds are actually among the most discounted funds within the high-yield peer group, as can be seen from the chart below. Out of 31 CEFs, GHY is the most discounted fund while ISD is the third-most discounted.Numerically, the average for the high-yield CEFs in the database is -5.81%. Even excluding the more richly-valued term CEFs and the MCI/MPV pair, the average for the remaining funds is still -9.11%, more than 300 bps higher than GHY and ISD's valuations. The full dataset for the high-yield CEF in CEFConnect's database is shown below.(Source: Stanford Chemist, CEFConnect)Why hasn't GHY and ISD been very popular in the past? My guess is that its previously low duration and higher-quality investment mandate restricted the funds' ability to invest in lengthier and junkier credits, which made their yield less competitive compared to their peers. Excluding the target term funds (which are shorter duration and lower yielding), GHY and ISD's former yields of 7.10% and 7.17% would have put them near the bottom out of the peer group the high-yield funds.(Source: Stanford Chemist, CEFConnect. GHY and ISD's forward yields are displayed in black, while their former yields are in yellow. Target term funds have orange bars).However, with the mandate change to allow investment into higher yielding securities, as well as the hefty ~20% distribution boosts for the two funds, there is a case to be made that these funds could very well see their discounts contract as they trade more in line with their (now) comparable peers. It should be noted that GHY and ISD do sport low coverage ratios of 69% and 75% respectively since the earnings numbers are based on their old portfolio. With the relaxation of the investment mandate to allow investment into higher-yielding securities, I would expect its net investment earnings number to move sharply higher in the next report, which would boost the coverage ratio.One very important point to note however is that the risk of both funds has been increased by this mandate change since the funds will have flexibility to invest in longer duration (higher duration risk) and junkier (higher credit risk) securities. To see what I mean, consider how their current portfolios stack up with their peers.Currently, ISD and GHY have low durations of 3.00 and 3.20 years respectively due to their previous short duration mandates. This compares to 5.25, 3.77 and 4.26 years for three other representative high-yield CEFs, BlackRock Corp High Yield CEF (HYT), Pioneer High Income Trust (PHT) and Neuberger Berman High Yield Strategies (NHS). An increase of ISD and GHY's durations towards the peer group will therefore necessarily lead to an increase of duration risk.(Source: Stanford Chemist, CEFdata)In terms of credit quality, ISD and GHY hold 47% and 40% in ""BB"" rated securities respectively, which are the highest rung of the non-investment grade ladder.(Source: CEFdata)This makes them higher quality than many other high-yield CEFs which load up on B and CCC credits in order to enhance yield. The chart below shows the proportion of assets in ""BB or above"" issues for different high-yield CEFs. ISD has over half (53.10%) of its assets in higher-quality issues, and for GHY the number is 45.90%. Out of the other three representative CEFs highlighted, only NHS has a comparable proportion (46.60%) in BB or above credits.(Source: Stanford Chemist, CEFdata)In a similar vein, ISD and GHY have relatively low proportions allocated to CCC or below (including unrated) assets, at 8.3% and 7.8%. Only NHS has a lower proportion allocated to CCC or below issues (6.9%).(Source: Stanford Chemist, CEFdata)Hence, relaxing the limits on lower rated issues could see ISD and GHY becoming junkier, thus increasing their credit risk.Do I like these changes? Personally, I am in favor of extending the duration of the portfolio to allow longer-duration (and therefore higher-yielding) securities. With many target term high-yield CEFs available, I don't find a particular need for a non-term high yield fund to invest in short duration issues. Indeed, something that I've found before in my research is that funds in the ""limited duration"" category have done fairly poorly compared to other fixed income sectors. It could very well just be the fact that the market has realized that rates aren't going to be rising very fast any time soon. With high-yield bonds, they aren't that interest rate sensitive in the first place, so a low duration mandate seems doubly undesirable in this case.However, I'm less positive on removal of the limits on CCC or below investments, which would seem to indicate that the funds are going to get junkier.The BB rating grade is a ""sweet spot"" in my opinion as they are significantly safer than B and especially CCC rated credits, but being still non-investment (""junk"") grade they cannot be owned by many types of large funds, which boosts their expected return premium. Also, many ""fallen angels"" (funds whose debt was initially investment grade when issued but then became downgraded) are BB-rated, and we've previously discussed the attractiveness of fallen angels in our analyses of the associated ETF, the VanEck Vectors Fallen Angel High Yield Bond ETF (ANGL).Indeed, ISD fell significantly less than other domestic high-yield CEFs during both the 2015/2016 credit panic and the mini-panic towards the end of last year. While we don't know exactly how much ""junkier"" ISD and GHY are going to get, it is probably safe to say that the funds are going to get riskier rather than safer.I'd like to highlight a CEF rotation trade that we recently performed in the Tactical Income Portfolio of the CEF/ETF Income Laboratory, our premium newsletter service, as an example of how we can use the above analysis to inform our investment portfolio decisions.While my outlook on the fundamental changes of ISD and GHY's investment mandates were mixed, they do provide a sentiment-based catalyst for discount contraction. The hypothesis is that CEF investors will reward the new, higher yields of these two formerly unpopular CEFs, and thus bid up their valuations. Credit should also be given to the fine folks at Morningstar who first reported the idea.We therefore purchased a ~4% position of ISD at $14.22 on March 11, 2019 in the Tactical Income portfolio.To make room for the incoming ISD position, we sold our position in Eaton Vance High Income 2021 Target Term Trust (EHT) which we had previously purchased (members link) on December 13, 2018.The below excerpt from our trade alert (members link) is illustrative of how a nimble CEF investor can take advantage of valuation divergences in CEFs, with good success."
4294897,54942,2019-10-04T07:00:00-04:00,"For the HY space, we think ISD is one of the best options up there with HYB and NHS/HNW.The fund changed their investment policy mandate to allow greater flexibility which caused them to increase the distribution twice.The shares are attractive here given the wide discount and competitive yield with upside should they increase again or institute a MDP.","(This was first released to members of Yield Hunting on September 11th)This is a high yield (non-investment grade) fund that we currently like given the large discount to NAV, the higher-quality of holdings, and the competitive yield. PGIM has two funds with similar mandates, ISD and the PGIM Global High Yield (GHY), with the latter having a global investment policy mandate.For today's purposes, we are solely looking at ISD, which avoided the Argentina debacle by not investing in overseas countries. Given the nearly identical distribution yields, we think ISD is the safer choice between the two at the moment simply because of that 100% domestic mandate.Investment ObjectiveFrom the annual report:The funds changed their investment policies to permit greater flexibility in their securities holdings. This led the firm to increase the distributions of both funds by 17.5% and 21%, respectively.In other words, they are moving away from the ""short duration"" restriction on the fund and the restriction on holding lower quality assets. It will truly be a go-anywhere type of fund.In this environment, it pays to allow these active managers to do what they are paid to do. That is, be nimble and allocate capital to where it will be most productive. The shift in the investment policy statement allows them to do just that.PGIM (Prudential) is a really strong fixed income asset manager- and really an under-the-radar one at that. The firm has been around for 145+ years and contains 117 portfolio managers, 120 credit analysts, and 54 risk analysts managing hundreds of billions of dollars for policyholders in their insurance business and for outside shareholders through their funds.Fund CharacteristicsThe PortfolioThe credit quality is skewed to the upper-end of the spectrum with 7.3% investment grade, and then over 80% of the rest of the holdings in the B area. The fund holds very little of what we call ""equity lite"" positions in CCC or below though they are now allowed to increase those holdings.The portfolio has shifted a bit since they changed the investment policy statement to allow greater flexibility. At fiscal year end 2018 (11/30), the fund had just over 50% in BB, 36% in single B. Comparing to the chart above, they moved about 14% out of BB and increased single B and CCC-rated issues modestly. The breakdown of those changes are below:The duration was also increased from 3.6 years to 4.2 years. Some of that may be the natural decline in rates reducing yields on holdings and increasing the durations naturally. Some may in fact be a tactical move towards more interest rate sensitive assets. In the end, the change is mostly immaterial in its absolute amount.One risk we see is the high allocation to telecom companies. Many consider telecom to be a ""defensive"" sector on a similar level as utilities or healthcare. But the debt load of the sector and the rate of change regarding the innovation (rate of change) with a lot of disruption are concerning to us.The portfolio also added some credit default swaps to gain general exposure to the market and more efficiently transition the fund under the new mandate.The DistributionAs a result of the policy change they made in March, they have increased the distribution twice- once by 17.6% and the second time by 5%. Obviously, buying riskier holdings and extending duration mean that the fund is taking on both more credit risk and more interest rate risk. Credit risk being the risk that the company may default on its obligations while interest rate risk stems from the risk that rates will rise depressing the prices of the bond holdings in the fund.(Source: CEFConnect)The new investment policy change is already being reflected in the net investment income (""NII""). From February 28 to May 31, NII production increased by 5 cents or nearly 20% (hence the fund increasing the distribution by a cumulative ~23%).Leverage did increase by $5M or about 2.85% in the three months since the end of February. The fund has a lot of space to increase leverage given that they are only at 25% which is about 5.5% below the average of the high yield sector.(Source: PGIM)We think the fund will eventually adopt a managed distribution policy (""MDP"") as it is more in tune with their strategy. The industry is slowly shifting towards MDPs being the standard. This could eventually increase the distribution again (but be composed of some gains or return of capital). However, we think that will help to reduce the discount to NAV which, at an absolute level, is much wider than the sector average (-4.98%).The new yield for ISD is VERY competitive with the HY space with an additional 92 bps of payout. The discount is also about 2.5x as wide providing a better safety net compared to other high yield funds. Coverage is 95.2% and heading up as they shift their holdings profile while the peer group is at 92.3% and heading lower. Valuation is also cheaper for ISD compared to the average for the high yield space as a whole.The time to buy high yield was back in December when high yield spreads (the amount investors required for a junk bond over the comparable treasury bond) were very wide for a non-recessionary environment. The yield on the High Yield Master reached 8.00% around Christmas and is down to 5.54% today. Of course, all interest rates are much lower today and the spread (which is far more important) is down to 4.05%. That level is still about 75 bps above the tighter levels we saw in late September of last year.We think there is a possibility that these spreads could move back below 4% and head towards the 3.50% level (at a minimum) as we progress through the fourth quarter. That would provide a lot of tailwind to fixed coupon bonds that are rated lower on the quality spectrum. As we noted in our monthly letter, it is our contention that the bar is set very low for incremental positive news on the geopolitical front. As we incur more positive news flows, we think that spreads could head lower.However, we would note that the risk is still skewed to the downside at 4.05% on the barometer. As you can see in the chart below, a ""all is rosy"" level is around 3.25%-3.50% while a fourth quarter correction/bear market would send you up over 5.5%. In other words, 75 bps at most on the upside, and 150 bps or more on the downside.The fund's changes are a necessary move in order to make it more competitive in the high yield space. The yield prior to the increases was on the lower end of the sector range which caused the discounts to be on the wider end. Given the proliferation of activism in the CEF space recently, it was likely, in my opinion, that ISD (and GHY) were opening themselves up to being a target by Bulldog, Karpus, Saba or another player on the activist side.I'm positive that the fund managers didn't go hog wild and load up on CCC or below rated credits at this point in the cycle or at these spreads. We are clearly later cycle so lower-quality assets are not the most prudent securities to be adding here unless the managers truly thought we had many quarters or even years to go before a recession reared its ugly head. Still, spreads as noted above aren't very juicy.Returns are increasing with near-term returns increasing. The question is if it is enough to compensate for the added risks. My contention is yes. While high yield, in general, is not something you want to own going into a recession, if you are of the belief that we are not entering one within the next 6-9 months (and we don't), then an allocation is likely warranted.It is hard to time these things but I do think ISD is a worthy high yield bond CEF for the portfolio. There is also the upside catalysts if they were to A) implement a managed distribution policy or B) increase the distribution again. The latter we think is at least a 50-50 probability as they haven't made all that much of a move in the portfolio since the investment policy change.The fund is one of our optional substitutes (for funds like BLW, IVH, HYB, FSD, DSU, PHT, DHY, HNW, and NHS)."
4075371,101638,2017-05-22T13:37:17-04:00,You should really take a look at this even if you aren't invested in the space because there are some important lessons.The pros are trading this asset class in a completely different way than retail investors.The problem: this asset class is in a bubble and the pros' positions are liquid while retail's positions aren't.,"Twice in the past five days I've tried to make a point about how if you look at credit's relative resilience during last Wednesday's equity market selloff, it seems to suggest that traders weren't shaken out of their core positions (see here and here).And predictably, some readers interpreted both of those articles as bearish reads on the market when in fact the exact opposite was true.Hilariously, I even explained that to readers at the beginning of the second article, citing a comment left on the first post, and readers left what amounted to the very same comments again, proving, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that very few people are actually reading these posts.But you know, that's how it goes.Well, I wanted to extend that analysis for anyone who is inclined to read what I'm writing because I think it's pretty important, especially if you're in iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (NYSEARCA:HYG) and/or SPDR Barclays Capital High Yield Bond ETF (NYSEARCA:JNK).Recall this table from Goldman (NYSE:GS):(Goldman)What you want to look at there is the ""SPX"" column. See those high numbers in the red boxes? So those are the percentile rankings for the S&P's (NYSEARCA:SPY) underperformance versus the assets listed on the left. The message there is clear: credit's outperformance versus equities in the period capturing last Wednesday's selloff was anomalous.That, as I noted in the second post linked above, underscores the extent to which the rally in credit markets off the deflationary doldrums of February 2016 has proven bullet-proof. There was a brief stumble in early March when crude sold off hard, causing oil-HY correlations to spike, but other than that, junk has remained resilient.So resilient, in fact, that the last time spreads in both synthetic and cash markets were as tight as they are now, crude was trading at roughly $90/bbl:That in and of itself is a red flag, but if you needed further evidence of the extent to which the artificial suppression of volatility is creating bubbles galore, have a look at this:(Barclays)So that's net protection bought on CDX HY and the deeply negative read there means that what you're looking at is a giant net long position (i.e., when a chart of protection bought is negative, it means investors are net protection sellers).And here's what I mean about artificially suppressed volatility encouraging this behavior:(Barclays)Consider this from Barclays:Again: from the 81st percentile to the 4th percentile in the short space of 5 months. How's that for getting long in a hurry?Now there's some nuance here. Note the discrepancy between protection sold on all series (the shaded light blue) versus protection sold on the OTR. Clearly, the all series figure isn't signaling as extreme a long position. The explanation for that is obvious. Here's Barclays (NYSE:BCS):Ok, duly noted, but I'm not sure how that materially changes this picture. That is, if series 27 shorts didn't roll their bought protection, then that would seem to suggest they either i) got bullish, or at the very least ii) are no longer bearish.Barclays also points to still elevated short interest in HYG and JNK as ""evidence"" that the market hasn't gone completely crazy with the HY bullish bias:I'm not buying that explanation. What seems pretty clear to me is that credit investors are getting long the ""smart"" way by selling protection in a low volatility environment on a highly liquid HY instrument and then they're hedging that long position by shorting the dumbest, most illiquid HY instrument available: your ETFs.If you own those ETFs that should give you pause. Here's what you should be thinking: ""why is it that the pros are hugely long HY via sold protection on CDX HY but their short positions in the ETFs I own are in the 67th and 73rd percentile versus history?""Well, I'll tell you why. Because CDX is liquid. The cash bonds aren't. And because the cash bonds aren't liquid, neither are your ETF shares in a pinch. So were something to go wrong (i.e. HY were to sell off), they can unload their longs easily, and their shorts are in the instruments that are most likely to suffer from a liquidity-mismatched firesale.In the same vein, the other thing you should immediately ask yourself when you see that chart of all the protection being sold on CDX HY is this: ""if they wanted to get long HY, why would they sell protection on CDX as opposed to simply buying the cash bonds?""The answer is the same: because the cash bonds aren't liquid. So whereas CDX used to be used as a hedging instrument, managers are now using it to express core directional views because there's no embedded liquidity mismatch. Of course, the more that ""substitution effect"" (outlined in more detail here) takes hold, the more illiquid the cash market gets because no one is trading it.I'll just be blunt: if you don't understand every single last bit of the above, you have no business buying HY ETFs."

The duration is less than three years.The fund is trading at a 7% discount to net asset value.Leverage costs are reasonable and the expense ratio is below average.,"Prudential Short Duration High Yield Fund (NYSE:ISD) is a leveraged closed-end bond fund that seeks a high level of current income by investing in a portfolio of higher rated, but below investment grade fixed income instruments. A majority of the portfolio is invested in bonds rated B or BB by S&P or Fitch.The Fund has very low interest rate exposure and tries to maintain a weighted average portfolio duration of three years or less.(Data below is sourced from the PGIM Investments website unless otherwise stated.)ISD Has Traded At A Premium Over NAV in the PastThe inception date of ISD was in April 2012. For the first year of its existence, it traded at a premium above NAV. A discount developed after the taper tantrum in 2013, and the five-year average discount has been -5.31%.ISD is currently selling at a discount to NAV of -7.49% compared to the 52-week average discount of -7.10%. (Source: cefconnect)Because of the terrific closed-end fund rally over the past year, it is getting harder to fund closed-end funds with negative Z-scores. The Z-scores for ISD are close to zero, but that is better than the high positive Z-scores for many other fixed income closed-end funds.Here are the three-month, six-month and one-year Z-scores:- 3-month Z-score = -0.13 (3-month average discount = -7.25%)- 6-month Z-score = +0.36 (6-month average discount = -7.81%)- 1-year Z-score = -0.22 (1-year average premium = -7.10%)(Source: cefanalyzer)Here is a historical chart of the ISD discount/premium since inception:ISD Benefits From Low Borrowing CostsOne of the advantages of purchasing fixed income closed-end funds is that you gain access to fairly low cost leverage. If the average retail investor tried to leverage their own high yield bond portfolio, they would pay much higher borrowing costs.This is a description of the fund's leverage taken from the last semi-annual shareholder report:Short-term interest rates have been creeping higher since then, so the fund's current borrowing costs are probably closer to 1.50%.Interest Rate SensitivityIn the last Fact Sheet, ISD reported a duration of 2.5 years, so interest rate sensitivity is very low. The 10-year bond yield has been trading sideways near 2.30% recently, and high yield closed-end funds have held up pretty well.Here is a sample of 3-month correlations for the NAV of ISD compared to various benchmarks. The correlations are scaled between -100% to +100%.ISD NAV 3-Month Correlation DataISD versus 20+ Year Treasury Bond = +20.23%ISD versus 7-10 Year Treasury Bond = +17.14%ISD versus 1-3 Year Treasury Bond = +6.96%ISD versus 1-3 Year Corporate Bond = +13.81%ISD versus Short-Term High Yield Bond = +78.14%ISD versus Bank Loan = +66.07%Source: cefanalyzerNote how the correlations with Treasury bonds and investment-grade corporate bonds tend to be low, while the correlations are much higher when compared to short-term high yield bonds and bank loans.DistributionsISD currently pays $0.1025 per month. The last distribution cut was from $0.1100 in September 2016. In February, the fund reported average monthly earnings of $0.0975, so they are currently slightly under-earning their monthly distribution.Credit Quality- (as of March 31, 2017)Asset Allocation Industry Breakdown- (as of 03/31/2017)Note that the troubled energy and retail sectors are not in the top ten.No Foreign ExposureISD is 100% invested in US securities. If you want some global exposure, Prudential also runs GHY, which is a global high yield closed-end fund.Fund ManagementThe fund uses a team approach. Note that all of the fund portfolio managers have earned the CFA designation:Ticker: ISD - Prudential Short Duration High Yield Fund(Sources: cefconnect, yahoo finance)Given the shortage of closed-end fund bargains now, ISD looks attractive now on a relative basis for a swing trade. It is a high income play with low interest rate sensitivity and should hold up reasonably well even if there is higher inflation and interest rates in the future.ISD has lower baseline expenses than many of its peers, and you recover some of that from the monthly distributions and discount to NAV. Because of its monthly distributions, it can be a good holding for the fixed income portion of a tax deferred retirement account.ISD has decent liquidity and usually trades over 100,000 shares a day. The bid-asked spread is one or two cents and you can usually get some price improvement between the bid-asked spread on market (or marketable limit) orders."
4117777,89835,2017-10-31T09:00:08-04:00,"Many individual and institutional investors face two major problems.First, they are sitting on excess cash. This could be due to a lack of compelling investment opportunities, staying defensive, or a combination of both.Second, investors need yield but not at the expense of massive principal and interest rate risk or extremely low liquidity.These closed-end funds solve most of the challenges while mitigating most of the concerns.The investment options discussed even trade at favorable discounts to their NAV relative to historical trends.","True portfolio optimization is an idea rather than a concrete reality. Many of us, me included, spend hundreds if not thousands of hours a year researching new stock ideas, buy and sell points, and the right sector exposures. Let me quickly do a little heavy lifting and help out in an area many people are most certainly not optimizing their portfolio: cash management.As my readers know, I have been fortunate and sold out of several profitable trades this year on the equity (e.g., Whole Foods Market (WFM), Main Street Capital Corporation (MAIN), JinkoSolar (JKS)) and debt side (e.g., senior bonds of Memorial Production Partners (MEMP), Legacy Reserves (LGCY), EV Energy Partners (EVEP-OLD)).While I did recycle a portion of the capital into firms such as Newfield Exploration Company (NFX), Ford Motor Company (F), and Monroe Capital Corporation (MRCC), over half the proceeds from the aforementioned sales remained on the sidelines looking for a good home. Compounding the issue is the fact I was already above 15% cash in my personal portfolio before selling the positions that hit my price target. Even more problematic is my expectation that I'll continue to be a net seller as long as valuations continue to rise. Though I've had good luck in the past with municipal fund CEFs such as Nuveen Municipal Value Fund (NUV) and Nuveen Select Tax-Free Income Portfolio (NXP), they have a few serious flaws relative to what I'd prefer.Source: CEFConnect.comThe first and second largest holdings in NXP, which are nearly 10% of the fund, mature in December of 2034 and April of 2053, respectively. These bonds will suffer a mathematically certain blood bath if and when long-term rates rise. On top of that, the average coupon is only 2.90% with no floating rate component to theoretically bolster that in the future. These funds can be a worthwhile addition to the right investor's portfolio, but they are poor places to park cash in the short and medium term.I know what mine does: high current income, relatively stable asset base and security price, decent liquidity, minimal interest rate risk, and a favorable entry point into whatever the asset is relative to historical averages. Surprisingly, a stable business development company (""BDC"") like Monroe Capital Corporation mentioned above achieves most of these objectives. Its stock price has been stable but BDCs have periods of instability sector wide. While Monroe's portfolio is well diversified and avoids more cyclical sectors such as oil and gas and real estate (to its credit), we are still long a single issuer. That's a lot of individual company risk, so putting more than a few percent of a portfolio in it may not be wise.In my attempt to find the ideal cash substitute within the framework I outlined above, coupled with a significant amount of research into how various high yield asset classes perform throughout times of high volatility and market dislocations, I landed on the Prudential Short Duration High Yield Fund (ISD) and the AllianceBernstein Global High Income Fund (AWF). Let's walk through the reasons why.Starting with interest rate risk, our high yield instrument needs to have low duration and a higher average coupon. Substantial statistical and academic evidence shows that the higher the starting coupon relative to the benchmark (e.g. U.S. Treasuries), the less the price of the stock or bond falls as rates rise. We also would prefer an average maturity of less than five years as interest rate sensitivity declines substantially as the bond nears maturity since it will pay par.Source: CEFConnect.comThe average coupon exceeds 8% and the average duration is very low at 2.50 years. This is exactly what we are looking for in these categories. The average maturity of 3.40 years coincides with these figures and promises that the portfolio manager will be able to quickly recycle capital into higher yielding instruments as rates rise. While not as rapid in adjusting as a floating rate portfolio such as Monroe's, it is as close as we are going to get in the high yield space. The 312 holdings also demonstrates a well diversified portfolio with minimal individual bond risk. To be thorough, let's evaluate the allocation to the fund's top two holdings.Source: CEFConnect.comWe are good in terms of bond diversification, with the top two holdings representing less than 5% of the portfolio. Let's now evaluate the quality of the underlying holdings.Source: CEFConnect.comIt may not be intuitive, but sector exposure is among the most important characteristic of a high yield bond portfolio. Portfolio managers can game critical statistics by over allocating to sectors the market knows are in trouble; energy would be a great example of this today. Since the credit rating agencies' updates are always lagging reality, moving into these areas before a series of downgrades can move a high yield bond portfolio's yields higher without seemingly increasing credit risk. ISD is solid here with no material energy exposure and the top two sectors, Technology and Healthcare, generally having stronger balance sheets and above average recession durability.Source: CEFConnect.comAbout 60% of the portfolio is BB or higher. For those unfamiliar with high yield, what kind of companies are we talking about?Source: PrudentialI am personally very familiar with eight out of the 10 companies listed here. They wouldn't be in this fund if they didn't have their fair share of challenges, but these are generally well established companies with large asset bases. While on this subject, what can we expect in terms of default rates? This quote discussing Moody's research is pulled from Prudential's most recent high yield bond market commentary:With minimal retail and energy exposure, it is likely that ISD will have lower defaults than the ~3% expected for 2018. This is important given ISD does use moderate structural leverage, averaging about 24% of assets both in recent periods and since inception. For a portfolio yielding well over 7% with minimal interest rate risk and a high quality portfolio relative to the sector, I can live with a 1-3% expected default rate annually.Last but far from least, we need to make sure our strategic income play/cash substitute is acquired at a favorable price and valuation.Source: PrudentialIt is easy to ascertain that the fund's net asset base, shares outstanding, and subsequently net asset value have remained stable since mid-2016. The Discount to NAV, however, continues to rise and now stands at -9.35% versus the average range of -8% to -5% and a low of -11%.Source: CEFConnect.comAs is typical when a CEF is launched, initial excitement and underwriting success results in a modest and very temporary premium to NAV. We see that with the green line exceeding the orange line for the first six months of trading. The NAV has fallen from the mid-$18s per share to the current level of approximately $17 over the last five years. The NAV and share price, however, have been trending higher since the high yield bond collapse of early 2016. The discount to NAV and multi-year track record of premium/discount to NAV data we now have gives us a strong indication of what to expect going forward.You can perform the same analysis on AWF and other similar high yield bond CEFs via the links cited and the thought process I applied to ISD. AWF's discount to NAV and distribution rate are not quite as compelling as ISD's, but it has zero leverage and consequently lower expense ratios coupled with global diversification. These investments are far from ""perfect"", but they are an effective tool to obtain high current income from your existing cash position without taking on significant interest rate or loss of principal risk.Editor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks.

4041318,20757,2017-02-01T00:29:17-05:00,,"The S&P 500 (NYSEARCA:SPY) is on pace for its fourth straight day of losses, which would mark the longest losing streak for the index since the election (leading up to the election, through 11/4, the index was down for nine straight days). While the four-day decline has been relatively modest, whenever equities slump, we like to see how things in the high yield market are playing out in order to see if there are any warning signs in this area of the fixed-income market. Historically speaking, spreads (yield premium over treasuries) on high yield debt have been inversely correlated to the equity market. In other words, when spreads on high yield debt increase, equities usually decline, and vice versa.Taking a look at the chart below, spreads on high yield debt have narrowed significantly over the last year. After hitting a peak of 887 bps back in February of last year, spreads contracted by more than half through their recent lows which occurred last Friday at 393 bps. In yesterday's trading, spreads widened a bit, which is understandable given the increased risk aversion in the market. However, with an increase of just 3 bps, like the equity market, high yield debt markets aren't showing a high degree of concern at this point.Thanks for reading the article.

4039299,96646,2017-01-25T09:15:29-05:00,,"What does the sea change in the economic and market landscape mean for fixed income investors?The U.S. presidential election was a transformative event. It focused tired markets on the potential for tax reform and reduced regulation, which introduced new optimism about economic growth, corporate earnings and a shift from ultra-low inflation. This has contributed to a surge in equities, and a tightening of spreads on corporate bonds, particularly in high yield, while Treasury yields have seen a sharp increase (and commensurate decline in Treasury prices).This is in stark contrast to the pessimism that reigned for the previous two years, when investors were preoccupied with slow growth and what seemed like the stuttering end to a very long business cycle. Flat corporate earnings, the drop of oil prices and the related six-quarter correction in high yield energy assets contributed to the malaise. As recently as the first quarter of 2016, meager U.S. economic growth and uncertain prospects in China were ongoing worries.The nadir of sentiment came in July 2016, at a time when central banks were flirting with the “dark side” of negative policy rates and seeing the limits of extraordinary monetary intervention. From there, yields began to inch up and risk assets gained momentum. The election then accelerated those trends. Interestingly, if you look at where rates are today versus the start of 2016, the trend is less dramatic.It’s possible that investors have exaggerated the potential economic upside from the change in political regimes, but there are certainly significant shifts in the works. Of primary importance is the rewriting of the tax code. House Republicans introduced a framework for corporate and personal income tax reductions back in June. At the time, it was given little chance of success, but given Trump’s campaign promises and Republican control of the executive and legislative branches, reform seems likely, with possible passage in the second or third quarter and implementation in January 2018.Its impact, by many accounts, would be significant. Corporate tax cuts alone have been estimated to increase corporate profitability by 10%, while a portion of personal tax savings is likely to enter the consumer economy. Depending on its size, an infrastructure package could help stimulate growth in the mid- to long term, while reduced regulation could encourage business expansion down the road.Source: Bloomberg, as of November 30, 2016.All told, we anticipate GDP growth moving from around 2% in 2016 to roughly 2.5% in 2017, with possibly higher growth in 2018 depending on the success of tax reform and other initiatives I’ve mentioned.As for interest rates, the Federal Reserve has hesitated to tighten for some time, but optimism about growth and inflation seem to now provide “air cover” to hike rates in a more sustained way. After its December increase, the central bank anticipates raising the fed funds target three times in 2017, to 1.25% - 1.50% by year-end, and could become more hawkish after that if inflation inches above its 2% target, as some expect. Still, its approach remains gradual and data-driven, as the risks of overtightening at this point outweigh those of further accommodation.Source: FRED, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Recession Years: December 2007 to June 2009. Data through December 31, 2016.What does this do to fixed income prospects for the year? It clearly makes things more challenging, particularly for rate-sensitive Treasuries. We believe that the 10-year Treasury yield will rise to about 3.0% this year from its recent 2.4%. The story is more positive for corporate bonds and other credits. Economic firming and better yields are likely to extend expectations for the length of the credit cycle, which should help to further tighten yield spreads over Treasuries. All else equal, the after-tax yields of municipal bond prices would be reduced by tax cuts, but the sector is already cheap relative to other quality bond segments. Overall, we believe it will be important for investors to be flexible in their approach to bonds, to better capitalize on the opportunities beyond the broad indices (See “Fixed Income’s Role” below). That said, the low global rate picture may limit the extent to which U.S. nominal rates rise this year, as foreign investor flows could rush in to capitalize on differences with home country yields.It may seem strange to hear from a fixed income manager, but I believe that this move to higher rates is actually very positive in the long term. The fact is that the major economies in developed markets have, in my view, reached the limits of nonconventional monetary policy. There’s only so much they can do to fight deflation and stimulate growth. Help has to come from other branches of the government through fiscal stimulus, whether tax cuts, reduced regulation or spending, or a combination of all three.Until now, the Fed has missed opportunities to raise rates and normalize the yield curve because of ongoing concerns about growth. Whether you like the new administration or not, its pro-growth bias lays the groundwork for expansion that doesn’t rely on ultra-low rates and a flat yield curve that have penalized savers and encouraged speculative, non-economic business activity. There are clearly risks: If the tough anti-globalization rhetoric of the campaign translates into trade war, that could offset any benefits from tax reform or deregulation. However, I believe that the Trump administration will probably take a more pragmatic approach, akin to the Reagan administration’s assertive negotiations with Germany and Japan 30 years ago. Another less dramatic risk is that the consumer may decide to “take a couple quarters off” due to uncertainty over health care coverage and other worries; that’s not our base case, but it could slow the expansion and cause the Fed to be more cautious.Net-net, I believe recent events have likely broken the logjam on rates. That’s not only good for the long-term health of the economy, but it also will likely recharge the Fed in the future when it once again needs to confront economic weakness or even crisis. Investors have experienced tightening cycles before, but this one is “new” given the low yield levels we will be emerging from. Although the process will likely create some near-term pain for fixed income investors, I believe it also sets the groundwork for a more normal environment and healthier prospects for savers over the course of time."
4039818,21992,2017-01-26T14:34:32-05:00,Bonds have struggled in recent months and have cooled lately following a bounce in recent weeks.Is it finally time to ditch long-term bond holdings?Is a new bear market in bonds now underway?,"The bond market has taken another turn lower following a strong start to the year. And with stocks showing some fresh vigor in recent days, it is reasonable to question whether it may be time to lighten up on high-quality bond allocations. While continued short-term fluctuations should be expected not only from bonds but across the asset class spectrum, now is not the time to change course with existing bond allocations.Everlasting BondsIndeed, it has been a difficult stretch for the bond market over the past several months. After peaking last summer with bond yields touching all-time lows, bonds entered into sharp correction mode through the remainder of 2016.Bonds started to show renewed life starting in mid-December, however. And over the subsequent month through mid-January, bonds as measured by long-term U.S. Treasuries (NYSEARCA:TLT) posted a solid +5.5% rally that outpaced a stock market as measured by the S&P 500 Index (NYSEARCA:SPY) that had entered a consolidation phase following its own sharp rally in the weeks following the election.But over the past two weeks, this bounce in bonds has proven fleeting with prices falling back to earth. This coupled with the jump in stocks over the past few days have put the two major categories back in line with one another from a return perspective since mid-December with one heading in the right direction and the other not.So is it time for investors to quit their high quality bond allocations? While the near-term road may indeed be bumpy in the weeks and months ahead, the answer is no for the following reasons.""Amicitiae nostrae memoriam spero sempiternam fore""(I hope that the memory of our friendship will be everlasting)--Marcus Tullius CiceroInvestors are constantly given to amnesia when it comes to managing their investment portfolios over time. Remember when the financial crisis nearly collapsed less than a decade ago? Remember the returns generated by stocks after reaching historical highs at the turn of the millennium? Apparently many do not - it is important to constantly reflect on the history of the market to understand where it is likely to travel going forward.And while so many in the stock pumping crowd have been quick to declare the end has arrived for the bond market following what has been a less than 75 basis point jump in the 10-Year U.S. Treasury yield (NYSEARCA:IEF) since the election, it may prove unwise to jump so quickly to such conclusions.After all, this is not a bond bull market that has been going on for a few years. In fact, it's not something that has been limited to the post financial crisis period. Instead, today's bond bull market, which remains very much ongoing today by the way, is now entering its 36th year of existence. For more than two secular stock market phases (or three depending on who you might ask, but I'm in the two camp) dating all the way back to 1981, bonds have been in rally mode. Not a bad run to be certain. And just as the current bull market in stocks, which is the second longest in history dating back to March 2009, has proven relentless and seemingly impossible to take down, so too has it been true for the bond market. The only difference is that bonds have been in the practice of repeatedly defying its doubters including the esteemed Oracle of Omaha for more than four times longer than today's stock bull market.Thus, investors would be naïve to think that today's bond bull market will simply go quietly and without one heck of a fight along the way. What will a ""fight"" most likely look like? Extreme interest rate volatility much like the stock market top in 2000 with wild swings in either direction. After all, it will likely require a transformational change in financial market conditions to usher in a new bond bear market.The bond bull market has survived strong economies and recessions as well as both rising and falling interest rate cycles from central banks over the past nearly four decades. And with global economic growth still sluggish and completely imbibed on central bank liquidity coupled with the fact that various risk markets are distorted beyond all recognition across many parts of the world, such is not the environment where investors are likely to throw a 36-year bond bull market overboard. Could high inflationary pro-growth fiscal policies eventually turn the tide in the coming years? Perhaps, but this is a tale told so many times in the past over the past four decades under much better geopolitical and global economic circumstances, yet the bond bull kept charging right through it to the upside.But why would an investor, for example, possibly want to lend money to the U.S. government in the form of U.S. Treasuries for the next 30years and earn a paltry 3%? Sure, I agree that a 3% annualized return over 30 years would likely be a lousy investment. But who said that when I buy a bond that I have to hold it to maturity? Do investors plan on holding the stocks they buy to perpetuity? No. And the same holds true for bonds. After all, one has to look no further than the chart above to see that these same U.S. Treasury bonds that won't mature for another 20 to 30 years generated a positive rate of return approaching 6% in about a month.Nice ClothesThus, the question instead is whether bonds (NYSEARCA:BND) including Treasuries represent an attractive investment not only for the long term as demonstrated by their ongoing bull market but also over the short term and intermediate term. And at present, a number of indicators are providing reassurance for bond investors after what has been a recently difficult stretch.""Vestis virum reddit""(The clothes make the man)--QuintilianusFirst, U.S. Treasuries as represented by the 10-Year U.S. Treasury yield appear to be finding their footing as of late. Yields are currently moving toward the middle of a thick terrain of support and resistance levels that have been in place for the past five years.Once again, the bull market in bonds is not over, as yields have only recently jumped to levels last seen in June 2015 (sarcastic gasp!) and are still below what would have been considered historically low yields in the first three years AFTER the financial crisis from 2008 to 2010. And while it is possible that they may continue to rise toward the 3% level in the coming months, this would be very much within the realm of normal yield movements in the ongoing bond bull market.Second, the primary driver of recently spiking yields (and thus lower Treasury and bond prices) has been the widespread liquidation of Treasuries by China, which has needed to raise cash to support its banking system in the midst of heavy capital outflow activity in recent months. Evidence of this source of downside pressure can be found not only in the Treasury TIC data but also in the recent correlation between the falling Chinese Renminbi currency exchange rate relative to the U.S. dollar and the price of the TLT.Over the past month, evidence has emerged that this pressure from China on U.S. Treasury prices appears to be abating. This is reflected in the renewed strength of the Renminbi since the start of the New Year, suggesting the tide in capital outflows may be heading back out for now.""Sometimes the clothes do not make the man""--George Michael, Freedom '90Of course, U.S. Treasuries have still rolled back over despite this apparent alleviation of downside pressure on prices due to the sale of foreign governments. So what then explains the recent price retreat over the past two weeks? Although the data hadn't really supported the narrative to this point, maybe investors have finally bought into the notion of pro-growth fiscal policies and are finally now rotating out of stocks and into bonds.Once again, the data does not support this narrative. In fact, the exact opposite is true. For according to the Investment Company Institute, the past week saw net inflows into taxable bonds totaling $3.5 billion versus net outflows from domestic equities totaling -$3.7 billion. Perhaps we will see a stark reversal once the next round of weekly data comes in to better explain what we have seen in recent days, but apparently investors have been rotating out of stocks and into bonds as of late.""Semper idem""(Always the same thing)--CiceroOK, but what about expectations for rising interest rates from the U.S. Federal Reserve in 2017? Perhaps some of the pro-growth fiscal policies we have seen started to move in recent days is raising expectations about interest rate hikes and weighing on the bond market. Perhaps, but if so the market itself does not agree.At the start of the year, the following were the probabilities based on CME Fed Fund futures for at least one 25 basis point increase in interest rates by the U.S. Federal Reserve coming out of their four press conference FOMC meetings this year:March 2017: 29.5%June 2017: 71.2%September 2017: 85.7%December 2017: 95.2%And here are the same numbers a few weeks later as of Thursday:March 2017: 25.4%June 2017: 74.5%September 2017: 85.8%December 2017: 94.2%In short, expectations for rate hikes are effectively unchanged from where they were at the start of the year when the bond market was rallying. In fact, they are incrementally lower if anything, as expectations for the first hike is more definitively backed up to June while the notion of more rate hikes by the end of the year is marginally lower.So maybe then the recent pullback in U.S. bonds (NYSEARCA:AGG) is due to the recent compression in the relative yield advantage over competing high-quality government debt from around the world. Maybe, but these spreads remain near historical highs implying that U.S. Treasuries remain an attractive bargain relative to other key safe haven destinations from around the world.U.S. Treasuries continue to enjoy some of the most attractive yield margin over equivalently dated German Bunds in history. For bonds that once were at parity in yield terms only a few years ago, investors are now getting paid more than 2% for owning U.S. Treasuries over their German counterparts.A similar story holds for U.S. Treasuries relative to Japanese government bonds as investors are getting paid nearly a 2.5% premium by owning Treasuries over comparably dated Japanese bonds, which is the highest spread since 2010.The Bottom LineBonds have fallen off a bit in recent days. And they have had a difficult stretch since last summer. But it is important to remember the following. Not only is the nearly four decade long bond bull market still intact with yields finding their footing at current technical support with capital flows recently moving out of stocks and into bonds and interest rate expectations remaining largely in check, but U.S. bonds including Treasuries represent a relative bargain versus the high quality debt available around the world. And as an additional point, if capital markets were to ever take a turn for the worse going forward, the U.S. Treasury market has been and will remain the safe haven of choice for the global investment community.For all of these reasons and more, stay long bonds including U.S. Treasuries as part of a diversified asset allocation that includes stocks and other uncorrelated securities.

4038705,101638,2017-01-23T13:26:17-05:00,"I'm not always bearish.In fact, I've laid out the bull case for stocks and rates in previous posts.Herein, I do the same for credit.","I like to present all sides of an argument.There's this perception that I'm bearish on everything, all the time (well, except for maybe the dollar).To a certain extent, that's correct. I'm bearish on rates (NASDAQ:TLT), I'm bearish on stocks (NYSEARCA:SPY), and I'm bearish on credit. All with good reason - I think.I have, however, presented the bullish case for rates and the bullish case for stocks on any number of occasions (see here on rates for example and here on stocks).What I haven't done is presented a bull case for credit.That's because there isn't one.Just kidding. There are always arguments on both sides of the trade. With credit, I do contend (and I'm hardly alone here) that the spread compression we've seen over the past 12 or so months is, for lack of a better word, absurd. High yield (NYSEARCA:HYG) spreads are now near levels last seen when oil was at $80. So enthusiastic is the market, that earlier this month, Citi decided to do a survey to see how many of their clients thought HY energy would soon trade inside HY as a whole.You won't be able to vote (unfortunately), but I did get a screengrab for you:(Citi)Note the reference to historical spreads. The assumption that the chart above will mean revert is based entirely on the idea that oil prices will continue to rise. Given positioning, you can hardly blame Citi for running this survey:(Charts: Deutsche Bank)As for IG (NYSEARCA:LQD), we've seen spreads tighten dramatically there as well and while there's certainly been no shortage of demand (or supply) when it comes to new issuance, I just can't bring myself to believe that this is realistic:(Chart: Goldman)For those interested in reading a truly devastating indictment of both IG and HY, see here. But as tipped at the outset, I'm going to present the bullish thesis for credit below.Ok, so we're all acutely aware by now that inflation is supposed to move higher going forward (in the US that is - ask Mario Draghi about how that's going in the eurozone).Consumer prices rose by the fastest y/y pace since June of 2014 in December and we've got some easy comps coming up on the energy front (think about how much higher oil prices are now than this time last year). And then there's the whole reflation narrative fueled by hopes of fiscal stimulus.Of course we have to be careful when we pile fiscal stimulus atop an economy that's already running too hot. Here's what I said early Sunday:With that caveat out of the way, it's worth noting that historically, rising inflation has led to tighter credit spreads. Let's look at some charts.First are two graphs that show IG credit tightens when inflation expectations rise (left pane) which isn't entirely surprising given the link between inflation expectations and growth (right pane):(Charts: Citi)Again, we have to bear in mind that too much of a ""good"" thing when it comes to inflation can create problems, but Citi's point is duly noted.Next up is a look at how spread differentials compress between quality buckets (you've got US in the left pane and euro in the right):(Charts: Citi)Obviously that isn't surprising. You'd expect the premium investors demand to hold lower quality paper to fall in an environment where spreads are compressing more generally.Which is precisely why what we see in this last set of charts isn't surprising either:(Charts: Citi)That's just a similar dynamic as that shown in the second set of charts. The spread difference between HY and IG (both in the US and Europe) compresses as inflation expectations rise.So that's the bull case for credit. Citi sums it up in about as simple a manner as possible: ""High inflation expectations are credit positive.""As noted above, you have to incorporate that into an analysis that includes considerations about leverage, fundamentals, and the credit cycle (as delineated quite poignantly by Morgan Stanley in a recent presentation).Considering all of the variables at once isn't easy, but your reaction function has to be as robust as possible if you want to make an intelligent decision.What the charts do show (well, besides the fact that when they're really trying, Citi has some of the best charts on the Street) is that ""there's always a bull case somewhere.""Oh no, I just paraphrased Jim Cramer. That means it's time to take a break.Until next time."
4034603,101638,2017-01-05T14:41:52-05:00,"It's that time again.Time to revisit the ongoing fallout from the global USD shortage.This go around, let's have a look at the prospects for US corporate credit.","It's funny how some topics sit well and others just don't.There doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason to what grates an audience's nerves, although I suppose if I knew everyone's particular circumstances, I could surmise why some subjects are taboo and others aren't.Of course, it's always the contentious topics that create the best discussions and that's precisely because, whether a reader realizes it or not, the only way to become more confident in your convictions is to subject them to scrutiny. And if scrutiny is what you need, I've got a surplus of it stored away in my head.In any event, one subject that everyone seems to find agreeable is the global dollar shortage. I cannot, for the life of me, figure out why everyone is so enthusiastic about a topic that necessitates a discussion of LIBOR and things like cross-currency basis swaps (maybe it's a sense of nostalgia for the Heisenberg gimlet threshold, FRYBOR, and the Albanian girls), but I certainly like writing about it and if you like reading about it then we've got ourselves a win-win.When last I broached the subject, I talked a bit about why foreign investors might be more inclined to run higher FX exposures. More specifically, I highlighted a Morgan Stanley note that quantified the yield pickup a Japanese investor could expect from running an unhedged position in US credit. Basically, you just subtract the cross currency basis from the yield on the instrument you're buying. Here's a visual aid using US 10s:(Chart: Morgan Stanley)So let's think about what that means for IG (NYSEARCA:LQD) credit. Needless to say, corporate credit has benefited from rock bottom rates on DM government debt. Indeed, ZIRP and NIRP have forced investors to reach for yield and that means climbing down the quality ladder, taking more duration risk, or both. As discussed previously, that leads to more IG and HY supply, which in turn means more EPS-inflating buybacks.The fact that rates are even lower in Europe and Japan than they are in the US means foreign money has contributed to the demand for US corporate paper.But now, with the policy divergence between the US and Europe/Japan fueling wider cross-currency bases and thus higher hedging costs, it's entirely possible that foreign demand for US IG paper will begin to dry up, removing one of the market's embedded cushions against a bond sell-off.Here are some bullet points and graphs from Deutsche Bank that illustrate how much lower the (hedged) yield pickup is now in US IG than it was at the start of 2016 (my highlights):Deutsche Bank goes on to note that rising UST yields have helped to mitigate the hunt for yield, but the stronger USD and commensurate rise in hedging costs makes it a zero-sum game.Here's where it gets disturbing. Consider the list of measures foreign investors are taking to increase the yield on their investments (emphasis in original):In other words, foreign money is taking on more and more risk in order to tack on a few extra basis points wherever possible. Needless to say, that money will be glad to adopt a more conservative investment strategy once rates on risk-free DM government debt finally rise.Deutsche Bank also provides a very interesting real-world example of how important the foreign bid is when it comes to mitigating a quick move higher in domestic rates (just like what many observers think we're about to see in the US). To wit (my highlights):In other words, the foreign bid is very useful in a pinch, but the high cost of hedging could discourage inflows.So the moral of the story: The global USD shortage in conjunction with a growing policy divergence between the Fed and other DM central banks threatens to wipe out the foreign bid for US corporate credit in a market that's already nearing the end of the cycle. US credit investors (both IG and HY) should be aware of this dynamic.As for the equity (NYSEARCA:SPY) investors out there, I'll leave you with one chart:(Chart: Morgan Stanley)"
4037527,101638,2017-01-18T05:57:02-05:00,It's difficult to find the right words to describe just how rich corporate debt has become.We already know that the cushion these bonds once enjoyed has completely evaporated.Now let's look at the fundamentals.,"That exchange is from the film ""Margin Call"". In it, Jeremy Irons plays John Tuld, the CEO of a major investment bank and Kevin Spacey plays Sam Rogers, a 34-year veteran of the fictional firm who oversees MBS trading.It's a go-to movie for me on the rare occasions when I leave the desk and as I was watching it for the umpteenth time on Sunday evening, I was reminded of credit markets.Although I could say the same thing about a lot of asset classes (stocks, for example), the numbers in investment grade (NYSEARCA:LQD) and high yield (NYSEARCA:HYG) truly don't ""add up anymore.""And I don't just mean in the narrow sense that ""one plus one no longer equals two"" (another quote from the film). I mean there is a shocking discrepancy between where we are in the cycle, the fundamentals, and spreads.It's not just that high yield has overshot a bit on excessive optimism around promised OPEC production cuts. That may be an example of one plus one not coming out to two. Rather, the whole complex is grossly mispriced. The 12-month spread compression has been so dramatic that one struggles to describe how truly irrational the market seems to have become.Earlier this year, Bloomberg's Lisa Abramowicz said ""buyers of risky corporate bonds are starting 2017 in a precarious position."" Lisa is pretty smart, so we can assume that the only thing keeping her from using much more colorful language to describe the situation was Bloomberg's dedication to a certain level of professional decorum.Indeed, the image at the top of the article - a silhouette of someone walking a tightrope - suggests she's fully aware that calling investors' position ""precarious"" surely qualifies as a candidate for understatement of the year and we're not even three quarters of the way through January. Here are some excerpts from the piece:In technical terms, spreads have compressed to the point that the cushion investors receive from taking on the risk associated with HY has disappeared with remarkable rapidity. The same is true of IG. Have a look for yourself:(Charts: Goldman, my additions)Here's a more straightforward way to visualize it (i.e. by showing explicitly how the cushion has eroded from one Fed hike to the next):(Chart: Morgan Stanley)To be sure, I've been over this rather remarkable spread compression on any number of occasions (most recently here and here). If you want to read Jeff Gundlach's opinion and/or see some incredible charts, I encourage you to take a few minutes and scan those pieces. But for our purposes here, I want to highlight a disconnect between collapsing spreads and fundamentals.""Many analysts think the market is in the later stages of the credit cycle, meaning that credit quality is expected to deteriorate in the near future,"" Bloomberg's Abramowicz goes on to note, in the same piece cited above. That's an important point and one I've made repeatedly. Here's what Morgan Stanley said earlier this month on the subject (my highlights):If we do get the growth the new President has promised, that may end up forcing the Fed's hand and that, as they say, would be all she wrote for the already long in the tooth credit cycle.So now let's look at leverage as a proxy for credit quality (and this is where the insanity really becomes apparent). First, here's a look at gross and net leverage in IG and HY, respectively:(Charts: Morgan Stanley)You can read the titles of the charts for yourself, but basically, there's no recent historical precedent for where we're at leverage wise.Rather than show you each chart in turn, allow me to just save us all some time and present four visuals at once:(Charts: Morgan Stanley)I mean, it's impossible to overstate how absurd this has become. Look at the growth of the HY tail (i.e. the most leveraged names) since 2011 (upper left hand corner). And how about the fact that a quarter of IG firms are leveraged 4 times or more versus just 15% six years ago (bottom left hand corner).And finally, have a look at how tight (compressed) spreads are versus fair value:(Charts: Morgan Stanley)See what I mean when I say this is off the charts (no pun intended) crazy? The disconnect between spreads and fundamentals has reached lunatic proportions.I certainly hope that the investment implications of the above are abundantly clear, but in case they're not, let me quote Lisa Abramowicz one last time:Indeed. And as far as ""pushing the leverage"" goes, I'll leave you with one last graph to chew on:(Chart: SocGen)"
3962386,71975,2016-03-31T16:08:01-04:00,The recent pullback in the high yield sector peaked my interest for a high yield closed-end fund with minimal exposure to the energy industry.The Prudential Short Duration High Yield Fund generated a positive return over the last twelve months in a tumultuous environment for high yield.The fund has minimal exposure to the energy sector and is trading at a discount to NAV of about 8%.I think the fund presents investors with a good opportunity to outperform U.S. equities over the next 6 to 12 months.,"IntroductionAs an investment manager, I prefer to invest in individual bonds-especially when it comes to high yield. I like being able to do my own research on the business, the fixed maturity date, and the potential for outsized gains when the market is wrong. For example, I wrote about these Fortescue bonds about 8 months ago when they were in the low $70s. I recently sold most of my client's holdings for $97.I have not been involved in high yield bond funds for quite a while. The minimal spread over treasuries a few years ago was ridiculous and signaled the peak in the broader high yield market. However, after the recent pounding the asset class has taken, I became interested. I also have some client situations where a high yield fund is more expedient than individual bonds.It is important for investors to understand that the high yield universe has had a strong correlation to the energy sector over the last few years. As oil prices and shares of energy companies have fallen, high yield spreads over treasuries have widened, as the following chart demonstrates:^XOI data by YChartsI suspect that the market may have treated some funds with much less exposure to energy unfairly. There are still a lot of high yield funds for me not to like, but after some research I found one in particular that I think is attractive at present.My High Yield RecipeThe specific ingredients that I am currently looking for in a high yield fund are as follows:I chose these attributes based on my broad market thesis for the next year and a half that expects:I think we have a window of opportunity here for a year or so to make some decent returns owning the right high yield fund. If an investor can capture a 7% to 9% yield, plus 3% to 4% in price appreciation, that equates to a potential return of 10% to 13%. This compares very well with the U.S. stock market. Assuming a 2% dividend yield, the S&P 500 would have to rise to the 2,230 to 2,292 range to generate the same level of return.As mentioned, I would prefer to own a closed-end fund at a discount. This is because I suspect there are some that have been unfairly beaten down by the broader high yield decline. For reference, the following chart shows how two popular high yield ETFs-the SPDR Barclays High Yield Bond ETF (NYSEARCA:JNK) and the iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corp Bond ETF (NYSEARCA:HYG)-have fared over the last five years:JNK data by YChartsThe other advantage of owning a closed-end fund is that if there is another brief panic in the high yield market, the manager does not have to sell securities at steep discounts to meet client redemptions. The closed-end structure is a better option for investors to ride it out.Closed-End Fund ScreenMorningstar's CEF Quickrank feature is a great way to screen closed-end funds. I used it to pull up the universe of high yield closed-end funds. (If you click the ""Expand"" button in the upper right it also shows you the performance for the funds.) After some playing around with ranking different attributes (e.g., discount and leverage), I decided to use the Trailing Total NAV Return as the initial driver for my screen. As mentioned, I wanted a fund that has done particularly well over the last 12 months, probably because it avoided the energy sector. The first domestic focused fund trading at a nice discount was (and still is) the Prudential Short Duration High Yield Fund (NYSE:ISD). The fund's 27% leverage is higher than what I wanted, but I decided to compromise here because I am not concerned about a dramatic increase in interest rates anytime soon (i.e., next two years). Given that the fund is a ""short duration"" high yield fund, its leveraged adjusted duration of 2.7 (as of February 29, 2016) was also an added bonus, since I would prefer to have the lowest duration possible while still clinging to the higher yield.The good news is I also came to find out that Prudential offers a ""sister"" open-ended fund that essentially holds the same portfolio. This fund is the Prudential Short Duration High Yield Income Fund (MUTF:HYSZX). (The ticker shown here is for the Z share class, which is a no-load, lower fee class exclusively for independent investment advisers that my custodian thankfully offers.) This open-ended fund comes without leverage, however, there is no discount to NAV. It is generally a better option for more conservative investors. Like its closed-end sister, it also has been a strong performer over the last twelve months. Its 1.27% return over this period is higher than the more than 500 purely high-yield funds with low initial minimums on Scottrade's mutual fund screener.For the remainder of this article, please assume the closed-end ISD fund is being discussed, since it is my preferred option.Weighing the Yield Versus The Fund HoldingsISD has been paying out a monthly dividend out of income of $.11 for 9 months straight. Assuming this level continues, we are looking at a distribution yield of 8.6% at the current price. The fund is leveraged by 27%, but this still represents a very strong yield for a fund with a duration of 2.7 years. Assessing and understanding the credit risk of the fund's holdings is essential. Let us start at the highest level and work our way down a bit.The credit quality of ISD's holdings, as of February 29, 2016, were as follows (debt related below BBB is considered high-yield):I like the fact that the fund has a higher concentration of debt in the BB category, as opposed to B. With only 6% of the fund's holdings rated CCC, it also has less exposure to the highest risk debt. For a comparison of how the fund compares to some of its peers, here is the current credit quality breakdown of some of the largest high yield funds on the market:The two ETFs listed in this table tend to track various indexes, so their holdings also provide insight into the credit quality breakdown of various high yield indexes. ISD has a slightly more conservative credit exposure than these ETFs and is considerably more conservative than the American High-Income Trust. It's credit quality is a close match to the Vanguard High-Yield Corporate Fund. Incidentally, the American High-Income Trust has about $15 billion in assets. It is down by about 11% over the last year and with 30% of the fund in CCC rated debt looks poised for more pain in the near future.So far so good for ISD. From a credit quality standpoint, it is positioned a bit more conservatively than the broader high yield universe, which is exactly what I wanted.Prudential does a good job on their website of providing information on the fund's holdings. Importantly, they also show the 10 industries that ISD has the most exposure to. Here is the breakdown:This breakdown reveals that the fund has minimal exposure to the energy industry, which was also one of my initial qualifiers. Digging through the detailed holdings also reveals that the fund's holdings are generally tied to the U.S. domestic economy, which was another one of my initial qualifiers. I like the fact that a lot of the fund's holdings are tied to more staples oriented U.S. industries such as healthcare, cable, foods, and telecom. Since I am also bullish on U.S. homebuilders, I especially like the fact that the fund's largest industry exposure is Building Materials & Construction. Furthermore, almost 2% of the fund is in the debt of Beazer Homes (NYSE:BZH). Beazer was my entry for the Seeking Alpha top long idea for 2016. I think the shares are significantly undervalued and its debt will continue to experience ratings upgrades in the coming years as the business fundamentals improve. (I also hold Beazer debt is some client portfolios). The fund also holds the debt of KB Home (NYSE:KBH), Lennar (NYSE:LEN), and William Lyon Homes (NYSE:WLH).Strategic ConclusionISD is trading at a significant discount to NAV of almost 8%. Based on my research, I think the fund has been unfairly punished by the market. It generated a positive return over the last year during a tumultuous environment for high yield and has wisely avoided the energy sector. Very few high yield funds were able to do this. Just a few years ago, the fund was trading at a premium.At the current price, I think ISD presents investors with the opportunity to earn outsized returns over the next twelve months and more so in the near term as risk assets continue to rebound. The fund has three avenues to earn returns: (1) a continued rebound in the broader high yield sector, (2) a decrease in the fund's discount to NAV, and (3) monthly dividend income. Given the quality of this fund, investors could conceivably earn a return in the 15% to 20% range over the next six to twelve months. A 5% increase in the fund's NAV from a broader high yield rebound, a 4% decrease in the fund's discount to NAV (which means the price increases by 4%), and an 8% dividend yield gets you into the middle of that range.I'm not concerned about the fund's leverage as I expect interest rates to remain low for at least a couple more years. A significantly higher increase in interest rates in the near term would signal economic strength and benefit the high yield sector. Furthermore, the fund's duration is low, which gives it an added advantage in such an environment.I would compare the level of risk in high yield debt to that of large capitalization U.S. stocks. Given this, I think ISD presents an opportunity to outperform equities, while taking on a similar level of risk. I hold this fund in some client portfolios and will likely continue to add to positions in the near term.Promoting Quality DiscussionIn order to promote quality discussion about the topics I address in my Seeking Alpha articles, I have decided to give away a free copy of my book, The Truth On Investing: From The Darkness Of The Crowd To The Light, to the individual who provides what I think is the most thoughtful comment on the article. This can also be a quality view that is opposed to my thesis. I will pick this person about a month after the article is published to allow time for comments. If there are no exceptional comments, then no book will be given out.

4035120,24206,2017-01-09T03:13:36-05:00,,"This week, the Federal Reserve issued their latest meeting minutes. They viewed the labor market positively: unemployment and initial claims for unemployment were low while wages were increasing at slightly higher rates. PCEs were growing moderately and future indicators of consumer spending were bullish. Industrial production was recently unchanged, but mostly due to a drop in utility output. Business investment was still weak, but recent indicators showed a slight increase. The Fed is projecting slightly higher growth due to a perceived increase in fiscal spending and an increase in price pressures due to recent increases in energy prices.Credit markets are in strong good shape. Although rising inflation expectations (as measured by the spread between treasuries and TIPS) have led to a selloff in the treasury market, rates are still historically low:Corporate yields have also increased since the election:AAA (in blue) are near 5-year highs. But BBB credit (in red) is still low by recent standards. The recent increase in yields explains higher corporate issuance since the first of the year (subscription required):Consumer credit is also plentiful (from the Minutes):Consumers are in much stronger financial shape. The financial obligations and debt service payments ratio are near multi-decade lows as are credit card charge-offs (subscription required):There is nothing in the credit markets that indicates a problem is coming down the pike in the next 12-18 months.The Fed has not only increased their growth forecast, but also their inflation expectations. The former is higher due to the incoming administration's promise for lower taxes and higher federal spending, while the increase in the CMT-TIPS spreads has caused the latter. Increased federal spending is not guaranteed. While the Republicans control the House and have of late generally been more accepting of Trump's positions, a large conservative core may not want to increase deficit spending. Tax reform is a far more achievable goal. While most commentators have not offered this explanation, the OPEC supply restriction deal is just as likely an explanation for increased inflation expectations as the potential for an increase in federal spending and tax reform.Hale Stewart, XE.com"
4025419,98386,2016-11-22T07:59:42-05:00,"Since U.S. Treasury yields hit an all-time low during the third quarter, the hunt for yield has been top of mind for investors.We wonder if the answer is right in front of us, but we are too focused on what we know to see it.A closer examination of traditional fixed income markets reveals opportunities to find the yield investors seek, but they may not realize is available.","Since U.S. Treasury yields hit an all-time low in the beginning of the third quarter, the so-called hunt for yield has been a major topic for investors. Yet the search for yield reminds us of the famous psychology experiment and later YouTube sensation of The Invisible Gorilla. In that video, observers are asked to closely watch players and count how many times they passed a ball back and forth. As the observer focuses on the number of passes, a person in a gorilla suit walks through the middle of the screen. As comically obvious as this sounds, about half of viewers have no awareness of the gorilla whatsoever.As we repeatedly hear the accepted orthodoxy that there is no yield in fixed income and investors continue to look to alternatives either within or across asset classes, we ponder if the answer is right in front of us, hiding in plain sight, but we are too focused on what we know to see it. As we examine the fixed income landscape, we try not only to count the number of passes, but to see the gorilla as well. We examine four of these invisible dancing gorillas that offer investors yield, but are hidden to those focused elsewhere.Gorilla #1: What if the Grass isn't GreenerAs we have discussed in previous pieces, the U.S. yield environment remains quite attractive in a global context. The yield differential between the U.S. and other developed markets remains large and that has drawn international capital to U.S. markets. This substitution effect, whereby international investors buy U.S. high quality assets fixed income assets in place of their local market assets, has provided support for U.S. yields in recent years. From the non-U.S. perspective, it is important to note, these purchases are not a trade-off of liquidity for yield, they are in fact a trade up in both.While often a search for investment alternatives takes one beyond the boundaries of their domestic market, no such travel is necessary for American investors as global yields remain below American ones and the U.S. market remains the largest and most diverse available.Gorilla #2: Apples to ApplesA major topic continues to be high dividend paying equities and the seeming oddity that equities are paying comparable or at times a higher dividend than bonds are paying. The much touted high dividend equities approach (as measured by the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index) offered a dividend yield of 2.5% at quarter end, above the yield-to-worst (YTW) for the Barclays U.S. Aggregate of below 2%. On a current yield basis, a more comparable methodology to dividend yield, however, the Barclays U.S. Aggregate offered a 2.9% yield at quarter end. Since the quarter has ended and rates have drifted higher, fixed income yields have only become more attractive. The 10 year Treasury ended October at 1.83%, approximately 30 basis points higher than September, a trend which has continued in November.Further, the U.S. fixed income market does contain pockets of the yield that investors are seeking, but many of these opportunities are obscured by the overall index averages. For example, the U.S. Aggregate yield is largely driven by the 40% of the index that is U.S. Government securities and a 10 year Treasury yield of 1.59% at quarter end. As is typical, the non-government sectors within the index offer higher yields including U.S. Corporates offering 3.8% current yield at the end of September. In this more apt comparison, equity dividend yields fall below the yield of U.S. corporates, while of course adding higher equity risk to a portfolio than would U.S. corporates.Active equity portfolios may be able to create even more attractive dividend yields, a point we would echo for active fixed income portfolio.Source: Barclays, S&P 9/30/2016Gorilla #3: Missing the Trees for the ForestExamining overall corporate yields excludes the various pockets of yield within this 5,900 security index. For example, BBB securities are the largest quality cohort within corporates (48%) and offered a 3.3% YTW at the end of October. Further, the 10+ year component of U.S. corporates is the largest maturity segment of the index, comprising over 31% of corporate market value, and offers a YTW of 4.2%. Credit curve steepness is an important consideration - though it is important to observe how much the yield curve has flattened in the past three years in the U.S., credit curves remain steep offering meaningful premia to investors.When yield alternatives, notably private credit and infrastructure, are juxtaposed to their traditional counterparts with comparable maturities and credit risks, the yield pick-up is much less than one might anticipate. In effect, the biggest difference is the illiquidity premium. The lack of pricing for these assets due to illiquidity creates a liquidity/volatility paradox, as less frequently priced securities appear to show lower volatility. The liquidity of public debt, with the option to exit the position daily or hold to maturity, seems the more favorable risk of the two in our estimation.Gorilla #4: The Rising TideIt is not only the long end that is offering value. Leaving the confines of the standard index, but remaining rather conventional, we examine investment grade floating rate notes which have had an interesting and significant change in yields of late.In this case the shift in yields comes from the regulatory changes in money market funds where (to simplify a complex set of regulations) government securities will now be treated more beneficially than corporate ones for purposes of ensuring a daily NAV of 1 in money market funds. The result has been a marked increase in LIBOR rates vs. short term Treasuries. Thereby increasing yields for securities with coupons with a component tied to LIBOR, such as floating rate notes. It is also important to distinguish between investment grade corporate floaters and bank loans, another popular instrument. By contrast to bank loans, corporate floaters are highly liquid, investment grade instruments with no LIBOR floors, so the impact of the increase in LIBOR benefits the holder as soon as the reset date of the instrument.Outlook & Positioning:The increase in yields in the beginning of the fourth quarter has strengthened the case for the availability of yields in traditional fixed income. Contrary to long-standing expectations of significantly rising rates, the recent increase comes on the back of a significant decline in rates year-to-date in 2016 and in our view is a healthy bounce from the all-time lows set in the beginning of the third quarter. On balance, we view the more likely drift of rates to be higher, but this is against a backdrop of long Treasuries having returned nearly 15% in the first three quarters of the year.With the continued focus on the Fed and the second rate hike in this cycle expected in December, short-term volatility may escalate if Fed messaging is muddled regarding expectations for 2017. Particularly following the market reaction to their September 2015 statement, the Fed is keenly aware of potential consequences of its actions (or inactions) and is likely to tread lightly on policy and messaging. The possibility of short-term disruptions do not shift our expectation for the fixed income landscape and our focus remains on the underpinning of the U.S. economy, the differences between global monetary regimes and the specifics of each investment that will have the greater impact to markets and client portfolios.As fixed income markets have been returning to a more fundamental and nuanced pricing of risk, we have viewed that as an opportunity to exit positions that we either maintained or added opportunistically during bouts of volatility in the third quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016. We have either replaced these with new mispriced assets as available or with more liquid, high quality assets when spread differentials were not justified.Conclusions:In our view, a closer examination of traditional fixed income markets reveals opportunities to find the yield investors seek, but they may not realize is available. Investors' expectations and consensus opinion on investment options may be blinding us to that which is often times right in front of us. Further, many attractive options for investors are masked by the overall market, leading to different perceptions of the trade-offs investors are undertaking.While most investors recognize the inherent risks when so many market participant are seeking the same objective, it has not yet deterred more exotic approaches to yield generation. These take many forms, but by and large can be summarized as a trade-off of liquidity, quality or both for yield. We continue to see opportunities in traditional fixed income and view the relative yields from other sectors as less than meets the eye when placed into the proper context of maturity, quality and liquidity.There are indeed many balls in motion and it is easy to be distracted by them and focus only on the task of counting the number of passes. While counting the passes, we are also attempting to find the dancing gorilla in our midst.

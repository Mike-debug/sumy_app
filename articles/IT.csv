4187762,104586,2018-07-17T12:29:15-04:00,"Gartner is a well-known IT research firm.The company decided to acquire CEB to leverage an expanded scope of operations and a larger market opportunity.While Gartner is no stranger to M&A, the CEB acquisition was five times as large as the 8 acquisitions that Gartner had made from 2005-2015.Gartner's successful track record of integrating smaller acquisitions, juxtaposed with the inherent risk in the large and complex deal (such as CEB) makes it a wait and watch play.","Gartner (NYSE:IT) is a play on the rising need of IT advisory. The company's acquisition of CEB is a stark departure from the set size and scope of Gartner's earlier acquisitions. The complexity of this deal makes it difficult to assess the combined entity without some quarters of operating history.Gartner is a well-known brand in the technology research and advisory space - Gartner's Magic Quadrant is an industry standard for assessing the market standing of IT companies in a particular vertical.The CEB AcquisitionThe recent acquisition of CEB has helped Gartner to expand its capability set.Source: GartnerThis acquisition is also expected to help expand Gartner's market opportunity to almost $200 billion from an earlier $60 billion.Source: Gartner 2016 Investor PresentationSource: Gartner 2018 Investor PresentationIn order to effectively capture this market share, the company has also reorganized its business units as Global Technology Sales (GTS) and Global Business Sales (GBS).Source: Gartner 2018 Investor PresentationThe new structure is aimed at capturing cross-selling opportunities. The management notes:Also, productivity improvement across legacy CEB (now GBS) has significant scope to catch up to the levels of the legacy Gartner (now GTS).Source: Gartner 1Q18 Results PresentationWhile the management claims that the CEB integration is almost complete, the real benefit would start showing in the numbers only when the combined entity starts delivering on synergies.Inorganic growth is not new for Gartner. The company had spent ~$700 million on eight acquisitions between 2005 and 2015.Source: Gartner 2016 Investor PresentationHowever, with a price tag of $3.5 billion, the CEB acquisition was in a different league. This led to the company borrowing an additional $2.8 billion, taking the total debt to $3.3 billion at the end of F2017.To streamline post-acquisition operations, Gartner recently (in April 2018) divested CEB Talent Assessment for $400 million and CEB Workforce Surveys $29 million. The proceeds from these deals were used to reduce the debt that was raised for the CEB acquisition. For F2017, the divested assets contributed $223 million to revenue and $47 million to EBITDA. For F2018, these assets were expected to do $229 million in revenue and $48 million in EBITDA.The acquisition of CEB has made Gartner optimistic about the head of HR referring to other functional areas. However, this logic is slightly unclear. In fact, it does raise certain questions: (1) Why would the head of IT take recommendations about IT systems from any other functional head? (2) And in case they do, how will such a referral be better than Gartner's existing brand image (everyone in the IT world knows about the Magic Quadrant)?If the answer to the first question is that it is ""helpful compared to just a plain cold call"", this is a weak argument to rationalize a $3.5 billion buy! And in case Gartner's image has taken such a beating that they have been compelled to convince the HR departments to sway decision making, this is an even more dangerous path to go down on. It may be reading too much between the lines, but Gartner has indeed lowered its long-term growth targets already:Source: Gartner 2016 Investor PresentationSource: Gartner 2018 Investor PresentationHowever, the market perception of the company continues to be quite strong. The stock price appreciated 20% in F2017 and 12% YTD.As businesses become global, the associated complexities are increasing. This has led to the continual evolution of IT systems. Gartner has been at the forefront of predicting industry evolution and assessing vendor capabilities in an evolving market. This has made spending on Gartner services a non-discretionary item for IT managers, something well reflected in the company's stock price. During 2009-2017, Gartner's stock has given a CAGR of 24% vs. a CAGR of 20% for NASDAQ over the same period.Source: Yahoo FinanceThe non-discretionary nature of spending on Gartner products is further evident in the correlation between change in Gartner's stock price and the change in global IT spending.Source: Gartner, Yahoo FinanceThe correlation between Gartner's stock price and global IT spending stood at 56%, for the period 2009-2017. This correlation increases to 93% if the data for the last four years (2014-2017) is considered.Having established that Gartner is a proxy to the rising global IT spending, it is difficult to ignore the stock. At the same time, the complexities arising from the CEB deal are also hard to overlook. This confusion gives rise to two scenarios:The likelihood of either of these scenarios is difficult to ascertain, given the moving parts in this entire equation. Thus, it might be prudent to wait out a few quarters before deciding on buying or selling the stock."

The company is trading at high multiples and depending on future growth. At this price, I don't see any margin of safety. It's an interesting company once the market would get more realistic about it. It provides IT research and consulting services. Obviously, this is a sector with great growth potential. Gartner doesn't pay a dividend but uses share repurchases to support the share price. In 2017, it had a large increase in debt because of the CEB acquisition. The company did manage this debt well and reduced it back to a normal level.In this article, I am going to analyze Gartner with basic multiples and a DCF model. I believe the company will grow strongly in the next few years. However, the price for this growth is too high for me. Last quarter's profit warning did reduce the share price. I believe a far further reduction is still necessary or Gartner should do an amazing acquisition. Such an acquisition could also carry new risks.Source: Yahoo FinanceGartner is an IT service company. It provides research and advice for other companies about their digitization. This is a lucrative and high-growth business with a lot of potential left. A lot of companies are adapting to new situations, and Gartner helps them to find the way. It only has a small portion of this total sector, which leaves a lot of potential.Source: Gartner websiteInvesting in stocks is about finding the right companies at the right price. By picking the right companies for the right price, I want to outperform the market. This without adding more risk. If I look at Gartner, I'm pretty sure this is a beautiful company with a lot of potential left. It is profitable, has good growth potential and doesn't carry too much debt. So, it certainly fits as a ""right"" company. The price is another matter.For me, Gartner is straight up too expensive at this point. The share price is a bit depressed since the latest quarter statement, but still at a high price from different points of perspective. First of all, look at the P/E for 2019. This is between 39.8 and 42.7, based on Gartner's latest guidance. Analysts do expect a big jump in EPS next year, which would push the P/E to 31.3 in 2020. Still, it looks like Gartner is priced for perfection.Grow companies aren't always easy to value by basic measures like P/E. The discounted cash flow model can help to calculate current value by valuing expected future cash flows with a discount.Based on my DCF model, I get a fair value of about $100 per share. My assumptions of growth are based on the company's medium-term objectives, as stated in its Investor Day slideshow. As the discount rate or WACC, I used 8.7% based on GuruFocus.Source: Author's calculationsThe DCF model isn't perfect, and small changes in growth rates or WACC have a big effect on the share price. For me, it is clear that Gartner is expensive. The company would have to achieve its maximum growth rate of 14% and a terminal growth of 3.5% to be valued at $144 today.This DCF model doesn't even count in the effect of stock-based compensations. That would deteriorate the fair value further.It bothers me that Gartner doesn't pay dividends. It doesn't even plan to pay dividends. The company does use share buybacks to spend its free cash flow. This good for its share price, but doesn't only reward current investors. The management remuneration consists in large part of stock-based compensation. So, they also gain by pumping up the share price. In the long term, I don't believe this is the best strategy for spending cash flows. Dividends could encourage management to keep their shares.Subsequently, the insider trading only shows the selling of shares. Most of these shares were acquired by exercising stock options.Source: MarketBeatAs mentioned, Gartner does have a share repurchase program in place. The company spends a decent amount of the cash flows on these repurchases and plans to continue to do so in the future. This supports the share price but doesn't make sense to me. Buybacks are interesting when companies are valued below their true value. Even if Gartner isn't overvalued, it is hard to argue it is undervalued. Opportunistic share buybacks aren't quite possible yet.Source: Second-quarter earnings supplementGartner carries a decent amount of debt of about $2.2 million, or $2 million after the deduction of cash. The net debt/EBITDA was at 2.9 in its latest quarter. This a very nice reduction since 2017, when it was 4.1 due to the acquisition of SEB.Source: Second-quarter earnings supplementGartner plans more mergers and acquisitions in the future, which could drive debt back to a higher level. It could also purchase companies by paying in new shares, which causes dilution for current shareholders.Source: Second-quarter earnings supplementIn Gartner's latest quarter, it disappointed with a profit warning for 2019. The company pointed to 2 factors for this profit warning in the earnings call. The first is a combination of lower sales in non-subscription and subscription-based revenues. The non-subscription revenues are slowing, since these are historical. This is a normal evolution, going a bit faster than expected. It could be worrying that subscription-based revenues slow as well, but most likely it's just a bump in the growth road ahead.The second reason was higher costs due to fulfilling open sales positions quicker than expected. This probably a good sign for future growth, but it does lower the estimates for now. So, while a reduction in expectations is never a good sign, it doesn't look too worrying for Gartner.In light of Gartner's current valuation, I do feel like there is no room left for more disappointments. While the revised guidance is bad news for this year, next year's earnings are probably safe. In the future, Gartner should also be able to grow at a decent rate. Its own projections of 10-14% growth are realistic.If we compare Gartner to other research companies like IHS Markit Ltd. (INFO) or Forrester Research Inc. (FORR), it looks like this is an expensive sector to invest in. This report is not meant to be a comparison between these companies. The basic multiples do give an idea of where Gartner is.Source: Seeking AlphaBased on these measures, Gartner is valued higher than both Forrester and IHS Markit. So, in comparison to its closed peers, Gartner is costly. Based on these basic multiples, the downside of 30% to about $100 seems valid.Gartner is active in an attractive sector with great growth. Its prospects are good. The share price is way too high, and Gartner keeps spending money on its shares. The stock has to come down a lot before it becomes an attractive investment. For now, I would stay on the sidelines until the price gets to a more reasonable level. I don't like shorting stocks and don't do so myself.

4171509,21434,2018-05-08T22:10:49-04:00,2018 will be a pivotal time for the adoption of new-era technologies.Many companies need help from firms like Gartner to move in the right direction.Gartner itself never stopped growing the top and bottom lines.,"How does the old saying go? Always the bridesmaid, but never the bride? That’s IT research outfit Gartner (IT). It’s an expert on the technology sector and the companies that make it up, leaned on by organizations in need of information, and sought out by investors hungry for data. But, it’s often overlooked as nothing more than a middleman. Most people don’t realize it’s an investment in and of itself.Indeed, not only is it an investment choice, it’s a compelling one right now coming out of a disastrous response to February’s fourth-quarter report and the subsequent reversal of that weakness in response to Tuesday’s first-quarter report.IT shares are still down 7% from their February peak despite Tuesday’s 5% bounce. That leaves plenty of room for more upside, though the stock may have much more ground to make up than most investors realize. IT shares have been stagnant for nearly a year now, with investors doubting it was going to do what analysts have said it was going to do.That’s the long way of saying it’s a buy.For the initiated, Gartner is… difficult to explain. It’s not complicated. Just difficult. In layman’s terms, it sells information and advice to companies that know they need help taking their information technology arm into the future, but don’t know where to begin.The data and outlooks it offers to individuals, and investors? That’s just the tip of the iceberg, dished out more as a courtesy and for publicity purposes. The really good stuff is the revenue-bearing product.Those who know the Gartner story well will know, of course, that the final quarter of last year wasn’t a great one for the organization. Earnings of $1.17 per share were up from the year-ago tally of 97 cents, but missed estimates of $1.28 per share. Meanwhile, revenue grew to $1.01 billion, but still fell short of the $1.03 billion the pros were calling for. The rhetoric changed on Monday though, with first-quarter earnings of 72 cents per share handily topping estimates of only 58 cents. Revenue of $963.6 million was also better than the $929.1 million the pros were calling for.Just as important, sales were up 16% year-over-year, and EBITDA grew 13% from Q1-2017’s figure.What’s most surprising about last quarter’s numbers was that most traders seemed to be surprised, as if Gartner hasn’t been on a respectable growth trajectory for the past several years.Yes, acquisitions have helped. Last year alone, the company acquired business intelligence outfit L2 and human resources management technology company CEB. A couple of deals made in 2016 also offered up a top-and-bottom-line boost. What’s gone largely unappreciated about the deal-making is that it’s not only accretive, but business-building. Analysts are looking for more double-digit growth this year and next, under the assumption that nothing new will be added to the mix in the meantime.Source: Thomson Reuters, image made by authorThe specifics: Analysts are calling for earnings of $3.88 per share this year, up from 2017’s $3.31, and then moving to $4.60 next year. The company offered guidance of $3.51 to $3.91- probably a low-ball figure. Gartner also suggested it may generate revenue of between $3.9 billion and $4.0 billion in 2018, versus the market’s consensus outlook of $4.14 billion. Again, the company may be downplaying its expectations, just as a precaution following a devastating Q4 miss.But why might the IT advisory outfit be in a position to underpromise and overdeliver in an environment where any organization that wants to build an app/get into the cloud/embrace the IoT lean on Gartner going forward if they haven’t yet?If that’s your stance, you may be coming to that conclusion based on what you see. Take a look at what you don’t see.Yes, it appears that the organizations that have a clear purpose for technology in mind and a staff that knows how to get from point A to point B are easily entering the new era of tech. Case in point: American Airlines (AAL), with some help from International Business Machines (IBM), successfully developed some new tools and overhauled a key consumer-facing app to ultimately create a better consumer experience.American Airlines knew exactly what it wanted to do, however, and knew what it didn’t know. That’s why it enlisted the help of IBM to fulfill its vision. Most organizations aren’t even able to articulate their visions, and without the right questions in hand are unable to move forward with the adoption of next-generation opportunities.Some stark details validate the idea.One of them was offered by a Commvault survey performed in the middle of last year, which indicated 81% of business leaders who were moving certain functions to the cloud were mostly doing so only because they feared missing out on the cloud advancements that may (or may not) come after that. It’s not exactly the purposeful move that could catapult a business. A similar survey taken by NewVantage Partners earlier this year determined that while most firms have embraced the idea of collecting more data, only about one-third of them say they’ve developed a data-driven culture.Meanwhile (and on a related note), only one in ten consumers fully trust their devices are protected from hacking, according to a survey from Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO). Then again, who can blame them when corporations themselves are no more certain? Ernst & Young’s 2017 Global Information Security Survey (GISS) determined that 70% of corporate chiefs felt they would need 25% more cybersecurity funding to fully fend off cybersecurity threats.To the extent the headwind is simply not even knowing what questions to ask or what viable choices are available, Gartner can help get these companies all the way over the hump.And the hump is coming, one way or another… with most of that arrival slated for this year.So yes, as much of a media machine as Gartner may seem to be on the surface, it’s the 90% of the iceberg that’s under the surface and out of sight that makes the company one of the market’s better-kept secrets.The good news is, investors are slowly but surely figuring this out. The bad news is, as they figure it out, bullish pressure is being applied to IT stock. If this interest’s growth persists, shares could easily break out of a trading range that’s been in place since the middle of last year. This week’s thrust may well be the beginning of that move, fueled by the fact that the bulls have some lost time to make up for.That said, stepping in immediately after Tuesday’s post-earnings surge might be less than ideal. If nothing else, waiting for the euphoria to wear off might prove wise, even if IT shares don’t peel back to the 200-day moving average line around $123. If that happens, IT is a buy then and there. If it doesn’t happen within a few days, pick your spot anywhere between Tuesday’s close and the 200-day moving average line.Source: TradeStationFor the time being, we’ll use the 20-day and 50-day moving average line, both around $120, as stop-loss point.Target-wise, let’s start with January’s high of $142 as a checkpoint target, meaning we don’t necessarily want to bail out there. We just want to re-assess and see if the rally is unfurling too quickly. If it’s moving slow and steady at the time – like IT shares traveled in 2016 and 2017 - we’ll stick with it. If we’re not seeing that, we may head to the sidelines for a while.For the record though, a long-term valuation-based target could be well in excess of $142.‘Long term’ is the key term there. IT shares are already richly-priced on a go-forward basis, and it’s going to take some unexpected growth and a handful of healthy beats if shares are going to be a huge winner in the meantime. That’s not a realistic short-term outlook, however; this really isn’t a great trade for an investor that can’t commit for at least a year. For those who can wait a year or more though, a move to the $150 area is plausible.Still, this is a name you can’t set and forget. Scoot your stops up as progress is made, and don’t be in a particular hurry to get in. The flipside? This stock is still less volatile than most other technology-consulting companies.Gartner is likely to become one of the inaugural holdings in my soon-to-launch premium newsletter.

4148855,104119,2018-02-21T12:20:35-05:00,"Gartner overpaid to acquire CEB, based on its 30-day weighted average closing stock price, 60-day volume weighted average closing price, and price on the last trading day.That sort of thing is great for CEB shareholders and bad for IT shareholders - especially when it's partially funded with IT stock.Nearly half of its capital structure is goodwill.It doesn't make any money.Its earnings yield is 255 basis points below the risk-free rate.","Gartner Inc. (IT) is an information technology research and advisory company that caught my attention due to its high price-to-earnings (3933x) and recent, partially dilutive acquisition. These are things that, in my opinion, may represent reasons to avoid this stock, based on what research suggests about subsequent period returns.As Eugene A. Hall said about the CEB acquisition:As we know, Gartner paid a premium to acquire CEB. It overpaid based on CEB's 30-day weighted average closing stock price, 60-day volume weighted average closing price, and price on the last trading day prior to the announcement. That sort of thing is great for CEB shareholders and bad for IT shareholders. Emphasis added:IT paid for this acquisition with cash and stock. And, as we know, acquisitions funded with equity tend to fare poorly for investors:As Fuller et al conclude in the Journal of Finance (emphasis added):Using partial equity to fund an acquisition may signify that management considers its shares overvalued. If shares are overvalued, a company gains more by offering stock. One possibility is that Gartner management partially funded this acquisition with equity was to take advantage of its belief that shares were overpriced.Goodwill represents the premium a company pays to acquire another company. Goodwill now makes up about 45% of its capital structure.Source: YCharts quarterly numbers & author's compilationGoodwill can become impaired. With nearly 45% of its capital structure comprised of goodwill, goodwill impairment is a risk for IT shareholders.The other problem with IT is that it doesn't make any money. It has a TTM profit margin of just 0.10% and an operating margin of -0.19%. Running a correlation analysis, we can see that IT's TTM revenue and net income are negatively correlated to a point of -0.86%.IT Revenue (TTM) data by YChartsAs Craig Saffion says in the recent conference, ""we are investing to support and drive future revenue growth."" But when will that growth translate into earnings? Its net income is lower than it was in 2010.Why is net income so low? Because its total expenses increase in tandem with its revenues (and have slowly - and then rapidly - begun to outstrip it).IT Revenue (TTM) data by YChartsNo matter how much it churns out sales growth, Gartner may struggle to turn that growth into profit. The more it sells, the less profit it seems to make as a percentage of revenue. Yet profitability is critical to a company's long-term success. And without some operational cutbacks, it's hard to see how IT will grow its profits in the future.To make matters worse, this company is priced expensively. At a P/E of 3,933x and an industry average P/E of 21, Gartner is 187x more expensive than the industry on a P/E basis. The reason I harken back to P/E, even though it's fallen out of favor with revenue-driven investors, is simply because the evidence supports it: research links high P/Es to lower returns and lower price appreciation in the following decade.With a P/E that high, investors are, in my opinion, paying far too much for each dollar of Gartner earnings. For investors unimpressed with P/E, it seems that Gartner does not offer significant value on other measures, either, when compared with some of its industry peers.Source: YCharts & author's compilationFor example, DXC trades at less than half of its P/S and 117x less its P/E. A P/E of 33 is still on the expensive side - historically speaking - but nowhere near the highs of nearly 4k times each dollar of earnings.Don't forget to note IT's earnings yield, as seen in the table above, is 255 basis points below the U.S. 10 year bond rate.If a company's earnings yield is significantly below the risk-free rate, investors won't have to look far to find a better value for significantly less risk. For certain companies - let's say, a junior minor, or a new biotech with a potential blockbuster drug, I - reluctantly! - would be willing to consider paying such an earnings premium. In the case of IT, I would not recommend investors take on that risk."
4043178,24992,2017-02-07T03:11:53-05:00,"Shares are trading at a 70% premium to the overall market.
        Recent acquisition of CEB adds risk to Gartner balance sheet.
        Net earnings results since 2011 have been skewed by massive share buybacks.
        ChartMasterPro downward price target of $92.00.","In the final two months of 2016, the shares of Gartner Inc. (NYSE:IT) jumped by approximately 17% from the mid $80s to $100 per share. In this article I want to work out whether this is reasonable in light of the company's financials and the recent announcement of the CEB (NYSE:CEB) acquisition. Although the financial performance has been generally good, in my view the acquisition of CEB runs the significant risk of destroying value, and burdening Gartner's capital structure for years. In my view, shares have little room to rise from these levels and very far to fall. I think investors should avoid this stock until the price makes more sense.Financial PerformanceA review of the financials indicates that things have been steadily improving for Gartner for some time. Revenue has been climbing steadily, and, while net income has been more volatile, it too has risen nicely since 2010. As mentioned above, the third quarter of 2016 was much stronger than the same period in 2015. There's obviously much to like here.The only problem of note is the fact that the company has spent approximately 50% more in acquiring treasury shares since 2011 than they have earned. This has obviously positively affected earnings per share and driven the stock price, but, since debt more than quadrupled over the same time period, such massive purchases might not have been in the best interests of shareholders.The CEB AcquisitionOn January 5, 2017, Gartner announced that they would be acquiring CEB for $2.6 billion in cash, and stock. Additionally, Gartner will be assuming approximately $700 million of CEB debt, making this a total transaction value of about $3.3 billion. This transaction basically doubles Gartner's debt load, which is obviously troublesome in my view as it adds a great deal more financial risk to the overall company.In return for this $3.3 billion, the company hopes that the acquisition will be immediately accretive to EPS, eventually generate double digit EPS gains, and provide a ""strategic combination (that) broadens capabilities to capture expanded addressable market.""Adding to the obvious, and quantifiable risks present, is the fact that most acquisitions fail. Possibly this acquisition won't fail, although there's no reason to believe it'll be a success. After all, didn't the failed acquisitions seem to make sense at the time? The bottom line is this acquisition adds to the level of risk present. Investors should demand a higher return for taking on that risk and return is a function of buying a great business at a reasonable price. A look at the stock suggests that the return prospects are actually poor going forward.The StockAs I've said repeatedly, the most significant determinant in the return you make on an investment is the price you pay for it. If you can acquire a company at a cheap price, you're much more likely to generate positive returns. If that company is trading for a premium, over the long term it gets harder to generate decent returns. In spite of all of the risks here, Gartner is actually trading at a significant premium of about 70% over the market on a PE basis. On a price to free cash flow basis, the company is trading near the high end of its historical range. The same can be said of EV/EBIT, Price to Book and a host of other valuation measures. Thus, marginal investors are being asked to pay a significant premium for future cash flows for this company at a time when the risk to future cash flows grows.Technical SnapshotAs per our ChartMasterPro Daily Price Model, the trend for IT would turn Bearish with a daily close below $99.00. We believe the bearish break would propel the stock down to the $92.00 level over the next six months.As you are aware, we prefer to anticipate technical signals when we can, if the fundamental analysis supports what we see on the charts. Today we purchased the IT 17MAR17 100 Put Options which will provide us with approximately 17x leverage on our SHORT trade. Our initial stop-loss exit signal will be a daily close above $101.00.For investors in the shares we recommend that you SELL to avoid any further drop in the share price.ConclusionI want to avoid acquisition situations because the odds against success seem so high. If someone was willing to accept odds on the 15% chance that this acquisition works out, they should be compensated for taking on that risk with an inexpensive stock price. In fact, the opposite is true here. The stock is trading as if hope were news. Investors need to remember that hope isn't a strategy and, in the face of the combination of a high stock price and a large overhang from an acquisition, investors would be better served avoiding this name."

CEB bills itself as a 'best practice insight and technology company.'The company operates in two business segments:CEB states that it counts as clients '90% of the Fortune 500, nearly 75% of Dow Jones Asian Titans, and more than 85% of the FTSE 100.'The company has more than 4,500 employees between 54 offices worldwide and also provides a membership service for companies to receive information, case studies, peer benchmarks, advisory support and learning events for senior executives and staff.Acquisition TermsGartner said it will acquire CEB for $54 per share cash and 0.2284 shares of Gartner common for each share of CEB common, for a split of approximately $1.8 billion cash and $800 million in stock.Additionally, Gartner will assume $700 million in CEB net debt. Upon completion of the deal, Gartner shareholders will own 91% of CEB.Gartner intends to fund the deal through cash on hand, existing credit facility and new additional debt financing. The company expects to have net debt after close of $3 billion.Gartner will pay around 3.3x CEB's trailing revenues in total enterprise value for the deal, not an unreasonable price.CEB has a go-shop right for the next 35 days.Gartner CEO Gene Hall said in a company statement, ""We expect this acquisition to create value for our shareholders in both the near and long term, including immediate accretion on an adjusted EPS basis.""The deal is expected to close in 1H 2017.CommentaryGartner provided five 'benefits' of the combination as justification for the deal:So, Gartner has made a compelling case of synergies, complementary business lines and differentiated industry penetration that provide cross-selling opportunities.Integration of the two organizations, which combined, will total 13,000 employees in over 100 countries, will likely take one to two years.The net result will be a global technology research and advisory company with a $10 billion market cap. This is compared to other smaller publicly held research and advisory firms such as The Advisory Board Company (NASDAQ:ABCO), Huron Consulting Group (NASDAQ:HURN) and Booz Allen Hamilton (NYSE:BAH).An enduring question about these types of acquisitions is to what extent the combined entity will be able to retain existing customers and obtain new customers efficiently during and after the integration. Competitors will no doubt redouble their efforts during the next 12 months to take advantage of the expected integration shakeup, so I wouldn't expect to see a significant performance catalyst in Gartner's stock for at least 12 months from the close of the transaction.The stock is down 11% on the announcement, from $102 to $90, likely on the dilution of approximately 10% of Gartner's enterprise. So, it appears the market's initial reaction is reasonable and not overdone.I'm positive on the combination's prospects, but not for at least 12 to 18 months from transaction close. Cost-saving synergies will be minimal, but the real value is in the combined entity's selling power and breadth of services to the middle market.As technology becomes an increasingly strategic focus for mid-sized firms trying to differentiate themselves in hyper-competitive marketplaces, firms like Gartner/CEB will be able to provide a more integrated set of high margin research solutions and advisory services.It's a win for Gartner and the middle market.I write about IPOs, follow-ons, secondaries, and M&A.

2430635,70915,2014-08-18T03:24:20-04:00,"Gartner’s last quarter saw top line and bottom line improving with metrics indicating retention of higher paying customers.The business model of Gartner allows every firm in the world to become a potential client.The company sells services, which in itself allows costs to become controllable.Strong prospects, better-than-industry performance coupled with improving earning guidance delivers a strong buy rating.","Often, investors go for companies that carry a big name tag against them. And usually these growth stocks can be some of the most thrilling picks in the market, as these high-flyers capture investors' attention, and a lot of times produce big profits as well. However, they can also lead on the downside when the growth story is over. Therefore, it is important to find companies which are still seeing strong growth prospects in their operations.One such company is Gartner Inc. (NYSE:IT), whose share value has gone up 23% in a year. The company provides research and advisory services to clients, which helps them in making better day to day decisions. Gartner reported a successful quarter this month and in this article, I will highlight some important points from the result to let investors know how strong the company is going. Later, I will move towards discussing the future potential of this fast-growing research firm.Second QuarterSource: Earnings ReleaseGartner's top line during the latest period was outstanding. The company achieved 17% growth in revenue with the final figure coming at $519.8 million in comparison to the second quarter of 2013. Gartner's largest and most profitable segment, ""Research"" saw its contract value (subscription-related research products that recognize revenue on a rateable basis) grow 11%. This wasn't new as Gartner has produced double-digit contract value growth in every region and industry segment for the past two years.This is a number which is very hard to maintain. The growing contract value is supported by services which satisfy customers completely. Gartner's customer retention rate has hence improved by 100 bps to 84%, with the same increment coming for wallet retention rate. Wallet retention measures the amount of contract value the company has retained with clients over a twelve-month period. This rate, which presently stands at 105%, is higher than the customer retention rate. The implication is that Gartner is retaining higher-spending clients within its portfolio.Moving forward, consulting too saw growth with revenue increasing by 9%. The company's backlog was up 11%, allowing it to have a safer revenue stream for the near future. Events posted a 39% increase in revenue with same-event revenue hiking 21% on a year-over-year basis.Cost of services and product development increased a lesser 14% as a result of higher payroll and related benefits coming from increased headcount and merit salary increases. The company also experienced higher ($6 million) conference expenses due to a greater number of events held. Nonetheless, costs as a percentage of revenue fell by 100 bps to 39% compared to the same quarter a year ago.Selling, general and administrative expenses rose a little higher (18%) above revenue but failed to bring any material impact to bottom-line. The net result was diluted earnings per share increasing 18% to 58 cents during the last quarter.The operational performance highlights the internal strength of the organization. Cost and revenue, both have improved not only in this quarter but in the past as well. Moving onto the future, I believe this trend should continue. This is because Gartner's business model is such that every company in the world, be it profit or not-for-profit, public or private, can become a potential client. This allows Gartner to possess a vast untapped market opportunity for its services.My statement comes from the fact that technology is transforming the world and driving change in every industry on a scale rarely seen. Businesses that are embracing modern IT are creating a new enterprise operating model that supports emerging business models and revenue options. For these models to emerge, understanding the market and trends are a valuable resource. This is where Gartner steps in. For example, a few years ago, nobody would've believed in the concept of what Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) presently does. The idea of movie streaming is taking over and many multimedia companies are now investing resources to support the future trend of watching content through the internet on tablets and smart phones.Of course, this is just one example. Gartner allows every firm to grasp specific industry knowledge and trends to identify opportunities which may be missed otherwise. The company's existence of more than three decades just adds more credibility to its ability of handling projects with wide experience in hand.Moving to the bottom line, since Gartner provides services, its major cost comes from hiring and awarding its employees. The company has seen strong demand for its consulting services and the present strategy of investing in managing partners is a good one since it allows Gartner to capture that demand. The company now has 87 managing partners, an increase of 7% from last year. The revenue per billable headcount last quarter stood at $454,000. Since not all employees are paid a six figure salary, I believe that the present revenue generating figure is plenty to support future hiring if needed. This should keep cost pressure under control.Bottom LineGartner's latest normalized EPS guidance of $2.18 to $2.35 per share is 3 cents higher than the EPS guidance it gave investors in May. The company saw EPS growth of 10.7% last year, and is looking great for this year too. In fact, the current growth estimate for this year calls for an EPS growth of 14.2%. Furthermore, the long-term growth rate is currently an impressive 18.3%, suggesting pretty good prospects for the longer haul.With debt level still below the industry, the company has managed to deliver return of equity of 72% in its recent past while peers have stood at a far lesser 34%. This outlines the competitive advantage Gartner possesses. If things continue this way, which I am sure they will, owing to the prospects of the IT industry, the company should be a top performer in the future. I therefore give a strong buy rating to Gartner.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

3623616,89795,2015-10-29T21:47:34-04:00,The DCF model shows that Gartner has a fair price right now.The company has huge growth potential.It has a solid financial position.,"Gartner Inc. (NYSE:IT) is an IT research and advisory provider based in the USA, with clients in 90 countries.As we're going to see ahead in this piece, the company has a really high growth potential, as the potential market for its operations is really big, it has a really good financial situation due to its ability to generate cash and the DCF model shows that the company is fairly valued right now.Gartner's operations are divided into 3 branches:Their main objective is to create value with its research branch offering to its clients the highest quality and innovation possible to create a moat over its competitors. In my opinion, the company is creating a moat, as can be seen in growth and client retention ratios that are double digit in the first case and at 85% in the second (2 points higher than the previous year).Executive compensation policyGartner has, in my opinion, a good compensation policy, as directors who are also employees of the company don't receive any fees for their service as directors.They have a short- and a long-term bonus set in cash and shares. The short one is based on objectives, and the long one is based on equity performance (30% and 70% respectively). 90% of the CEO's compensation is in the form of bonus and equity award.In my opinion, this compensation plan is good for the company in the long run, as in spite of being focused on earnings and creating value for shareholders, a huge part of the compensation is in equity form.Valuation and growth potentialI'm going to start with a DCF model.From what I have seen in the past 5 years' CF statements and in the growth rates that the company has achieved during that period, I think it would be fair to set an FCF of 310 as a starting point to project the following years, but I think with the exchange rates volatility that we're going to see during next year (and that we have seen during this year), and taking into account that more than a half of Gartner's revenue is in foreign currencies (taking the USD as the home currency), $300M as a starting FCF is a fair amount.I'm also going to use a high discount rate (9%) and a terminal growth rate of a 2%, as, like I have said in other articles, I used to be very conservative in DCF models.The fair value that the DCF set is a price of $87.03, so at today's price, the company seems to be at a fair price.Let's take a look at some ratios, growth rates and financial statements.We can see the ROE and ROA average of the last 5 years are really good numbers at 66.3% and 9.9% respectively, and the average revenue growth rate for those 5 years is 12.12%.Despite that, if we look at the income statements, we can see that the operating income has been recently lower because of the exchange rate impact, and in my opinion, it will continue to hit operating income next year.I'm not concerned about the FCF, as from what I can see in the CF statements, the company has no problems generating cash - and it seems it is not going to have problems ahead either, as the growth potential is high. As has been said in the Gartner Investor Day presentation, the potential market for the company is really huge, as it only serves about 10,000 clients globally, and the firm estimates there are around 110,000 clients that it could serve, as it is entering new markets.(Source: Gartner's Investor Presentation)The company hasn't got a dividend policy, but it conducts a more interesting share buyback policy that, in my opinion, helps to create value for shareholders. The company set aside $800M for the plan, but it only buys back shares at a price it considers appropriate and depending on market and company conditions. Gartner has already spent a half of that budget.It has also purchased 3 companies in 2014 to expand the business, and that's the main reason why the company's debt has increased substantially. Gartner established an agreement for a combination of a $400M loan and a $1B credit line during the next 5 years (including 2015), and I expect those 3 companies to help to maintain the double digit income growth rate in the near future.Main risksIn the short term, the risk that concerns me more is the exchange rate risk, as I expect high volatility in forex markets during next year because of the possible rate hike in USA and the expected deleverage of many countries (as debt-to-GDP is close to 100% in many countries).The company is not very diversified, as it earns 59% of its revenue from the US and Canada and only 28% from Europe, Middle East and Africa and 12% from other places. In my opinion, it needs to improve that to reduce exposure on North America economies.In the long run, Gartner can have problems keeping up its renewal subscription rates if it can't maintain a high-value and innovative product and, as subscription renewals are one of the most important business cash generator, this would heavily hurt the company.ConclusionGartner has a really solid business, is committed to create a strong brand and has high growth potential due to the potential business it could serve and the acquisition of 3 firms in 2014.The company has superb financial strength, as it has enough cash to face a great amount of its current liabilities, and it has no problems generating FCF.Right now, as can be seen from the DCF, the company is at a fair value. Of course, the DCF that I have used is a really conservative one, taking into account the company's situation and growth rates during the last 5 years. In my opinion, the company is one of the best options to add to a portfolio right now."
4034627,25120,2017-01-05T15:51:01-05:00,"Gartner is making a big move with the purchase of CEB.While cheap financing, similar valuation multiples and synergies can justify the deal, investors have some doubts.The move into a new HR area, addition of a lot of leverage and relative modest earnings accretion are reasons to be cautious on the deal.While I could defend the deal itself, Gartner's own and the pro-forma valuation multiples are way too high to consider following a multi-year momentum run.","Gartner (IT) announced a rather sizable deal with the purchase of CEB (CEB). The deal looks reasonable based on relative multiples, as Gartner is paying similar sales multiples compared to the value at which it is trading itself. Cheap financing options, an unleveraged balance sheet and synergies allow for earnings accretion, yet investors are not too pleased.Gartner's shares fell by more than the premium being offered for CEB, despite the promise of cost synergies, which theoretically should justify the premium. I have to agree with the market as the current sales trends of CEB and margin profile is not that encouraging, although Gartner believes it can ""export"" operational excellence to CEB, like it has done with previous (smaller) acquisitions.Given the leverage incurred there is not hope for (special) dividends as Gartner´s balance sheet flexibility will be limited going forward. This observation and the sky-high earnings multiples, even if we generously use non-GAAP metrics, make it easy to avoid the shares.Buying CEBGartner has agreed to buy CEB in a $3.3 billion deal if net debt of $700 million is taken into account. The $2.6 billion equity component consists out of a 70% cash and 30% stock component. Investors in CEB will receive $77.25 for their shares, comprised out of a $54 cash component and 0.2284 shares of Gartner. All in all, CEB investors will hold a combined 9% equity stake in Gartner following the deal.The deal terms look very reasonable as investors receive a 25% premium compared to the unaffected share price, as the premium is a bit higher if longer time periods are being considered.Gartner rationalizes the deal by pointing towards an expansion of services into HR, sales, finance and legal functions, areas best covered by CEB. Gartner hopes to ""export"" its best practices and give CEB global coverage, as both items are expected to yield better revenues and earnings at CEB. These drivers alone should make the deal accretive to earnings, as costs savings of $25-$50 million per annum from 2018 onwards should act as icing on the cake.What Is Gartner Buying?CEB has been doing a good job expanding its business over the past decade, having essentially doubled sales between 2006 and 2016, with sales hitting $950 million this year. The issue if you like is that scale has not brought better margins. GAAP operating margins ranged at 15-20% in the period 2006-2011, and in some years even surpassed the higher end of the range. Margins have fallen towards 10-15% in recent years, and even come in below the 10% mark in recent times on the back of deal-related charges.The $3.3 billion deal valuation appraises CEB at 3.5 times sales. Adjusted EBITDA is seen at 25.5% of sales this year, valuing the business at 14 times EBITDA. This is a full multiple given that sales are flattish at best at the moment, and the EBITDA number is highly ""adjusted."" If the $232 million EBITDA number could benefit from $50 million in annual cost savings, the effective multiple could fall to a little below 12 times by 2018/2019.The $77.25 price seems reasonable given that CEB anticipates adjusted earnings per share of $3.75 per share or more this year. As referred to before, non-GAAP earnings exclude real costs such as amortization charges, deal-related costs and stock based compensation charges. These costs are projected to be very high in 2016. Even in more normalized recent years, GAAP earnings have come in a fifth below the non-GAAP earnings on average.Pro-Forma: GartnerIn November of last year, Gartner released its third quarter results which revealed a clean balance sheet. The company held $465 million in cash and operated with just $745 million in debt for a modest net debt load of $280 million.The 84 million shares are valued at roughly $8.5 billion at $101 per share, levels at which Gartner traded ahead of the deal announcement. This valued the overall business at $8.8 billion, equivalent to 3.6 times the revenue forecast of $2.45 billion. Coincidentally, Gartner is paying a similar multiple to get its hands on CEB.Adjusted EBITDA is seen at 19% of sales this year, seen around $465 million. This reveals that Gartner trades at a staggering 19 times adjusted EBITDA multiple. GAAP earnings are seen at $200 million, with adjusted earnings seen around $250 million. Depending on your accounting preference, this results in very steep valuation multiples with equity trading at 34-42 times earnings.The Market Does Not Like The Deal, Avoid Following Years Of Multiple InflationThe $15 premium offered for CEB, given that it has 32 million shares outstanding, implies that Gartner is paying a roughly $480 million premium to buy the company. Yet the market is reacting negatively to the deal.Including the shares to be issued to investors in CEB, Gartner will have roughly 90 million shares outstanding. As shares are down nearly 9% to levels around $93 per share, the valuation of Gartner has come down by $800 million, much more than the premium paid for CEB.If $25-$50 million in pre-tax costs synergies are capitalized at a 20 times multiple, after applying a 30% tax rate, the value of the synergies could be roughly $350-$700 million. As such the market is clearly taking the deal as a negative, perhaps on the back of the incurred leverage and fact that the company moves away from its research focus towards HR.While I think this could be an overreaction, I did not like Gartner as a stand-alone opportunity, as the sell-off has not meaningfully changed this stance. Non-GAAP earnings power for Gartner runs at around $3 per share. The claim that 2018 non-GAAP earnings will increase by double digits might support earnings of $3.30-$3.50 per share that year. That still results in an elevated 28 times non-GAAP earnings multiple a year ahead in time at this point in time. For simplicity, let's forget that the balance sheet is highly leveraged and GAAP earnings are meaningfully (roughly 20%) lower.Adding the $232 million adjusted EBITDA contribution of CEB, and the $465 million number from Gartner, pro-forma EBITDA comes in at $700 million, or $750 million including synergies. The net debt position of CEB and existing debt load of Gartner combined comes in at close to a billion. The cash component of the deal represents another $1.7 billion, for a net debt load of $2.7 billion. That yields a leverage ratio of 3.8 times ex-synergies, or 3.6 times if those are taken into account.I simply want to avoid Gartner at this point. At best, using a non-GAAP multiple, the earnings yield is just 3.5%, while the realistic GAAP yield is just 2.5%-3%, amidst a leveraged balance sheet and lack of dividends. While the company is a decent grower, the deal will probably work out fine, and the long term outlook is solid, the valuation is simply too rich for me. This follows a multi-year momentum run in which share gains have far outpaced the revenue and earnings advancements.This is a dangerous cocktail for investors amidst a balance sheet which in the short to medium term leaves little flexibility."
3270645,63483,2015-06-19T12:32:33-04:00,"Renowned IT research and consulting firm.Despite limited barriers to entry, Gartner thrives on its reputation and sticky client relationships.Opportunities for growth remain vast.Consistent cash flow generation bodes well for current and future share buyback programs.Minimal margin of safety at current levels.","The businessGartner (NYSE:IT) is a renowned IT research and consulting firm. To readers, probably the most familiar service that Gartner provides is market research - I'm sure most people have seen a Gartner market report before. However, that is not all the firm does. The company also provides consulting services and organizes events for its clients. Hence, Gartner operates in three segments - research (70% of the top-line), consulting (17%) and events (13%).For the research segment (or the cash cow, as I like to call it), the company makes money primarily through multi-year subscription-based contracts. As for consulting, revenues are generated through fixed-fee and time and materials engagements. Whereas for events, sales stem primarily from the number of attendees. All three of the company's segments are complementary with one another, allowing for numerous cross-selling opportunities throughout the firm's client base.Despite limited barriers to entry, Gartner thrives on its reputation and sticky client relationshipsBarriers to entry to this space are rather limited (in terms of capital required) - it does not take much capital investment to set up a market research firm. This is because the primary expense for such firms is headcount, which is not a particular tough barrier to overcome. However, Gartner thrives on its reputation and sticky client relationships, making it difficult for new entrants to steal market share from renowned incumbents.A typical client first purchases research reports from Gartner that are relevant to their industry (IT, supply-chain, marketing, etc). Then, the client finds out that there are numerous secular trends (cloud, big data, mobile, etc) that are rapidly transforming the way businesses are operated. Armed with this knowledge, the client proceeds to purchase consulting services from Gartner in order to exploit these trends. Along with this, the client may also choose to attend events organized by Gartner (e.g. symposiums/ Itxpo) in order to act on the insight that industry leaders provide. Generally, this process tends to repeat itself - it is a virtuous cycle.As clients use Gartner for a greater period of time, trust begins to build, resulting in extremely sticky client relationships. Due to the need for a stellar reputation and track record, it is very difficult for new entrants to steal market share from incumbents. Even incumbents are unlikely to steal share from one another - I suspect this is due to the fact that it is very difficult to differentiate the value-add of market research firms from one another both ex-ante and ex-post. Most clients would rather stick with one firm.In a nutshell, we have a business that:A great business, no doubt. As always, qualitative discussion is all well and good, but it is paramount that the numbers back up the narrative. And they do. As of 2014, rolling (due to seasonality issues) enterprise client retention was a stunning 85% while enterprise wallet retention was in excess of 100% (the actual number is 106%). Metrics are similar for that of organization client and wallet retention.The fact that wallet retention is greater than client retention indicates higher spending by retained clients or greater retention of higher-spending clients, or both. This is effectively an endorsement of the company's invaluable value-add to its clients.Cash flows are highly-recurring largely due to the dominance of the cash cow (research) segment with regard to the business mix, which generates revenues through subscription-based contracts. Unfortunately, the company does not provide insight as to what percentage of its consulting backlog is recurring. However, by parsing its business mix, we can reasonably assume that at least 60-70% of the firm's revenues are recurring in nature.Opportunities for growth remain vastIn earlier paragraphs, I have alluded to the many secular trends that are not only transforming the way people live but also the way businesses operate. The most popular of these trends are that of big data, cloud and mobile.Companies are increasingly collecting more and more data not only on their customers but also on their business. A bulk of this raw data is currently unusable, and big data analytics firms are starting to develop solutions that can manipulate this data and provide actionable insights in order to aid businesses in making better financial decisions. The cloud is an alternate delivery model for application software (mostly), allowing an enterprise to reduce total cost of ownership, among other things. The explosion of mobile has allowed businesses to maintain productivity on-the-go, on any device.All these trends are revolutionizing the way corporations operate and a large number of them have yet to understand or implement solutions that exploit these secular trends. This is where Gartner and other similar firms come in.Source: Gartner Investor Day PresentationCurrently, Gartner serves about 10,000 clients globally (9,958 is the exact number, as of FY14). The firm estimates that there is a total of 110,000 firms that it could serve, resulting in a vast untapped market opportunity valued at $58b.Considering the fact that market penetration has been rather minimal, and also keeping in mind that Gartner has recently been focusing on growing its sales force (the firm targets 15%-20% sales force growth annually), it is easy to see that Gartner has a ton of room available to grow in the future. Additionally, the company estimates that wo-thirds of its growth stems from increasing penetration/cross-selling among existing clients while the other one-third stems from the signing of new clients. The company's renowned brand name and large client base also makes it easier (due to availability of case studies, past instances of value-adding projects, etc) for the salesforce to convince prospective clients to do business with Gartner.Consistent cash flow generation bodes well for future share buyback programsRecently, Gartner completed its $800m buyback program, purchasing the remaining $400m worth of shares during Q1 FY15. The company has authorized a much larger buyback program of $1.2b, which it expects to complete within 2-3 years. The obvious concern would be whether Gartner would have the cash flow to fund these buybacks.A majority of the firm's debt ($386m, total debt is $750m) is due in 4-5 years, while free cash flow generation has been more or less spectacular, amounting to $250m+ (adjusted for an approx. $100m one-time charge) in FY14 and growing. Considering the highly-recurring nature of the firm's cash flows, this trend should continue going forward. Thus, one can be reasonably assured that there will be available cash flow to fund the current $1.2b share buyback program and future similar programs.Minimal margin of safety at current levelsMy model implies a price target of $68 for the firm, indicating about 22% downside at current prices. Revenue growth assumptions of high single-digit growth in the earlier projection years, which gradually declines to mid single-digit growth, are supported by the firm's market forecast, historical growth rates, and the fact that it is steadily increasing its sales force. EBITDA margins are expected to gradually expand to 18% by the end of the projection period. I expect this margin expansion to stem primarily from higher spending per client (as the firm continues cross-selling additional services) in the future.Despite the fact that Gartner is a great business with vast growth opportunities, the firm trades at a price that presents minimal margins of safety. Currently, Gartner is trading at approximately 23x LTM EBITDA, or about 45-50x earnings. I assumed a 15x exit EBITDA multiple and a 10% discount rate. I have no doubt that the company will eventually ""grow"" into this valuation, but it is clear that the upside potential is far greater that the downside potential at current levels. In my opinion, the stock is too risky for conservative investors. Regardless, I opine that one should wait for a significant pullback before initiating a long position."

For the purposes of this article, the author compares the financial performance of Gartner with that of Forrester Research (given IDC is a subsidiary of IDG, and a private company).Source: Yahoo Finance and Author's CalculationsAs can be seen from the above ratios, Gartner Inc. has outperformed Forrester Corporation on all major measures, having vastly higher growth in free cash flow, earnings and ROE, along with a higher operating margin and more attractive valuations on a price-to-book basis.ValuationFollowing on from the above, an examination of Gartner's Historical Price-to-Book Ratios over a 1 and 5-year time frame reveals that the firm is currently trading at fair value relative to its 1-year average, and is undervalued by a potential 50% given the firm's current P/B ratio of 17.38 relative to the 5-year high of 34.34.Source: YChartsOver a one-year basis, we can see that the firm is trading in line with the average, i.e. this indicates the firm is trading at fair value. At a price of $68.96, an investor could lock in a margin of safety of 20%-25% by buying the stock at a price of $55. For Forrester Corporation, we can see that while the firm is undervalued on a similar 5-year P/B basis, the stock does not have as much potential upside as Gartner.Source: YChartsFree Cash Flow Growth ModelThe author has determined a price target of $140 for Gartner Inc. through to 2018, meaning a 150% upside if an investor initiates a position at $55. At the current price of $68.96, there is a potential 103% upside through to 2018, assuming the free cash flow projections below prove accurate.Gartner Inc. has witnessed an impressive growth in its free cash flow from $40.28 million in 2009 to $137.86 million in 2013, reflecting an average growth of 48.62% per year. It is the author's opinion that growth in free cash flow will continue, and projects a more conservative, yet still vibrant estimate of 20% per year. In tandem with the CNBC 3-5 year estimate of 19.6% earnings growth, the author also uses this forecast through to 2018 in the below EPS calculations. Given that Gartner Inc. is not a dividend-paying company, the author uses a free cash flow growth model as an estimate of the company's growth prospects over the next five years. In line with the traditionally accepted historical average return on the S&P 500, a 7% discount rate is used. Additionally, the price-to-book ratio is used in lieu of the traditional price-to-earnings ratio used in the dividend discount growth model. As technology companies typically have high price-to-earnings ratios, it was deemed more appropriate to use the price-to-book ratio as a more accurate estimate of valuation.Sources: Marketwatch/Business InsiderSources: Author's CalculationsBusiness ProspectsGartner Inc. is a financially stable company, with a proven ability to continually grow its business under a range of market conditions. According to the firm's 2012 Annual Report, the firm's Research business delivered double-digit growth across all geographies despite weak global economic growth during this period. This was particularly evident in the European and Chinese markets, where the business continued to grow at double-digit rates. Given Gartner's global presence, it is in an adequate position to continually grow its business in emerging countries such as China for the foreseeable future.The firm's contract value (a key metric used by the firm through measuring the value attributed to subscription-related products to forecast return sales) measured a wallet retention of 99% in 2012, along with an 83% client retention rate. According to these measures, the firm's increasing rates of revenue are reported as being ""highly likely to recur over a multi-year period"".According to the global consulting firm, McKinsey & Company, the demand for ""big data"" skills is set to increase greatly through to 2018, with demand for analytical talent projected as being 50 to 60 per cent greater than supply by this period. Therefore, given Gartner's competitive advantage in the business intelligence industry, the company has a myriad of opportunities to further build its client base across a wide range of industries, including healthcare, the public sector, manufacturing and retail, among others.ConclusionIn conclusion, Gartner Inc. is a firm with immense growth prospects over the next five years if it can continue to maintain its competitive advantage and grow its revenues across a wide range of businesses and geographies. According to the author's calculations, the stock is currently priced at fair value and investors could potentially enter at a price of $55 for a margin of safety within the 20%-25% range. Given a continued and robust increase in free cash flow, the stock certainly has the potential to reach higher levels given its current valuation.Author's Notes: This article covers a mid-cap stock with a market capitalisation of $6.23 billion.

Currently trading at an all-time high with a share price of $52.27, Gartner is one of the big share risers of the moment. The all-time low for this stock was back in March 2009 when the share price declined to $8.33. Wise investors, who bought $10,000 of shares back in March 2009, would now be sitting on $52,749 of capital profit.The next earnings call for Gartner is scheduled for February 7th and it will be interesting to see if it can maintain its drastic rise on the back of the call.Founded in 1979 and headquartered in Stamford, Connecticut, Gartner now also has offices in Canada, Europe, the Middle East and Africa. The information provided by Gartner is used as key performance indicators in the information technology, social media, online advertising, computer hardware and communications sectors.Based on the collective knowledge of the IT executive world community, Gartner reports influence business leaders, decision makers and most importantly share prices. It was a recent Gartner report that influenced the rise in Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) shares based on its research of the mobile advertising market.On February 14th, Gartner will host its annual Investor Day for institutional investors in New York. During the course of the day, the company's senior management will review its business portfolio, strategy for growth and financial performance. Brokers are currently indicating a hold in favor of a buy of Gartner shares, signaling that all eyes will be on the forthcoming earnings call and the outcome of the Investor Day. Among the institutional holders of Gartner is Price (T. Rowe) Associates Inc. with 15.7% stake in the company.Competitors include Forrester Research (NASDAQ:FORR) currently trading at $27.77. The 52-week high and low for Forrester is $20.60 - $36.15. With Forrester's next earnings call scheduled for February 4th, brokers are also currently recommending a hold on Forrester shares.With the strong demand in the market for good information, both of these companies seem very well strategically placed currently, and would be a wise addition to any well-balanced portfolio.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

176060,20412,2009-12-02T03:20:44-05:00,,"Gartner, Inc. (NYSE:IT) announced yesterday an all-cash offer of $64 million for competitor AMR Research.  Gartner expects the deal to close by the end of December, and will add AMR’s approximately $40 million in revenue to Gartner’s industry leading $1.2 billion (TTM) top line.  The market reacted mildly positive to the news, edging its market cap up 3% in midday trading. The purchase price of $64 million is slightly more than 1.5 times revenue, and about 8-12 times EBITDA (MGI estimates). A cash deal with a quick close indicates this was priced to move, particularly when a business with strong recurring revenues and modest growth can attract higher multiples.  With a high percentage of its revenues derived from vendors (70%+), one could logically question whether or not the price tag represents AMR’s view of where tech spending and vendor viability will be in 2010 and beyond.  After taking into account business efficiencies and cost reductions, the purchase price is more like 4-6 times pro-forma EBITDA.AMR’s revenues have been essentially flat since it filed for an IPO in September, 2000 and subsequently withdrew the offering in 2002 when the IPO window had closed.  CEO and majority owner Tony Friscia has long been rumored to be looking for an exit, and without a robust IPO market, a cash sale to the largest player in the IT industry makes sense, particularly in light of a potential change in capital gains taxes.  By selling to Gartner, Friscia achieves liquidity in uncertain times, and provides a soft landing to the loyal employees of AMR. Gartner can take one of two approaches to integrating AMR. If it follows the model of its acquisition of META group, Gartner will consolidate the operations, retire the AMR brand, and blend AMR into the Gartner operations.  The risk to this is that many AMR clients subscribe to AMR precisely because it is not Gartner. Vendors are looking for an alternative marketing channel, and users are looking for an industry-focused perspective that they find lacking from Gartner.  The second approach to integration would be to leave AMR as an independent brand with its own research operations, but consolidate the back office and provide AMR access to the strength of the Gartner sales channel.  We believe Gartner will likely take the former approach, and quickly integrate AMR into Gartner’s operations.  There is plenty of room for consolidation – both in the back office, and among the analyst ranks.  Although some vendors may elect to merge their Gartner and AMR budgets, the loss of contract value could be offset by a likely price increase and the ability of Gartner to add the AMR product into its global subscriber base. It is hard to see this deal transforming Gartner's ability to sell beyond the IT department.Bottom line: We expect this deal to close, and to be modestly accretive for Gartner.  It will boost Gartner’s FY2010 results beyond the low expectations it set with the announcement of this deal.  AMR provides Gartner added depth in vertical industry coverage and brings several well-known industry analysts (e.g., Bruce Richardson).  Looking into FY2011, Gartner will need a new source of top line growth, unless of course the IT industry rebounds robustly ahead of expectations - which does not appear to be the expectation of AMR's owners/research leaders."
29984,20103,2007-03-19T12:32:24-04:00,,"The streak of favorable 108 adjustments continues . . . Gartner Inc. (NYSE:IT), the technology consulting firm, came clean with its 10-K application of SAB 108, and increased its retained earnings by a bit less than 2%. Even more striking: some of the adjustments also affected additional paid-in capital, and in total, the SAB 108 adjustment increased stockholders’ equity by 7%. The biggest piece of the favorable increase to retained earnings - $7.4 million - came from a previously overstated income tax payable balance. According to the filing, “The adjustment was due to the carryover impact of an excess payable balance from prior years in the current taxes payable account which had accumulated over a period of years prior to 2000.” What made the current taxes payable too large is still unclear. The most curious item in the SAB 108 stew had to do with stock option pricing: Using SAB 108 to clear up stock option problems is probably not what the SEC had in mind when it published the bulletin. The Commission’s intent, I believe, in developing SAB 108 was to motivate companies to eliminate known old errors that had accumulated on balance sheets for years. If a company just figured out in 2006 that there were problems in its option practices, restatement might be a more appropriate route, or at least the disclosures discussed in the recent letter sent from the Division of Corporation Finance to companies with known option reporting issues.

38761,20370,2007-06-19T07:06:25-04:00,,"Gartner Inc. (NYSE:IT) is a leading provider of market research covering the information technology [IT] industry. It provides more than 10,000 client organizations with competitive analysis reports, industry overviews, market trend data, and product evaluation reports. Its GartnerG2, Gartner Dataquest, and other research services are made available through subscriptions primarily to CIOs and other IT professionals. Gartner also offers technology and management consulting services, and produces a number of conferences, seminars, as well as other events aimed at the technology sector. If every investor had bought Gartner two years ago, they'd all be richer now. From a low of $8.10 in early 2005, the stock has been on a trajectory that would make any investor smile. It seems there's money in technology. Who would have guessed. Earnings are the usual driver behind the great performance. In 2005 they were 37 cents a share, then went to 58 cents a share. This year expect 75 cents a share, and in 2008, look for $1.00. Revenues have been ramping right along with earnings. Back in 2004, they were $894 million. This year they should be $1.18 billion and $1.3 billion next year. Analysts are looking for sales to grow by 12% a year, on average, over the next 5 years while earnings should increase by 20.5% a year, on average, in the same time period. Research is the backbone of Gartner, contributing the majority of revenues and earnings. In the first quarter of this year, the company recorded the highest backlog of business under contract, up 19% over the same period last year. The company hosts Events, where clients pay for the latest updates on technology. In the first quarter, Gartner hosted 12 Events, compared to 6 last year in the first quarter. The Events should produce about $190 million in revenues this year, about $20 million more than last. These higher-margin conferences help boost profitablity. Here are some other numbers: Current assets are about 60% of current liabilities. Net profit margin is 6.6%, heading for 8.2% next year. Return on equity is expected to be 79.5% (this is not a typo) this year and 52% next year, gradually moving toward 22% over the next 5 years. Price to book is 86. Price to earnings is currently 53. Market Cap is $2.8 billion. IT is an interesting stock that has performed very well, both in terms of price and earnings growth. There are opportunities for the company to leverage its current employees (more Events), and it's adding more billable consultants for higher-margined services. It's all good. But the price already tells you that. Investors love this stock, and if it continues to deliver the earnings, they'll continue the love. But if it misses one quarter, watch out for the correction. It won't be pretty. IT 1-yr chart  Disclosure: none"

1487882,29371,2013-06-07T12:48:23-04:00,,"Gartner (NYSE:IT) offers an exposure to the fast growing IT area. The company operates in three segments and each one of them has almost unlimited potential for revenue growth and an increase in profits. These segments are research, consulting and events with research being the largest and also the most profitable business, supported by the consulting business. While the events business is the smallest, it is also benefiting from growth in IT as the audience at Gartner organized events has grown from 31,000 participants in 2004 to over 46,000 in 2012. Importantly, the events allow Gartner to network with IT professionals on a global basis and it also provides a venue for IT companies to pitch their products and services.Fundamentals and valuationGartner has 93.7 million shares outstanding for a market capitalization of $5.4 billion and an enterprise value of $5.3 billion. The company is actively repurchasing shares and in the first quarter of 2013, it bought back about 1 million shares for $49 million and has a remaining authorization to repurchase additional shares in the amount of $187 million. Two other IT-related companies, Forrester Research (NASDAQ:FORR) and Xerox (XRX), are also deploying capital to buy back their shares. Forrester most recently bought back 2.1 million shares of its own for about $74 million in a modified Dutch auction and has $75 million remaining under its current repurchase authorization. And Xerox expects to repurchase $400 million of its own shares in 2013. Share repurchases are beneficial for shareholders for a number of reasons including:Currently, Gartner's common stock trades at high valuations. Its price-to-earnings ratio for 2013 is 27.8 compared to 41.4 and 7.9 for Forrester and Xerox, respectively. Xerox' valuation is artificially suppressed from the company's printing business that is experiencing secular decline due to the switch from paper to digital. On a price-to-earnings-to-growth ratio, Gartner, Forrester and Xerox trade at 1.4, 1.1 and 1.1, respectively. While Gartner is slightly more expensive when accounting for expected growth, this is justified as the company has the best EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) margin among the three companies of 17% compared to 14.6% for Forrester and 13.4% for Xerox.Also, Gartner's research division, which grew revenues by 13% in the latest quarter, has among the highest incremental margins of 70% due to the high retention rate and predominantly fixed costs of the business. The events and consulting incremental margins are also high at 50% and 40%, respectively. Finally, Gartner estimates revenue growth in 2013 of between 10%-13% compared to 2012. Forrester's and Xerox' 2013 revenues will likely be flat to slightly up (low single digits), highlighting the ability of Gartner to grow regardless of the economic environment.Unique services in a growing industryOne of Gartner's most unique strengths is that companies and governments need its data and services when they are growing as well as when they are downsizing. In addition, each of its three segments operate in closely related areas. For example, the research division is supported by the consulting segment which can obtain reliable data directly from clients. Also, Gartner's more than 60 events in six continents allow the company to bring together leading IT companies as well as customers while at the same time generating leads for its research and consulting businesses. Also, Gartner offers vendor briefings with its analysts, which many companies find helpful when deciding which products and services meet their objectives.Investors can learn more about the areas that Gartner covers by simply reading the titles of its recent press releases. It is clear that the demand for IT and related services is high due to the technological changes taking place and the fact that about 70% of productivity growth comes from IT.Gartner's understanding of IT and how it relates to unique business situations has allowed the company to partner with Harvard Business Review to issue cutting edge books. Gartner can provide proprietary data and analytics as well as contract and strategy reviews. A recent article in the Wall Street Journal stressed the demand for MBAs with supply-chain management experience and knowledge. In fact, a large part of Gartner's business is assisting companies with their IT as it relates to supply management.ConclusionGartner is uniquely positioned to provide IT related data, services in IT and events that bring industry vendors and customers together. The company is one of the most reliable and independent sources of IT related data. Gartner not only helps companies solve their IT problems and measure progress, it is also at the cutting edge of IT related research that will also drive the future. For example, a Gartner analyst's (David Cappuccio) IT predictions for the next five years were featured in an article at networkworld.com. According to Cappuccio, two of the ten trends we should watch in the next few years will be software defined networks, which will provide greater flexibility and the internet of things, which will bring embedded sensors and image recognition to consumer devices and physical assets. It is not surprising that the article garnered nine comments, 408 LinkedIn shares and 265 Facebook likes. Investors looking to gain exposure to the important and fast changing area of IT research, services and events should consider Gartner, the market leader in this area.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

4077928,101665,2017-06-01T03:18:38-04:00,IZEA operates in the fast growing digital and sponsored content advertising markets.IZEA should be able to take share from search and display advertising.Native advertising and sponsored content are a powerful combination.The company trades at an attractive valuation after recent pullback.,"Investment Overview:We believe IZEA's (NASDAQ:IZEA) Managed Services are poised to drive growth in the short-term and long-term. With the exponential growth of time spent on social media and digital video, from 60 minutes a day in 2012 to an estimated >100 minutes a day in 2017, we see IZEA's platforms well positioned to benefit from 29%/28% growth of video/social advertising in 2017 (Fig. 1). Additionally, with growing top line and attractive margins the company is a prime acquisition target.Financial Overview:While we expect Content Workflow and Service Fees to remain a drag on revenue, Managed Services should more than offset the drag. Managed Services is at ~75% of total revenue (~94% of gross profit) and growing double digits should more than offset the declines in the Content Workflow (~24% of total revenue) resulting from the declining newspaper industry. We expect total revenue to grow by ~10% for FY2017.While in a high growth phase, management is doing a great job keeping expenses in check with a minimal cash burn. For FY2016, total gross income increased 59% and total expenses increased 33%, however adjusted EBITDA improved by $1.9m. We expect FY2017 gross margin to improve by 100bps to 48.9% and result in -$4.0m in adj. EBITDA compared with -$5.2m in FY2016 driven by strong top-line growth, improved gross margins and better operating expense control.Bookings are strong: While 1Q17 booking of 5% seems disappointing at first glance, we note that 34% 2-year CAGR in 1Q17 points to upper 50% bookings growth in 2Q17 to 4Q17.Investment ThesisWhile the importance of digital advertising is acknowledged by most marketers, the inefficiencies (e.g. micro transactions with low influence creators) and complications (e.g. FTC regulations) related to advertising with newfound content creators (e.g. bloggers, tweeters etc…) have curbed budget shifts to this special category of advertising within digital advertising. The robust userbase growth of social platforms like Snapchat (14.2%/9.5% in 2017/18) and Instagram (10.6%/7.4% in 2017/18) is an indication of the importance of these channels for marketers to connect with consumers, especially millennials, who refer to these channels every day to find out about new products and services through their favorite online celebrities. This creates an opportunity for platforms like IZEAx, which facilitates the marketer-creator connection process, to take ad budgets from search and display, which combined comprise ~60% of total digital ad market in the U.S. Global content market is projected to grow at 14% CAGR to 2019, per PQ Media. In its most recent State of Creator report, IZEA found that sponsored video experienced 20% jump in usage in 2016 vs. 2015 (44% vs. 24%), ahead of sponsored Facebook's 18% increase (78% vs. 60%) and sponsored photo's 12% increase (41% vs. 29%), further supporting our view of sponsored video growth.IZEA operates through three platforms. IZEAx, Ebyline (Acquired in Jan 2015) and ZenContent (Acquired in July 2016). IZEAx, as company's primary technology offering, enables transactions to be completed at scale through the management of custom content workflow, creator search and targeting, bidding, analytics, and payment processing. IZEAx is designed to provide a unified ecosystem that enables the creation of multiple types of content including blog posts, status updates, videos and photos through a wide variety of social channels including blogs, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and Tumblr, among others. While Ebyline was originally intended to transform editorial newsrooms into ""Virtual Newsroom"", IZEA has evolved the platform to become more of a content creator and intents to incorporates some of its capabilities into its IZEAx platform. ZenContent, a content production platform for e-commerce and brand marketers utilizes a wide range of qualified creators to produce custom content, unlike Ebyline, which only used editorial and expert level creators. We expect ZenContent to improve Managed Service margins through 2Q (ZenContent acquisition cycles in July) due to lower production costs.Marketers essentially use IZEA platforms in two ways: 1) Influencer Marketing and 2) Custom Content. With Influence Marketing, brands, agencies and publishers connect with online influencers like bloggers and tweeters to market their products by putting them on the creator's weblog or social media content in the form of native advertising. On the other hand, with Custom Content, IZEA also works with marketers to augment or replace their content development efforts. These customers use the platform to connect with creators to produce both editorial and marketing content that can be published both online and offline. IZEA's network of creators includes professional journalists, subject matter experts, bloggers and everyday content creators, allowing our customers to produce content ranging from complex white papers to simple product descriptions. Whether marketers utilize Influencer Marketing or Custom Content, it's important that their message will be conveyed on a custom-made content, where we believe IZEA has an advantage over traditional channels. eMarketer expects native advertising to grow 36%/28% in 2017/2018 (Fig. 2) giving us further confident with IZEAx future growth potential.We look at IZEA Exchange as a programmatic ad exchange for content creators. Just like Rocket Fuel's DSP connects publishers and marketers, IZEAx connects content creators with marketers. Competition in the space is not as strong at the moment but low barriers to entry could be a problem, although we consider IZEA's firsthand advantage in pioneering sponsored social sponsorship along with a massive talent network major plus points for the firm and its future success in maintaining and gaining market share.While acquisitions have been a major contributor to the top-line growth, it's important to point out that the organic growth has also been very strong. For FY2016, IZEA grew 33% on a reported basis but even excluding ZenContent, the growth would have been 29% and FY2015 reported growth of 146% would have been 50% excluding Ebyline. Strong organic growth, robust platforms, strong client portfolio, effective cost control and macro tailwinds should keep IZEA on track to profitability.Trading at its 52-week low and ~0.5x EV/sales, IZEA is a great way for investors to play the fast growing digital advertising and sponsorship content creator market. While content revenue, mainly produced by Ebyline, is a declining business, the strength in sponsored revenue and margins along with management's efforts to curbe costs should keep cash burn in check to profitability. While barriers to entry remains low in the industry, we point to the IZEA's strong and long client relationships with some of the top marketers in the world and a massive pool of content creators as hard to replicate. We also see IZEA as a great take-over candidate at this levels. As more DSPs adapt to native advertising, we think IZEA massive talent network will look very attractive to competition.Company DescriptionIZEA Inc is an online marketing company which provides online marketplace services such as producing and distributing text, videos, and photos for customers through blogs, websites and other media channels. IZEA helps customer improve branding, targeting, bidding, analytics and payment processing. The main customers are marketers of brands, agencies, and publishers who have two primary purposes; ""Influencer Marketing"" and ""Custom Content.""Industry OverviewWhile sponsored content industry has become a hot topic, there has not been a proportional shift of budgets to the sector due to the legal restrictions and limitations. As social media and sponsored content market grow, we expect this underutilized advertising channel to start taking shares from other digital advertising channels like Search and Display which comprise ~50% and ~20% of U.S. digital ad market.Native advertising market, growing at 36%/28%, is becoming the principal form of display advertising due to its less intrusive and more engaging nature. The value of talent marketing and word of mouth is well known to marketers but the market is still in its primitive stages and marketers who want to get even more engaged with the channel find themselves limited regarding running an effective campaign that is adequately managed. This is where IZEAx comes to play. IZEAx automates the process of connecting talent to marketers and utilizes its native advertising technology to navigate through the complicated landscape to minimize inefficiencies in the market as an exchange that connects marketers to a massive pool of its talent network.CompetitionIZEA Inc's direct and indirect competitors are driven from social sponsorship space and content marketing space. These companies have different advantage in video marketing, text editing, content development and tech consultancy area. Also, competition for advertising placements among current or future suppliers of Internet navigational and informational services, high-traffic websites, social sponsorship providers and other native media firms for marketing promotion. Moreover, we also consider vertical markets including companies with advantage in expertise and brand recognition. The list below includes companies that which come across from these areas and are rapidly growing their market size.Competitive AdvantageLarge Growth Rate in Influencer Marketing and Advertising: According to 2017 ""State of the Creator Economy Report,"" sponsored video usage within influencer marketing grow 20% year to year. Also, usage of sponsored blog posts increased by 16%, and sponsored photos jumped by 12%. The market trend now is expanding the investigation of marketer, creator and consumer perspectives on the effectiveness of influencer and content marketing. According to ""Investment in 'Snackable' Visual Content Quickly Increasing"" from Business Wire, IZEA Inc focuses more of its services in visual and video marketing strategy, expanding services of the branding of all sizes. JGR Capital foresees IZEA's influencer marketing potential and predicts its platforms will be well positioned to benefit from 29%/28% growth of video/social advertising in 2017.Strong Management Team: IZEA Inc has a strong management team members who lead IZEA to a fast-growing marketing company. SVP Bill Momary was the CEO of Ebyline who initiated the concept of a content marketplace and attracted customers including E.W. Scripps, Tribune, Dell and Intel. VP of engineering Chris Staymates served as the data scientist at Row Sham Row for games data-driven analysis, delivering insights to production and operation. The executive director in client development Kevin Blazaitis led a Southeast-focused sales team at Carbon Media Group. Right now Kevin leads and develops comprehensive sales strategies for IZEA's +45 member team, analyzing data, and providing support through training and leadership. The director in corporate events and communication Lindsay Broadhurst held a variety of positions in communication and marketing for over ten years at Walt Disney Company. She is now providing strategic direction for IZEA's corporate events and marketing communications and public relations.ValuationComparable Company Analysis: We applied comparable company analysis from five marketing/strategy firms that have the similar stock price and market capital. Since IZEA Inc extends its work in social sponsorship, content, and marketing industry, the five companies selected come across these areas. We collected the five companies' enterprise value, EBIT margin, ROA and revenue in the last two fiscal years as valuation inputs. The tables below are our analysis and result.Fair Value Multiple with Greater Growth Rate: The multiple we focused on is EV/Revenue which means what a company is being valued per each dollar of income. This multiple could indicate whether a stock is overvalued or undervalued. In most cases, the lower multiple EV/Revenue is, the better the company value will be. In this case, we see that the average of EV/Revenue from competitive companies is 0.4x, and the EV/Revenue for IZEA Inc is also 0.4x, which indicates IZEA Inc reached the fair value multiple compared with the market. Moreover, we calculated the average revenue growth rate for the five competitors from the most recent fiscal quarter which is -3.1% while IZEA Inc yielded a 13.5% in revenue growth.Conclusion:Given the underutilized nature of sponsored content marketing ( due to inefficiencies and limits in the segment), we believe IZEA, is well positioned to take advantage of the sector-specific growth and the total digital market growth. The fast growth of display and social advertising and specifically native advertising should keep IZEA's top-line growth steady while management's expense control efforts keep bottom line in check to profitability. Also, owning a great network of talent and a strong native ad exchange makes IZEA a take-over target, especially at ~0.5x EV/sales and 52-week low.Editor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks.

4337379,105571,2020-04-13T16:43:57-04:00,Influencer marketing is a legitimate and growing ad form.This company had an early start but lacked focus and discipline.The business model is confused and self-cannibalizing.Company could be turned around and used to start a roll-up.,"IZEA Worldwide, Inc. (NASDAQ:IZEA) was a pioneer in influencer marketing, but the company's offerings have fallen behind and become confused, and annual revenues have fluctuated between $27 million and $19 million over the last five years, with substantially negative bottom lines. There are also accounting concerns. The stock price has collapsed from $500 at the start of 2012 to $0.30 in late February 2020, just before the COVID-19 crash. There is a lot of potential here, but not on the company's current course and speed. (Timeline)Influencer marketing is when advertisers (or their ad agencies) pay someone to use or endorse that advertiser's products on that person's social media channel. The social platforms with the most influencer marketing, according to Mediakix, are Instagram (69%), YouTube (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (11%), independent blogs (7%), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) (5%), LinkedIn (NASDAQ:MSFT) (5%), followed by Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), Twitch (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) (1% each). The most common forms of influencer marketing are variations on sponsorships, reviews, and product placements.IZEA's primary business model is to use technology to scan social media platforms for influencers (influencers can also sign up on IZEA's site), categorize them, and then match them with advertisers. It then brokers a deal, tracks performance, collects money from the advertiser, and pays the influencer. IZEA makes money by selling tech tools for finding influencers and for tracking brand sentiment to agencies and marketers, by selling managed services (acting as an agency) to marketers, and by taking a percentage of the ad spend paid to influencers. An influencer search tool sells for $149 a month, but the company doesn't disclose the typical price of any of its other products or services.IEZA operates a second and unrelated business, matching freelance ""content creators"" with marketers. A content creator produces ""…Articles, Infographics, Videos, and Images that are delivered directly to the brand without distribution on your social channels."" The freelancer uploads links to their portfolio. Behind the scenes, IZEA matches them with marketers. Most freelance matching sites let the participants make their own matches in an open market. IZEA takes a percentage of the fees paid by the marketers.Of IZEA's revenues in calendar 2019, 81% came from managed services, which is the company running the system for its clients as an agency, 18% came from SaaS, which is all the self-service fees. The company refuses to disclose how much of its revenues are from influencer marketing and how much are from matchmaking for content creators, but it appears the latter is a very small number.Influencer marketing has become big business. According to Adweek, the industry will be $10 billion in 2020. According to Mediakix and Business Insider Intelligence, the market was $8 billion in 2019 and will reach $15 billion by 2022.Influencers can make a lot of money. According to Mediakix, payments on Instagram can be up to $500 per post with 10,000 followers to $150,000 per post with a million followers. The number of followers is only partly the measure of value. There are dozens of other variables including engagement rates, type of content, and subject matter. The Instagram Rich List for 2019 from HopperHQ, tracks the top 100 influencers on Instagram and their cost per post.IZEA's most important direct competitors are Linqia, Collective Bias, AspireIQ, and Upfluence. But this is an extremely crowded market. According to Influencer Marketing Hub's The State of Influencer Marketing 2020: Benchmark Report, in 2019, there were 1,120 influencer marketing platforms and agencies, including 380 new ones created just that year. It isn't a surprise that most players are very small, with no one company dominating. $10 billion in estimated revenues for 2020 divided by 1,120 is only $8.9 million per company, after all. See Competitors.Our takeaway is that, as the industry matures, there will likely be consolidation, and a very high death rate among those companies not acquired in a roll-up. Or Facebook could step in, offer influencer marketing as a sideline, and create an extinction-level even for the rest of the industry (see below).The freelancer match-making business is a totally separate market, at least as it applies to piece-work (it makes sense that an influencer might want to license their entire broadcast). By our estimate, the size of the freelancer market (revenues for the match-making platforms, not the total gig economy) is roughly $2 billion. The two public companies in this space (Upwork (NASDAQ:UPWK) and Fiverr (NYSE:FVRR)) are both losing money. There are just too many ways freelancers can connect with clients.Opportunities (external)Influencer marketing will continue to grow. According to Influencer Marketing Hub's The State of Influencer Marketing 2020: Benchmark Report, 91% of advertisers believe influencer marketing is an effective form of marketing and 78% intend to dedicate a portion of their budget to influencer marketing in 2020. We also find it interesting that the most used social platforms, Facebook, YouTube, LinkedIn, and TikTok all significantly lag behind Instagram in influencer marketing. The market could grow if they started to catch up (even though Facebook, which owns Instagram, would be competing with itself).Increasing supply of influencers. The number of influencers making money will increase as marketers go after smaller but more focused social followings, paying ""micro influencers"" who have 10,000 to 50,000 followers and even ""nano influencers"" who have fewer than 10,000. Dealing with such small influencers is only practical on an automated platform.Threats (external)The influencer marketing market is extremely crowded. It's hard to get attention when you have 1,120 competitors.Facebook could enter the market. Facebook with Instagram controls by far the largest share of social media. If it got into influencer marketing with its existing agency connections, even if it didn't require its influencers to post exclusively on their sites, the third-party industry would be in big trouble. But it hasn't, and a discussion of why is beyond the scope of this profile.The Federal Trade Commission may impose additional regulations on influencer marketing. Ethically, influencer marketing only works with disclosure. The FTC has already posted guidelines for influencers here. New regulations would further benefit consumers but cut industry revenues.Strengths (internal)IZEA has a lot of influencers signed up. The company says,These number are large because the company has been around a long time and made some acquisitions, but they are soft because influencers tend to sign up for many platforms and then settle on one or two.Not dependent on one customer. IZEA had no customer that accounted for more than 10% of its revenue during the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, or 2018, according to the company's last 10K.The company has cash and credit. As of December 31, 2019, the company had $5.88 million in cash and an untapped credit line of $5 million. This is important during the COVID-19 slowdown.As a public company, IZEA can use stock for acquisitions. IZEA is the only public company in influencer marketing. Theoretically, it could acquire its way to dominance, but the company would have to be turned around first to get the share price up.The cap table is clean. Insiders own 8.87% of the shares and institutions own less than 10%. See Cap Table.The CEO is popular with lower-level employees. On the review sites, newer and younger employees often complain about the substandard pay, but they like the relaxed atmosphere and the fun work culture. The CEO, Ted Murphy, has a 91% approval rating, and 82% of the employees would recommend a job at the company, according to Glassdoor.The new Brand Graph product looks promising. This is a brand sentiment measuring tool, released just before the COVID-19 crash. It makes a lot of sense to give clients a way to measure the effect of their campaign spend.Weaknesses (internal)The company's business model for influencer marketing is self-cannibalizing. It sells tools, platforms, and services to both brands and agencies. Each of those offerings vitiates the others and confuses everyone. On GlassDoor, one IZEA employee said management needs to ""… Refine the core product of IZEA. Decide what it actually is. We currently make the majority of our money as an Agency even though we swear up and down we're not one."" Another employee said,Although these comments are from 2017, they appear to be just as valid today.The company's second business, content creator matchmaking, is very confusing and is unrelated to influencer marketing. The supply is different, the demand is different. One business doesn't help the other. And the similar language confuses everyone. Even the company can't keep straight the distinction between influencers and content creators, posting,To be fair, a competitor is also dabbling in this side business (see AspireIQ here), but it still makes no sense.The engineering is mediocre. On the software review site G2.com, there were only 15 reviews of IZEA, and the consensus was that its platform is ""Buggy but gets the job done."" A review on another site said,On another site, an IZEA employee anonymously said,The company's acquisitions were not worth the dilution. The TapInfluence purchase for $7.08 million in July 2018, ended up with a $418k impairment charge. The company laments the ""churn"" in TapInfluence customers, but churning implies lost customer are replaced, which they weren't. They were just lost. And one would think the technology could have been developed in house. The Ebyline acquisition for $8.85 million in January 2015, and ZenContent for $4.5 million in July 2016, bought a business (the content creator sideline) the company didn't need.The company will probably have to do a reverse stock split. On December 11, 2019, NASDAQ granted the company an additional 180 days (extending an earlier deadline) to comply with the minimum bid requirement.Something is odd in finance. The audit committee corrected revenues for 2015 and 2016, decreasing each by about $6 million, and the first 3 quarters of 2017 (discussed in this 8-K). There are three recent shareholder lawsuits discussed in the most recent 10-K. There was a patent infringement case (discussed in this 10-K 2014 and concluded in 10-K 2015) . The company's stock was listed on a foreign exchange without (we are told) the company's prior knowledge (as stated in this press release). And, the company has had three CFOs in the past two years, with the current CFO being interim, rehired after having left in 2018 (discussed in the most recent 10-K).The company lost its first-mover advantage. The company says,But according to Influencer Marketing Hub's list of platforms for 2020, IZEA ranks only 22 out of 30.IZEA had an early and promising start in influencer marketing, and the CEO is truly an impressive fountain of new ideas, but the company lurched after one shiny, new idea to another, tangling its strategy along the way. This company has released more new products than any other $19 million company we have ever seen. That's reflected in the stock price. From the outside, it looks as if the board - which has some accomplished members - provided little discipline to a hyper-creative chief executive, to the massive detriment of the shareholders. In the meantime, the market became extremely crowded. See People.IZEA's existing business could be squared away, and the company could then be used as the nucleus of a roll-up. But we don't think that will happen without major changes in oversight.We have spoken to the company about its future and what we see as necessary changes, and we will continue the discussion. In the meantime, we're staying out.If you support this course of action - or don't - please let us know and tell us why.The Accord Partners Strategy.

3975816,60091,2016-05-17T17:19:13-04:00,"IZEA a pioneer in the content marketing industry. With first mover status, an impressive deck of investors and significant revenue growth, there is a strong case for potential upside.Revenue growth continues to be created (organically and through acquisitions). Furthermore, margins increased a few hundred bps in the mrq, suggesting the company is starting to control costs/roll-off legacy revenues.The company is relatively undervalued, netted the majority of their warrants, recently up-listed to the NASDAQ and has a clean balance sheet.Given that IZEA is sitting near a 52/week low, a compelling investment case can be made.Interview with Ted Murphy, the CEO of IZEA.","IZEA (NASDAQ:IZEA) owns the marketplace that pioneered the concept for online sponsorship. As a company, major brands engage with IZEA's platform, in order to sponsor online influencers and to host sponsored social campaigns. As of December 31 st, 2015, the company had 683,000 user connections, from 358,000 user accounts.Investment ThesisThe idea presented here stray's far from my typical deep value approach. IZEA is a growth company, that isn't profitable and will most likely raise additional funds via debt or equity offerings. However, despite the speculative nature of this security, I believe that IZEA should not be ignored.An investment case for IZEA can be made based upon the game changing nature of the company's business model, potential for rapid topline growth, and a successful CEO running the ship. When looking into my crystal ball, I see IZEA either becoming a huge player in the online advertisement industry or getting bought out.Out with the Old, in with the NewAs you read my article look to the left and right…what do you see? Ads, ads and more ads. Let me ask you this; have you ever intentionally clicked on an ad? If I was to bet, it would be no. Who in their right mind would click on an ad? According to statistics, you are more likely to survive a plane crash than to click on a banner ad.Solve Media did a really interesting study on the likelihood of someone actually clicking on an ad. The statistics were fascinating…You are 2.13 times more likely to get a full house in poker than to click on a banner ad. An individual is 31.25 times more likely to win the Mega Millions. 40.17 times more likely to give birth to twins. 87.9 times more likely to apply to Harvard and get accepted. 279.64 times more likely to climb and summit Mt. Everest.Given these statistics, why do companies spend billions of dollars each year advertising? Good question. If you figure that one out let me know. However, as we have all learned from South Park, ads naturally adapt to their environment, making it impossible to rid the world of ads.Ted Murphy, the CEO of IZEA and serial entrepreneur, realized that the current method of advertising on the internet is inefficient. With his vision on making advertising over the internet more efficient, he pioneered a much more effective way of conveying ads to internet users.The idea is simple and in my opinion, genius. With the array of social media celebrities, journalists and industry experts making a name for themselves blogging, tweeting and whatever else you can do online; Ted realized that there was a hidden niche to take advantage of. Thus, Ted and his team built-up a marketplace where advertisers can sponsor or pay online influencers, to pitch their product that they want marketed.For an example, let's say that Katie, a famous health and fitness blogger wants to make an extra buck, or ten. Katie learns about IZEA from a fellow blogger; promptly signing up for an account. When she gets on the site, she sees that MyFitnessPal wants to sponsor a blogger to post about their new product. MyFitnessPal reviews Katie's online profiles and decides to sponsor her to post about their product. Being that IZEA owns the platform, they act as the middleman, connecting MyFitnessPal and Katie.Acting as a middleman, IZEA generates revenue from three sources: Sponsored Revenue, Content Revenue and Service Fee Revenue. Sponsored revenue is generated when an advertiser uses custom branded content, pay per post or runs an advertising campaign. Sponsored revenue equated out to 60% and 92% of revenue in 2015 and 2014.Content revenue is generated when an influencer creates content, and then is delivered and accepted to the customer. In 2015 and 2014, content revenue accounted for 39% and 0% of revenue, respectively.Finally, Service revenue is generated when fees are charged to customers. Fees mainly consist of subscription fees, licensing fees (white-label use), early cash out fees and inactivity fees. Service fees accounted for 1% and 8% of revenues in 2015 and 2014, respectively.I think you are beginning to see how IZEA's business model can be very disruptive. But how disruptive can content marketing be? In my opinion, extremely. Take my word for it if you want. Or if you don't believe me, take a look at some statistics I found.Source: Google TrendsThe most obvious place to get a comparison on content marketing vs banner ads is Google Trends. According to Google Trends, content marketing is growing exponentially while banner ads look like the stock prices of coal companies.Adding additional tailwinds to the company's technology is the expected growth in online ad spending. According to eMarketer, total digital ad spending will increase 15.4% this year to $68.82 billion. Furthermore, digital ad spending is expected to continue to increase at double digit rates through 2020.As predicted in South Park, consumers start to get smarter with what they want to see. Because we have begun to adapt as consumers, there has been an exponential rise in ad blocking.Source: IZEA Investor PresentationHowever, despite our intent to get rid of ads completely, ad creators have begun to adapt, and have gotten more intelligent in how they convey their advertisements. In actuality, content marketing is the future of advertisement. I am not alone in thinking that content marketing is the way of the future either. For an example, 78% of Chief Marketing Officers believe that content marketing is the future. Further proof is from the list of some of the world's top executives who believe that content marketing is a game changer.There are two major tailwinds playing in IZEA's favor.Advertisement spending will not go away. No matter how smart we get with ad blocks, advertisers will find a way to get through them. As the world economy grows and as we become more interconnected on the web, the end result will be more money spent on digital advertising. Banner ads are inefficient and practically useless. The shift from banner ads to content marketing will be extremely beneficial to IZEA.ValuationFrom 2011-2014, IZEA's revenue grew at an 18.92% annualized rate. However, by 2015, revenues jumped up from ~$8mm to >$20mm, or a 150% jump. The reason for the extraordinary jump in revenues is due to the acquisition of Ebyline.Before the acquisition, the Ebyline platform was used by publishers to manage over 200,000 content projects. Post-acquisition, Ebyline gave IZEA access to a network of 15,000 content creators with many having professional journalism credentials from big named media outlets. In total, IZEA paid $8,850,000 (mixture of cash and equity) with contingent performance payments expected to be $3,327,064.The downfall to the Ebyline acquisition was the massive hit gross margins took. After bringing on the content creators, gross margins fell from an impressive 65.8% to a sub-par 40.2%. With every action there is an equal or greater reaction. In this case, IZEA traded >65% gross margins for >150% revenue growth.Given that margins fell to ~40% in 2015, Q1 was quite the surprise for me. In Q1, revenues jumped up 32% with gross margins up to 43.3%. The reason for the ~300 bps jump up in gross margins was due to the company focusing on branded content. Moreover, as branded content continues to represent more and more of the revenue mix-up, gross margins have potential to continue to incrementally increase (maybe another 200 bps).A short-term headwind, which in the long-term is a tailwind, is the widening gap between bookings and revenue recognition. Because the gap between bookings and revenue recognition is widening, revenues have a potential of being dampened in the short-term.Lower revenues in the short-term, will act as a headwind; from short-term oriented investors. However, what matters is that companies are beginning to see the value in IZEA's platform and have started to increase the size of their bookings. Eventually, the majority of the bookings will end up on the topline. Although, due to the sheer size, revenues may not hit managements target in the next few quarters or year.I believe that IZEA is undervalued given their rapid growth, the leadership position in their industry and the game changing technology that top name advertisers have begun to use. Furthermore, given the recent increase in bookings, I believe that IZEA is well positioned to continue generating significant revenue growth, organically and through acquisitions.IZEA is also relatively undervalued to its peers…Source: Created By Nicholas BodnarWhat is even more interesting is that SITO, MEET and TUBE has 2016 estimated revenue growth rates of 81%, 14% and 27%, respectively. IZEA outstrips both MEET and TUBE with an estimated revenue growth rate of 40-42% for 2016. Moreover, the only company that is profitable is MEET, which makes us question; why is IZEA valued below its peers?In my opinion, IZEA deserves to be trading at a 2.0-2.5x multiple given the comparable comps valuation, game changing technology, leadership position, double digit revenue growth and crystal clean balance sheet. At a 2.0-2.5x multiple, IZEA's EV would be sitting at ~$40-50mm or an 84-129% upside.A buffer for the price target above is the well run management team coupled with the impressive list of investors who have taken a position in the company. At the head of the company we have Ted Murphy. Murphy comes from family of very successful entrepreneurs, in which, Murphy has been a serial entrepreneur practically his whole life (since 1994, Murphy has founded six companies).After having a cup of coffee with Murphy and subsequently speaking with him on the phone, I was impressed by his demeanor, competence and enthusiasm towards IZEA. I have attached a quick 20 minute interview below. Note, the interview starts at 1:30 and may contain forward looking statements.IZEA also has an impressive list of investors who have bought into the company:Source: IZEA investor presentation.I am not one to ride the coattails of a successful investor or fund; however, it's always interesting to see some of the biggest names interested in a tiny microcap.Going forward, IZEA will continue to add scalable segments to their platform, significantly benefiting from the increasing popularity in content marketing. Furthermore, given the absolute high amount of monetary assets spent on banner ads, there is a good suggestion that content marketing is still in the early stages of development. With IZEA's first mover status and already built out, successful and rapidly growing platform, I believe that the company has a huge ability to become a major player in this market.RisksConclusionThere are a lot of positive directions IZEA can go into. With the majority of their warrants netted into cash, zero long-term debt, an immensely growing platform, and the 2016 up-listing on the NASDAQ exchange, there is a lot more room for the company to run. IZEA is also a relatively young, high-growth company, which will start to catch the eye of other players looking for an entry into content marketing industry. With an EV/Revenue multiple ~1.00x, I believe the company is significantly undervalued, with a significant amount of forward looking prospects.Editor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks.

4023237,94946,2016-11-14T14:34:45-05:00,"Izea offers investors an exceptional way to play the hyper growth of two burgeoning areas of the digital advertising industry, influencer marketing and content marketing, without paying a huge multiple.Izea is valued at only roughly 1.0x EV/Sales, despite growing 50% in q2 2016 and expanding gross margins 800 basis points.Izea announced on 10/6/16 that it achieved its first positive adjusted EBITDA month during the quarter.Solid management that owns a lot of stock and bought stock on open market as recently as September 2016.","Izea (NASDAQ:IZEA) - Long; Price Target: $7.70 (56% Upside) Silver FoxNovember 2016 (Post Fiscal Q2 '16)IZEA is an early stage nano-cap trading on the Nasdaq, offering the opportunity for investors to buy a high-growth, best-in-class business with strong secular growth tailwinds and deepening network effects at a substantial discount to its peer group. We believe IZEA shares are significantly undervalued given low investor awareness primarily due to being a relatively illiquid small-cap stock and a ""black box"" ad tech model that many generalist investors inherently have difficulty grasping. We also think IZEA's current valuation reflects a high level of skepticism on its ability to continue growing revenue sustainably over the next few years. While revenue growth will admittedly slow in the next few years given the base effect on a larger installed customer set, the defensible nature of IZEA's top-line, which we believe is trending towards larger average order size and a more recurring nature, should not be discounted to the degree implied by today's valuation. We believe IZEA could be worth at least $7.70 in the next 12 months based on what we view is an extremely conservative exit multiple of 1.0x EV/sales. It is highly likely, in our view, that the business will eventually re-rate much higher given the strong likelihood of continued execution and the increasing appeal of the company as a strategic asset to potential acquirors.BackgroundFounded in 2006 originally as PayPerPost, IZEA was a pioneer in a niche of digital advertising called ""social influencer marketing"" where convention historically did not support brands paying for online posts or tweets. Over time, this practice became an industry standard, and IZEA accordingly had tailwinds to drive its growth going forward. In 2011, IZEA completed a reverse merger with a corporate shell and in 2014, it raised $12mm in a PIPE transaction, led by small-cap investment bank Craig Hallum. Despite taking share in a rapidly growing industry, IZEA still remained under the radar of traditional investors as an OTC bulletin board stock. In August 2015, IZEA converted 43 million shares of outstanding warrants into common stock, reducing potential dilution and adding $13mm in cash to its balance sheet. In January 2016, IZEA completed a 1:20 reverse stock split and subsequently listed on the Nasdaq, effective at the end February. BDO signed on as the company's auditors, and in March, Liolios Group, a reputable small-cap IR firm, took charge of introducing IZEA to the sell-side community. These recent developments have increased the stock's visibility among investors somewhat, but IZEA still remains under the radar of most institutions.Business ModelBased in Orlando, FL, IZEA operates an internet-based advertising model, relying on online marketplaces that connect content creators and brands. IZEA pays creators to produce and distribute unique content, including long-form text, videos, photos, and status updates on behalf of brands through websites, blogs, and social media outlets. Brands benefit from differentiated, influential consumer-driven content and engaging, shareable stories that drive awareness. The marketplaces are powered by Izea Exchange (""Izeax""), a software platform that enables transactions to be completed at scale through the management of content workflow, creator search and targeting, bidding, analytics, and payment processing. Izeax serves as an ecosystem that supports various content types, including blog posts, status updates, videos, and photos enabled through social channels like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Tumblr, etc.Izeax catapulted from zero users two years ago to over 683,000 currently, with the potential to reach over 3.9 billion followers. Clients migrated fully to Izeax in October 2015. The platform is able to provide scale, facilitate client migration seamlessly, and help sign up white label partners who want to self-brand and operate the solution in-house. White labeling carries lower revenue per partner than a managed relationship, but the associated margins are significantly higher given a lower labor component borne by IZEA. At its core, Izeax enables the business to operate a two-sided marketplace, bringing together both advertisers and content creators and social media personalities and collecting a fee for facilitating the relationship, much like a standard ""take rate"" e-commerce model. Network effects enable high incremental margins over time, driving bigger deal sizes and substantial operating leverage.Key Operating Segments:Sponsored SocialIZEA generates about 65% of its revenue through its Sponsored Social segment at gross margins above 60%. This segment addresses an advertising model known as ""influencer marketing"", where Izea brokers the relationship between a brand or ad agency and a social media influencer (blogger, tweeter, etc.), who is hired specifically to share sponsored content in an ad campaign with their followers. This parallels to the existing concepts of product placement and endorsements in movies, TV, and radio, and applies them to social networks, allowing the opportunity to monetize content and drive brand demand to a wide range of influencers, including professional bloggers, college students, stay-at-home parents, etc.Illustrated in Exhibit A are some general examples of sponsored content via influencers on different social networks supported by Izeax. In each case, the brand/product is clearly featured by the particular influencer's account, with a relevant label or hashtag indicating a direct relationship between the brand and the influencer. This has the potential to drive a deep connection between followers of the influencer and the brand, which in turn can drive demand for the brand's products. Izeax currently operates on eight different social networks. A big selling point in particular for IZEA's sponsored social business is that ads flowing through their platform are frequently shared by consumers, driving network effects through increased views and thereby boosting advertiser ROI. Further, as more brand advertisers utilize Izeax's marketplaces, they create a growing positive feedback loop; this increases monetization opportunities for creators, which in turn attracts more creators and drives more value for advertisers, thereby attracting even more advertisers. In order to attract new influencers to the platform, IZEA has created a referral program, where an influencer can recommend a peer and earn a referral fee between 5-15% of the peer's earnings for up to a two-year period.Sponsored social campaigns run from anywhere between three days for a tweet to 30 days for a blog post, and revenue is recognized ratably over the applicable term. Operating metrics to gauge campaign success in this area generally include number of views, click-throughs, likes, and general engagements per platform. Typically, for each dollar an advertiser spends with IZEA for sponsored services, roughly 50% goes to social media content creators, thereby providing a valuable income stream to many influencers while widening the brand's reach. In addition to using Izeax itself, IZEA also licenses it to roughly 30 other companies to use the platform (some examples as of 12/31/15 include media companies like Meredith and Viacom). White label partners receive a percentage of each transaction generated by users within their system.In 2015, IZEA launched SocialLinks, a new affiliate marketing product through which consumers can buy a product promoted by an influencer, and the influencer is compensated for driving this transaction. SocialLinks is monetized on a cost-per-action basis, where the influencer is only paid if a purchase is consummated. Macy's, eBay, and Target were all among initial retail industry customers, and management notes interest has grown in this particular product, particularly as brands and retailers look to drive better advertising ROI industry-wide.In June 2016, Izea announced a partnership with Rakuten, a $15 billion market cap Japanese internet company which owns the largest affiliate marketing business in the world. Rakuten will use SocialLinks as their social product in their affiliate marketing business, and Izea gets to tap into Rakuten's millions of brands and customers on it's platform.ContentOver 30% of IZEA's revenue stems from the Content segment, which carries structurally lower margins in the low-mid 20%s range. The offerings within this segment are the result of the 2015 acquisition of Ebyline and derive from a digital advertising form known as ""content marketing"". In this situation, IZEA behaves as a broker between companies/publishers requiring that an article be written for web and offline consumption and freelance journalists seeking work. A prominent example management cites in IZEA's investor materials is that of Russ Banham, formerly a journalist for The Wall Street Journal and his contribution of an article titled, ""The Upside of Surge Pricing at Uber"" on Dell's corporate website.Content assignments can range from complex academic-style whitepapers, newspaper inserts, recipes, customer emails, or simple product descriptions for e-commerce companies. The purpose of this model is primarily so that publishers can replace internal content development with an ""on-demand"" labor model, thereby driving down fixed payroll costs. Similar to sponsored social posts, content is another area within marketing materials that consumers tend to share. The Content segment has over 15,000 content creators with professional journalism backgrounds and supports the needs for over 1,000 publishers.CustomersIzea's customer set is large and highly reputable, spanning consumer brands across various verticals, including consumer products, retail/e-commerce, technology, and travel/leisure. Major customers are highlighted below in Exhibit B. Customers are predominantly US-based, though IZEA also does business with some companies in Canada, India, the United Kingdom, and over 150 other countries. No customer represents over 10% of sales. Of note, IZEA is the platform of choice for all five of the top five global consumer brands by revenue, which should be evident from the below exhibit. Management does not disclose which of these brands just ran a one-time campaign versus which have signed longer-term, higher margin master service agreements. However, in Q2 '16, it was noted that half of IZEA's revenue was from repeat customers and half came from new clients. Importantly, IZEA's average order size continues to grow each quarter, indicating that the platform is evidencing deeper value across the customer base over time. In Q2 '16, average order size grew 13% y/y, and in Q4 '15 the company processed its first order of $1 million.CompetitorsBoth of IZEA's key sources of revenue, influencer marketing and content marketing, derive from industries that are highly competitive and very fragmented. Primary research indicates there are approximately 50 (at least) companies in the influencer marketing space, most of which are very small. The barriers to entry in influencer marketing are not very high, as an individual with some basic relationships can run campaigns using spreadsheet software. However, there are structurally very high barriers to scale in order to serve large brand advertisers and to gain favor as the vendor of choice. IZEA's decade of operating experience and scale offer distinct advantages in this space. As of October 2016, IZEA had roughly 700,000 creater connections in 150 countries, and the platform has processed over 3.5 million transactions. This scale is extremely difficult to replicate. Competitors in influencer marketing include Mode Media (bankrupt as of recently), Federated Media, BlogHer, Adly, TapInfluence, and Collective Bias. Although our research suggests that some of these are larger than IZEA given significant venture capital backing, we do not believe they possess brand relationships or a technology platform as robust as IZEA. On the content marketing side, competitors include Triplecurve, Zaius, Zmags, and Odyssiant. Given the lower margin and less differentiated nature of content marketing, we believe no specific competitive threat exists to IZEA on this side.Any discussion on IZEA's competition would be incomplete without mentioning Google's October 2016 acquisition of influencer marketing business Famebit. Famebit has approximately 20 employees and is a fairly small acquisition for Google, by our estimation, particularly given Google's obvious relative size and edge in innovation. Given how little time has elapsed since the deal announcement, we cannot yet ascertain exactly how Google will leverage this asset within its own ecosystem. However, we believe the acquisition is encouraging for IZEA, as it is a signpost of the increasing importance of influencers as a differentiated marketing channel for brands, which ultimately could lend itself to IZEA continuing to be an opportunistic consolidator or be poised for strategic acquisition itself.AcquisitionsOpportunistic tuck-in acquisitions have historically played a fairly prominent role in IZEA's strategy as a means of supplementing strong organic growth. Management has been skilled at integrating acquired businesses across the spectrum of both sponsored social and content areas; four acquisitions in particular stand out in IZEA's history. In July 2011, IZEA acquired Germany's Magpie Twitter advertising network, including 12,000 advertisers and 20,000 Twitter-based creators in 143 countries. In December 2012, it acquired FeaturedUsers, an advertising network that helped pioneer the trend of aiding Twitter users in growing their follower base. Next, in 2015, IZEA purchased Ebyline, an online marketplace providing access to a network of over 12,000 content creators, spanning from writers to illustrators, across 73 countries. Finally, the most recent acquisition of Zencontent in July 2016 served to grow the content marketing side of the business. At the time of the deal, Zencontent had roughly $2 million in run-rate revenues at 50% gross margins; though this deal serves to dilute the pro forma gross margin profile of IZEA, it also provides a diversified stream of revenue to make IZEA a ""one-stop shop"" across sponsored social and content areas, ensuring greater long-term competitive defensibility. As a general rule, management has structured acquisitions in a shareholder-friendly manner, relying on a mix of cash as well as equity earn-outs based on future revenue milestones. We believe IZEA is uniquely advantaged as a consolidator in its fragmented market, as the favorable mix of a net cash position and equity listed on the Nasdaq will continue to allow management to prudently seek out value and tender for future acquisitions. Over time, we think this positioning could also allow IZEA to reach such scale that would be attractive as a strategic takeout candidate by various other digital media players.Capital StructureWe believe that IZEA's capital structure and balance sheet overall are in a very strong position. The company does not have any debt and had a net cash position of $8 million as of Q2 '16. This is approximately one-third of its current market cap, which we think is a further indication of deep undervaluation. To put it in context of share price, $1.50 of IZEA's current valuation comes from its cash balance, offering downside protection and ample optionality for future capital deployment into high ROIC areas. IZEA has access to a line of credit, currently undrawn, for $5 million with prominent tech-focused institution Bridge Bank. In addition, the company's $75mm shelf registration aids in providing significant liquidity and the enhanced ability to accelerate strategic investments. All of these factors protect against the likelihood that IZEA will have to go to market for a dilutive follow-on equity offering in the near future, in our view.Investor BaseIZEA has a largely underappreciated ""smart money"" investor base that should inspire confidence in the company's long-term trajectory and potential for success. Some prominent investors holding more than 5% of the equity are Special Situations Fund (25%), Goldman Partners (5.5%), and Diker Fund (3.0%) on the institutional side, as well as Dr. Phillip Frost and John Pappajohn as individuals. With over 75% of the equity owned by reputable holders and management, we are confident that IZEA has a strong stable of partners that can help drive financing and transactional advice going forward to position the company for continued robust growth. Institutional investors own 38% of the company as of October 2016.IZEA is a high-quality business, as it continues to grow top-line rapidly and increase order values, suggesting it is benefiting from stronger network effects and stickier customer relationships. The drivers of continued revenue growth within IZEA remain strong, as the positive feedback loop created between creators and brands is amplified. This should allow IZEA to continue growing bookings and revenue at least in-line with provided guidance, if not well in excess. We expect that while gross margins will compress in the near term given the mix shift towards content from integration of Ebyline, they should stabilize and tick back up over time as incremental volumes from higher margin white label accounts start influencing long-term business mix. This dynamic plus an anticipated slowdown in SG&A will begin to drive EBIT margin accretion and position the business for substantial long-term EPS and FCF generation.Management is best-in-class and has a high degree of alignment with common shareholders.We believe IZEA's management to be extremely strong, with Ted Murphy (Founder, CEO, and Chairman) evidencing a keen aptitude for strategic, operational, and financial discipline. At only 40 years old and leading IZEA since its 2006 establishment, Ted is one of the ""founding fathers"" of the influencer marketing industry. We have spent a significant amount of time with Ted and believe that he is a solid tech entrepreneur with a relatively enviable track record given the fragmented and competitive nature of his space, in which he was able to create a dominant business with sticky customer relationships and list it on the Nasdaq. His financial acumen can be seen in expanding gross margins and starting to scale back operating expenses while not compromising on admirable top-line growth. Ted owns 5.5% of IZEA's equity and consistently makes open market purchases, indicating an alignment of incentives with public shareholders. In addition, COO Ryan Schramm owns approximately 3.5% of the business. Finally, IZEA's board is comprised of members with deep backgrounds in consumer brands and technology; collectively, management and the board own roughly 25% of the company.Valuation is simply too compelling to ignore at current levels.IZEA's currently cheap valuation is the result of a few factors, which we believe arise primarily from technical factors rather than discrete fundamental issues. First, the investor base to date has been limited given the early stage, micro-cap nature of the business, despite listing on the Nasdaq in early 2016. Further, ad tech stocks have suffered broadly during the year relative to other companies in the broad internet and software sectors, as investors are concerned about the ability of these businesses to experience sustainable top-line growth as advertiser relationships mature on the largest social networks. Ad tech business models have been viewed increasingly by the market as ""black boxes"", providing investors with little conviction during turbulent markets; we concede that IZEA is no exception. We also accept that revenue growth at IZEA will have to slow as the company matures over the next few years. However, we believe this is more than discounted in the current share price, as the business will exit 2016 doing ~40%+ top-line growth and should be able to compound that in the high 30%s in 2017. This is highly impressive growth for a company selling for less than 1.0x currently.Several key assumptions drive our financial model, provided below as Exhibit C. We highlight some of the major variables as follows:Given IZEA's lack of near-term profitability, we benchmark the company against the broader internet media space on an EV/Sales multiple basis. Exhibit D below highlights the companies we believe have enough broad similarities to IZEA's business and also grow revenue sustainably at above average rates. IZEA very clearly sells for a much lower EV/Sales multiple than this peer group; however, we believe some of this discount is warranted given the relatively more nascent stage of its growth, the more competitive nature of its space, the lack of profitability to date, and the small-cap, illiquid profile of the stock.Our base case valuation scenario assumes a 1.0x EV/Sales multiple on on our FY '17 revenue estimate of $39.2 million. This yields a stock price of $8.44, or 71% upside from current levels, giving the company full credit for its $8 million cash balance from the end of Q2 '16 and assuming a 4% y/y increase in share count. We believe a 1.0x EV/Sales multiple is extremely conservative given we are modeling high 30%s revenue growth in FY '17; however, we think this is prudent given the aforementioned factors that create challenges in comparability between IZEA and its peers. Our downside case valuation assumes a 15% haircut to our FY '17 base case revenue, yielding an estimate of approximately $33 million, to which we apply a 0.5x EV/Sales multiple. This produces a stock price of $4.41, or 11% downside from the current price. Our upside case is predicated on a 2.0x EV/Sales multiple and that our $39 million revenue estimate from the base case holds, for conservatism. A 2.0x EV/Sales multiple on a forward estimate represents a discount to M&A comparables we denote in Exhibit E. Again, while IZEA may ultimately command a takeout multiple in-line with industry averages, we believe that underwriting a lower multiple on the upside scenario is prudent given that M&A valuations recently have been particularly elevated. Our upside case, therefore, produces a stock price of $15.44, or 213% upside. We assume the cash balance of $8 million holds across both of our downside and upside cases. As illustrated by the table at the beginning of this memo, applying a probability distribution of 60% to our base case and 20% each to our downside and upside cases, we arrive at our price target of $7.70, or 56% upside, over the next 12 months.As is generally the case with stocks offering multi-bagger potential, an investment in IZEA carries several distinct risks that we believe must be carefully weighed.Editor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks.

3136636,50822,2015-05-04T14:06:48-04:00,"IZEA has once again reported record financials.Native advertising growing at a faster rate than any other type of advertising.IZEA is positioning itself, and scaling itself, to become a market leader in the sponsored social space.The company is a micro-cap, so there are obvious risks associated with it, but it could be a potentially rewarding small scale speculative allocation.","Record Financials Highlight IZEA's Foothold in the Native Advertising SpaceThe social media space has been an attractive investment opportunity over the past four or five years, and some of the leading companies in the sector generated triple digit rewards for early stage investors. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is up 118% at time of writing on its IPO in May 2012, and, similarly, LinkedIn (LNKD) is up 186% on its May 2011 IPO. Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), while not quite as rewarding as those mentioned and having demonstrated much higher volatility, is also up about 15% from its November 2013 IPO. Future gains are far from guaranteed, however as, as those who remember MySpace will be well aware, things can change quickly in the social sharing sector. An organization whose future success relies on the social whims of the tech savvy can be a risky position to hold. One thing is relatively certain, however. Whoever ends up leading in the space, social media is here to stay.There is one company that offers exposure to the social media space, but has a business model that also offers protection from the potential turnaround in a company like Facebook's popularity. That company is IZEA (NASDAQ:IZEA). How does the company afford its investors this protection, how is IZEA performing at the moment, and what can we project going forward?There are a number of resources available online that offer a detailed description of the company's business model, one of which is its video presentation available here, but for those not yet familiar with the space or the company itself, here's a brief introduction.IZEA operates in what the company calls the sponsored social space - a space it claims to have invented in 2011. Through its platform, IZEA-X, IZEA brings together advertisers (companies wishing to promote a good or service) and influencers (individuals with a large and potentially influential social media or online presence). Influencers published content through their personal channels that promotes the goods or services of the advertiser, and receive compensation - primarily financial, but also in some cases material.Most reading this will have seen a sponsored post online, be it through a social media network or a content website, and according to industry experts, sponsored content is quickly becoming the promotional method of choice for online advertising.There are a number of reasons for this. First, traditional banner advertising has grown to become very ineffective when compared to the early days of Internet promotion. Some of the first banner ads received a 50% click through rate (""CTR""). Now, the average banner ad receives somewhere between a 0.05% and a 2% CTR. Second, as internet usage increasingly migrates towards alternative platforms such as mobile and tablet, screen space is at a premium. Traditional banner ads display well on a desktop monitor, but can be intrusive on a handheld device. Native advertising such as that which IZEA facilitates offers an effective solution to the lack of space on a handheld device. Further, these are not far-reaching predictions by industry experts; they are becoming the reality of online advertising very quickly. For example, in 2013, Forbes reported that it generated 20% of its advertising revenue through sponsored content.With Facebook and Twitter both generating revenues from sponsored posts and sponsored tweets on their respective platforms, how can IZEA expect to ""compete"" for this revenue? The answer is in what the company calls its platform agnosticism. For an advertiser to promote a good or service on Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest and other social media platforms, not to mention the host of small to medium-sized blogs that have proven effective promotional resources in the past, it must approach each of these individually. Through IZEA-X, the company can design, coordinate, execute and track the effectiveness of a wide scale campaign across a network of influencers and platforms all in one place.How does IZEA generate revenue? Just as would a traditional media agency, IZEA serves as a market maker between publishers and advertisers. For the bringing together of the two parties, as well as for the use of its platform and proprietary technology, IZEA takes a cut from the advertising spend of the company in question.How has the company performed to date? In March 2015, IZEA Management held a conference call to explain and announce its financial performance as reported in its latest filings. As CFO LeAnn Hitchcock reported, Q4 2014 revenue came in at $2.46 million, a 26% rise on the $1.96 million reported for the corresponding quarter a year earlier. Revenues generated during the year ended December 31, 2014, totalled $8.3 million, another 26% increase over the corresponding period in 2013, reported at $6.6 million. Gross profit margin came in at 65.5%, up from 56.5% during Q4 2013, and gross profit came in at $1.6 million, again up from $1.1 million during Q4 2013. Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2014, came in at $5.5 million and 65.8% gross profit margin. Net income during 2014 came in at $3.2 million versus a net loss of $3.3 million a year earlier - with the difference primarily attributable to a $7.8 million change in the fair value of the company's derivatives. During the conference call, the company reported a $1.5 million credit facility that it had secured with Bridge Bank (NASDAQ:BBNK) in March 2013 and that was - at the time - contact. This week, however, IZEA has reported an expansion of this facility of $3.5 million, bringing the total to an untapped $5 million.Between the announcing of these financial results and time of writing, there have been a number of developments worth mentioning. The first is a 151% year over year increase in its bookings during the first quarter of 2015, reported unaudited at $4.3 million - the highest quarterly performance in IZEA's history. The growth came primarily as a result of IZEA's acquisition of Ebyline, Inc., a content marketplace with a network of 12,000 content creators and 2000 fully vetted journalism professionals from backgrounds such as the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal and ESPN. Another, was the announcement that former president of Olive Garden, John Caron, had joined the IZEA board of directors. Caron brings with him 27 years marketing experience in senior marketing leadership roles with companies such as Unilever and Darden. Caron was already actively involved with IZEA as a member of the company's strategic advisory board since 2013, but the upgrading of his role to a member of the board of directors should see in focus more time and energy into IZEA's development going forward.Also worth mentioning are the company's three major shareholders. First up, is Perry Sook - founder of Nexstar Broadcasting Group, Inc and executive chairman, chief executive officer and president of the company since 1996. Next, is Brian Brady. Brian Brady is the founder and CEO of Northwest Broadcasting Inc, and also associated with a number of other successful broadcasting and media ventures over the past 25 years. Finally, John Pappajohn. Renowned venture capitalist in the pharmaceutical space, and famed networker, Pappajohn is known for his ability to grow company to exit.While IZEA looks well-positioned to benefit from the nascent but rapidly expanding native advertising space, there are a number of risks associated with investment in the company. Before addressing the risks, however, it is worth mentioning that this article is not intended to frame as IZEA as an alternative to the more established social media stocks. Instead, it is intended to suggest that an allocation towards IZEA could serve as a complementary exposure and a speculative play in an industry that looks set to boom over the coming five years. With this said, and as mentioned earlier, there are - of course - many risks involved in a speculative, microcap investment allocation such as this.Some of these risks are based around the industry as a whole, and some are company specific. One of the primary risks related to the industry is IZEA's reliance on the continued popularity of mobile devices as far as accessing social media is concerned. A large portion of IZEA's revenue comes from serving small screen, mobile native advertising through Twitter, Pinterest and others, and if users migrate towards larger screen devices (as we are starting to see with the introduction of plus sized iPhones and other tablets), the necessity to rely on native advertising as induced by the lack of space on mobile screens may diminish. If this happens, we could see a return to the more traditional display advertising, since there will no longer be the necessity to use in-feed promotion as screen space will become more readily available. While a return to the dominance of the desktop is unlikely tablets such as the iPad can accommodate display media (banners, etc.) comfortably, and (especially) the more traditional advertisers may refute the necessity of native advertising and maintain their current, display-driven approach.Further to this point, IZEA is heavily reliant on the continued effectiveness of native advertising and social sponsorship. As happened with banner advertisements over the past decade, consumers became effectively blind to their display, and if the social sponsorship market reaches a saturation point, we could see users effectively ""turning off"" to recommendations through their social connections. A risk that is perhaps more company specific lies in IZEA's reliance on larger social media platforms to serve its social sponsorship advertisements. It would not be that difficult for Facebook or Twitter to implement policy that prohibits its users from displaying advertisements facilitated through the IZEA platform , and - especially if IZEA starts to encroach on revenues that could potentially be earned by the aforementioned networks - implementation such policy would be a real setback for IZEA.At time of writing, the company's market capitalization was just $21.35 million, and its stock is currently traded over-the-counter. Another risk lies in the speed with which the social media space moves, as mentioned in the introduction to this article. Yes, IZEA's ability to provide sponsorship opportunity across a range of platforms and publishing sources reduces the risk that a company like Facebook faces in the event of a social shift in the sector. However, the company's ability to generate revenue relies on it being able to successfully incorporate its business model into whichever platform emerges as a leader in the space going forward. Without this successful integration, IZEA may suffer. Regarding financials, independent analysts expect IZEA's current $5 million cash on its balance sheet, combined with zero debt, to fund its operations through FY 16. However, if demand for the company's platform increases rapidly and IZEA has to invest in an expansion of its personnel, the company's current burn rate would increase and its cash on hand could quickly deplete. In addition, there are also a number of other companies in the space vying for market share. Adly, SheKnows, Speakr, Collective Bias and Ready Pulse each have their own proprietary platform and publisher network, and - in order for IZEA to maintain its current growth levels - the company must outpace each of those mentioned.All said, IZEA has been an under the radar speculative quasi-social media play for the past few years, but with the announcing of its recent financials (Q4 2014 and full year 2014) it has shown that it could be company with real promise. The company is a micro-cap, and investors should be aware of the risks associated with such before committing capital, but as a speculative play in a space that is expanding rapidly, the reward may outweigh the risk at present. As the native advertising industry expands, IZEA is well-placed to take advantage of this expansion and could present early-stage investors with an opportunity to enter before an upside revaluation takes place.Editor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks.

(Nasdaq: JCDA), a leading provider of unified desktop and process optimization solutions for customer service operations, announced that the company sold its Application Modernization Business to Software AG for $26 million. The effective date of the transaction is January 1, 2008. This deal seems to be about focus — about positioning Jacada as a pureplay in the call center solutions business. The firm provides a single, unified workspace for customer service organizations managing lots of legacy and disparate software systems. Jacada President (and actually, the new CEO), Paul O’Callaghan, said the following about the deal: This sounds pretty good. We’ve written positively about Jacada before, and like the direction that the company is taking. Along with the deal, we’ve seen Paul emerge as the new CEO with the founder and former CEO, Gideon Hollander, sliding into the Chairman seat. This is a company maturing and taking the right, and albeit tough, steps of the founder stepping aside. O’Callaghan joined Jacada as President in May 2006, after successfully holding senior management roles in companies including Optio Software (OTC:OPTO), Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO), IMNET Systems, XACCT Technologies, Idapta and Network Systems Corporation. His experience in sale-oriented tech firms has allowed the company to grow its pipeline of new deals and land material type deals like recently announced deals with Central Hudson Gas & Electric, a regulated gas and electricity provider serving approximately 367,000 customers in eight counties of New York State’s Mid-Hudson River Valley. Keep in mind that the company has a market cap under $80 million, and a cash position of $35 million. If you another infusion of cash to a company that had guided for 2007 revenue growth of 23 - 27%, and get the firm completely focused on the call center business growing at a CAGR of 60% plus, then you would have a nice little Israeli microcap."
35606,20283,2007-05-15T08:58:15-04:00,,"Jacada (JCDA), a global provider of unified service desktop and process optimization solutions that simplify and automate customer service processes by bridging disconnected systems into a single, ""intelligent"" WorkSpace, has announced the completion of the most profitable quarter in company history. Total revenues increased 23.6% to $6.4 million from 2006 and Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2007 was $752,000, or $0.04 per diluted share.While revenue was helped by legacy products, Gideon Hollander, CEO, commented:As opposed to the legacy products, the new products generate much more recurring revenue, thus allowing for continued and sustained growth. Most importantly, the company raised its revenue guidance for the rest of 2007, pointing to a growing backlog, and clearer visibility in the sales pipeline.With a market cap under $75 million, and almost $36 million in cash, Jacada is still flying under Wall Street’s radar, but with a succession of newly signed contracts with the likes of Avaya, ING Canada, the stock seems well positioned to move. We have seen this scenario play out with numerous other small Israeli companies that keep quietly growing their business, turning profitable, gaining some PR traction and then flying. Just look at Silicom (NASDAQ:SILC), Pointer Telocation (NASDAQ:PNTR) to name a few. With a small float to boot, keep an eye on JCDA.JCDA 1-yr chartDisclaimer: In the normal course of doing business, we may buy or sell shares of the securities discussed herein for our personal accounts, our corporate accounts, or our clients’ accounts."

4365784,24361,2020-08-07T11:39:00-04:00,"Johnson Controls kept pace with its HVAC/building control peers on the revenue line, beating Street expectations, and did an excellent, better-than-expected job on costs.Open Blue furthers Johnson Controls' move into building controls and automation and should be an appealing option for building managers/owners.Tenants have forced building owners to be more aware of environmental footprints, and automation can drive significant operating cost savings, all of which can drive revenue growth for JCI.Weaker non-residential investment spending is a threat in 2021/2022, but JCI still offers an attractive long-term return on top of room to beat revenue and margin expectations.","Even with my concerns about weaker non-residential spending in 2021 and 2022, I thought Johnson Controls (JCI) was too cheap after fiscal second quarter results, as the company had some solid cost-cutting opportunities, as well as longer-term leverage to attractive trends in building automation and efficiency. Since then, the shares have risen about 35% - doing quite a bit better than the average industrial, but still lagging HVAC peers like Carrier (CARR), Lennox (LII), and Trane (TT).A higher valuation does skew the risk-reward argument some, and I do still have concerns about the likelihood of weaker non-resi spending in 2021-2022, as well as whether companies that have had good success in cutting costs (like Johnson Controls) will face greater cost headwinds as demand recovers. I still think Johnson Controls has good prospects from here, but I wouldn’t be in quite as much of a rush to buy in as before.Johnson Controls reported a 4% revenue beat in the fiscal third quarter (calendar second quarter), with beats in all but the Building Solutions Asia segment. Decremental margin was even better than expected, around 13% at a time when many companies are reporting low 30%’s decrementals, driving a 20% segment EBITA beat (worth about $0.17/share).Revenue declined 16% in organic terms, with Global Products down 20%, Building Solutions North America down 13%, Building Solutions EMEA/Lat Am down 15%, and Building Solutions Asia down 12%. That performance was broadly in line with peers, with Carrier reporting 19% organic contraction, Honeywell (HON) reporting a 17% decline in its Building Tech segment, and Trane reporting a 13% decline.Mid-teens installation declines in North America and Asia weren’t surprising, but I am surprised that Europe held up better (down 6%), while service held up well in North America (down 7%) and weakened considerably more in Europe (down 24%). Commercial HVAC declines in the 20%’s looked pretty typical, while refrigeration did a little better than at least some rivals.Gross margin improved by a point, and operating income rose 13%, while EBITA declined 14% (margin up 50bp). As I said before, decremental margin was only 13%, an impressive result by any measure.Non-residential investment spending has held up better than I expected in 2020, but the new projects aren’t entering the funnel and that’s supporting my view that 2021 and 2022 will be more challenging years.The impact on Johnson Controls isn’t so cut-and-dried, though. First, a significant portion of the business is institutional (around a quarter), and although state and municipal budgets are likely to be under much greater strain, those investment decisions aren’t as economically-driven. Likewise, contracted service agreements contribute a significant part of Johnson Controls’ revenue (around $6 billion, or a quarter of FY’19 revenue); those agreements don’t mean that service revenue will always grow (as seen this quarter), but it is less sensitive to new investment decisions.Beyond that, there are other factors playing into the story. I’ll talk about Open Blue in a moment, but there are some meaningful retrofit opportunities. In the near term, I expect Johnson Controls and its peers to be fielding a lot more inquiries and orders for indoor air quality systems, including UV and biopolar ionization systems – these systems have been used in healthcare facilities for years, and while their impact on reducing COVID-19 transmission is largely unproven, tenants are going to demand them and building owners will either have to spend the capex or accept lower rents.Johnson Controls also recently announced the launch of Open Blue – the company’s entry into the connected solutions and service platform. Open Blue will compete with Honeywell’s Forge and Schneider’s (OTCPK:SBGSY) Ecostruxure digital/connected building offerings.The company has been working on this for about four years, ever since the Tyco deal, and it will allow building operators to automate and integrate functions like building access, air flow, elevators, door control, lighting, occupant tracking, not to mention incorporate services like remote diagnostics, predictive maintenance, and compliance monitoring/reporting.There are a lot of advantages to a system like this. Data-driven control of HVAC, lighting, elevators, and other systems can lead to significant power savings (as much as 60% in some cases), and the COVID-19 pandemic has shown some of the advantages to remote maintenance and control. Given how much of a building’s costs are made up of these functions, this is not trivial, and it’s also important for building operators looking to comply with more rigorous green certifications.Reviewing my model, my old longer-term revenue assumptions for Johnson Controls were just too low considering future new-builds, service growth (including Open Blue), and system retrofits. Between ongoing urbanization and the push towards greener buildings, growth more in the 3%-4% range seems reasonable, and even that may be low.How well Johnson Controls management can leverage that into better margins and FCF is harder to say. This isn’t a particularly high-margin sector and there’s enough competition to keep it that way if one or more players decides it’s willing to trade margin for growth. I do still expect some improvement, though, with FCF margins moving toward 10% over time, driving mid-to-high single-digit FCF growth.Johnson Control’s sector-beating performance has taken away some of the low-hanging fruit I saw before, but I still think this is a stock with a good long-term outlook and solid return potential. A weaker non-residential spending environment is a real threat, though, and I’m not sure that the energy efficiency/environment angle can offset that indefinitely in investors’ minds, particularly when those weaker non-resi numbers really start coming through. For investors with a longer-term horizon, that’s likely just noise, but it could also create some opportunities to buy in at even better prices."
4343703,24361,2020-05-06T14:43:18-04:00,"Johnson Controls has been a long-time laggard in the industrials group, but the share price seems to more than adequately reflect the challenges in margins and business mix.
        The underlying non-residential construction market is likely to see a more extended downturn/recovery cycle, but drivers like building automation and efficiency retrofits can offset that.
        At current prices, it seems like the problems and challenges JCI faces are more than adequately discounted, and this is a name worth a closer look.","There’s a big difference between investing in a “cheap stock” and “cheap for a reason” stock, and the latter is a sure ticket to years of frustration. In the case of Johnson Controls (JCI), there are certainly legitimate criticisms of the business – the margins are really not that good, the scope of future margin improvement is uncertain, and the business has some definite gaps (particularly in more value-added areas). Even so, factoring in discounts and haircuts for those flaws still leaves me with a valuation comfortably above today’s share price. There is a new risk on the table now with Covid-19 and whether the non-residential market will see a V-shaped, U-shaped, L-shaped, extended L-shaped, or some sort of “jacked up W-shaped” recovery, but long-term trends like building automation and energy efficiency remain as strong as ever. With that, this is a name worth a closer look.Johnson Controls didn’t have a bad quarter; while revenue was a slight miss relative to sell-side expectations, the 5% organic contraction was about on par for the wider group so far, and the company saw a modest segment-level beat and a $0.03 operating line beat. On the other hand, Johnson Controls seemed to find more trouble (weaker performance) in HVAC than peers like Trane (TT) and Lennox (LII).Revenue declined about 6% as reported and 5% in organic terms. Global Products declined more than 8%, with double-digit declines in HVAC equipment and stable building management revenues. Service, underpinned by the Fire and Security operations, held up substantially better, with modest (2%) growth in both North America and Europe, while installation was modestly weaker. As I said, relative to Trane and Lennox, Johnson Controls had a weaker performance in commercial and residential HVAC, but I believe the company’s geographic mix can explain that at least partially.Gross margin improved about 120bp, helped by mix, and operating margin was steady (operating income down 6%). Segment-level profit declined 8% (margin down 20bp), with a 15% drop in Global Products (margin down 80bp) driving the weakness.Field orders were healthy (up 7%) and backlog improved 4%, but management did note a sharp downturn in April, with orders declining at a high teens to 20% rate.There’s no question at this point that the next quarter is going to bad, and quite likely the next one after that too. The bigger question is what the recoveries in Johnson’s core markets will look like, and there’s ample uncertainty there.I believe new-build non-residential construction is going to see a double-digit multiyear downturn. Some of that is “digestion” from the above-average run we’ve seen in recent years, and I don’t think the long-term growth opportunity has changed all that much. I just think that between economic uncertainty, liquidity concerns, and so on, the funnel will dry up over the next 12-18 months, leading to a two or three-year downturn.It’s not quite that simple, though, when it comes to the impacts on Johnson Controls. For starters, about a quarter of the company’s revenue comes from long-term contracted service agreements in fire and security, and those tend to be durable (particularly fire). For as much as investors prize the recurring revenue at Roper (ROP) and the growing recurring revenue mix at Fortive (FTV), that may be an underappreciated positive with Johnson Controls.I also see positive counter-trends benefiting Johnson Controls. Building automation was already a positive driver for companies like JCI, Honeywell (HON), Schneider (OTCPK:SBGSY), and Siemens (OTCPK:SIEGY), and I think Covid-19 could be a catalyst for accelerated adoption of remote monitoring/control, touchless services (doors, etc.), and so on.Likewise, as I’ve mentioned in reference to Trane and Lennox, I see energy efficiency as a major positive driver for new HVAC, controls, and automation. HVAC and refrigeration systems typically account for more than half of a commercial building’s energy consumption, and I believe there will be a concerted drive to reduce this footprint over time.Turning back to what this all means for Johnson Controls, I think the underlying non-residential new-build market is in for an “extended L” recovery, but I think Johnson Controls may well see more of that “jacked up W” path; better than the underlying market and with growth, but with choppy results and no steady trend. I also see M&A opportunities, but that is a discussion for another day.Management is targeting decremental margins in the low 20%’s for the second half of this fiscal year (the June and September quarters), and that would be a pretty respectable result; other industrials are likely to see decrementals in the 20%’s to 30%’s, but then they don’t have the boost from service contracts. Management is also launching a $400M-$450M cost reduction program, with about 20% of the cuts likely to be structural and longer-lasting.Driving better long-term margins really remains high on the “must do” list for Johnson Controls. I believe at least some of the stock’s longer-term underperformance can be explained by its weaker margins, even though management did a decent job of driving synergies from the Tyco deal. Product mix is part of the problem, as JCI isn’t as strong in areas like controls and software as some of its peers (like Honeywell and Schneider), but that will take longer to fix.I am valuing Johnson Controls with the assumption of 2% long-term annualized revenue growth, and if anything, that may well prove low – as one of the leaders in HVAC, building controls, and fire/security, and with a solid ex-US business, they should be able to do better than that. I’m also not using particularly heroic margin/FCF margin assumptions. I see room for improvement in operating margins, working capital management, and asset efficiency, but I want to see JCI track above my expectations before assuming more. As is, I expect JCI to stay below double-digit FCF margins through 2029, though with enough improvement to drive mid-single-digit FCF growth.I use a lower EV/EBITDA multiple here than for many industrials to account for the lower margins and returns, but even in so doing, I believe Johnson Controls is undervalued. Likewise with my cash flow model; on balance, I think JCI shares are priced for a high single-digit to low double-digit annualized return. JCI’s relatively lower quality does argue for some discount to names like Honeywell and Trane, but I think today’s discount may be too wide. I don’t like buying “it’ll get better” stories without a strong plan in place, but I like the markets this company serves and I think a lot of the risks are already in the price.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

4317963,67113,2020-01-20T20:52:59-05:00,Stock has a very low reported book multiple of 1.6.Q1 earnings are expected to be announced later this month.We look at how the firm's main balance sheet line items have been trending.,"Johnson Controls (JCI) announces its first-quarter earnings numbers on the 30th of this month. Consensus comes in at $0.38 per share which is well ahead of the $0.26 number reported for the same quarter of 12 months prior. At present, JCI shares are trading with an implied volatility of just under 20%. This means the market believes shares of this conglomerate will have a trading range of 20% either to the upside or downside over the next 12 months. We would initially state that the move should happen to the upside given the firm's present valuation. As earnings approach, we expect the IV number to increase to the mid-twenties like it has done in previous quarters.Earnings announcements offer excellent opportunities to generate cash flow around solid underlyings due to the elevated volatility. As we can see from the technical chart below, shares look like they are undergoing a topping pattern at present. If this is correct, shares should retrace right back down to around the $38 level in order to complete the pattern. Binary events such as earnings usually offer the perfect opportunity for something like an ongoing technical pattern to play itself out.Therefore, if shares drop somewhat, the real question is whether Johnson Controls would be a strong long-term buy at those levels. To help us in answering this question, we turn to the balance sheet to see how the firm's key financial metrics have been trending. When this financial statement is researched carefully, it can give us a strong insight into whether the company in question turns out to be a good investment or not. Therefore, let's go to the recently reported annual numbers to see how they line up with past years.Firstly, we see that “Cash & ST Investments” has risen to $2.8 billion which is encouraging. Obviously, the more cash on the balance sheet, the better as long as debt or share dilution is the reason for more cash.Receivables came in at $5.821 billion at the end of last year. Although this key line item rose by a mere $160 million last year, the trend over the long term is definitely down. However, when we divide receivables at present into net sales, we get 24% which means receivables as a percentage of company sales is actually rising. This is the first adverse trend we see on the balance sheet.We see a more favourable trend with respect to the company's inventory. Inventory is down 43% since September 2017 and currently represents 7.5% of the firm’s total sales.Current assets amount to $12.393 billion at present and current liabilities come in at $9.07 billion. This gives us a current ratio of 1.37, which is the highest current ratio we have seen in Johnson Controls for quite some time.We then go to the non-current assets which essentially are assets which are more “fixed” in nature. Johnson's “Net Property, Plant & Equipment” comes in at $3.34 billion. Again, similar to inventory, this line item has been literally cut in half since 2017.What really sticks out in the non-current asset section of the balance sheet is the amount of goodwill. Goodwill is basically the “extra fat” paid on top of respective book values when the company makes acquisitions. Here is where the whole area of risk/reward on any potential investment enters the equation. For example, if any particular acquisition were to come good, then the original goodwill dollar amount may end up being a steal. Alternatively, if an acquisition does not do what was originally envisaged, then Johnson would have to lower the amount of goodwill for that particular deal. This is what is known as a write-down and is very common in companies that do not acquire well.We write a lot about stacking the odds in our favour as much as possible. Goodwill ($18.17 billion) in Johnson Controls at present accounts for 43% of the firm's total assets of $42.87 billion. We are not stating that this is essentially negative. It just increases or consequently the reward from how these acquisitions play out going forward.Other intangible assets come in at $5.6 billion. When we basically add property, plant & equipment to goodwill and current assets, we get total assets of $42.28 billion.The long-term liabilities of long-term debt, pension benefits and other non-current liabilities come to $12.38 billion. Total liabilities come to $21.48 billion when we add in current liabilities. This means the reported debt-to-equity ratio is only a mere 0.34, which on paper means the firm is in a much stronger financial position at present. But is there more than meets the eye here?Where total equity of $20.8 billion may be easily covering long-term debt, it is not covering the firm's total liabilities of $21.45 billion. Furthermore, investors must take into account the number of intangibles which make up shareholder equity. With a market cap of $31.6 billion, the stated book multiple of the firm comes in at 1.63 which looks very attractive on the surface. However, to get some validity on Johnson's price-to-book ratio, we turn to the price-to-sales ratio which currently comes in at 1.5, which incidentally is well ahead of its 5-year average of 0.9.Therefore, to sum up, the stock does not look as cheap as we originally envisioned. Strong points on the balance sheet are improving liquidity and growing cash. We would have reservations, however, how stubbornly high receivables remain as well as the large amount of goodwill. Let's see what Q1 numbers bring later this month."
4319516,20599,2020-01-28T12:50:10-05:00,"Johnson Controls is no longer an automotive-parts supplier.There is urbanization happening throughout the world that requires HVAC services.With positive free cash flow and a solid balance sheet, Johnson Controls is well positioned for growth.","Given the market pullback that is starting to happen this week and the upcoming earnings report this Friday from Johnson Controls (JCI), it looks like the perfect time to start a position in this steady earning, dividend paying company. Since JCI merged with Tyco in 2016 it has become a leader in the building technologies and solutions industry.Johnson Controls is in the industry of designing, installing, and maintaining HVAC systems and fire and security systems in buildings. These systems are full of technological enhancements that require regular maintenance and software updates. This is the recurring revenue stream JCI needs to maintain its growth. In its upcoming earnings report, I would expect JCI to have at least 25% of revenue coming from recurring service agreements. With the merger in 2016, JCI targeted over $1 billion in synergies and cost savings. With the proceeds from their battery business sale, Johnson was able to pay down $4 billion in debt and repurchase $6 billion of shares. This greatly improves Johnson's balance sheet. Their debt to equity ratio is down to 0.37 from 0.52 a year ago. Free cash flow is stabilizing and should continue to grow as they develop a less cyclical business model and have more of a recurring cash flow stream. They have had three quarters in a row of positive free cash flow (-$232M in Dec 2018 to +$189M in Sept 2019) and I would expect this trend to continue. Overall, the sale of the business unit has allowed JCI to improve its financial health and set the stage for a better business model with a smoother ride into the future.The global environment has been moving towards urbanization. According to the United Nations, ""The urban population of the world has grown rapidly from 751 million in 1950 to 4.2 billion in 2018. Asia, despite its relatively lower level of urbanization, is home to 54% of the world's urban population, followed by Europe and Africa with 13% each."" This trend shows up in Johnson's number. They had 7% organic sales growth in the Asia Pacific region compared to 3% in North America. Sales in China were up over 10% for fiscal 2019. Johnson is well positioned to take advantage of the energy-efficiency needed to cool, heat, and safely maintain the added urban development and I expect Asia to be a large source of growth for JCI.Going into fiscal 2020, JCI started with an $8.9 billion backlog of contracts. This allows Johnson to have better guidance as to their profitability for the upcoming year. They expect to continue to have organic field order growth, similar to 2019, of 5%. Between the reduced share count and increased earnings, expectations are for 45% year-over-year earnings per share growth for the first quarter. The largest drivers of future earnings are the recurring service contracts on existing units and JCI's ability to retrofit and reconfigure a building's existing HVAC system.With the 10-year Treasury bond yield falling to 1.6%, JCI's yield of 2.5% looks even more appealing to investors. Johnson Controls has maintained its dividend steadily for 13 quarters. Even though their yield is greater than their competitors, JCI only pays out 16% of earnings so they have a lot of room to comfortably increase it. With the new business model and added free cash flow, I'd expect to see a dividend increase in 2020, which lends support to the stock price in addition to the growing business and increased earnings.Even though JCI stock was up over 37% and bested the overall market in 2019, since JCI started its transformation in 2016, the stock has underperformed the S&P 500 Index by 23%. Given the current coronavirus scare, businesses around the world need to take seriously the idea of clean air, air flow and security systems. With the steadier business model and backlog of work, the stock has room to keep growing.*Like this article? Don't forget to hit the follow button above!"
4287204,67113,2019-08-21T16:56:26-04:00,Share price has been on a tear since last December.Has the rally run its course?We look at the technicals to find out.,"A mistake we made in yesteryear with respect to our short-term trading strategies was going far too quickly to the implied volatility chart of the respective underlying. In the past, the implied volatility chart would have been far higher up our priority list, whereas now, we use this metric simply to decide on whether we buy option premium or sell it. Let me explain.For example, we have a possible buying signal in Johnson Controls International plc (JCI) (The Diversified Technology Company) at the moment as its 4-day moving average has now crossed over both its 9-day and 18-day moving averages. The triple crossover method is used extensively among short-term traders, especially in the futures market.The crossover is a signal to us to investigate how the stock has been trading and to see if we should contemplate putting long deltas to work. Before we look at the volatility numbers of Johnson, we need to go through a range of steps to see if this particular stock would be suitable as a short-term play in our portfolio at this present moment in time.Remember when dealing with trades that may last up to two months at most, the long-term fundamentals of the stock or indeed the sector come in a distant second to how we believe shares will trade over the short term. Being chartists, we believe that all fundamentals have already been baked into the price action. Therefore, let's get to those steps before finally we see how the volatility numbers look like (which essentially would decide if we were to buy or sell option premium).As the chart shows above, the 200-day moving average has been steadily increasing since February as a result of the blistering rally the stock has enjoyed since December last year. Many short-term traders only trade stocks trading above their respective 200-day moving averages. We can see this momentum on the earnings side with $2.53 in earnings per share on top of $25+ billion in sales expected next year. So far, so good here.If we go to the 3-month chart, we can see that, as mentioned, we have our moving averages cross over. In fact, the share price printed a higher intra-day high on the 20th when it rose above $43 a share. Traders here may be conscious of how far we are trading above the 200 DMA. Furthermore (even though we have a moving average buy signal which is being confirmed by the MACD indicator), the stock is nowhere near being oversold, which may present a slight concern. Why? Because the potential upmove may be less due to how stocks oscillate between oversold and overbought conditions. In fact, if we look at the RSI and MACD indicators, we can see that there seem to be divergences in play. These divergences could be stating that the recent rally is about to end. Therefore, irrespective of the crossover, we need to remain cautious about getting long up here.If we look at the implied volatility chart over the past year, we can see that JCI's present implied volatility seems to be near the lows of its 12-month range at just above 20%. The company's most recent earnings numbers resulted in an earnings beat which fueled recent share price momentum. Suffice it to say, if we were to introduce some long deltas into our portfolio for JCI, we would most likely be looking at a debit spread instead of a credit spread. There just doesn't seem to be enough premium in those call options to consider selling them at this moment in time. We would be looking for a gradual increase of implied volatility over the next month or so, which would increase the price of the options.Source: ivolatility.comTo sum up, we will be watching volume trends closely over the next few days to see if shares can keep on making higher highs. Buying volume has remained strong. Let's see if this stays that way."
4275701,104618,2019-07-18T10:40:13-04:00,"JCI has transformed its portfolio over the last few years through merging with Tyco, spinning off the auto business, and divesting the car battery segment.The 'new' JCI is a pure-play building technologies business (fire, security, control systems, HVAC equipment, etc.).While results have not been smooth over the last couple of years, they have the opportunity to improve margins and free cash flow conversion.","Since 2014, Johnson Controls (NYSE:JCI) has gone through a massive portfolio transformation. They spun-off the automotive business (click here to find the list of recent spin-offs), merged with Tyco, and divested the lead-acid battery business. These moves reduced revenue by over 40% but also decreased the company's cyclicality and capital intensity.Johnson Controls' roots are as an industrial conglomerate supplying diverse markets across automotive, plastics, building controls, and HVAC. Portfolio moves over the last few years moved the company out of markets, such as automotive, where JCI had been a major player for decades. Today, they are singularly focused on the commercial and residential buildings end market.The major portfolio moves included:You can see in the table below that these portfolio moves shifted the company's overall revenue mix towards the Building Technologies & Solutions business.Another important company milestone to discuss is George Oliver taking over as Chairman and CEO from Alex Molinaroli. George Oliver was the CEO of Tyco prior to merging with JCI and was set to take over in January 2018. In August 2017, the board accelerated the leadership transition plan and announced that Oliver would take over as Chairman and CEO in September 2017, fast-tracking the appointment by 6 months. Oliver was with Tyco since 2006 and served as an executive under Ed Breen. Prior to Tyco, he spent more than 20 years at General Electric (GE).Johnson Controls is now solely comprised of the Building Technologies & Solutions business. They sell integrated control systems, security systems, fire detection systems, equipment, and services. Over the years, JCI has acquired companies to build up this business. Two of the larger, more impactful acquisitions were of York International and Air Distribution Technologies. York is a global supplier of heating, ventilation, air-conditioning (""HVAC""), and refrigeration equipment and services that was acquired in 2005 for $3.2 billion. Air Distribution Technologies is one of the largest providers of air distribution and ventilation products which was acquired in 2014 for $1.6 billion.Importantly, Johnson Controls has an enormous installed base of products which generates attractive service revenue.Source: Management PresentationThe merger between JCI and Tyco combined the #1 player in fire and security, the #1 player in building controls, and the #1 player in commercial HVAC. It gave them the scale to build out a more robust direct customer channel as well as a $500 million cost synergy opportunity (SG&A, procurement, corporate, branch optimization, etc.).Since Johnson Control's business is completely different today than it was in the past, the historical financials do not accurately reflect the current underlying business. As a result, investors cannot rely on historical consolidated financials to inform the business' future economics.Since the Tyco merger closed in 2016 and George Oliver took over as CEO in the fall of 2017, JCI has reinvested significant capital back into the company. Johnson Controls had underinvested in the business and they needed to hire more sales professionals as well as invest in research & development and technology. In 2018, they hired almost 500 sales professionals to broaden their footprint and increased spending on new product development and technology. These investments have been a headwind to margins and eaten away at some of the cost synergies of putting JCI and Tyco together.Recent management commentary suggests that they will begin to leverage these costs, meaning that cost of goods sold, SG&A, and R&D will begin to decrease as a percent of revenue. As a result, margins should improve from the current year levels (incremental margins are in the mid-to-upper 20s).Another area for improvement is free cash flow conversion or the percentage of net income that converts into actual free cash flow. Over the last few years, JCI's free cash flow has been relatively weak due to restructuring costs, integration costs, working capital build (inventory, accounts receivable, etc.), and reinvesting rather than receiving dividends from the Hitachi (OTCPK:HTHIY) joint venture.Management is very focused on improving cash flow. They are targeting 95% conversion for fiscal 2019 and 100%+ for 2020 and beyond. In order to get there, they are improving working capital (harmonizing vendor payment terms, becoming more efficient with inventory, etc.). Furthermore, the rolling off of restructuring and integration costs as the integration work comes to an end should help. Lastly, the sale of the Power Solution segment will reduce the company's capital intensity as capital expenditures were consistently greater than depreciation and amortization for that segment.Organic revenue growth along with margin improvements should drive earnings higher, which when combined with better free cash flow conversion (higher earnings quality) should result in a higher valuation.With all the portfolio moves over the last three years, Johnson Controls has many of the characteristics seen in special situation investment opportunities. They spun-off the automotive business, merged with Tyco, appointed a new CEO, and divested the car battery business (used the proceeds to deleverage and buyback shares). Overall, the 'new' JCI is a much more focused business and has the opportunity to improve margins and free cash flow conversion which should result in a more attractive valuation over time."

JCI used $5 billion of the proceeds to reduce its gross debt from $12.4 billion to $7.3 billion during the June quarter (fiscal Q3):Source: FY 2019 Q3 PresentationJCI also bought back shares for a combined total of $4.2 billion. Over the next year and a quarter to Sept. 2020 (its fiscal year-end 2020), Johnson Controls has also committed to repurchase another $3.1 billion worth of shares:Source: Same as aboveThe CEO also indicated in the conference call that JCI might purchase an additional $1.0 billion of shares on top of the $3.1 billion:Source: Q3 Conference Call TranscriptSince JCI has a market cap of $34.78 billion, this $3.1-4.1 billion repurchase activity gives it a buyback yield of 8.9% to 11.8%. Combined with its 2.38% dividend yield, the total yield to shareholders is as high as 14.17% over the next year.Assuming the stock rises 10% over the next year or so, the average buyback price would be $48.25. So, $3.1 billion in buybacks would reduce the share count by another 64.25 million shares. This works out to 8.1% of the 795.7065 million shares outstanding as of June 30. If $4.1 billion worth of shares are bought back, the share count will fall by 10.7% to 710.732 million. With a 15% higher average price over the next year, the share count would fall by as much as 10.2%, assuming $4.1 billion in share repurchases.So, a potential 8.1% to 10.7% reduction in the share count would have a directly equal impact on the growth in EPS. It would also allow JCI to raise the dividend per share much higher. For example, the dividend cost was $233 million during Q3 at $0.26 per share. With just 710.7 million shares outstanding by the end of FY Q4 2020, using the assumptions above, the dividend could be set at $0.325 per share or 25% higher. This means for the same $233 million expense, depending on the number of shares outstanding after repurchases, the dividend per share rises even without a higher payout ratio.Management indicated that the interest expense over the next year will be higher by $100 million as a result of the debt paydown. In Q3, JCI produced adjusted free cash flow (""FCF"") of $600 million. That figure includes $100 million in one-time integration benefits, but the $100 million in interest savings will replace it.Source: FY 2019 Q3 PresentationSo, going forward, the estimated FCF yield is 6.9% ($2.4 billion/$34.78 billion). This is probably the main reason why management plans on potentially spending another $1 billion in share repurchases on top of the planned $3.1 billion.For example, the cash and securities balance now is $3.685 billion. Adding in $2-2.4 billion in FCF gives a future balance by Q4 2020 of $5.1-5.5 billion. So, spending $4.1 billion in share repurchases would still leave a remaining balance of $1.4 billion by the end of next year.That would leave plenty of room for the dividend cost of $777.4 million. (The dividend cost of $0.26 per quarter at an average number of shares between 785 and 710 million (747.5 million) is $777 million.) It might also leave room for some smaller acquisitions. And as I pointed out above, the dividend per share could actually increase by the end of next year.There are several ways to value JCI based on its huge buyback program and its high FCF yield. One way is to assume the company will increase its dividend per share to say $0.31 per share. If there is an average of 747.5 million shares outstanding during FY 2020, the cost would only be $232 million, about the same as the $233 spent in Q3. Keeping the same 2.38% dividend yield, the stock would be worth $52.10 (i.e., ($0.31/.0238) x 4 = $52.10. This is 18.8% higher than today.Another way to value the company is to compare its FCF yield with other companies of similar size. The table below shows the median FCF yield of 5.56%.Source: Hake compilation from Yahoo! Finance figuresAssuming JCI produces $2.4 billion in FCF next year and assuming it could result in somewhere between 710 million and 747 million shares outstanding next year, the same value would be $59.30 or 35% higher than today:Source: Hake estimateSo, averaging the results from these two methods produces an estimate of $55.70.Source: Hake estimateJohnson Controls is on a major buyback program. This will allow the company to raise its dividend per share for the same amount of expense over the next year. My estimate is that the dividend per share will rise to a quarterly rate of $0.31 per share. At the same yield as today, the stock is worth $59.30. Using an FCF comparison, JCI is worth $55.70. On average, JCI is worth $55.70 on average or 27% higher.The huge $3.1-4.1 billion buyback program over the next year will act as an effective catalyst to push the stock to that target price. The buyback yield ranges from 8.9% to 11.8% depending on how much share repurchase activity it engages in over the next year. Combined with the 2.38% dividend yield, the stock's total yield is as high as 14.2%. This total yield combined with the buyback catalysts and the possibility of a dividend hike makes JCI an attractive value opportunity."

JCI’s share price has continued to decline slightly since the beginning of the year, and although investors are awaiting positive news on the power solutions spin-off, it is unlikely to present major upside for the share price. Current valuations are mainly down to JCI’s underperformance, which should continue in the short-term.JCI’s total revenues were ahead of consensus by 5.4%, reaching $8.69bn for the quarter and $32.5bn for the year, which translates into a yoy organic top line growth of 6% and 8%, respectively. This was primarily driven by the strong performance of buildings, especially in the fire & security and HVAC & controls segments in North America, driving 8% organic growth yoy. On the other hand, revenues from power solutions grew only 2.3%, around 1.7% below expectations.JCI posted solid growth in its total adjusted EBIT, reaching $1.17bn for the quarter (2.1% above consensus) and EBIT margin expansion of 40bps as a result of the implemented structural improvements.EPS for 4Q18 came in line with consensus at $0.93, a 7.4% increase yoy. At the same time, the company reduced its debt by $2.6bn, continued its buyback program by buying $300mn worth of its shares, and paid $1bn of dividends in FY18.Building revenues grew by 8% this quarter and contributed approximately 71% of total revenues in 4Q18, reaching $6.18bn, and $23.4bn for FY18, a 2.6% increase yoy. The acceleration of the growth in building revenue was primarily fueled by the 7.3% yoy increase in 4Q18 revenues from North America, reaching $2.34bn.On the other hand, power solutions revenue growth of 2% yoy was lower than consensus, reaching $2.5bn for the quarter and $9.1bn for the year.(Source: Author)Growth in the buildings segment was not uniform over all regions as it only reached 2.9% and 1.8% yoy in EMEA/ LA and Asia Pacific, reaching $948m & $689m for the quarter respectively. Moreover, organic growth was driven by products which grew by 9% and field organic orders which were up by 9%. Although the fire & security and HVAC & controls were the main drivers in North America, service was the main driver in EMEA/ LA ((Europe, Middle East, Africa/Latin America) and Asia Pacific.Power solutions revenue growth is mainly attributed to OE battery shipments and start-stop battery shipments, which grew by 5% & 20%, respectively; while aftermarket shipments were down by 2%.(Source: Author)On the EBITDA side, building grew by 3.8% yoy in 4Q18, reaching $939m. Meanwhile, EBITDA for power solutions decreased by 1.6% yoy, reaching $424m as a result of higher transportation costs and increased investments in the business, resulting in EBITDA growth for JCI of 2.1% yoy.(Source: Author)Investors were expecting to hear news regarding the planned spin-off of the power solutions business of JCI during this quarter. However, management didn’t provide any clarifications, merely stating that the strategic review is in its final stages. This uncertainty, coupled with continued media speculation, continues to frustrate investors and analysts alike; and until a clear view about the planned spin-off is given, it will continue to cap any upside in the share price.JCI beat the street on FCF generation in 4Q18, reaching FCF conversion of 88% for the year (vs consensus of 80%). The strong cash performance highlights the positive impact structural reforms implemented by the company, especially the cash management office, are making.JCI’s management provided encouraging top-line growth guidance across all its business with total revenue growth in the mid-single digits. Building revenue is guided to grow by 4-6% and power solutions by 3-5%. These numbers are slightly above consensus which is reflected in the adjusted EBIT margin (up 50-80bps). FCF conversion guidance came at 90%. However, EPS guidance of $2.90-$3.05 came in below consensus of $3.03 due to a 12c headwind from higher tax rates and an 8c headwind from FX.Although 4Q18 showed strong fundamentals, the soft FY19 guidance and the uncertainty around power solutions remain concerns for investors. Moreover, despite its attractive current valuation compared to peers, we believe that this is well explained by JCI’s gap in performance. Thus, we maintain our hold position for the time-being while awaiting news on the power solutions spin-off."
4271241,101450,2019-06-20T10:18:50-04:00,"After completing its $11.6 billion sale of its Power Systems segment, Johnson Controls saw solid growth across regions despite macro weakness.PMI surveys and industrial production in key markets were weak in the second quarter from trade tensions and slow growth.After an unexpected $200 million tax savings, Johnson Controls looks to be in good control of its debt obligations and share purchase plans as it continues to expand.","Two months into 2019, Johnson Controls International (JCI) is currently trading around the top of its 52-week range. The stock has seen a huge rally since the beginning of the year bouncing off of $28.30 to reach its recent value near $40. This has it testing a resistance price level that was set back in September 2018 around the same price. Investors now need to consider whether the rally will find another leg up, get stuck in consolidation, or become technically weak and drop. Institutional analysts have initiated four new ratings, two neutral (Credit Suisse and Barclays) and two bullish (Wells Fargo and Citigroup). In addition to this, 3 out of 4 price targets are above $40.Source: FinvizJCI's history of earnings has been relatively solid. While its beats are often small or nonexistent, the auto parts company hasn't reported EPS below Wall Street estimates in the last 5 years. On the revenue side, results compared to expectations are a bit more volatile, but the past two years have seen solid beats and only minor misses over Wall Street estimates. The most recent earnings were solid enough for management to issue an increase in full-year guidance from $1.75-1.85 to $1.85-1.95 which provided a boost of optimism for investors.JCI's operations are focused on the installation and servicing of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems after its sale of the power solutions segment selling automotive batteries to Brookfield Business Partners (BBU). The reduction in diversity makes JCI sensitive to fluctuations in this respective industry which are tied heavily with industrial demand in its key markets.Despite general pessimism in global industrial production, JCI saw North American organic sales growth, as revenue increased 5 percent with the installation segment up 5 percent and the service segment up 4 percent. Europe, Middle East, and Africa results were similar though a tad slower at 4 percent organic growth. The strongest region was Asia Pacific where organic sales jumped 12 percent due to strong HVAC and Building Management Systems growth. Across all geographies, the order pipeline grew at a solid rate, up 6 percent, a return to mid-to-high single digit growth.From US PMI, China PMI, Eurozone PMIIn the context of global macroeconomic weakness, these numbers were certainly a positive surprise. Manufacturing PMIs from some of JCI's key markets look to be tracking to near-term lows. Eurozone and US manufacturing conditions deteriorated the most since US protectionism entered the picture in early 2018 and recently reached near-term lows. China's Caixin PMI was relatively flat but already tracking lower. Industrial production indexes also look to be slowing with US YoY growth dropping to 2.8 percent, eurozone YoY growth was -0.38 percent in April 2019, and China YoY growth fell to its lowest in five years at 5.0 percent.JCI's strength amidst macro weakness can be viewed in two ways. The outperformance by JCI is representative of its new strength from divesting and focusing on its building systems segment. In this scenario, the company could use its momentum to maintain a relatively strong growth rate through weakness until a US-China trade deal comes. On the pessimistic side, this last earnings bump was a result of sentiment peaking and JCI benefitting from a last run of capital expenditures before its customers tighten the purse strings.There are two reasons why the first situation is more likely. In both the North American and Asia Pacific segments, JCI saw installation growth higher than service (and even EMEA/LA was relatively flat) which could end up being an interesting indicator to watch. Since orders for new systems likely have a higher demand elasticity, they're likely to be more sensitive to demand fluctuations. The other reason is JCI's execution of maintaining solid margins as a result of the successful consolidation of operations after the completion of its deal. While Asia Pacific margins were flat, JCI managed to improve EMEA/LA margins by 100 basis points before currency effects. Profitability is key as the company has already tied itself down with financial obligations to debt and share repurchases.From FY 2019 Q2 slidesJCI currently has $11.9 billion of total debt with $2.3 billion of that debt residing in the current portion of debt. The large short-term liability accumulation has been over several deals initiated in anticipation of the Power Systems sales which has actually turned out better than expected. Management expects a $0.15 boost in full-year EPS to come from a decrease in cash taxes on the deal worth about $200 million. The now $11.6 billion deal will lead to about $3.4 billion in debt payments and $8 billion or more of share repurchases. The renegotiation of several credit facilities in early 2019 leads to a reduction of $9 million in net financing charges for the quarter, about $26 million for the first half of 2019. Going forward, the favorable result in the sale should help boost free cash flow in the second half of the year providing the company more opportunity to look for expansive plans or give it some breathing room if uncertainty suppresses demand.It's a tough spot. JCI results seem to tell a different story from the overall pessimism that is resulting from trade tensions and growth worries. The Asia Pacific segment had a spectacular Q2 and synergies in other slower growing segments improved margins significantly. An investor has to think, if his or her base case is that trade negotiations eventually result in a deal, macro weakness could clear up and JCI's demand could get more robust. However, if negative data keeps coming out, the cyclicality of JCI's industry will probably start to show, especially if installation growth starts to slow. At its top, JCI looks like a good hold and a decent buy if it sees a leg down. Investors should continue to monitor economic data though as continued weakness could alter the prognosis."
4228357,101850,2018-12-14T11:02:02-05:00,"Johnson Controls announced the sale of its Power Solutions unit for $13.2B.As expected, the transaction will be all-cash, and part of the proceeds will be used to pay down debt.Streamlining the business is a net positive.But we remain cautious pending further visibility into JCI's capital allocation plans.","Johnson Control’s (NYSE:JCI) recent Power unit sale earns at best a few extra points for the valuation of the conglomerate. That's because investors had long anticipated the deal, and there was no surprise on the price paid. But the announcement does put the focus back on JCI’s execution, which we think is positive. With the deal done and dusted, JCI may well revert to multiples more closely aligned to its peers in the building technologies business (“Buildings”).Compared to the Power Solutions business (“Power”), the Buildings unit operates at a smaller margin but is growing at a faster rate with higher Free Cash Flow (“FCF”) conversion. It is also much less capital intense which helps the investment case. In the mid to long-term, this should cushion shares since the market has been discounting lower FCF conversion rates including the Power unit.The repurchase of shares should partially offset the dilutive effect of the transaction, and the cash can also be used to explore other growth opportunities in the Buildings sector. The execution after the operation and the use of proceeds will further determine the extension of the operation’s benefits, but so far this is a step in the right direction. We think this is a net positive for JCI but remain on the sidelines pending further clarity on their capital return plans.Johnson Controls International is a multi-industrial leader serving customers in more than 150 countries under two branches of services: Power Solutions and Building Technologies and Solutions. Buildings business comprises the engineering, developing, manufacturing and installing building products and systems like heating, ventilation and air conditioning (“HVAC”) equipment and controls, energy management, security, and fire detection systems. Power business consists of supplying lead-acid automotive batteries and also battery technologies to power start-stop, hybrid and electric vehicles.Over the years, the group has acquired several businesses both in the automotive (batteries and seating) and in the HVAC industries. In 2016 Johnson Controls merged with Tyco, an Irish company providing security solutions and fire protection. This operation brought complimentary services to the Buildings business.Following the merger, Tyco’s CEO - George Oliver - was to take the lead of the new company, and in that same year, JCI completed the spin-off of its Automotive Experience business in a move that signaled a strategic shift towards a less diversified company. In March 2018, Mr. Oliver announced the company’s intentions to sell the Power business as part of its portfolio management strategy deal.The Power business makes and distributes about 154 million lead-acid batteries annually and in FY2018 contributed with $8 billion to JCI’s total revenue (about 25%), 9% above its FY2017’s contribution. The segment had been growing at a steady pace in the last couple of years although profitability had been declining. EBITA margin is currently below 18%, down from 19.4% and 19.9% in FY2017 and FY2016, respectively.In November 2018, JCI announced the sale of Power Solutions to Brookfield Business Partners and institutional partners including Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec in a cash transaction of $13.2B, or $11.4B after tax and transaction-related expenses.The company expects to deploy $3.0 to $3.5 billion of the proceeds to debt repayment, and the rest should return to shareholders. Although JCI didn’t disclose how it will return capital to shareholders, the most likely scenario is through share repurchases to partially offset the dilutive effect of the operation.Centerview Partners and Barclays served as financial advisors, and Simpson Thacher served as legal advisor. The deal should close by June 2019 subject to customary closing conditions and required regulatory approvals. Nevertheless, Power operating results will be reported in discontinued operations right from the start of FY2019.This deal reflects the final stages of a strategic review that positions JCI as a focused provider of building technologies and solutions. The diversification of business is always frowned upon as investors feel that the task is better suited to them. That’s one reason we’re positive about streamlined portfolios, and this deal is a step in the right direction. With a leaner structure, JCI can narrow the gap to peers. However, given that it’s still capital intensive and is growing at a slower rate compared to peers, we are concerned the case still isn’t quite compelling enough.Using part of the proceeds to repay debt will help the company maintain its investment-grade credit rating. The dilutive effect should be offset in the mid-term by share repurchases and higher valuation multiples resulting from higher FCF conversion rates and margin expansion of the Buildings business.Overall, the company presents a stable financial position with reasonably good solvency. Current Ratio averaged 1.1 and excluding Inventories (Quick Ratio) averaged 0.8. Debt levels are a primary concern as total debt doubled from $6.7B in FY2014 to $13.6B in FY2017. In FY2018, total debt decreased by almost 20% to $11B bringing the debt-to-equity ratio to 52%. Nevertheless, EBITA is now ten times interest expenses which signal a comfortable interest coverage ratio.Regarding FCF, improvements are evident as the company is showing good management of working capital needs and a steady CAPEX. FCF conversion rates are finally on track (69% in FY2018) but still further from the 100% goal. Compared to peers like Ingersoll-Rand (IR) which have conversion rates around 100%, JCI is at a disadvantage and it reflects in the company’s valuation. According to data from Morningstar JCI is currently trading with an EV/EBITA of 9.2 compared to 12.3 from IR.Finally, there’s been some talk about the consolidation of the HVAC industry, which represents an opportunity for JCI, especially now with all that cash to spend and the need to find more growth avenues. In its statement regarding the announcement of the deal, CEO George Oliver made clear JCI wants to take part in any consolidation of the industry.Overall, we think the transaction is a net positive but remain on the side lines pending further visibility into the company’s capital allocation plans following the sale."
4223023,25120,2018-11-17T09:28:36-05:00,"Johnson Controls is selling its Power Solutions business in a very large deal.Unfortunately, headline multiples are not that impressive as tax leakage is pretty high as well.Given these observations and reduced earnings per share power, I am not convinced about the investment case despite a very reasonable valuation.","Johnson Controls (JCI) delivered on a much anticipated huge sale as it has agreed to sell its Power Solutions business in a $13.2 billion deal. The proceeds look high at first, but given the solid earnings power of the business, good future prospects and inefficient structure of the deal, I am not inclined to buy the shares as there is still quite some dilution seen despite a multi-billion share buyback program.Given that the company has been lagging (both the shares as well as operations) for years, I am very happy to pass on the opportunity to buy the simplified core solutions business going forwards.Johnson Controls has reached a deal with Brookfield Business Partners LP and some other institutional investors to sell the Power Solutions business in a $13.2 billion cash deal. That headline number will fall to $11.4 billion after taxes and deal related costs are accounted for, but still represents a formidable amount.Investors can look forward to a great portion of this cash as the company has outlined plans to pay down $3.0-$3.5 billion in debt in order to continue to hold onto its investment grade credit rating, with the remainder of the money to be returned to investors. That implies that investors could look forward to $7.9-$8.4 billion worth of shareholder returns, all in the form of share buybacks. A little patience is required as the deal is only set to close in the summer of 2019.Following the deal, Johnson will become a pure play on building technologies and solutions in the HVAC industry. The sale of the Power Solutions business is somewhat interesting as the business could benefit from a shift towards electrification of vehicles. The unit generated $8 billion in sales this fiscal year on which it reported $1.68 billion in EBITDA, for a mere 7.9 times multiple. The bad thing is that taxes and transaction cost reduce the effective EBITDA multiple to just 6.8 times, hardly a high multiple if you are the seller of such a business.Alongside the deal announcement, it becomes clear that the company will become more focused and that corporate costs will come down by some $50 million following the deal.In the deal presentation, Johnson Controls itself already provided a ""bridge"" with regards to the earnings power of the new company. The company started with the 2019 guidance, calling for earnings between $2.90 and $3.05 per share. Dilution from the divestiture was pegged at $1.28 per share, as buybacks could limit dilution by $0.75 per share. That brings the walk down to $2.40-$2.50 per share in earnings power on a pro-forma basis.Let's check these assumptions. For 2018, the buildings business generated $23.4 billion in sales on which it reported 13.2% segment EBITA margins. Of course, the company has recently reported its results for the fiscal year of 2018. Johnson Controls reported total sales of $31.40 billion in 2018 on which it reported operating earnings of $2.38 billion and net (GAAP) earnings of $2.16 billion. This amounts to earnings of $2.32 per share, while adjusted earnings came in at $2.83 per share.With 930 million shares outstanding and working with the $1.28 per share dilution number, the sale of the Power Solutions business has a $1.19 billion impact on the bottom line, which seems correct.With share repurchases pegged at $8.15 billion, plus or minus $250 million, and shares trading at $33, the company can buy back 247 million shares at this level. With 930 million shares currently outstanding, that reduces the share count to 683 million.As the company communicated, pro-forma earnings would come in at $1.70 per share following the divestiture, that is before taking into account the impact of the buyback. Given that repurchases could reduce the share count to 683 million, earnings could jump back to $2.30 per share. That reveals that accretion amounts to just $0.60 per share and not the communicated $0.75 per share. The reason for the discrepancy results from the differences between GAAP and non-GAAP earnings.The reason for the dilution is simple. Based on the headline numbers, Johnson is receiving a mere 7.9 times EBITDA multiple for the company, and just 6.8 times after accounting for taxes and deal related costs. If the positioning of that business was really that good, one would never execute a deal this way but rather opt for a spin-off.The route of a spin-off has been challenging as well after the company spun-off Adient (ADNT) two years ago, but that has become a blood bath for investors as well. The low multiple, and lower than average multiple at which Johnson Controls trades, is the reason for the dilution in anticipated earnings in the earnings bridge.After all, ahead of the deal announcement, Johnson Controls traded at a $30.5 billion equity valuation as an $11 billion net debt load increased the enterprise value to $41-$42 billion. With reported segment EBITA of $4.5 billion for the company overall, including a $1.1 billion depreciation charge and $600 million in corporate cost allocation, I peg overall EBITDA at around $5 billion. This suggests that Johnson at large trades at 8.3 times EBITDA, which means that the headline number of the deal is more or less in line with the overall valuation. That said, the $1.8 billion in tax and transaction leakage in connection to the deal is very painful, equal to $2 per share.With adjusted earnings seen down from roughly $3.00 to $2.30 per share, the valuation at $33 per share comes in around 14-15 times earnings, while the pro-forma business operates with a reasonable leverage ratio just above 2 times. It should be stressed that the leverage calculation above excludes the billion underfunded status of pensions.While a 14-15 times multiple might look reasonable, reality is that growth has been underwhelming (for quite a while now) and that and cash flow conversion is consistently below the 100% mark. Furthermore, I am not impressed with the outcome of the restructuring efforts, as selling in a tax-inefficient way and at a multiple which can not be regarded as very high, are not convincing arguments either for investors to jump on board.These reasons are why shares have been lagging the market a lot in recent years and continue to trade at non-demanding multiples, as a market performance is required before getting investors enthusiastic to be willing to pay a market multiple for the current earnings. So while the valuation looks fair to appealing, I would not expect fireworks in the near term and thus am not necessarily a buyer just yet."

The economic business cycle shot clock looks to be winding down.Should investors keep camping or pull up the stakes and head out?","In January 2017, I initiated what evolved to be a smallish position in Johnson Controls International plc (JCI). Routinely, I scale in and out of positions. Therefore, my position was acquired via several 2017 purchases. The investment is down 11%, though the loss has been mitigated by a ~2.5% dividend yield.It's not been a very good investment while Mr. Market is a-rockin'.As we approach the upcoming earnings season, I figure it's time to do a little soul searching and determine a forward plan for this laggard holding.Overarching the situation are several of my ""big rules."" I tend to stick with a stock unless:Let's pick these off one at a time.On February 21, 2017, Seeking Alpha published my initial Johnson Controls article. The investment thesis contained therein, word for word, is found below:For those interested, I followed on with a subsequent Seeking Alpha article about Johnson Controls a little over one year ago. It's found here.Let's break down the original 2017 premises.Global Business and Corporate FocusSince January 2017, the global business climate has improved. The markets/businesses in which JCI operates have been impacted positively by a robust, global economic expansion.Looking back to December 2016, the company outlined its strategic objectives during an investor conference. These objectives included focusing upon two primary industries: Building Technologies and Power Systems.Building Technologies entails comprehensive HVAC and ""smart"" building and related system controls. Power Systems includes the manufacture of automotive batteries.2017-2020 Business Plan: Is Management Keeping Its Promises?At the same investor conference, management offered a detailed multi-year business plan. Among other things, senior leadership set expectations for the following key financial metrics:Halfway through the 2017 to 2020 plan, how has management fared versus goals and objectives?POSSIBLE. In FY 2017, adjusted net sales increased just 2%. Management backed down the FY 2018 forecast to low single digits. Through three quarters, YoY adjusted net sales increased 4.7%. A good FY 4Q could salvage the situation.FAILING. 2017 margins improved 90 bps to 11.9%. However, 2018 YTD margins backslid to 11.1%. Earlier in the year, management guided to 12.3%. It seems improbable the company can match 2017 results, let alone meet guidance with one quarter remaining. The upcoming earnings report will provide the punch line.POSSIBLE. In 2017, Johnson Controls missed the mark. A combination of events contributed to the failure, including poor working capital control. Management promised to correct the mistakes, maintaining an 80% conversion rate for the current fiscal year. Through three quarters, the measure clocks in at just 57%. On one hand, historically, the fiscal fourth quarter tends to exhibit strong FCF generation. On the other hand, management includes a number of free cash flow ""adjustments"" that cloud matters.ON TRACK: Last year, corporate expenses fell 14%. Management forecast another 11% cut in FY 2018. It appears likely the company can complete the year at ~$415 million, thereby making the grade and keeping the 2020 objective intact.FAILING. 2017 operating EPS tallied $2.60. However, the most recent management forecast indicates FY 2018 will come in at $2.81 (midpoint), suggesting an 8% year-over-year improvement. Even this year's high Street estimate doesn't provide enough juice. Management adjusts GAAP earnings by excluding transaction costs, integration costs, corporate gain-on-sale for the Scott Safety transaction, and some purchase accounting figures.Does Johnson Controls Own a Sound Balance Sheet, Earn Profits in Cash, and Exhibit Shareholder-Friendly Actions?Johnson Controls owns a sound balance sheet. After managing several moving parts (purchasing Tyco, selling Adient and Scott Safety), the company is whittling down debt and improving leverage ratios. Current net debt-to-capital is 36%, acceptable for an industrial outfit. Net debt-to-EBITDA is 2.4x, within management's target range. These ratios are expected to see continue improvement. A S&P BBB+ credit rating puts the business solidly in the investment-grade category.The business earns its profits in cash. Through three quarters in FY 2018, JCI reported $1.39 billion GAAP net income. Operating cash flow (GAAP, unadjusted) is $1.26 billion. I'm willing to give management a pass for 2017. Given major corporate transactions ongoing last year, there were a lot of moving parts and pieces. A long-term look at the business via F.A.S.T. Graphs demonstrates that most of the time Johnson Controls generates cash flow at or greater than earnings.Courtesy of fastgraphs.comIs the business shareholder-friendly? Looking back to the corporate move to Ireland, and some of the other actions precipitated by ex-CEO Alex Molinaroli, I'd say no. However, Mr. Market (and yours truly) tends to look forward, not into the rear-view mirror.Current CEO George Oliver has performed acceptably. He was the previous CEO for the Tyco Corporation, and groomed to become Johnson Controls' CEO and chairman after Molinaroli departed. Molinaroli was moved out and Oliver replaced him quite a bit earlier than originally intended. I opine that was a good thing.In July 2018, JCI elected Ms. Jean S. Blackwell to serve as a director effective immediately. Blackwell previously served as the executive vice president of Corporate Responsibility and chief executive officer of the Cummins Foundation. I saw this as a positive move to strengthen the board.After increasing the share count in conjunction with the Tyco acquisition, Johnson Controls' management has repurchased shares methodically. Over the past year, the company knocked back total diluted shares outstanding 1.5%.The company has paid a dividend every year since 1887.Has Management Leadership and Execution Been a Catalyst?No. I identified management's ability to execute and ability to set/exceed Street expectations as the primary catalyst relating to future share appreciation. Indeed, back in 2016, Johnson Controls embarked upon a series of major transactions thereby re-imagining the company.Unfortunately, I cannot give the company a passing mark on this account. True, there have been positives and negatives. To be fair, the jury is still out on a new CEO, his ability to meet objectives, realize proposed merger synergies, and tighten up the business.Nonetheless, on balance, between the January 2017 and September 2018, management hasn't been an effective catalyst resulting in higher stock prices.Let's turn to valuation. Are the shares dear or inexpensive?F.A.S.T. Graphs is a good place to start an analysis.First, here's a long-term price and operating earnings chart:Courtesy of fastgraphs.comGiven the premise ""price follows earnings and cash flow,"" this chart suggests JCI's shares are undervalued. A 15.2x long-term, trimmed P/E ratio isn't excessive. Looking forward, EPS is expected to rise modestly, albeit lower than management's 12% to 15% forecast. The long-term EPS growth rate has been 6.1%; the forward operating EPS growth rate is a bit higher. The dividend brings the current forward yield to a nearly 3%.If we accept $2.81 EPS will be attained for this fiscal year (ended September 30), applying a 15x multiple indicates a $42 stock. If FY 2019 operating EPS grows 7% to $3.00 a share, shares could be valued at ~$45. Including the $1.04 dividend, that's a pretty good return on a recent $36.31 bid.Let's turn to another F.A.S.T. Graph: this time plotting price and operating cash flow:This chart is a good example why F.A.S.T. Graphs are ""a tool to think with,"" and not a stone tablet. Despite a 15-year 13.9x trimmed average P/CF multiple, I contend the figure is just too aggressive. In a late-phase economic cycle, history tells us a 10x to 12x ratio on an industrial stock is more appropriate. Therefore, placing an 11x multiple on FY 2019 cash flow, I see no more than a ~$46 FVE.For additional background, I include a 15-year F.A.S.T. Graph illustrating price and EBIT. I was interested in this chart because management identifies EBIT and EBIT margin as key financial indicators. So it seems reasonable to include this metric as another price/multiple valuation measure.While I believe straight, trimmed average valuations are also too aggressive, they do confirm JCI's shares appear to trade below fair value.Finally, as a quick check, here's a price-to-sales chart.Over the past 15 years, we see the JCI stock now stretching its relative P/S valuation. Currently, the P/S is 1.1x. This marks a trend towards the higher end of the long-term range. The data reinforces my reasoning for pushing down ""fair value"" P/CF and P/EBIT multiples.Frankly, Johnson Controls' ""other factors"" and overall set-up suck.First, presuming we are in a late-phase economic cycle, by this juncture, most industrial stocks tend to be a lot closer to their peak than trough. If true, Johnson Controls missed the party; the company got caught up in multiple major acquisitions and divestitures instead of enjoying the festivities.Even if the current up-cycle has another year or so to play out, there's not much time for the stock to garner capital appreciation. Indeed, Mr. Market is pretty good at looking 6 to 12 months out. That means the industrials, including JCI, just don't have a lot of time on the shot clock.In July, the company entertained four suitors seeking to purchase its Power Solutions business for up to $12 billion. This has the propensity to add a little shine to the situation, but also muddies the water. Management hardly digested one slug of merger/divestitures, and it's looking at another round.Compounding matters, the Street is sour on the stock. Poor sentiment dogs the shares. Over the past year, several brokerages downgraded JCI. Of the firms listed on finviz.com, just one upgraded it. Here's the summary:Second, throughout 2018, analysts have been lowering 2019 EPS expectations. At the beginning of this year, the Street expected JCI to earn $3.12 per share in FY 2019. Currently, consensus estimates now call for $3.03. That's still an 8% improvement over management's FY 2018 forecast, but the numbers are moving in the wrong direction. That makes the upcoming management guidance even more important.Third, the JCI chart doesn't warrant a great deal of excitement. While I favor the fundamentals over the technicals, I do pay attention to what the charts have to say. The related technical studies help show how sentiment and institutional money is playing out.As a long-term investor, I favor using a long-term picture. Hence, please find below Johnson Controls' 3-year weekly chart.Johnson Controls : Price, volume, related studies (3-year weekly)Courtesy of bigcharts.marketwatch.comThere's not much to float your boat.JCI is trading below both its 8-week and 40-week moving averages. The MACD looks to be rolling over. The MFI isn't bad. On balance, volume appears to be somewhat neutral.Over the past couple of years, Johnson Controls' stock hasn't played out well. With the benefit of hindsight, a combination of 1) multiple major merger and divestitures, 2) a new CEO, and 3) associated growing pains hamstrung the stock during a period of solid global economic growth. Fundamental performance measures have been mixed, mostly lackluster.Street sentiment for JCI stock is awful.Compounding matters, the global economic expansion may be into the late phase of the cycle.Johnson Controls' senior leadership indicated the U.S./China trade conflict should not affect the company significantly. However, the stronger dollar does pressure earnings.I believe investors must make a choice: either hang in there with the expectation management will sort things out and get it right, weather potential industry cyclical softness, then come up strong on the other side of the next rebound, or simply bail out and redeploy the capital elsewhere.Since 1Q 2017, shares are down ~11%; about 2.5 points less on a total return basis if the dividend is included.Furthermore, the stock looks inexpensive. I can defend JCI as a $45 stock using FY 2019 EPS/cash flow (FY ends September 30), suggesting considerable capital appreciation upside.Personally, I plan to watch upcoming earnings very closely, attempt to read the tea leaves, and make an informed investment decision. Indeed, I expect management to either provide FY 2019 operational and financial expectations on the upcoming investor conference call, or announce a corporate communication shortly thereafter. This data, plus management's views on the state of global economy, will further assist my decision. It's time for this investor to either decide to hunker down or begin to bail out.Please do you own careful due diligence before making any investment decision. This article is not a recommendation to buy or sell any stock. Good luck with all your 2018 investments."
4296148,21798,2019-10-11T15:20:35-04:00,"The expected double-digit growth of commercial and residential smart buildings is likely to have a positive impact on Johnson Control's revenue, earnings, and stock price.Johnson Controls is keeping a sharper focus on the building controls market to capitalize on this trend.Johnson Controls is valued attractively, giving the stock room to run higher.","Johnson Controls (JCI) recently sold their energy solutions business to focus on their buildings solutions. The company plans to benefit from the expected 33.7% CAGR for the smart buildings solutions market by 2022. The company received $13.2 billion from this sale, which is being used to capitalize on growth trends, to strengthen the balance sheet, and to return cash to shareholders (dividends/buybacks).The company has solutions that are increasingly more advanced so that commercial and residential buildings can be more efficient and safer than they were before the new technology. Johnson Controls offers HVAC systems, intelligent building control systems, fire detection, and electronic security systems. The company's systems work together so that customers can effectively monitor everything for optimal efficiency and safety.Source: eco-business.comSome examples of the company's innovative technology are their solutions for growing data centers. JCI produces the York Mission Critical Direct Evaporative Cooling Air Handling Units. These units have the advantage of being highly efficient and allow for data center expansion strategies - so they can be scaled up as needed.Another example is the York VYFA Free-cooling VSD Screw Chiller. This system uses high efficiency air-to-liquid free cooling coils to reduce or eliminate the need for mechanical cooling. The system's smart controls monitor energy use all year and adjust the system's operations (compressor and fan speeds) as needed for the most efficient operation.Johnson Controls is also working on making the office of the future. The company partnered with Microsoft (MSFT) to produce sustainable headquarters for United Arab Emirates company, Bee'ah. This smart office uses AI (artificial intelligence) across systems and spaces. The smart office combines Microsoft's Azure with Johnson Controls' system to provide optimal energy efficiencies, smart security, and to make the best use of available space to increase productivity.Look for the company to continue to create innovations like this and to expand their usage. It appears that the Bee'ah project was a test run for what the company would like to do for many companies.The outlook for Johnson Controls looks positive. Management seems to be on the right track by focusing on catching the tailwinds of the long-term growth of smart building technology market. The highest growth for this market is expected to take place by 2022 with a 33.7% CAGR. However, the growth won't stop there. This market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 19.6% through 2024.With that said, I expect Johnson Controls to grow revenue and earnings at a pace that is likely to be attractive for investors. The company has expectations for strong double-digit earnings growth over the next four years. That growth has the potential to allow JCI to outperform the S&P 500.Here's a look at Johnson Controls' earnings growth expectations for the next 4 fiscal years:Source: seekingalpha.comJohnson Controls did experience lower earnings in FY19. However, that reflected the loss of their energy business which they sold. FY19 is now officially over for Johnson Controls since October 2019 marks the beginning of FY20 for the company.The future looks bright as earnings are expected to grow at above-average double-digit rates over the next few years. As a comparison, the companies in the S&P 500 (SPY) are expected to grow earnings only in the mid single-digits in 2020.Johnson Controls has been making improvements in their margins and returns. This helped improve their profitability. For example, the gross margin of 29.75% and EBITDA margin of 14.9% for the past 12 months increased over the company's five-year averages of 25.8% and 12% respectively.The ROE (return on equity) of 10%, ROIC (return on invested capital) of 7.4%, and ROA (return on assets) increased over the 5-year averages of 9%, 6%, and 3% respectively.Those gains demonstrate management's effectiveness in improving the company's profitability. This shows that their strategies have been effective in recent years and that they are navigating well within their market.Johnson Controls has an attractive valuation when compared to their competitors. The company is valued lower and has higher expected growth than their peers. Here's how JCI stacks up to their competition:Source: finance.yahoo.comJohnson Controls is the only company from this bunch that is trading with an EV/EBITDA below 10. EV/EBITDA ratios below 10 are considered an attractive valuation if the company is healthy and profitable the way JCI is. JCI also beats most of their peers on forward PE. This is a result of their high expected earnings growth for FY20. You can see from the table above that no competitor comes close to Johnson Controls' expected earnings growth.The average forward PE for all 5 of these companies is 16.84. Johnson Controls is trading about 4.6% below that. JCI's forward PE has room to move higher since the company's growth outlook is improving for multiple years at an above-average pace.Johnson Controls has a few key competitive advantages: effective management and effective partnerships. Management strength looks strong as they made improvements with margins and returns (as mentioned earlier in the article). The decision to sell their energy solutions business looks wise as the company can focus on the growth of their smart buildings solutions.The company has a goal to lead the move to smarter, more efficient, and more sustainable buildings and infrastructure. While it is not clear that JCI will emerge as the leader in this space, this goal along with their innovative solutions gives the company a high chance of being a significant player.Another advantage is that JCI is willing to form effective partnerships with other companies. This can increase their probability of being successful with innovative solutions as opposed to navigating everything by themselves. An example of this is JCI's joint venture with Hitachi (OTCPK:HTHIY). This joint venture strives to provide a diverse range of air conditioning products. Examples of products include: high-efficiency chillers, residential air-conditioning solutions, variable refrigerant flow systems, HVAC building automation solutions, and leading-edge rotary & scroll compressors.Another example of business partnering is teaming up with Microsoft to utilize the cloud and AI for the office of the future. This partnership can help offices increase efficiencies and better utilize space.Johnson Controls also partnered with Foxconn (OTC:FXCOF) to develop smart building and smart city technology through the use of AI and machine learning. This is another example of how the company is willing to team up with other companies to help make buildings and cities safer and more efficient.The long-term outlook (looking out 3 to 5 years) into the future looks positive for Johnson Controls. Commercial and residential building owners can benefit from making their buildings safer and more efficient through the company's technology. This can reduce costs over time for the building owners, enticing them to demand more intelligent control systems. That is why this market is expected to grow at a double-digit pace for multiple years.Look for Johnson Controls to expand more into smart cities over the next few years. Smart buildings can work together and be interwoven into smart cities so that overall efficiencies are gained in fire/security responses, energy usage, intelligent infrastructure systems, and productivity, etc.The risk to the investment thesis is an economic slowdown that would delay the building of new commercial and residential buildings. This would have a negative impact on the installation of Johnson Controls' smart building solutions. However, a recession or economic slowdown would also likely create a good buying opportunity for the stock.The company's reasonable valuation can support strong gains in the stock as the company grows earnings at an above-average double-digit pace. This growth can help drive the stock to outperform the broader market. JCI's above-average growth has the potential to increase the forward PE to a higher level. For example, a one-year $50 price target would take the forward PE up to about 19.3, which is more in-line with Lennox's forward PE. It would be reasonable for JCI's stock to trade that high based on their high growth rate. This is based on JCI's expected EPS of $2.56 for FY20. That represents a 19% to 20% potential one-year gain."
4118857,103373,2017-10-31T20:25:36-04:00,What makes Johnson Controls International an attractive buy?Which segment is on the verge of sustained growth?What are the trends and forecasts that point to this growth?,"What makes Johnson Controls International (JCI) a solid long-term investment, despite the stock having hardly made a dent YTD? Is there a particular segment that’s poised for growth? What are the forecasts and trends that point to sustained growth for the segment in question?Johnson Controls International is one of those businesses that has stood the test of time. The company, founded in 1885, is still moving forward, simply because the business lines it operates help create a wide moat around the company. The company operates in three primary business segments: Buildings, Automotive Experience and Power Solutions.It’s not really a surprise, considering the age of Johnson Controls, that the company has constantly adjusted its product portfolio according to the changing needs of the market. The company entered the automotive battery business through the acquisition of Globe-Union in 1978, then it added automotive seating by buying Hoover Universal. In 2005, the company bought York International, which brought in heating, ventilating, air-conditioning and refrigeration equipment and services to the company. And in 2014, the company entered the air distribution and ventilation market through the acquisition of Air Distribution Technologies.In 2015, Johnson Controls entered into a joint venture agreement with Hitachi, acquiring 60% ownership stake in the new entity that had approximately $2.8 billion in annual sales.Johnson Controls went through a huge transformation process as it divested its Global Workplace solutions business, created a joint venture with Yanfeng Automotive Trim Systems for its Automotive Experience business and did a tax inversion by merging with Ireland-based Tyco International.The reason I brought up the whole list is because this is what helped Johnson Controls stay relevant in a world that is constantly evolving due to advancement in technologies.More to the point, all this happened even as Building Efficiency remained the bread and butter segment for Johnson Controls for a very long time.In 2006, the Building Efficiency segment accounted for 32% of net sales, which improved to 35% in fiscal 2016. As of the quarter ended June 30, 2017, segment net sales were reported at $1,128 million compared to $1,113 million during the prior period, representing a growth rate of 1.3%.Johnson Controls remains a global leader in providing integrated control systems, with operations across 53 countries. The company does have powerful competitors like Honeywell International (HON) and Siemens Building Technologies (OTCPK:SIEGY) in the HVAC equipment market, but this segment being completely under the control of large vendors, the odds of new entrants coming into the market and succeeding are extremely slim.The demand for installation of HVAC, security products and fire detection and suppression solutions is driven by commercial and residential constructions, and industrial facility expansion and maintenance projects. These projects will always be happening around the world. Though recessions would slow things down, construction and maintenance projects will start up again once economic recovery starts.According to Johnson Controls VP and GM, Middle East and Africa, Ashraf Abdalla,Source: ForbesA new surge in urbanization is already underway in most parts of the world, especially in emerging economies like India, China and parts of Africa. According to data from UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs, in 2014, nearly 54% of the global population lived in urban areas, and that figure is expected to hit 60% by 2050. In comparison, only 30% of the population lived in urban areas in 1950. Nearly 2.5 billion people are expected to move into urban locations by 2050, and the trend seems irreversible.Though the forecast numbers vary depending on the market research firm’s report you are reading (Zion, Markets and Markets, Research and Markets), most forecasts expect strong double-digit growth for the smart building market over the next five years.Johnson Controls says that this massive urbanization will lead to $90 trillion worth of investments in urban infrastructure. Honeywell, Johnson Controls, Schneider (OTCPK:SBGSY) and Siemens are clearly going to play a major role in this infrastructure development, and walk away with most of that growth surge over the next ten years.Source: Esa.un.orgBusiness Insider expects the industrial automation market to grow at a fast clip as well, nearly doubling its size over the next five years. The global industrial automation services market was $35.22 billion in 2016 and is estimated to reach $ 64.46 billion by 2022, growing at a CAGR of 10.6% for the forecast period.The report cites the “Need for operational efficiency, Rapidly growing SMEs, growing inclination towards Internet of Things(IoT) and cloud-based automation, growing demand for smart factories, mass customization, supply chain synchronization, integration of systems, increasing R&D and innovation in Artificial intelligence and advancement in the M2M communication technology are some of the key growth factors of this industry.”The combination of these forecasts represents a very strong upside for Johnson Controls’ Building Efficiency segment, which looks set for a period of sustained growth.Though there is a lot of noise and confusion around the massive changes that Johnson Controls is going through, for which the company has no one else but itself to blame, the Building Efficiency segment, which now represents more than a third of total revenue, is only going to keep increasing its contribution to overall revenues over the next several years as these trends and predictions play out.Excluding Tyco's revenues, overall revenues for JCI grew by 2.8% year-over-year for the quarter ended June 30, and EBITA excluding Tyco grew 11.1% for the quarter. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the quarter was 59 cents, compared to 53 cents for the prior period.There's a certain amount of risk associated with future growth in the Building Efficiency segment, but even excluding potential revenues from the trends I've outlined above, the company is once again tracking growth.JCI data by YChartsFrom a valuation perspective, Johnson Controls is trading at a forward P/E of 12.2, which is much lower than the 18.5 times its chief competitor Honeywell International is trading at.The company has guided for 2017 adjusted EPS from continuing operations in the $2.60 to $2.62 range.If we use Ben Graham’s Intrinsic Value calculation, using the trailing twelve months EPS of $2.60, Corporate AAA bond yield of 3.63% and a projected growth rate of 3%, which I think is a reasonable assumption for Johnson Controls, it derives an intrinsic value of $45.70, slightly above the current trading price.The stock has barely moved year-to-date, but considering the upside from global urbanization and technology trends, as well as the dividend yield of 2.3%, Johnson Controls looks like an attractive bet."

The company's shares sit at 52-week lows as investors were once again disappointed after its latest earnings report. At the time of our latest JCI article, we also expressed our disdain for the company's CEO and his outsized and excessive pay package. Despite our disappointments, we advised investors to remain patient until the company's current CEO likely leaves in the next year or so. We also recommended to investors that they give more time to management to achieve their promised benefits of the Tyco acquisition. In the company's latest earnings report, it recorded earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.59. Non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.71 per share, an increase from $0.61 in the year-ago quarter. JCI saw many of its businesses and its regions experience some good growth while others fell short. The company also noted that within its buildings business that the Tyco merger created some near term distractions that had contributed to it not achieving its revenue objectives. JCI, however, continues to offset its revenue shortfalls with its continued transformation strategy and productivity benefits.During JCI's latest earnings announcement, it guided investors to the low-end of its prior earnings estimates of $2.60 to $2.62, representing growth of 13 percent. JCI, however, remained confident that its strategy and the strategic platform that it is creating would drive revenue/earnings growth. To drive growth, JCI has realigned its leadership structure to eliminate costs and redundant management layers and to optimize sales/service productivity. The company also remains committed to achieving its synergy/productivity savings targets. (JCI is set to meet its $300 million 2017-cost/productivity synergies targets.) With such efforts in mind, JCI's total sales increased 1 percent to $7.7 billion in its latest quarter. The company's building business sales were flat versus the prior year at $6.1 billion due to 2 percent organic growth being offset by adverse currency effects and net divestitures. The company saw continued momentum in its global applied HVAC business while its fire and security business declined. The company's product business recorded a 4 percent of organic sales due to very strong growth in our North America residential and light commercial HVAC business, which benefited from a significant amount of new product launches, despite beginning to lot more difficult comparisons. The company's power solutions business recorded sales that increased 6 percent to $1.6 billion.While investors remain disappointed with JCI's performance, there are signs of innovation that give us hope as investors. For us, such hope emanates from the company's ability to innovate and adapt to technological innovations changing the lives of people and business. For example, in late July 2017 Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and JCI announced their partnership to build a ""connected thermostat."" Such thermostat, named ""GLAS,"" would be used in homes, workplaces and vertical market environments. The GLAS thermostat, which will be made by JCI, will include a touch-screen display that will enable customers to control their room temperatures and check their energy usage (and air quality). One MSFT partner, indicated that GLAS fits with MSFT's Internet-Of-Things (""IoT"") strategy of offering flexible building blocks for end solutions. Where MSFT steps up to create all of the building blocks for customers/partners to work together to bring together industry-specific solutions that solve business challenges, JCI benefits by moving forward into the expanding IoT market. The GLAS thermostat, which includes Cortana digital assistant integration, will run on Microsoft's Windows 10 IoT operating system. As such, MSFT's partnership with JCI is important to bring human interaction with smart devices in vertical markets.JCI is among the first companies to launch production-grade devices that incorporate MSFT's Azure IoT capabilities, and, once again, with GLAS the company is leading the way to innovate through the IoT. For JCI, aside from its GLAS product, there are significant opportunities ahead to move beyond simple device integration and provide natural, human interaction with smart devices. The GLAS thermostat has sensors that detect when a person is in a room or not and the thermostat will constantly monitor indoor and outdoor air quality. All of the sensors in GLAS are designed to save energy by changing settings in the moment, similar to the Nest thermostat. MSFT's promotional video for GLAS appears to market it for businesses/commercial properties given that MSFT designed it to be powered by MSFT's Azure cloud services. To date, it is not clear whether GLAS will be available to consumers or when such thermostat will launch. JCI's efforts with the GLAS product are important, nonetheless, because such product is part of a growing market that includes energy efficiency of buildings, which includes air conditioners.JCI shares have underperformed while the shares of other air conditioner companies have performed well. As such JCI's shares have traded at a discount to such competitors despite the company's exposure to the long-term trend of building owners upgrading building technology to decrease operating costs and emissions. We have noted in the past that such discount would dissipate and it shares would rise once the company realized its full potential in the markets it sells into such as the building technologies market and the energy efficiency trend that supports it. While JCI is making progress with its integration of Tyco, it continues to exceed its cost savings forecasts from its productivity/integration cost savings efforts. JCI has finished much of its transformation to exit low-margin industrial businesses to focus on less cyclical higher-margin markets that are experiencing higher growth rates. Such transformation, however, has yet to satisfy analysts/investors sufficiently to drive JCI's shares higher. The company is likely to experience continued strength in its air conditioning/energy solutions businesses, while its volatile battery business may hinder its progress unless it is ultimately divested. In addition to JCI's transformation efforts, the combined JCI/Tyco businesses should benefit by combining each company's offerings of complementary product/services with customer/geography overlap, along with significant revenue/cost synergies. The combined companies will also drive growth through product cross-selling and complementary distribution networks.With JCI continuing its Tyco integration efforts, it will also continue to focus on its market-leading building business that includes its heating and air conditioning equipment for commercial buildings, and on its devices for monitoring and regulating electricity usage, temperature and security. The company will also focus on its profitable but volatile automotive battery business that will benefit from fuel economy regulations due to its advanced lead-acid battery technology. We believe investors should begin a position in JCI shares now and complete such position on any overall market sell-off. As an investor waits for the company to fully realize benefits from its transformative activities, they will collect about a 2.55 percent dividend that may be increased. As the company's transformation continues to move forward, JCI will also be able to drive more consistent long-term revenue/earnings growth and the shares will be assigned a price-to-earnings ratio more consistent with its competitors.We see JCI's partnership with MSFT to develop the GLAS thermostat as an important consideration for JCI shareholders as it shows the company's interest in innovating to push forward into burgeoning markets such as the IoT market. While The GLAS product has not been officially offered into the marketplace, we see such innovation as significant given its participation in the company's most important marketplace, the building business that includes heating and air conditioning equipment for commercial buildings and devices for monitoring and regulating electricity usage, temperature and security. JCI's slow and uneven transformation efforts to drive long-term revenue/earnings growth have shaken risk-averse investors. Investors realize JCI's transformation efforts have multiple moving parts, and, any misstep could adversely affect its results. We believe, however, that JCI shareholders will benefit from the Tyco acquisition if JCI can achieve its stated cost/productivity synergy goals. JCI's shares trade at a discount when compared to its competitors due to the uncertainty of the Tyco integration efforts. The company, with its exposure to energy efficient-building market trends, however, will benefit from commercial building operators efforts to reduce their most significant expense, heating/cooling costs.Building owners/operators understand that high-energy-efficiency buildings are able to obtain higher rents and such buildings can also be sold at premium prices. JCI, a leading supplier to such building owners that can also assist them in improving a building's energy efficiencies, stands to be a main beneficiary of such building upgrade trend. The company will also benefit from: 1) JCI/Tyco offering complementary product/services with customer and geography overlap, along with strong revenue/cost synergies; and 2) product cross-selling and complementary distribution networks. As noted above, as the company integrates Tyco into its organization, JCI's profit margins will also increase and its price-to-earnings ratio will expand and be more comparable with that of its competitors. Earnings estimates for JCI are $2.61 for fiscal year 2017 and $2.97 for fiscal year 2018. (Estimates have decreased slightly for both years in recent months and after its latest earnings report.) Shares are trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 15.00 based on fiscal year 2017 earnings estimates and 13.20 based on fiscal year 2018 estimates. While we believe that investors should start a position in JCI shares now, we believe that since the overall markets are at 52-week highs, investors should finish their position on an overall market sell-off.Over the long term, a combined JCI/Tyco, the company's energy solutions business (including its air conditioning business), its innovations and other transformative actions will reward long-term investors with increasing dividends, substantial share repurchases and share price appreciation.(Click ""Follow"" next to our contributor name at the top of this article to follow our upcoming articles on JCI and more.)"
4108820,24018,2017-09-22T12:11:53-04:00,"Johnson Controls is a ""work-in-progress"" company. In 2017, shares have gone nowhere.If major restructuring and refocusing is executed successfully, a more focused company with a growth business model emerges.An accelerated CEO transition adds a new catalyst.I continue to be constructive on JCI shares.","It's tough to outperform the market by chasing the front-runners, or trading in and out of multiple tickers. I contend securing portfolio alpha requires finding undervalued securities, then waiting for these to return to fair value.Johnson Controls PLC (JCI) remains on my list.Johnson Controls owns a sound balance sheet. The company has a strong franchise and traditionally earns its profits in cash. Management is capable and offers investors several shareholder-friendly attributes.(Yes, I'm aware of recent history; more on that later in the article).The stock appears inexpensive on earnings or cash flow.In addition, several catalysts are in place to move shares higher:Before making an investment, the first place I look is the balance sheet. Specifically, I look at the cash position, debt, liquidity, and equity build.As of June 30, 2017, Johnson Controls held $458 million or $0.49 a share balance sheet cash. The position is modest; however, it reflects some of the post-acquisition ""noise"" to which I referred earlier. Going forward, I expect the figure to improve.Net debt to capital is 41.2%. The target is 35% to 40%. Importantly, the company expects the upcoming sale of the Scott Safety business to net $1.8 to $1.9 billion cash. The cash will be used to repay a portion of merger-related debt. The transaction is scheduled to close in 1Q 2018. Post-close, all else equal, the ND2Cap ratio falls into line at ~38%.While the debt load is higher than pre-merger levels, the company is well equipped to service it.Courtesy of fastgraphs.comIn late August, Fitch reaffirmed Johnson Controls' BBB+ investment-grade credit rating, including a ""Stable"" outlook. S&P also rates the company BBB+. Through the first nine months of the fiscal year, the Interest Coverage Ratio (EBIT/Interest Expense) is 3.0x. That's acceptable.Liquidity, as measured by the 1.2x Current Ratio, is solid. In addition, the company uses its investment-grade credit rating to tap the commercial paper and short-term bank loan markets. There are two revolving credit lines, totaling $3.0 billion. Both are undrawn and do not mature until 2020.A short post-acquisition operating history, along with heavy restructuring, makes evaluating management's ability to increase net book value (equity) difficult. Investors should note about half of Johnson Controls' asset base is comprised of Goodwill and Intangibles. Go-forward equity build will require close monitoring.Established in 1885, Johnson Controls has a long-term, storied franchise. I consider Johnson a ""wide moat"" business, meaning it is difficult for new competitors to enter its markets. The company's HVAC and building controls businesses cater to campuses, districts, and complex single-building applications. Johnson Controls supplies original and replacement vehicle batteries for just about every manufacturer in the world.For FY 2017 to-date, Johnson Controls' management fell down on Free Cash Flow and FCF conversion targets. In part, this is a reason the shares eased after the 3Q report.To its credit, JCI senior leadership set specific fiscal year 2017 goals for these aforementioned metrics:Setting these objectives provided investors all the rope needed to hang management.In spite of the lengthy explanations on the most recent earnings conference call, much of the blame is simply poor execution.On the FY 3Q conference call, CFO Brian Stief addressed the cash flow problems:He then attempted to reconcile the shortfall:Here is the referenced chart:Mr. Stief proceeded:Bottom line: that's a lot of explaining. Through nine months, straight Free Cash Flow is negative. Adjusted FCF is only $0.2 billion. The stated target was $2.1 billion. If as predicted, Johnson Controls generates $900 million in the quarter ending September 30, it certainly would be a step in the right direction.Of course, the 80% FCF Conversion target ratio went AWOL after the 3Q earnings report. On the conference call, management addressed it, setting expectations it will be ""fixed"" in the second half of this year.Historically, Johnson Controls has been a free cash flow machine. Following is another F.A.S.T. graph highlighting the relationship between free cash flow and net income:I surmise the 80% conversion objective wasn't an unreasonable goal; however, execution got busted in 2017.For long-time Johnson Controls investors, I recognize good management and ""shareholder friendliness"" may be called to question. I offer my go-forward assessment.Good Management?I am a firm believer management makes a difference.Unquestionably, prior CEO Alex Molinaroli was a controversial figure; he carried plenty of baggage. The man is out. Effective September 1, 2017, new CEO George Oliver is in. Not only was Molinaroli replaced, but also the transfer was accelerated six months earlier than announced previously.Mr. Oliver moves over from his role as president. Before coming to JCI, he held the CEO role for the acquired Tyco International PLC. George Oliver managed Tyco evenly and capably. A Morningstar.com news article on the move reinforces the point.JCI stock reacted positively to the accelerated transfer.Shareholder Friendly?Many retail investors panned Johnson Controls over the 2016 tax inversion and associated Adient spin-off. Ex-CEO Alex Molinaroli's compensation package is also cited as a big negative.Frankly, I'd be less than thrilled with Johnson's actions to enhance shareholder value through a tax inversion, too. A tax inversion scheme includes existing stockholders getting hit with a tax bill as if they sold the stock.The Tyco merger and Adient/Scott Safety spin-off sales were the company's latest steps in a long-term strategy: exit low-margin businesses and focus upon less cyclical, faster-growing, and higher margin markets. I cannot find fault with the strategy, but recognize some investors still have a bad taste in their collective mouths over how it's transpired.I will not try to justify the compensation and severance package awarded to Molinaroli. Indeed, Johnson Controls received an ISS Governance Quality Score of 10, indicating elevated governance risk. In particular, ISS found ""Compensation"" an issue. I find this off-putting, but decided to watch, let the dust settle a bit, and monitor forward results. Some new players, especially CEO George Oliver, may change the calculus.On the other hand, there are several positives.First, the company has paid dividends since 1985. Since the Great Recession, the payout increased each year; during the period, the annualized dividend growth rate has been over 18%.Courtesy of fastgraphs.comSecond, management has not been shy to lay out specific goals and objectives. There's focused accountability. Indeed, the granular targets have come back to haunt senior leadership.Third, I see the Molinaroli's early departure as a signal the company wanted to get CEO George Oliver into place to recalibrate the operation. I suspect the failure to meet certain targets accelerated the board's desire to get on with Oliver running the show. This is a shareholder-friendly action.I believe Johnson Controls offers investors several catalysts that may spark better share prices.Source: Johnson Controls EPG Investor Conference presentation materialsPost-acquisition synergy targets are integral to meet 2020 goals and objectives.Source: Johnson Controls EPG Investor ConferenceBusiness unit spin-offs, gains-on-sale, impairments, transaction tax payments, restructuring, and acquisition integration expenses elevated operating earnings and cash flow adjustments. Year over year comparables are difficult, if not impossible, to evaluate. The Street hates complexity and uncertainty. Currently, Johnson Controls owns both in spades. This should fade.Courtesy of fidelity.comYet after the initial post-earnings hit, the stock price stabilized around $39 to $40.Courtesy of bigcharts.marketwatch.comWhen the Street is in full bear mode, yet the stock price refuses to keep going down, it's often a positive signal. There are not many more analysts to get negative on JCI.New CEO George Oliver replaced the ex-CEO Alex Molinaroli six months earlier than announced previously.I first wrote about JCI stock back on February 21, 2017. At the time, shares traded ~$42. Today, the bid is just under $40. I did not expect the stock to do much until 2018, digesting the Tyco acquisition, spinning off Scott Safety to 3M (NYSE:MMM), and restructuring the organization. Meanwhile, I considered the 2.5% dividend yield to be secure.An updated F.A.S.T. graphs continues to paint a picture:The long-term price-and-operating earnings chart suggests ~$50 price target using FY 2019 EPS and a 15x multiple. This is down about $2 from the February inputs. Wall Street knocked back FY 2017 earnings forecasts a few cents to reflect management's recent projections. Forward expectations continue to call for low-to-mid double-digit earnings growth. In May, management reiterated this long-term view.Source: Johnson Controls EPG investor conferenceFollowing on, I share with you an operating cash flow F.A.S.T. graph. I no longer have a great deal of confidence in the projections as outlined.FY 2017 operating cash flow seems unlikely to approach anything near $4.47 a share. Nor can I reconcile the 13.5x trimmed average multiple with my own due diligence check. The ratio appears too high.Using my own ""quick check"" calculations, I believe Johnson Controls can earn $2.95 a share in FY 2018. A successful 80% FCF Conversion ratio suggests the company can generate $2.35 free cash flow. Applying a 20x P/FCF ratio yields a $47 stock. Continued improvement into FY 2019 offers a stock price in the low $50s.Poor management execution is the primary risk. A new CEO and his team are tasked with restructuring a global organization. Failure to achieve synergy targets, streamline operating costs, and better manage working capital could derail the thesis.In addition, Johnson Controls expects to see its end markets grow, and top-line numbers along with it. If these expectations don't materialize, the investment thesis is jeopardized.A plausible Johnson Controls investment thesis remains intact. Recent events resulted in the shares easing about 5% since the beginning of the year. Long-term investors may see this as an opportunity to accumulate stock. The 2.5% dividend yield is safe.Johnson Controls' management faces major restructuring and reorganization. In 2018, investors will learn whether the team is up to the task. If successful, earnings and cash flow will be on a strong, multi-year glide path. This is likely to boost shares prices from $40 to ~$50. A growing dividend is an additional kicker.Poor management execution/integration risk and weaker-than-expected end markets are the primary risks to the thesis.Please do your own careful due diligence before making any investment decision. This article is not a recommendation to buy or sell any stock. Good luck with all your 2017 investments."
4094791,103238,2017-08-04T04:57:01-04:00,"Johnson Controls International is a diversified industrial company specializing in improving energy-efficiency and providing technical services to buildings and supplying lead-acid automotive batteries.
        Q3 earnings saw strength in EPS and margins, but weakness in revenues and cash flow.  The stock dropped significantly following the report and could face continued headwinds.
        Johnson Controls is now trading at an attractive valuation, and stands to benefit from a trend towards improving energy-efficiency in buildings and a CEO change.","After weak earnings, Johnson Controls International (NYSE:JCI) is trading near a 52 week low. The company remains competitive in its industries and is trading at a low valuation compared to its peers and the broader market. This presents a good buying opportunity.Johnson Controls International is a global industrial company based in Ireland. It has two primary business segments: Buildings and Power Solutions.The Buildings segment consists of HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning), fire-safety, and security. The Power Solutions segment consists primarily of lead-acid automotive batteries.Johnson Controls was originally based in Milwaukee, but in 2016 they merged with Tyco, an Ireland based industrial company specializing in security and fire-prevention. While the merger met with regulatory and shareholder approval, it garnered bad PR for the combined company, as politicians spoke out against the move to Ireland and many US citizens viewed it unfavorably.Q3 earnings results were released on July 27 and Johnson Controls International suffered a 9% intraday drop in share price. The positives from the report were an increase in EPS and margins, but these were overshadowed by coming in below expectations on revenues and cash flow.The EPS and margin growth stemmed largely from efficiency gains from the merger with Tyco. Corporate expenses were 16% lower than the previous year, and the tax rate of 15% compared favorably to the previous tax rate of 17%.The disappointing revenue numbers were blamed on a few factors, and it was not universal across the company. Some segments saw growth. In particular, start-stop batteries that are used in hybrid vehicles saw a 17% increase in global shipments year over year.Weakness in the Buildings segment was blamed primarily on growing pains from the merger with Tyco. According to the CEO, Alex Molinaroli:When questioned about these distractions during the Q&A portion, he responded that the largest part of that segment's business is North America and the two legacy businesses of Johnson Controls and Tyco came together there in the 3rd quarter. He couldn't point to a specific thing such as a lost contract, but stated that when you change the structure of an organization it takes time for people to adjust. Both he and the COO, George Oliver, were optimistic that the changes would benefit the company long-term. While they seemed to indicate that the revenue problems in the Buildings segment would be temporary, the market seems to be taking a wait-and-see approach.In the Power Solutions segment, revenue challenges were blamed on customers of lead-acid batteries, primarily in China and EMEA, waiting for a reduction in lead prices. Johnson Controls has the leading market share in this business and one can assume that high lead prices affected the sales volume of their competitors, as well. Customers delaying purchases should translate into more demand in Q4 and beyond. In the words of the CEO:The build-up of inventory of batteries to meet future demand, and the increased spending to improve AGM capacity in North America with two plants that should finish up in 2018 and 2019, seemed to be the primary drivers behind weak cash flow during Q3. The company still expects to meet their cash flow targets later this year, however.Recent price: 39.37Estimated forward earnings: 2.88Estimated forward P/E: 13.67Quarterly dividend: 0.25Dividend yield: 2.54%Johnson Controls hasn't traded at a forward P/E ratio this low in a year and a half, and that proved to be an opportune time to invest in the stockWhen compared to the 5 year average P/E for JCI, as well as the US MSCI, World MSCI, and Ireland MSCI forward P/E provided by Yardeni Research, Johnson Control International's current P/E of 13.67 compares quite favorably.In addition to trading at a discount to both itself and the broader market, Johnson Control's quarterly dividend of 0.25 makes for a healthy dividend yield of 2.54%. If it takes some time for the stock price to recover from recent weakness, the dividend income should make the wait more endurable.There is always execution risk when it comes to mergers, and this one is no exception. While the reduction in corporate expenses and tax rates are evidence of some of the benefits of the merger, the loss of revenues in the Buildings segment has been disconcerting to investors. If we take management at face value, these growing pains should be transitory and we should see improvement in Q4. There is always some risk that the merger results in a loss of market share, however, or that the revenue problems are due to something else entirely.In addition, recent weakness in auto sales could impact the Power Solutions segment. 75% of sales volume in that segment are on the aftermarket side, however, and those should remain resilient.Despite the recent earnings miss and the potential for continued revenue shortfalls, the sentiment around the stock seems overly negative. With its current low P/E multiple, there is a large margin of safety in an investment in Johnson Controls International at these levels. It is hard to imagine a significant compression in P/E multiple from here, and it would not take much improvement to send the stock higher.Recently, Barron's contributer Jack Hough described a potential tailwind for the stock, specifically in HVAC sales in the Buildings segment. The article references a Morgan Stanley report about a ""long-term trend of upgrading building technology to drive down operating costs and emissions."" Energy is apparently the biggest expense for commercial building operators and high-efficiency buildings command higher rents. The report names three companies that have high exposure to this trend and stand to benefit, and Johnson Controls International has the lowest valuation and the biggest upside of the three.Morgan Stanley is not alone, either. In additional articles in Barron's over the past three months, Johnson Controls International received favorable coverage by William Priest of Epoch Investment Partners and an upgrade by Brian Sponheimer of Gabelli & Company.Finally, the upcoming CEO transition from Alex Molinaroli to George Oliver is being viewed favorably by analysts and investors, despite the risks inherent in any leadership change. George Oliver, former head of Tyco, is set to take over the CEO position in March of 2018, and then assume the additional role of chairman one year later. This could be a positive catalyst for the company as it puts the excessive compensation paid to Alex Molinaroli behind it.Johnson Controls International has stumbled with recent earnings, and there is no guarantee that the problems are entirely behind them. With its cheap valuation and the overly negative sentiment surrounding it, however, JCI appears to have a large margin of safety and significant upside potential. I purchased shares of Johnson Controls International this week and am prepared to add to my position on any further weakness."
4092794,67985,2017-07-31T14:08:07-04:00,"One cannot help wondering if the company will become a “mini General Electric” in terms of performance. Are the company’s shares set for a decade-long sideways move?Without an improvement in the company’s performance soon, it appears that the company's CEO may be regarded as poorly as General Electric’s outgoing CEO.We believe that the company’s investors should hold on a little long until the company’s CEO, whose pay package is outrageous/excessive, exits over the next year or so.A new CEO, with a continued energy efficiency focus (ie, air conditioners), will drive growth from the building technologies/solutions market and the energy efficiency trends that support it.An investor should consider the company’s shares as it continues to integrate Tyco and cut costs in anticipation of a new CEO in the next year or so.","Once again, investors sold off Johnson Controls International plc's (NYSE:JCI) shares by several percent after its latest quarterly earnings report. We were hoping for better, but once again our hopes were dashed. Long-term JCI investors, still angry about the adverse tax effects relating to the company's tax-inversion acquisition of Tyco International (Tyco""), are getting frustrated with the company's results. As a long-term JCI investor. we plan to hang in there with JCI shares but we cannot help wondering if JCI will become a ""mini-General Electric (NYSE:GE)"" in terms of performance. In other words, ""Are JCI and its shares set for a decade-long sideways move?"" We cannot say, but we certainly hope not. Of course, when one thinks of GE's many missteps and poor share performance one cannot overlook the company's recently departed CEO Jeffrey Immelt. Now, whether GE's poor performance was all Mr. Immelt's fault (or a combination of other factors out of his control), that is a debate for another day in another article. In an article about JCI, however, the man to discuss is CEO Alex Molinaroli. While we would like to see Mr. Molinaroli succeed, a review of his background at JCI makes us wonder if he is the person that is looking out for shareholders' interest first. His outsized pay package is outrageous, excessive and a symbol of all that is wrong with corporate executive pay.At the time of the Tyco acquisition announcement, Mr. Molinaroli was set to receive at least $20.5 million and as much as $79.6 million for completing the acquisition. In particular, he was entitled to collect the total value of his deferred compensation and pension plan ($20.5 million) as a lump payment. In addition, the $20.1 million value of his stock options, which would vest after 18 months. Further, an almost $39 million termination fee if he is fired within two years after the acquisition. Mr. Molinaroli plans to stay with JCI as CEO for 18 months after the acquisition closes. Finally, if he has to pay additional taxes because of the accelerated payouts, JCI will pay for his taxes. A sweet deal if you can get it. We should note further that he has a controversial past which includes: 1) having an affair with a management consultant who was working with the company; and 2) being caught up in a Ponzi scheme, but bankrolling the criminal defense of the scheme's perpetrator. For JCI shareholders, it is a lose-lose situation considering the company's poor post-Tyco acquisition performance. Needless to say, we look forward to Mr. Molinaroli departing as soon as possible. He is hardly a ""Boy Scout"" and is not someone we want steering JCI into the future.Despite circumstances surrounding JCI's CEO, we still think investors should give more time to management to achieve their promised benefits of the Tyco acquisition. With this in mind, let us look at the company's latest earnings report. JCI recorded earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.59. Non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.71 per share, an increase from $0.61 in the year-ago quarter. The company is seeing many of its businesses and its regions are experiencing some good growth and others have fallen short. The company also noted that within its buildings business that the Tyco merger created some near term distractions that have contributed to it not achieving its revenue objectives. JCI, however, continues to offset the revenue shortfall by its continued transformation strategy and productivity benefits. As such, the company guided to the low-end of its prior earnings estimates of $2.60 to $2.62, representing growth of 13 percent. JCI remains confident that its strategy and the strategic platform that it is creating will drive revenue/earnings growth. For the latest quarter, JCI's sales increased 1 percent to $7.7 billion. Organic revenue growth in its buildings business increased 2 percent that was partially offset by a modest decline in its power business.JCI has completely realigned its leadership structure to eliminate costs and redundant layers of management as well to optimize sales and service productivity. As such, the company remains committed to achieving its synergy/productivity savings targets. For example, during the latest quarter the company recorded about $80 million (about $0.07 a share) in year over year savings. JCI remains on track towards the high end of its original $250 to $300 million range in cost synergies and productivity savings for 2017. With this in mind, the company's building business sales were flat versus the prior year at $6.1 billion due to 2 percent organic growth being offset by adverse currency effects and net divestitures. The company saw continued momentum in its global applied HVAC business while its fire and security business declined. The company's product business recorded a 4 percent of organic sales due to very strong growth in our North America residential and light commercial HVAC business, which benefited from a significant amount of new product launches, despite beginning to lot more difficult comparisons. The company's Hitachi business recorded a high-single-digits organic sales increase due to a recovery in the timing of shipments. JCI's fire and security product businesses recorded stabilized results and was flat with the prior year.JCI's trailing EBITDA increased 7 percent to $908 million. The company's segment margins increased to 15 percent due to a strong synergy and productivity savings with modest volume leverage in a favorable mix more than offsetting planned incremental product and channel investments during the quarter. The company's power solutions business recorded sales that increased 6 percent to $1.6 billion. Organic sales for the business decrease 2 percent due to a decrease in global unit shipments with declines in both the original equipment and aftermarket channels. Power Solutions business EBITDA was $304 million, an 8 percent increase. With these earnings highlights in mind, JCI expects upcoming quarterly earnings to be $0.86 to $0.88, a 13 percent to 16 percent increase from the year-ago quarter. The company also continues to believe there will be $0.09 of benefit in the next quarter related to cost synergies and productivity savings. JCI also reduced its upcoming quarter's organic revenue growth to the low end of its previously provided range of $2.60 to $2.62, which represents a 13 percent increase from the prior year.While JCI's results continue to disappoint investors, we believe that patient long-term investors will be rewarded. Earlier in 2017, we referred to Barrons which highlighted a part of JCI's businesses that is likely to reward investors. Such business that is likely to excel includes energy efficiency of buildings, which includes air conditioners. While the shares of other air conditioner companies have performed well, JCI's shares have performed poorly and traded at a discount to such competitors despite the company's exposure to the long-term trend of building owners upgrading building technology to decrease operating costs and emissions. We have noted in the past that such discount would disappear and it shares would rise once the company would realize its full potential in the markets it sells into like the building technologies market and the energy efficiency trend that supports it. While JCI is making progress with its integration of Tyco, it continues to exceed its cost savings forecasts from its productivity/integration cost savings efforts. Over the past year, there has been commentary that JCI should divest its volatile battery business as such commentary indicates that the battery business would be a better with another company. Such a divestiture would then improve JCI's free cash flow conversion to an amount more in line with its competitors.JCI has finished much of its transformation to exit low-margin industrial businesses to focus on less cyclical higher-margin markets that are experiencing higher growth rates. Such transformation, however, has yet to satisfy analysts/investors sufficiently to drive JCI's shares higher. As noted above, the company is likely to experience continued strength in its air conditioning/energy solutions businesses, while its volatile battery business may impede the company's progress until it is ultimately divested. In addition to JCI's transformation efforts, the combined JCI/Tyco businesses should benefit by combining each company's offerings of complementary product/services with customer and geography overlap, along with significant revenue and cost synergies. The combined companies will also drive growth through product cross-selling and complementary distribution networks. With JCI continuing its Tyco integration efforts, it will also continue to focus on its market-leading building business that includes its heating and air conditioning equipment for commercial buildings, and on its devices for monitoring and regulating electricity usage, temperature and security. The company will also focus on its profitable but volatile automotive battery business that will benefit from fuel economy regulations due to its advanced lead-acid battery technology.We believe investors should consider JCI shares on any overall market sell-off. As an investor waits for the company to fully realize benefits from its transformative activities, they will collect about a 2.50 percent dividend that is likely to be increased. With much of its transformative activities behind it, JCI will also be able to show more consistent revenue/earnings growth over the long term, and the shares will be assigned a price-to-earnings ratio more consistent with its competitors.JCI's turnaround efforts to position itself towards more consistent long-term revenue/earnings growth have certainly been slow to impress analysts/investors. Investors tend to be risk averse to uncertainty, and even more risk averse to companies such as JCI that have undertaken multiple transformative activities with a goal of transforming towards higher-growth businesses in higher-growth markets. Investors understand that there are many moving parts to the transformation that the company has undertaken, and any misstep could adversely affect its results. We believe, however, that JCI shareholders will benefit from the Tyco acquisition if JCI can achieve its stated cost/productivity synergy goals. JCI's shares trade at a discount when compared to its competitors due to the uncertainty of it Tyco integration efforts. The company, given its exposure to energy efficient-building market trends, will benefit from the fact that energy is the most significant expense for commercial building operators. Further, given that high-energy-efficiency buildings are able to obtain higher rents, such buildings are also able to sell for premium prices. JCI stands to be a main beneficiary of such building upgrade trend.JCI will also benefit from: 1) JCI/Tyco offering complementary product/services with customer and geography overlap, along with strong revenue/cost synergies; and 2) product cross-selling and complementary distribution networks. As noted above, as the company integrates Tyco into its organization, JCI's profit margins will increase and its price-to-earnings ratio will expand and be more comparable with that of its competitors. Earnings estimates for JCI are $2.63 for fiscal year 2017 and $3.06 for fiscal year 2018. (Estimates have decreased slightly for both years in recent months and prior to its latest earnings report.) Shares are trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 15.10 based on fiscal year 2017 earnings estimates and 12.95 based on fiscal year 2018 estimates. While investors could buy JCI shares now, we believe that since the overall markets are at 52-week highs, investors could pick up shares even lower if a strong overall market sell-off occurs. Over the long term, a combined JCI/Tyco, the company's energy solutions business (including its air conditioning business) and other transformative actions will reward long-term investors with increasing dividends, substantial share repurchases and share price appreciation.(Click ""Follow"" next to our contributor name at the top of this article to follow our upcoming articles on JCI and more.)"

The EPS guidance range for the year narrowed to the lower end, yet perfectly bracketed Street's expectations of $2.64. The company also increased its stock buyback program by half a billion dollars, which at the current share price represents a modest additional retirement of just about 1% of the float.Good quarter, right? Well, not so fast.Credit: Milwaukee Journal SentinelThe stock reacted negatively to the print, dipping -3.7% over the course of the last two trading sessions of the week. The decline was slow and progressive, suggesting that the closer investors looked into the company and its results, the less excited they seemed to be about holding the stock.To me, the phenomenon seems to be associated with two main drivers: (1) the business transformation may not be generating results as quickly or to the extent that some analysts and investors might have wished for, with EPS and organic growth guidance for 2017 taking a bit of a haircut from previous estimates; and (2) expectations ahead of the print might have run ahead of itself, with the stock's +6.5% jump during the two weeks that preceded the earnings report representing the biggest spike in share price this year so far.Source: Seeking Alpha, sourced from company's presentationA look under the hood, however, reveals that Johnson Control's fundamentals and prospects seem to be no less robust than they have been in the recent past.Timid YOY top-line growth of 3% might actually not sound too bad, considering significant commodities price and FX headwinds. Non-GAAP EBIT margins improved slightly in the quarter as a result of cost and productivity savings - a key tenet of the investment thesis. Synergies, in fact, accounted for all the 11% YOY improvement in adjusted EPS in F2Q17, and are running ahead of the company's internal target, according to management. The announced divestiture of Scott Safety to 3M (NYSE:MMM) for a price that seems very reasonable (13x trailing EBITDA) will add a much-needed $2 billion in cash to the company's debt-rich balance sheet, and allow Johnson Controls to focus more on its core building solutions business.My views on the stockIn the end, I continue to find an investment in JCI attractive for two key reasons. First, the company's current transformation offers plenty of potential catalysts for increased cross-sales, reduced costs and cash generation from non-core asset dispositions. In fact, as I have mentioned before, rarely do I see M&A activity make as much sense as it does in the Johnson Controls-Tyco case. Second, shares are very cheaply priced compared to the peer group, which indicates that the risk-reward dynamic might be skewed to the upside. See graph below, sourced from Bloomberg.The stock, however, might not be immune to short-term headwinds from investors' skepticism. When share price dips on no real bad news, as it has this past week, it may be a sign that demand for the stock is not so hot. But for the longer-term horizon, I see skepticism as an opportunity for the more patient investor to take advantage today of what could prove to be a bargain in the future.It's all in management's hands now. Solid execution is likely to translate into stock appreciation, in my view. The bar is set very low for Johnson Controls. It would be a shame, however, if the company tripped over it.Note from the author: I invite you to follow me as I build a risk-diversified portfolio designed and back-tested to generate market-like returns with lower risk.

        Rarely do I see M&A activity make as much sense as it does in the Johnson Controls-Tyco case.
        Market seems to be discounting identified synergy opportunities by nearly 12%, and I see it as an opportunity.","As you may know, I have recently launched a premium subscription service on Seeking Alpha called SRG (Storm-Resistant Growth) portfolio. It is a multi-asset class, risk-diversified portfolio designed and back-tested to generate equity-like returns with lower risk. The very early results have more than exceeded my expectations.Recently, I reviewed the list of top 20 ""loser"" mid-to-mega cap stocks in the industrials space over the past 12 weeks as I was searching for an inexpensive and high-quality name to buy on weakness and add to my SRG holdings. Johnson Controls (NYSE:JCI) caught my attention.Credit: wuwm.comThe stock rallied earlier in 2016 following the announced intention of Johnson Control Inc.'s merger with Tyco International. But shares took a long, deep breath in the past six months, as investors awaited further clarity on the future state of the ""new"" Johnson Controls International that is being created.See below the performance of the stock against the industrials sector (NYSEARCA:VIS) and the broad equities market over the past 3 months.Source: Yahoo FinanceFirst, and for context, let's recap the key developments that took place during Johnson Control's transformation in late 2015 and 2016:- Hitachi joint venture: in October 2015, Johnson Controls completed a joint venture agreement with Hitachi to produce air conditioning products and technology. The JV, owned 60% by Johnson Controls, had about $2.8 billion in sales at the time of the transaction - for context, Johnson Control's total revenues in FY15 were $37.2 billion - in addition to 14,000 employees and 24 global locations. This arrangement further strengthened Johnson Control's HVAC and building automation solutions portfolio.- Tyco merger: on January 25th, 2016, Johnson Controls Inc. announced a merger with Tyco International. For every share of Johnson Controls Inc. stock, existing shareholders would receive one share of Johnson Controls International (the new company) and own in aggregate 56% of JCI; or $34.88/share in cash to opt out of the deal. The old Johnson Controls Inc. would also receive $3.9 billion in aggregate cash from Tyco International, financed through a bank facility.The rationale behind the merger, as explained by Johnson Controls' management team, was ""to become a leading global multi-industrial company […]. With its world-class fire and security businesses, Tyco aligns with and enhances the Johnson Controls buildings platform [which includes HVAC, power solutions and energy storage] and further positions all of [the companies'] businesses for global growth.""What the merger did, in short, was to help turn Johnson Controls into a more complete-package building solution provider than it used to be before, without the Tyco portfolio and with the car seat business (on the latter subject, see next bullet).The two graphs below, provided by Johnson Controls, best illustrates how the two legacy businesses complement each other.Source: Company presentations- Adient spinoff: the last main piece of the transformation came with the spinoff of Johnson Control's lower margin, lower growth Automotive Seating and Interior business in October 2015. The new company, which basically manufactures $17 billion per year worth of car seats, is now called Adient (NASDAQ:ADNT), and trades as an independent public company. In my view, this unit did not have much in common with the building systems piece of the business, and it seems logical to me that it should have been spun off or divested.With the addition of Tyco's security and fire business and without the car seat manufacturer, the new Johnson Controls International became a company more focused on building technology and solutions (over three-fourths of total revenues) and energy storage (a.k.a. the batteries division). See chart below.Source: Company's presentationMy take on the ""new"" Johnson ControlsThe transformation, in my view, will be highly beneficial to Johnson Controls and its shareholders. The merger and spin-off creates noticeable benefits from a strategic and synergistic perspectives. Lots of buzz words, I know. But rarely do I see M&A activity make as much sense as it did in this case.With Tyco's security and fire portfolio, Johnson Controls is now able to offer a full suite of building solutions that range from heating and cooling systems to lighting control to intrusion and fire detection and alarm. Whereas most mergers or acquisitions attempt to create value largely through cost reduction and consolidation of redundant activities, I believe Johnson Controls has the opportunity to drive sizable top-line upside by using a unified sales channel to cross-sell and upsell its new portfolio of products and services.In fact, the company shared for the first time last month its expectations for extra revenue opportunities from the merger: $500 million by FY20. This does not sound like much at all, considering that the amount would represent a meager 1.5% annual top-line upside from FY16 levels - while organic growth alone is projected at 3% to 4%. I believe the figure could go up over time, as the merger integration process evolves and management is clearer on what the company can reasonably achieve.The $85-$100 million in EBIT that could be generated from the extra $500 million in revs are in addition to the $650 million in run-rate savings that the company expected to realize by FY20 as of early 2016, plus the $100 million in additional productivity opportunities identified since then. All accounted for, the Johnson Controls/Tyco merger is currently expected to generate $1.10 in EPS upside by FY20.Below is how management sees EPS evolving over the next four years.Source: Company's presentationHere's an intriguing thought: $1.10 in extra EPS valued at the current forward P/E of nearly 16x adds up to almost $18/share in price appreciation. When the Tyco merger was announced on January 25th of last year, JCI was trading at $30.60 and climbed to $43.66 today. The $13 share appreciation over the past 12 months is $5/share lower than the ""intrinsic"" $18/share value of the identified merger synergies.This means that the Street is discounting by a factor of nearly 12% ($5/share in skepticism divided by $43.66) the company's ability to deliver on the cost-cutting and extra revenue initiatives that management has already identified and committed to. While conservativeness alone might justify such a discount, I believe the $1.10 might even prove to be a ""low-ball estimate"", suggesting that shares could reach the low- to mid-$50 range as the transformation winds down, over the next 12-18 months.Below is a table that illustrates how solid Johnson Controls looks, from a fundamentals perspective, against the median of its peer group of mid-to-mega cap industrials names. Percent price change is over the previous 12 weeks:Source: DM Martins Research, using data from Zacks downloaded earlier in January 2017What I don't love about JCIAmid the opportunities and potential upside, I see short- and mid-term risks associated with cash management.The company currently holds only $2 billion is cash, $12.8 billion in debt, and has a credit facility of $3 billion available. Per the most recent analyst day presentation (December 2016), management believes that Johnson Controls is ""significantly liquid"" and that ""annual cash generation comfortably supports anticipated funding needs"".However, the company booked over $1 billion in tax expenses in 2016 as a result of the M&A activity (mostly repatriation costs associated with the Adient spinoff) that is expected to result in cash outflows in FY17. In addition, nearly $1 billion of the company's debt is maturing within the next two years. This is not to mention potential restructuring costs and outflows that usually result from the cost-cutting initiatives.On the plus side, Johnson Control has been a consistent producer of FCF (free cash flow), having generated $650 million and $460 million in FY16 and FY15, respectively. In FY15 and FY14, Tyco produced a sizable $300 million and $540 million in FCF, respectively. And the expected synergies could help to boost these numbers further in the future."
4047918,24018,2017-02-21T13:54:55-05:00,"A good bull run flushed out many previous discounts from the market.Johnson Controls remains a solid industrial company, and the stock remains reasonably priced.Uncertainty around its recent automotive products spin-off, and Tyco International acquisition, appear to be holding the shares down.The stock may be consolidating now, but it is poised to move much higher in late 2017 and 2018.","Finding value in rising markets takes patience and diligence. Much of the merchandise is trading above fair value estimates. Nonetheless, a few discounts always remain.I believe one such discount is Johnson Controls International PLC (NYSE:JCI).Johnson Controls is a global, diversified industrial manufacturing company. It is in the midst of substantive corporate transition. Uncertainty associated with this transition appears to be holding the shares back, at least for now. Last September, Johnson Controls completed a reverse acquisition with Tyco International, augmenting its Building Technologies & Solutions segment. Then in October, JCI spun off its automotive operations unit into an independently-traded listed company.A chart from the December 2016 Investor Day presentation update offers a pictorial overview:Johnson Controls is a company on the move. This creates both risk and opportunity.An Investment ThesisLet's begin by outlining an overarching investment thesis for owning JCI shares.Next, we will review the financials, forward business trends, and stock valuation.Financial OverviewBalance SheetWhen evaluating a business, I like to start with the balance sheet.Historically, Johnson Controls has owned a tight balance sheet; however, the recent acquisition and spin-off somewhat muddied the waters. Nonetheless, core measures remain sound.Liquidity is adequate. The company has access to short-term credit and commercial paper arrangements. Currently, $3 billion revolving credit facilities are unused and available through 2020. Only $377 million cash is on the balance sheet; just $0.40 per share. However, as 2017 progresses, this figure will improve. A 0.96 current ratio is acceptable.Debt is manageable. At year-end 2016, the debt-to-capital ratio was 40%. Management targets D2Cap ranging between 35% and 40%. Total debt and net debt is $13.25 billion and $12.87 billion, respectively.A 3.8x interest coverage ratio indicates Johnson Controls can service its debt easily. Leverage, as measured by net debt / adjusted EBITDA was 3.3x. This quarterly mark is likely to be the high-water mark for this metric. Leverage should ease through remainder of 2017.ROIC is a bit low, but it's early in the game. Using management's outlook, I estimated 2017 (Johnson Controls' fiscal year ends September 30) return-on-invested-capital to be 9.8%. Assuming management integrates the new businesses successfully, improved returns in 2018 are likely.Goodwill and Intangible Assets are high. I don't care for the fact goodwill and IA comprise 57% of the company's total assets. Continued and careful balance sheet monitoring is warranted. I want to see management build total shareholder equity via ""hard"" asset growth and good debt management.On the other hand, Johnson Controls has but 4% pension and post-retirement debt as a function of total debt. I believe a figure above 20% triggers a yellow flag.Profit and Cash FlowRecent corporate actions makes prior-year comparisons difficult.Management offered detailed FY 2017 targets. EBIT margins are projected to improve to 11.5% to 12.1% from a baseline 11.0%. Revenue is expected to come in ~$30 billion. At the midpoint, EBIT may be forecast at $3.54 billion; applying interest expense and the projected tax rate, Johnson Controls is expected to earn ~$2.66 a share.First quarter 2017 operating earnings were $0.53, beating the Street by a penny. The earnings cadence is back-end loaded. Evidently, this spooked investors; the earnings beat was treated like a miss.Historically, JCI experiences lower first-half earnings. These accelerate as the year progresses. The following ""EPS Phasing"" slide reaffirmed the point:Significant post-acquisition synergies are expected. Here again, management outlined specifics in the FY 1Q 2017 earnings presentation material.Please note these savings ramp up in the second half of the fiscal year, too.2017 forex headwinds will total $0.08 per share. That's about a 3% hit to earnings. I'm of the opinion a strong dollar isn't a ""forever"" situation. Today's headwind becomes tomorrow's tailwind.Meanwhile, 1Q 2017 cash flow took one-time hits. Transition costs and a one-time $1.2 billion tax bill on the automotive operations spin-off comprised most of the damage. Adjusted figures remove the one-off items.In 2017, Johnson Controls seeks to generate $2.1 billion adjusted Free Cash Flow. The -$0.3 adjusted 1Q figure is notwithstanding. Adjusted net income is projected to be ~$2.5 billion. Meeting these objectives will indicate a clear signal the company can earn profits in cash.By 2020, management expects the company to convert 90% of its profits into Free Cash Flow. FY 2017 is a transition year.Forward Business TrendsEffectively, purchasing Johnson Controls stock is a bid on the future of the construction and power industries. I contend both segments looks promising.During the December Analyst Day meeting, management provided investors with an excellent presentation explaining their vision for the future. It begins with two primary business platforms.The underlying business drivers are several identified mega-trends:Demographics, Urbanization, Energy, Sustainability, and Digitization.The Johnson and Tyco combination affirm the platform for deep leadership positions in a growing, increasingly digitized world. The worldwide rise of the middle class, demand for environmental stewardship, and the global migration from rural areas to cities fuel these trends.Johnson Controls plans to focus efforts on China, Asia and other developing markets, while driving investment into new technologies.This includes ""smart"" buildings (requiring IoT: internet-of-things), integrated infrastructure, and power storage. The company asserts 60% of total global power generation is consumed by buildings and automobiles.The Johnson-Tyco overlay offers the new company an inside track to nearly all aspects of building products and management systems.Turning to Power Solutions, I was surprised to see the length of the prospective ""tail"" on the traditional automotive battery market. Indeed, Johnson Controls is the undisputed automotive battery leader - well-positioned to leverage its size and span into new power storage technologies, too.Investors should note Power Systems' margins are double those for the Buildings & Technologies segment.Stock ValuationIf convinced a company is a good investment, there remains one additional critical piece of the puzzle: do the shares trade at a discount or premium to Fair Value Estimates?For this exercise, I'll begin with several remarks and conclude with a series of F.A.S.T. graphs.My strong opinion, evidenced over decades of experience, is stock prices follow earnings and cash flow. Therefore, evaluating historical multiples thereof is key to understanding whether shares should be purchased.In addition, careful examination of management's outlook, coupled with an investor's ability to discern management's probability to fulfill the outlook, map the best opportunity to pick a well-run business and an undervalued security.Please find following a series of F.A.S.T. graphs. It is important to note Johnson Controls' historical multiples are a rough guide only; it is a company in transition. However, the long-term benchmarks do retain considerable value, as we'll find below.First, a 14-year chart highlighting price-and-operating earnings:Note the long-term earnings multiple is 15.8x (the blue box). This is a plausible starting point for several reasons.Looking out to FY 2018-19, and applying a 15x multiple, one can defend an 18-month FVE between $46 and $52.Next, a similar chart but focusing upon operating cash flow:The 14-year trimmed average P/CF multiple is 13.5x. Lowering it to a conservative 10x (the pink line), we still see JCI trades at a discount. It's a ~$51 stock. Indeed, that's a 35% factor-of-safety versus the long-term ""old"" JCI price-to-cash flow ratio.Off a ~$42 per share base, a $51 bid suggests a year-and-a-half return over well over 20%, including the 2.4% dividend.Rounding out the exercise: a quick PEG check. Management forecasts 12% to 15% EPS growth though 2020. Presuming we accept the figure, the PEG may be computed as follows:Therefore, the PEG is 15.1 / 12 to 15.1 / 15 or ~1.25 to 1.00.This ratio indicates an acceptable investment.ConclusionsJohnson Controls International is a good investment candidate that warrants further consideration.Premising accelerating global economic growth, this industrial sector stock is well-positioned. Post-corporate actions, its current focus is building products and systems and power solutions, primarily automotive batteries. Both segments appear to have solid runways. Demographics, urbanization, energy demand, sustainability, and digitization are likely mega-trend drivers.Johnson Controls owns a sound balance sheet, sporting more strength than weakness. Management is committed to maintaining at least a BBB+ investment-grade credit rating.Looking ahead, the company expects strong operating cash flow and free cash flow conversion. In turn, this sets up smart stock repurchases and good dividend growth prospects.I was impressed with the granularity of management's mid-term financial outlook. Rarely do investors see such a level of detail. This reinforced my original investment thesis; indeed, Johnson Controls has a history of meeting investor promises.Currently, the shares yield 2.4%.Importantly, JCI appears to be trading below this author's fair value estimates. Using conservative operating earnings or cash flow multiples, the stock appears to be worth ~$50 per share within the next 18 months. The latest bid is about $42.Please do you own careful due diligence before making any investment decision. This article is not a recommendation to buy or sell any stock. Good luck with all your 2017 investments."
4133500,24992,2017-12-22T12:50:34-05:00,"Shares are trading at a 15% discount to the overall market.Dividend has increased an average 6% per year over the last six years.If we assume the same dividend growth rate going forward, our growth model shows a 8.58% total annual return on the shares to 2021.ChartMasterPro upward target price of $42.00.","The shares of Johnson Controls International PLC (JCI) are down about 11% over the past twelve months, and the current price represents an excellent entry point for prospective shareholders. The merger with Tyco International created a global leader in building and energy storage solutions. Although the market has seemingly not approved of the merger, the combination is a good one that will deliver decent returns to shareholders over the next few years in my estimation. I’ll go through my reasoning below by modelling what I think is a reasonable future price based on dividend growth for the merged company, and by making an appeal to authority. I’ll conclude with a discussion of the relative merits of this stock versus the overall market.Obviously in a situation like this, the financial history of the pre-merged company is less relevant than that of a company that has not undergone such a significant financial engineering event. That said, I think it’s worth highlighting a few key facts about the capital structure. I want to look at the balance sheet, as it’s usually the source of risk post merger.The debt load has obviously grown, but the vast majority of it (67.5%) is due after 2021. This suggests that there’s little risk of a credit or a solvency crisis anytime soon. Additionally, the current interest rate of 3.9% is sustainable, suggesting that the debt used for the merger is not excessively priced. For these reasons, I’m less concerned about the financial impact of the merger than I otherwise might be.In the absence of a long history, the ability to forecast is particularly important. Whenever I forecast, I engage in a ceteris paribus assumption, meaning that I hold all constant but one variable. I consider the dividend to be the most significant “driver” of value here, so I’ll model it while holding everything else constant.Over the past six years, the dividend per share has grown at a CAGR of just over 6%. I consider this to be a reasonable expectation of the future growth in the dividend per share, so I’ll model this growth rate. When I do so, I infer a CAGR for the shares of about 8.5%. I consider this to be a very reasonable rate of return, given the risk present. Additionally, most of this return is from dividends, which are obviously a more reliable source of investor returns than stock price.As confident as I am in my forecast, I must acknowledge that there are some investors who are more well informed than I am. When given the opportunity, it would be wise to follow in the footsteps of these investors. With that in mind, I’d like to point out that last month, two insiders (George Oliver and William Jackson) have put just over $1.7 million of their own capital into the company. In my view, it makes sense to ride on the coattails of people who are, by definition, more well informed than the rest of us. If they are willing to put their personal capital to work, the risk of me following along is much reduced in my estimation.As per our ChartMasterPro Daily Trade Model, the trend for JCI would turn bullish with a daily close above $38.00. This would signal a bullish breakout from an Ascending Triangle on the daily charts. From here, we see the shares climbing to the $42.00 level over the next three months.We will buy JCI call options that will provide us with approximately 13x leverage on our long trade. Our initial stop-loss exit signal will be a daily close below $37.00.For investors in the shares, we recommend that you hold for three months or $42.00, whichever comes first. For longer-term investors (years, not months), we believe JCI is a solid addition to any dividend growth portfolio over the next four years.Investing is a relativistic game, meaning that we must buy X and sell Y. In my view, it makes the most sense to buy the cheapest “X” while actively avoiding expensive “Y.” At the moment, the newly merged company represents the best risk reward relationship. The shares of Johnson Controls are trading at a 15% discount to the overall market. In the relative game of investing, this is a significant perfect storm in my view. The company has the potential to continue to grow shareholder wealth at a decent rate, while the shares trade at a significant discount to the overall market. In my view, we’d be wise to buy at these levels before price and value inevitably collide."
4037054,67985,2017-01-17T05:45:00-05:00,"Investors have shown disappointment with the “new” tax-inverted company so far as shares trade below their tax-inversion cost basis of $45.69 despite the President Trump “infrastructure trade.”.
        Investors, likely awaiting news on cost-related synergies and other non-tax related Tyco acquisition benefits, will receive earnings news relating to the Tyco acquisition soon.
        We expect an investor “prepare for the worst” but get a “better-than-expected” result reaction to the company’s next earnings announcement in early February 2017.
        The company’s Tyco acquisition will reduce taxes, allow for cost saving synergies, product cross selling opportunities, and complementary products/services.
        The company’s transformation to higher margin businesses will reward long-term investors with share price appreciation and likely annual dividend increases.","Although Johnson Controls' (NYSE:JCI) tax inversion acquisition of Tyco International (""TYC"") closed as recently as late 2016, so far there has been a disappointing investor response to the ""new"" tax-inverted JCI. In fact, JCI's shares are currently trading below their new tax-inversion cost basis of $45.69 despite other industrial-related stocks trading higher on the President Trump ""infrastructure trade"" of late 2016 into 2017. Perhaps investors are waiting to determine whether JCI's integration of TYC's businesses is on track with respect to cost-related synergies and other non-tax related benefits of such acquisition. With the company set to announce just weeks from now its first full quarter earnings with TYC being integrated into JCI, we will soon find out investors' response to the initial results of the newly combined companies. Given that investors are adverse to uncertainty, we expect an investor ""prepare for the worst"" but get a ""better-than-expected"" result reaction to the company's next earnings announcement in early February 2017.The question that JCI's next earnings report will begin to answer is whether all of the company's transformative activities (including the late 2016 spin-off of its automotive seating and interiors businesses into a United Kingdom based company) in recent years will begin to show results. The company's most recent quarterly results in late 2016 revealed revenue and earnings before special items that exceeded estimates. Profitability improved in the quarter across all of its businesses due to cost-reduction initiatives, restructuring savings and operational efficiencies drove the company's double-digit earnings per share growth. Although such quarter only included partial TYC's results, we believe that JCI will succeed in obtaining additional cost reductions, restructuring savings and operational efficiencies to drive increased revenue/earnings growth for years to come. With this in mind, we recommend investors consider a partial position in the company's shares on any overall market weakness going into the next earnings announcement.The company's merger with TYC and spin-off of its automotive seating and interiors businesses as part of Adient plc (NYSE:ADNT) were its most recent and significant transformational actions to exit low-margin industrial businesses to focus on less cyclical higher margin markets that are experiencing higher growth rates. Aside from the company's transformative efforts, it has also been engaged in an ongoing cost savings program. With much of such transformative activities behind it, now is the time for JCI to show that the steps it has taken are able to put it on the road to achieving consistent revenue/earnings growth. If the company is able to record more consistent revenue/earnings growth following the JCI/TYC combination, investors will reward the company by assigning a higher price-to-earnings multiple for its shares that is in line with the already higher price-to-earnings ratios assigned for its competitors' shares. At the outset, we note that the combined JCI/TYC expects at least $150 million in annual taxes and $500 million in other synergies over the next three years.JCI offers products that include HVAC equipment and controls, automotive interiors and battery manufacturing, while TYC offers fire-safety and security products and services. A now joined JCI/TYC will benefit by combining each company's offerings of complementary product/services with customer and geography overlap along with significant revenue and cost synergies. The combined companies will also drive growth through product cross-selling and complementary distribution networks. Clearly then, there are benefits to the combined companies in addition to cost synergies and a lower tax rate through the now-completed tax inversion. As JCI moves forward to integrate TYC, it will also continue to focus on its market-leading building business that includes its heating and air conditioning equipment for commercial buildings, and on its devices for monitoring and regulating electricity usage, temperature, fire safety and security. The company will also focus on its highly profitable automotive battery business that will benefit from fuel economy regulations due to its advanced lead-acid battery technology.We believe that investors should consider a partial position in JCI's shares ahead of the next earnings announcement during a overall market selloff. If investors react negatively to the company's next earnings announcement (which we do not expect), we believe investors should then establish a full position. As a JCI investor waits for the benefits from the company's transformative activities to come to fruition, they will collect a 2.50 percent dividend that is likely to be increased on an annual basis. With the ADNT spin-off now behind it and the TYC acquisition closed and integration ongoing, JCI will likely show more reliable revenue/earnings growth over the intermediate and long term, and the company's shares will be assigned a price-to-earnings ratio more consistent with its competitors.Our viewAs our article title indicates, JCI is in a ""show me"" mode with respect to investors going into its next earnings report. As noted above, investors are risk averse to uncertainty, In particular, investors are even more risk averse to companies such as JCI that have taken multiple transformative activities with a goal of transforming towards higher growth businesses in higher growth markets. There are many moving parts to the transformation that JCI has undertaken and any misstep could adversely affect its results. We believe, however, that shareholders will benefit from the TYC transaction if JCI can achieve its stated goal of saving at least $150 million in taxes and $500 million in additional synergies in three years. In our experience, however, such cost savings targets and additional synergies goals set out by JCI tend to be understated targets that an acquiring company generally will exceed.A combination of JCI's products, including HVAC equipment and controls, automotive interiors and battery manufacturing, with TYC's fire-safety and security products and services is an advantageous combination. As noted above, the newly joined companies had each offered complementary product and services with customer and geography overlap along with significant revenue and cost synergies. A now-combined JCI/TYC will drive growth by the cross-selling of products and complementary distribution networks. As JCI's transformation shows results, it will then be able to focus on future technology trends, such as the energy efficiency of office buildings and energy efficient battery technology. Finally, as the integration of TYC into JCI moves forward JCI's profit margins will increase and its forward price-to-earnings ratio will increase to be in line with its competitors.Earnings estimates for JCI are $2.69 for fiscal year 2017 and $3.10 for its fiscal year 2018. (We should note that estimates have fallen for both years in recent months.) JCI's shares are trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 16.25 based on fiscal year 2017 earnings estimates and 14.10 based on fiscal year 2018 estimates. While we believe investors could buy JCI shares now, we also believe that since overall markets are at 52-week highs, potential JCI investors could buy shares in the $40.30 to $43.40 price range (a price to earnings ratio ranging from 13.00 to 14.00 based on fiscal year 2018 earnings) Over the long term, a combined JCI/TYC and other transformative actions will reward long-term investors with increasing dividends, substantial share repurchases and share price appreciation.(Click ""follow"" next to our contributor name at the top of this article to follow our upcoming articles on JCI, dividend growth stocks and more.)"
4054356,67985,2017-03-12T21:00:00-04:00,"Shares have languished post tax inversion, as investors have not been impressed with the company's revenue/earnings results since its Tyco acquisition.Investors are likely waiting to see whether Johnson Controls fully realizes its stated benefits from its integration of Tyco's businesses including cost/productivity synergies.The company is exploring the sale of its non-core safety gear business for $2 billion, which would allow it to strengthen its balance sheet.It is in advanced talks with potential acquirers such as Honeywell and 3M, and could close a divestiture of its safety gear business by the end of March 2017.We see the safety gear divestiture as a net positive as Johnson Controls transforms to higher-margin core businesses that will drive share price appreciation and dividend increases.","Johnson Controls International plc (NYSE:JCI) shares have languished below their new tax-inversion cost basis of $45.69 ever since its tax-inversion acquisition of Tyco International (TYC) closed in late 2016. To date, investors have not been impressed with the company's results since its recent acquisition of TYC. The lack of a positive investor reaction to JCI's combination with TYC may be a simple matter of investors waiting to determine whether the company's integration of TYC's businesses is on track with respect to cost-related/productivity synergies and other non-tax related benefits of such acquisition. While investors are waiting for positive results to emerge from JCI's acquisition of TYC, the company is rumored to be taking additional steps to put itself on a stable foundation to drive more consistent revenue/earnings growth over the long term. For example, the financial media reported that JCI is exploring the sale of its safety gear business, Scott Safety. Such reports indicate that the Scott Safety business could sell for up to $2 billion and allow JCI to divest itself of a non-core business and strengthen its balance sheet after the TYC acquisition. For investors not fully familiar with JCI, it is a manufacturer of products ranging from automobile batteries to heating equipment.Financial media reports indicate that the company is in advanced talks with potential acquirers, including Honeywell International Inc. (NYSE:HON) and 3M Company (NYSE:MMM). (All three of these companies refused to comment on the confidential talks.) If JCI is able to close a satisfactory deal, such deal could close before the end of March 2017. The company's Scott Safety business manufactures respiratory and protective equipment and safety devices for firefighters, industrial workers, police squads and the military. According to media reports, investors and industrial conglomerates have begun to view safety equipment manufacturers as desirable assets due to an improved economic environment that is likely to spur demand for such equipment. As such, JCI is likely to be able to sell its Scott Safety business at a desirable price. In addition, by divesting such non-core business, the company will be able to focus on driving revenue growth in its core businesses, given that the latest quarterly organic sales growth fell short of guidance due to weakness in its building technologies and solutions businesses. We see the balance sheet strengthening divestiture of such non-core safety business as a net positive for JCI and its shareholders. With this in mind, let us take a look at the company's latest earnings results.JCI's latest quarterly results showed that it recorded sales of $7.1 billion, a slight increase from the year-ago quarter on a reported basis. The company experienced organic sales growth of 1 percent that was partially offset by adverse currency effects, mergers & acquisitions and lead pass-through pricing. Earnings per share was $0.39. Adjusted non-GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.53 per share, an increase from $0.48. In regard to such results, JCI admitted it was not where it wanted to be with respect to growth, but noted that it was ahead of its plan on both margin and expansion of its earnings. The company, however, remains committed to meeting its full-year 2017 goals and is in the process of developing a new strategic plan for a combined JCI/TYC. The company will also continue to evaluate its business portfolio and institute a disciplined capital allocation strategy that balances its investments for future growth and returning capital to shareholders. With respect to its latest quarter, JCI recognized better-than-expected profitability in both its buildings and power businesses. The company was also able to begin to realize its TYC acquisition-related cost synergies, which were slightly ahead of its cost savings plans.JCI sees the non-residential market it sells into continuing to improve. In particular, it saw institutional markets continue to be strong, with positive order activity particularly in the healthcare space. The company expects cross-selling activity with the acquired TYC businesses as continuing to increase. Across the Asia-Pacific region, JCI expects organic growth in its buildings business in the low- to mid-single digit range, while it expects its power business to grow above 20 percent on an organic basis. The company also continues to expand its profitability in this region with several hundred basis points of margin expansion. The integration within its Hitachi joint venture continues to contribute stronger margins for the region as well. With respect to its overall recent quarterly earnings, JCI's organic sales increased about 1 percent as a modest decrease in its buildings business sales was more than offset by increased volume and a favorable mix in its power business. The company also recognized continued profitability and EBITA of 10 percent year over year on a reported basis when adjusting for adverse currency effects, due to strong execution across all of its businesses.JCI has been spending an extensive amount of time with its business unit leaders across the company to develop strategies for each respective business unit. The company, with some early order wins under its belt, sees strong future revenue synergy opportunities for the combined JCI/TYC. With respect to cost synergies arising out of the TYC acquisition, the company expects to record $250-300 million in cost synergies and productivity savings in 2017. In JCI's latest quarter, it recorded about $50 million in synergies and productivity, or about $0.05 on an earnings per share basis. The company expects to record a similar cost/productivity synergy amount in second quarter 2017. (It also expects $0.07 cost/productivity synergies in third quarter 2017 and $0.08 in fourth quarter 2017.) As JCI moves to integrate TYC into its organization, it is guided by four goals: 1) grow; 2) integrate; 3) change; and 4) operate. With this in mind, it expects organic sales for fiscal second quarter 2017 to increase 2 percent and earnings per share to be at $0.48-0.50 per share (including the above-noted $0.05 cost synergies), representing a 7-11 percent increase. JCI reaffirmed its full-year 2017 guidance of $2.60-2.75, representing a 13-19 percent increase.JCI's acquisition of TYC and spin-off of its automotive seating and interiors businesses as part of Adient plc (NYSE:ADNT) are passing further into the rear-view mirror as it transforms to exit low-margin industrial businesses to focus on less cyclical higher-margin markets that are experiencing higher growth rates. Its rumored Scott Safety business divestiture noted above for a likely $2 billion is a continuation of the company's transformation efforts that will strengthen its balance sheet with proceeds from such divestiture. The divestiture of Scott Safety also allows JCI to focus on its core business units. In addition to its transformation efforts, the company is also continuing to engage in a cost synergy/productivity savings program. As many investors may know, JCI offers products that include HVAC equipment and controls, automotive interiors and battery manufacturing, while the acquired TYC offers and security products and services. A now joined JCI/TYC will benefit by combining each company's offerings of complementary product/services with customer and geography overlap, along with significant revenue and cost synergies. The combined companies will also drive growth through product cross-selling and complementary distribution networks.With JCI continuing its effort to integrate TYC, it will also continue to focus on its market-leading building business that includes its heating and air conditioning equipment for commercial buildings, and on its devices for monitoring and regulating electricity usage, temperature and security. The company will also focus on its highly profitable automotive battery business that will benefit from fuel economy regulations due to its advanced lead-acid battery technology. We believe investors should consider JCI shares during the next overall market sell-off, and especially under $40 a share. As an investor waits for the company to fully realize benefits from its transformative activities, they will collect about a 2.50 percent dividend that is likely to be increased. With major transformative activities behind it, JCI will also be able to show more consistent revenue/earnings growth over the long term, and the shares will be assigned a price-to-earnings ratio more consistent with those of its competitors.Our viewJCI's rumored divestiture of its coveted Scott Safety business is the latest in the company's turnaround efforts to position itself towards more consistent long-term revenue/earnings growth. As we have noted in past JCI articles, investors remain risk averse to uncertainty, and even more risk averse to companies such as JCI that have undertaken multiple transformative activities with a goal of transforming towards higher-growth businesses in higher-growth markets. Investors understand that there are many moving parts to the transformation that the company has undertaken, and any misstep could adversely affect its results. We believe, however, that shareholders will benefit from the TYC transaction if JCI can achieve its stated cost/productivity synergy goals. In our experience, a company's stated cost savings/productivity goals tend to be understated conservative targets that an acquiring company generally will easily exceed.A combination of JCI's products (including HVAC equipment/controls and battery manufacturing) with TYC's products (including building security products/services) presents an advantageous combination. As stated above, the combined companies each offer complementary product/services with customer and geography overlap, along with strong revenue/cost synergies. A now-combined JCI/TYC will drive growth through product cross-selling and complementary distribution networks. As JCI's transformation shows results, it will then focus on future technology trends, such as the energy efficiency of office buildings and energy efficient battery technology. As also noted above, as the company integrates TYC into its organization, JCI's profit margins will increase and its price-to-earnings ratio will expand and be more comparable with that of its competitors.Earnings estimates for JCI are $2.66 for fiscal year 2017 and $3.08 for fiscal year 2018. (We should note that estimates have remained relatively steady for both years in recent months.) Shares are trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 15.50 based on fiscal year 2017 earnings estimates and 13.40 based on fiscal year 2018 estimates. While we believe investors could buy JCI shares now, we also believe that since the overall markets are at 52-week highs, investors could buy shares below $40 a share if a strong overall market sell-off occurs. Over the long term, a combined JCI/TYC, a balance sheet-strengthening divestiture of the company's Scott Safety business and other transformative actions will reward long-term investors with increasing dividends, substantial share repurchases and share price appreciation.Click ""Follow"" next to our contributor name at the top of this article to follow our upcoming articles on JCI and more."
4008935,102253,2016-09-28T11:15:30-04:00,"Johnson Controls International is spinning off its automotive seats and interiors business, the largest such business in the world.The spinoff was originally intended to be tax-free, but is now taxable as a result of issues arising from the recently completed Johnson Controls merger with Tyco.Tax impacts, business risks and typical spinoff trading patterns could put downward pressure on the stock after the spin.","IntroductionJohnson Controls International (NYSE:JCI) announced the spinoff of its automotive seating and interiors business on July 24th, 2015 and planned for the transaction to be structured as a typical tax free spinoff for JCI shareholders. Subsequent to that announcement, JCI entered into a merger agreement with Tyco International PLC that required it to restructure the spinoff.While the details are too complex to get into here, the merger between Tyco and Johnson controls effectively removed the possibility of a tax-free spinoff for the seating and interiors business (subsequently named Adient). That's the bad news. The good news is that the spinoff plan was further revised to re-locate Adient's headquarters to London, a move that will cut its future tax rate substantially. The Wall Street Journal reported Adient's tax rate should drop to 10% to 12%, down from parent JCI's tax rate of 17%.BusinessIn the most recent prospectus filed on September 20, 2016, Adient describes itself as ""the world's largest seating supplier"" by volume, citing IHS Automotive. Specifically, the company notes it ""…designs, manufactures and markets a full range of seating systems and components for passenger cars, commercial vehicles and light trucks, including vans, pick-up trucks and sport/crossover utility vehicles. Adient also supplies high performance seating systems to the international motorsports industry through its award winning RECARO brand of products. Adient operates approximately 230 wholly- and majority-owned manufacturing or assembly facilities, with operations in 33 countries. Additionally, Adient has partially-owned affiliates in China, Asia, Europe and North America.""Investors should read the prospectus for all the details, I won't rehash them here.Being the largest supplier of anything automotive is a real advantage given OEM customers' penchant for driving down costs and requiring complex global logistical compliance from their suppliers in order to meet the OEM's production schedules. Adient's market position within the large automotive supplier industry merits a closer look at the transaction.Valuation - Expected Price at DebutOne of the tricky aspects of evaluating spinoffs is that we don't know what the valuation is going to be until shortly before the stock is distributed and it begins trading. Although Adient shares won't be distributed and begin regular trading for over a month from now, investors can get a head start on the market and estimate the valuation today using available information. This article will look at both a) the price I expect Adient to begin trading at and also b) the price at which Adient provides an attractive risk-reward tradeoff.Looking at the valuation both of these ways is particularly helpful with spinoffs because often times after a spinoff begins trading there are technical reasons for the price to fall as I wrote about here.In the valuation table below, we can see Adient will have approximately 93.5M shares outstanding based on the disclosed ratio of Adient shares to be distributed relative to JCI shares (after taking into account the recent closing of the Tyco merger). Further, we see debt and cash are expected to be $3.6B and $643M respectively after the spinoff is completed. Tying in some additional pro forma financial information from the Selected Financial Information table at the end of this article, we can estimate EBITDA for the 2016 fiscal year at just under $1B.Although Adient will be the largest seat supplier to the global auto OEM industry, its margins are small even by auto supplier standards.With a pro forma gross margin of 10.6% and an estimated EBITDA margin of 5.6% for the 2016 fiscal year, Adient trails a broad group of twenty auto suppliers who show current gross margins and EBITDA margins of 17.7% and 11.2% respectively. Combined with relatively flat growth and concerns that overall industry auto sales are near the top of the current cycle, it's reasonable to expect some downward pressure on the valuation. The benefits from company's relatively low capital requirements, the anticipated long-term tax savings from the move offshore (which will deliver more cash flow to the equity*), and the company's plan to pay a regular dividend following the spinoff should somewhat offset the downward pressure.Looking at the net impact of these factors, it's reasonable to expect Adient to launch at an enterprise value roughly in line with the median peer group EBITDA multiple of 6.9x.(*) In the short term, the tax savings will be more than offset by the cash interest expense of the $3.5B of debt incurred as part of the spinoffBased on this approach, I would expect trading to begin at approximately $40 per share. As the valuation table below shows, $40 per share represents just over 6.8x 2016 estimated EBITDA.Valuation: Post-Transaction Downward PressureA common spinoff pattern that causes post-transaction selling could be amplified in this transaction because the spinoff is taxable to JCI shareholders receiving the stock, whereas most other spinoffs are tax-free. As such, the stock could see higher levels of post-transaction selling as holders look to generate cash to offset any tax liability.Other fundamental risks loom large. Relatively low margins and auto market cyclicality are two such risks that could put downward pressure on the stock. The latter risk is especially important in light of Adient's 3.0x net leverage against its 3.5x covenant. The table below shows Adient's post-transaction debt and related important ratios.Given these factors, a move down toward the lower end of the valuation range for comparable automotive suppliers is possible. At a multiple of just over 5.4x EBITDA, Adient would trade in-line with six of the previously referenced twenty comparable companies. Those six companies trade at or below a multiple of 5.5x EBITDA (Recall the group of twenty as a whole trades at a median of 6.9x EBITDA).The table below shows Adient's valuation at $25.00 per share or about 5.4X EBITDA:Conclusion:Adient plc could debut at a share price of close to $40 per share based on an automotive supply comparable group median of 6.9x EBITDA. Investors looking at the stock as a long idea or those who hold spinoff stock should consider the following fundamental risks at that level:* Lower than average margins;* Flat growth;* Net leverage of 3.0x against a covenant of 3.5x* Market is potentially situated at the top of the overall auto sales cycleIn addition to the usual selling pressure that many spinoffs experience, Adient may also experience additional pressure as a result of the taxability of the transaction.To the extent Adient debuts and / or trades down to the low end of the comparable range with a stock price closer to $25 per share, the valuation at that level presents a more suitable risk-reward.Transaction Notes:Record Date: October 19, 2016 (When-issued trading should begin on or shortly after this date)Distribution Date: October 31, 2016Ticker: ADNTBecause the spinoff is taxable, whereas most spinoffs are tax-free, ADNT could see higher levels of post-transaction selling as holders look to generate cash to offset any tax liability.Supplemental Data"
3990765,23899,2016-07-22T16:09:52-04:00,"According to this Energy Efficiency Indicator survey, 72% of participants expect to increase their investment in energy efficiency and renewable energy in the next twelve months.Both developed countries and emerging markets will also be investing heavily in efficiency and renewable energy in the coming years.JCI is perfectly positioned to cash in on this trend.","By Sara NunnallyJohnson Controls, Inc. (NYSE:JCI) is headquartered in my backyard: Milwaukee, Wisconsin.It's a company focused heavily on efficiency, and it's got its finger on the pulse of what the corporate world wants. And it turns out, the corporate world wants what JCI is selling.In its latest Energy Efficiency Indicator survey, JCI found that 72% of the 1,243 participants said their companies are anticipating increasing their investment in energy efficiency and renewable energy in the next twelve months.That's a massive number, and it's also a massive increase compared to just four years ago. In 2013, JCI's Energy Efficiency Indicator survey found that only 42% of those surveyed had planned to increase investment.And take a look at this map:Emerging markets are going to be investing heavily in efficiency and renewable energy, but developed economies aren't sitting on the sidelines, either.I think the efficiency sectors is going to be an interesting area over the next couple of years, and there are several different areas that could be of note to investors.According to the survey, heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) improvements were the most popular improvement over the past 12 months, followed by energy-focused education programs, building control improvements, water efficiency improvements, onsite renewable energy and building systems integration.Looking into the future? 80% of those surveyed plan to achieve ""nearly net zero,"" ""net zero"" or positive energy status for at least one of their facilities.(Net zero means the company or facility offsets all of its carbon emissions, and certified net zero buildings must meet exceptional energy conservation -- and generation -- standards, and must be verified by a certification body.)This means that many companies across the world are going to be spending big bucks on efficiency and renewable energy generation.That's where a company like JCI comes in.Now, JCI is also in the automotive parts sector, but recently it was announced that this part of the business would be spun off with a new IPO in October 2016. The new company will be named Adient.The remaining business segments focus on building efficiency and power solutions, and both are growing nicely.According to the company's second quarter earnings report, the building efficiency segment grew income 42% year-over-year, with margins increasing by 50 basis points. The power systems segment -- things like batteries for electric and hybrid vehicles -- set a record in the second quarter, with 2.6 million batteries shipped in China, up a whopping 60%.As a result, JCI increased its earnings guidance for the full year from $3.70-$3.90 to $3.85-$4.00 per share.And get this: In January 2016, the company announced it would be merging with Tyco (TYC), a global fire and security company, to become the leading building products and technology, integrated solutions and energy storage company.That says a lot for how JCI sees this major trend in energy efficiency investment.Analysts believe JCI's earnings will grow at an average annual rate of 11.71% over the next five years. That's on top of the 10.77% average earnings growth over the past five years.In other words, JCI earnings could grow from $3.42 in 2015 to $5.95 in 2020, a gain of 73.9%.Risks To Consider: When it comes to the spin-off, there's a lot of uncertainty in the timeline. The company hopes to be able to IPO Adient in October 2016. That's no guarantee, and if there is a hiccup in the timeline, that could adversely affect JCI's share price.The company also just settled a bribery case with the SEC for $14.4 million. The case regards JCI's wholly-owned subsidiary, China Marine. China Marine was bribing Chinese officials and employees of state-owned shipyards to win business.JCI apparently knew about these bribes when it acquired the company, and did attempt to stop it. It didn't. And in a rare form of integrity, JCI turned itself in to the SEC in 2013, acknowledging that it didn't do enough to stop the illegal payments.That $14.4 million represents 0.15% of the company's quarterly revenues, so while it's not a significant financial burden, JCI's image and PR could be hampered by the finding.That the company essentially blew the whistle on itself, though, is a good sign moving forward.Analysts seem to look somewhat favorably on JCI. The company has received two outperform upgrades so far this year, one from Oppenheimer, and most recently, one from Credit Suisse at the end of May.Share prices have excelled so far this year, climbing 19.4% year-to-date, and actually topping out near $52.50. A move back to this level -- which is where ambitious analysts put their price targets -- could mean another gain of 19%.This article was originally published on StreetAuthority.com."

It also provides industrial refrigeration products.Johnson Controls ranks as a ""Buy"" using The 8 Rules of Dividend Investing. This article takes a detailed look at the favorable risk/reward characteristics and current events of Johnson Controls.Recent ResultsOn April 21, Johnson Controls reported its second quarter fiscal 2016 financial results, which beat adjusted earnings-per-share expectations by $0.04 (4.9%). Johnson Controls has shown earnings-per-share surprise in two of its last four quarters meeting estimates in the other two quarters, as shown in the table below.Data: Yahoo FinanceThe company posted revenues of $9.03 billion, down 1.8% year over year, missing consensus estimate of $9.08 billion. Diluted earnings-per-share surged 18%.Source: Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference CallIn the report, Alex Molinaroli, Johnson Controls chairman, president and chief executive officer, said:Johnson Controls also raised its full year fiscal 2016 guidance from $3.70-$3.90 to $3.85-$4.00, reflecting stronger operational performance and a reduction of the company's annual effective tax rate from 19% percent to 17%. According to the company, it expects 2016 fiscal third quarter earnings per diluted share of $1.01-$1.04.Source: Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference CallJohnson Controls and Tyco MergerOn January 25, Johnson Controls and Tyco announced that they have entered into a definitive merger agreement under which Johnson Controls, a global multi-industrial company, will combine with Tyco, a global fire and security provider, to create the leader in building products and technology, integrated solutions and energy storage.Under the terms of the agreement, which has been unanimously approved by both companies' Boards of Directors, Johnson Controls shareholders will own approximately 56% of the equity of the combined company and receive aggregate cash consideration of approximately $3.9 billion. Current Tyco shareholders will own approximately 44% of the equity of the combined company. CEO Molinaroli explained:The merger with Tyco will bring Johnson Controls a significant tax benefit since the merger will make Johnson Controls an Irish company. Spinning off Adient afterward will allow it to be immediately recognized as a foreign-based scion of Johnson Controls. The close of the planned merger is expected on or around October 1, 2016.All in all, I see the merger with Tyco as a smart move by Johnson Controls. The merger will open new markets for the company especially in Europe with complementary products and services. Moreover, significant synergies and tax benefits are expected, which could reach $1 billion in three years, according to the companies.Source: The Electrical Products Group Annual ConferenceAdient Spin-offOn January 12, Johnson Controls revealed that Adient will be the name of its automotive seating and interiors business after the entity is spun off into a new publicly traded company in October 2016. The distribution of Adient shares is scheduled for October 31. Shareholders will receive one Adient share for every 10 shares of Johnson Controls they own.Adient will be the world's largest maker of car seats, as well as other interior parts, last year it posted $20 billion in revenues. The fact that the new company will have its headquarter in London will give it a significant tax benefit. Adient will have a corporate tax rate of 10% to 12% compared to the 17% Johnson Controls paid in the U.S. in the recent quarter.Johnson Controls' automotive seating and interiors business continues to perform ahead of expectations. While revenue for the fiscal year 2016 is expected to come in flat year-over-year, margins are likely to exceed targets. The company also said that order wins continued to accelerate during the first half of fiscal 2016 with awards nearly equal to the full year fiscal 2015 levels.Bruce McDonald, current Johnson Controls vice chairman and future Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Adient, said in a presentation that he expects Adient to implement new strategies that will drive higher levels of growth and profitability as well as strong cash flows. According to McDonald, Adient will increase its investments in innovation in order to gain share and increase value to customers and shareholders.I believe that the new company is well positioned to achieve high growth in the following years due to increasing investments, new products, and lower tax rate.Dividend and Share RepurchaseOn May 17, Johnson Controls has authorized a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.29 per common share. The dividend is payable on July 5, 2016 to shareholders of record at the close of business on June 10, 2016. Johnson Controls has increased its dividend in 36 of the past 38 years and has paid a consecutive dividend since 1887.The annual dividend yield is at 2.61%, and the dividend coverage ratio TTM is at 59.5%. The annual rate of dividend growth over the past three years was high at 13%, over the past five years was also high at 14.9%, and over the last 10 years was at 12.1%.Source: company's reports *assuming same dividend rate for the yearJohnson Controls confirmed it expects to resume its previously authorized share repurchase program with plans to repurchase $500 million before the end of the fiscal year.ValuationSince the beginning of the year:However, since the beginning of 2012:According to TipRanks, the average target price of the top analysts is at $51.33, an upside of 15.5% from its June 10 close price, which appears reasonable, in my opinion.JCI's valuation is good, the forward P/E is very low at 10.3, and the price to cash flow is at 19.9.

Add to the underperformance of the company's shares the tax bill that JCI shareholders will incur for the now-closed tax inversion acquisition of Tyco International (TYC), and it is easy to see why investors in the company's shares are aggravated by the company's performance. With the closure of the tax inversion and the spin-off of its automotive seating and interiors businesses into a United Kingdom based company, now is the time for the company to drive revenue/earnings growth and shareholder rewards. The question now, however, is whether all of the transformative activities by the company will result in share price appreciation, continuing share buybacks and strong dividend growth. The company's most recent quarterly results revealed revenue and earnings before special items that it exceeded estimates. Profitability improvement in the quarter across all of its businesses due to cost-reduction initiatives, restructuring savings and operational efficiencies drove the company's double-digit earnings per share growth. Although such quarter only included partial TYC's results, we believe that JCI will be successful in extracting further cost reductions, restructuring savings and operational efficiencies to drive increased revenue/earnings growth for years to come.JCI's merger with TYC and spin-off of its automotive seating and interiors businesses as part of ADNT were its latest transformational moves to exit its low-margin industrial businesses to focus on less cyclical higher margin markets that are experiencing higher growth rates. The company is also engaged in an ongoing cost savings program. JCI has taken these steps because it has been unable to achieve consistent revenue/earnings growth. Given the company's inability to achieve such growth, investors have assigned a lower price-to-earnings multiple for JCI's shares than the price-to-earnings ratios assigned for its competitors' shares. The now-closed JCI and TYC tax inversion merger is the most significant step in the company's transformation, as it will save the company at least $150 million in annual taxes and $500 million in other synergies over the next three years. JCI offers products that include HVAC equipment and controls, automotive interiors and battery manufacturing, while TYC offers fire-safety and security products and services. Each company offers complementary product/services with customer and geography overlap along with significant revenue and cost synergies. The combined companies will drive growth through product cross-selling and complementary distribution networks.Now that JCI has spun off ADNT and completed its merger with TYC, it will continue to focus on its market-leading building business that includes its heating and air conditioning equipment for commercial buildings, and on its devices for monitoring and regulating electricity usage, temperature, fire safety and security. The company will also focus on its highly profitable automotive battery business that will benefit from fuel economy regulations due to its advanced lead-acid battery technology. Further, the company's divestiture of its automotive seating business allows it to exit a cyclical business that is highly capital intensive. We believe that investors should consider JCI's shares, which yield about 2.65 percent, during a strong overall market selloff. With the ADNT spin-off now behind it and the TYC acquisition closed and integration ongoing, JCI will likely show more reliable revenue/earnings growth over the intermediate and long term, and the company's shares will be assigned a price-to-earnings ratio more consistent with its competitors.Fiscal fourth quarter 2016 earningsIn early November 2016, JCI announced adjusted earnings of $1.21 per share, a 16 percent increase from the year-ago quarter. The company recorded revenues of $10.2 billion, a 16.6 percent increase due to incremental sales from the JCI-Hitachi joint venture. Gross profit increased to $2.1 billion from $1.6 billion. The company reported business division income of $798 million, a decrease from $1.05 billion.JCI's automotive experience division revenues decreased 5 percent to $3.9 billion due to weakness in Europe and the Americas. Income for the division increased 13 percent to $281 million due to cost-reduction initiatives, restructuring savings and operational efficiencies. The company's building efficiency division revenues were $3.6 billion, a 25 percent increase due to incremental revenue from mergers and acquisitions and adverse currency effects. Income for the division increased 17 percent to $410 million. The company's power solutions division revenues increased 7 percent to $1.8 billion. Income from the division was $394 million, a 16 percent increase due to increased volumes, mix, and cost reduction initiatives.Our viewNow that JCI's merger with TYC and the spin-off of ADNT are complete, it is time for the company to show results to its shareholders. As noted above, JCI stuck its shareholders with a tax bill due to its tax inversion merger with TYC. We believe that shareholders will benefit from the TYC transaction if JCI can achieve its stated goal of saving at least $150 million in taxes and $500 million in additional synergies in three years. In our experience, however, such cost savings targets and additional synergies tend to be ""low-ball"" targets which an acquiring company typically will easily exceed. The combination of JCI's products, including HVAC equipment and controls, automotive interiors and battery manufacturing, with TYC's fire-safety and security products and services is a logical combination. Each company offers complementary product and services with customer and geography overlap along with significant revenue and cost synergies. A now-combined JCI/TYC will drive growth by the cross-selling of products and complementary distribution networks. With the JCI/TYC merger and ADNT spin-off complete, the company has completed its exit from low-margin businesses to focus on higher margin businesses.JCI's transformation will begin to show results over the intermediate term. As such transformation shows results, the company will also be able to focus on future technology trends, such as the energy efficiency of office buildings and energy efficient battery technology. Earnings estimates for JCI are $2.80 for fiscal year 2017 and $3.25 for its fiscal year 2018. JCI's shares are trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 15.75 based on fiscal year 2017 earnings estimates and 13.60 based on fiscal year 2018 estimates. As the integration of TYC into JCI moves forward, and JCI's overall transformation continues, its profit margins will increase and its forward price-to-earnings ratio will increase to one in line with competitors. While we believe investors could buy JCI shares now, we also believe that since overall markets are at 52-week highs, potential JCI investors could buy shares in the $37.50 to $40 price range. Over the long term, JCI's merger with TYC and other transformative actions will reward long-term investors with increasing dividends, substantial share repurchases and share price appreciation.Click ""follow"" next to our contributor name at the top of this article to follow our upcoming articles on JCI, dividend growth stocks and more."
3988638,39661,2016-07-15T09:29:39-04:00,"There are clear synergies and financial benefits in the merger for both the company and its shareholders.
        Shareholders will receive shares of Adient after the merger closes.
        Own Johnson Controls shares in an IRA or Roth IRA.
        As of today I clearly see more value in the shares of Tyco International compared to Johnson Controls.","In this article, I would like to discuss the upcoming merger between Johnson Controls (NYSE:JCI) and Tyco International plc (NYSE:TYC). Specifically, this article will present how to benefit from the merger and explain which company out of the two is a better value and stands to benefit more with higher potential capital gains going forward for its shareholders.Previously on Seeking Alpha, the details of the merger have been presented so for purposes of this article, we will just briefly go over the key specifics of the merger. Here is a great recap of the full details of the merger. Another great place to learn about the details of the merger is from Johnson Controls' website in the press release that announced the upcoming transaction.Based on those the details of the merger and its related announcements, there are significant synergies which will be created for Johnson Controls' shareholders (the surviving company) going forward. By relocating its tax domicile to Ireland, the company will save an estimated $150 million per year in taxes. Furthermore, operating synergies are currently pegged at $500 million over the first three years of operating as a combined entity. As a result, this is one of the main reasons that I like the deal and believe that the surviving company will produce returns that will beat the S&P 500 over the medium to long-term.The other big aspect of the merger is that after it is completed, Johnson Controls will spin off Adient, its automotive seating company. Shareholders of both Tyco and Johnson Controls will receive 1 share of Adient for every 10 shares owned of Johnson Controls. This spin off is expected to occur early in 2017.I am a firm believer that spin offs generate value and higher capital returns. In this one specifically, there are two key benefits that I see as compelling reasons to own the stock. This article mentions the first one - a lower taxed tax home in London. Furthermore, Adient will have $20 billion in annual revenue and will be the largest automotive seat producer. Its potential to be bought out is enhanced by the fact that it will have a compelling tax rate as well as being a big player in its market. Tyco has a rich history of spinning off companies in addition to the spin offs later on being involved in buyouts or mergers. Most recently, ADT Corporation (which was spun off by Tyco earlier) was taken private by Apollo Group.Now, one downside to the deal for shareholders of Johnson Controls is that the merger with Tyco will be treated as a taxable event. For Tyco shareholders, that will not be the case. This is because $3.9 billion of cash is being paid to Johnson Controls shareholders as part of the merger and also partially due to the fact that it is viewed as a tax inversion deal. How does one avoid this bill? Simply put, if you want to own Johnson Controls shares going into the close of this merger - own it in your IRA or Roth IRA. This way you will not have to pay the tax bill on the distribution.As I see it here, the real winners are the shareholders of Tyco International. If I were buying the stock today, I would buy stock of Tyco International and not Johnson Controls.The rationale behind this starts with the fact that shareholders of Johnson Controls will be obligated to receive $3.9 billion of cash when the merger closes. This sounds great until one sees that Johnson Controls shares which are exchanged for cash only provides for $34.88 per share. This is referenced from the company's press release above which was linked in the first paragraph of the article. At the time the merger was announced, this was a decent deal as it was right around the closing price of Johnson Controls shares. As of 7/14/2016, Johnson Controls shares are trading at $44.51 per share.As a result of its current share price, Johnson Controls shareholders are not going to be interested in the cash consideration and will prefer to have shares of the surviving company. Unfortunately, $3.9 billion out of its current $28.47 billion in market capitalization will have to be redeemed for cash, which will provide a haircut to the returns of Johnson Controls shareholders.Conversely, shareholders of Tyco International will receive shares of the surviving company. After the .955 shares per share (reverse split) are redeemed for each share of Tyco International, shareholders of Tyco International then receive 100% of their shares in the new company.A look at the market capitalizations of the two companies as of 7/14/2016 provides further insight into why Tyco is a better deal here. The market capitalization (per Yahoo! Finance) of Johnson Controls is $28.47 billion and Tyco's is $18.52 billion. Combined, this is $46.99 billion. Now, let's subtract out the $3.9 billion in cash to be paid out and we arrive at a $43.09 billion combined entity value.Per the company's press release, approximately 44% of the equity in the surviving company will belong to Tyco shareholders. 44% of the $43.09 billion is $18.95 billion. That is 2.37% lower than Tyco shares trade at today. In my opinion, this is merger arbitrage and I have seen no signs that point to this deal not going through. However, I do not believe this factors in upside potential to the combined company's true market capitalization going forward nor the upside potential to the market value of Adient once it is spun off.In conclusion, as a buyer here I like Tyco and believe that is the play that provides the most upside potential for Johnson Controls moving forward in a merger that promises to provide great synergies and financial results. I believe that the estimates provided by management also have room to be revised upward and assuming it can execute on delivering the benefits, shareholders stand to profit nicely from this stock over the next 5-10 years."
4070483,67985,2017-05-08T06:00:00-04:00,"Investors sold off the company’s shares after its last quarterly report as the company narrowed its full-year 2017 profit and organic sales forecast.
        Investors were critical of the company’s latest quarter largely due to the building technologies/solutions business’ results as their bullish opinion relies on such business.
        Such business, focusing on energy efficiency of buildings (includes air conditioners), will benefit from its exposure to technology trends to decrease building operating costs/emissions.
        The company’s shares will rise once it realizes its full potential in the building technologies and solutions market and the energy efficiency trends that support it.
        While the company will also benefit from at least $1.00 a share in cost cutting benefits, investors should consider the company’s shares during the next overall market sell off.","Investors continue to be disappointed with the performance of Johnson Controls International plc (NYSE:JCI) and its shares since its tax-inversion acquisition of Tyco International closed last year. Investors continue their wait and see approach to find out whether the company's integration of Tyco's businesses is on schedule in regard to cost-related/productivity synergies and other non-tax related benefits of such acquisition. Such investors sold of JCI's shares after its latest quarterly report as the company narrowed its full-year 2017 profit and organic sales forecast. In particular, the company expects fiscal 2017 profits to be from $2.60 to $2.68 compared with a prior forecast of $2.60 to $2.75. The company also cut its organic sales growth forecast for 2017 to about 3 percent from its previous range of 2.5 percent to 4.5 percent. Sales in JCI's building technologies and solutions business, its largest business, increased 1 percent to $5.54 billion in its latest quarter, but its margins decreased due to higher expenses and an unfavorable product mix. Analysts and investors were critical of the company's latest quarter largely due to the results of its building technologies and solutions business, given that such analysts/investors see the expected performance of such business as a primary reason why they have been bullish on the company's shares. While JCI's near-term results continue to confound and disappoint investors, we believe that patient and persistent investors will be rewarded over the long-term if they hold the company's shares.Barrons financial newspaper recently highlighted a part of JCI's businesses that is likely to excel and reward investors if they continue to hold the company's shares. We foresaw and agree with Barrons analysis of the positive attributes of such business. The company's business that is likely to excel includes energy efficiency of buildings, which includes air conditioners. While air conditioner offering competitors have seen their stocks perform well, JCI's shares have languished and traded at a discount to such competitors despite the company's exposure to the long-term trend of building owners upgrading building technology to decrease operating costs and emissions. We have long held that JCI's shares have traded at a discount to their competitors' shares, and that, such discount would disappear and it shares would rise once the company would realize its full potential in the markets it sells into like the building technologies market and the energy efficiency trend that supports it. As investors have seen shares of JCI's competitors in the air conditioning business thrive, JCI's shares have underperformed. While JCI's recent earnings results met expectations and the company narrowed its 2017 guidance, the company acknowledged that its air conditioning business performed well and will continue to perform well in 2017. In JCI's most recent quarter, its positive air conditioning results were offset by weak results in its power solutions business and its ADT security and fire safety systems. Despite such weakness in JCI's non-air-conditioning businesses, the investment story for the company's shares is also cost cutting of at least $1.00 a share.With the potential growth of JCI's air conditioning business in mind, let us take a brief look at the company's latest earnings results. The company recorded sales of $7.2 billion in its latest quarter, a 3 percent increase from the year-ago quarter (excluding the net impact of currency effects, mergers and acquisitions and lead pass-through pricing). Organic sales increased 2 percent. Adjusting for special items (including acquisition, divestiture and integration costs), the company recorded non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.50 per share, an increase from $0.45 in the year-ago quarter due to its continued focus on its productivity and the integration efforts (including merger synergies). In particular, JCI recognized $70 million in productivity/synergy cost savings for the quarter (.06 a share), an amount that the company indicates is accelerating. (The company now expects to achieve synergy/productivity savings at the high end of its $250 million to $300 million range for about $0.27 in savings for full year 2017.) In addition to such cost savings, the company is beginning to recognize organic growth, particularly within its buildings business. The company is experiencing significant strength in its HVAC businesses, particularly in its light commercial and residential businesses due to launches of new products and business investments. The company is also seeing some stabilization within the legacy Tyco fire protection products businesses.JCI's narrowed guidance did not sit well with analysts and investors as the company's shares continue to under perform its competitors. Analyst/investor criticisms come on top of the tax bill that many were hit with given the company's tax inversion maneuver with Tyco that was supposed to be a boost for JCI and its investors. So far investors have yet to see a boost and their patience is wearing thin. While the company is making progress with its integration of Tyco's businesses, it also continues to exceed its cost savings forecasts from its productivity/integration cost savings efforts. Recently, there has been commentary that JCI should divest its volatile battery business as such commentary indicates that the battery business would be a better with another company. Such a divestiture would then improve JCI's free cash flow conversion to an amount more in line with its competitors. JCI has already been engaged in a transformation to exit low-margin industrial businesses to focus on less cyclical higher-margin markets that are experiencing higher growth rates. Such transformation, however, has yet to satisfy analysts/investors sufficiently to drive JCI's shares higher. As noted above, the company is likely to experience continued strength in its air conditioning/energy solutions businesses, while its volatile battery business may impede the company's progress until it is ultimately divested.In addition to JCI's transformation efforts, the combined JCI/Tyco businesses should benefit by combining each company's offerings of complementary product/services with customer and geography overlap, along with significant revenue and cost synergies. The combined companies will also drive growth through product cross-selling and complementary distribution networks. With JCI continuing its effort to integrate TYC, it will also continue to focus on its market-leading building business that includes its heating and air conditioning equipment for commercial buildings, and on its devices for monitoring and regulating electricity usage, temperature and security. The company will also focus on its profitable but volatile automotive battery business that will benefit from fuel economy regulations due to its advanced lead-acid battery technology. We believe investors should consider JCI shares during the next overall market sell-off, and especially under $40 a share. As an investor waits for the company to fully realize benefits from its transformative activities, they will collect about a 2.40 percent dividend that is likely to be increased. With much of its transformative activities behind it, JCI will also be able to show more consistent revenue/earnings growth over the long term, and the shares will be assigned a price-to-earnings ratio more consistent with its competitors.Our viewSometimes we wonder why we have invested in industrial-related companies such as Emerson Electric (NYSE:EMR), General Electric (NYSE:GE) and JCI over the past decade, given their poor share price appreciation. Nonetheless, we want to participate in the industrial space and enjoy the outsized dividends of such companies while hoping for modest share price appreciation along with dividend increases and share buybacks. JCI's turnaround efforts to position itself towards more consistent long-term revenue/earnings growth have certainly been slow to impress analysts/investors. Investors tend to be risk averse to uncertainty, and even more risk averse to companies such as JCI that have undertaken multiple transformative activities with a goal of transforming towards higher-growth businesses in higher-growth markets. Investors understand that there are many moving parts to the transformation that the company has undertaken, and any misstep could adversely affect its results. We believe, however, that JCI shareholders will benefit from the Tyco acquisition if JCI can achieve its stated cost/productivity synergy goals. In our experience, a company's stated cost savings/productivity goals tend to be understated conservative targets that an acquiring company generally will easily exceed.JCI's shares trade at a discount on a forward price to earnings ratio basis when compared to its competitors given such uncertainty. The company, given its exposure to energy efficient-building market trends, will benefit from the fact that energy is the most significant expense for commercial building operators. Further, given that high-energy-efficiency buildings are able to obtain higher rents, such buildings are also able to sell for premium prices. As such, office/residential building owners that invest in upgrading their buildings with modern controls, lighting and air conditioning allow such owners to harvest outsized investment returns. With the possibility of such investment returns, building owners are likely increase their building upgrade spending to improve energy efficiency. JCI stands to be a main beneficiary of such building upgrade trend. Also, to reiterate, JCI also stands to benefit from: 1) JCI/Tyco offering complementary product/services with customer and geography overlap, along with strong revenue/cost synergies; and 2) product cross-selling and complementary distribution networks. As noted above, as the company integrates Tyco into its organization, JCI's profit margins will increase and its price-to-earnings ratio will expand and be more comparable with that of its competitors.Earnings estimates for JCI are $2.63 for fiscal year 2017 and $3.05 for fiscal year 2018. (We should note that estimates have decreased slightly for both years in recent months.) Shares are trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 15.95 based on fiscal year 2017 earnings estimates and 13.80 based on fiscal year 2018 estimates. While we believe investors could buy JCI shares now, we also believe that since the overall markets are at 52-week highs, investors could buy shares below $40 a share if a strong overall market sell-off occurs. Over the long term, a combined JCI/Tyco, the company's energy solutions business (including its air conditioning business) and other transformative actions will reward long-term investors with increasing dividends, substantial share repurchases and share price appreciation.(Click ""Follow"" next to our contributor name at the top of this article to follow our upcoming articles on JCI and more.)"
3980574,99406,2016-06-07T18:26:17-04:00,"No catalyst to invest pre-merger.Adient spin-off looks interesting if not loaded with debt.Tyco's business is not growing much faster than JCI, so synergy realization and tax savings become paramount, but are likely overstated.","IntroductionI like diversified industrial companies; they remind me of the good old days of our forefathers when the stock market indexes were dominated by real companies producing things rather than services.Many of the better ones have turned out to be incredible long term investments like 3M (NYSE:MMM), United Technologies (NYSE:UTX), and General Electric (NYSE:GE).I have long wanted to write about a company local to me and important to the Milwaukee economy, Johnson Controls (NYSE:JCI).Many readers may have become more familiar with the company after they announced a merger with Tyco (TYC) that can be viewed as an ""inversion"" which the government has cracked down on harder and harder over the past few years.Let's take a look at Johnson Controls, what they have been making in the land of bratwurst and cheese since 1885, and how the company will fare with or without Tyco.Core BusinessMany industrials that I have researched over the past few years have seen contractions in some or all of their end markets due to falling commodity prices with oil being the largest impact.This is interesting because on the surface many of these segments appear to be tied to overall industrial production and economic growth rather than these specific commodities.So you make nuts and bolts huh? $30 oil shouldn't matter to you right? Well it turns out Mr. Novice Investor, a lot of those nuts and bolts actually are used in the energy industry. Here is a surprise 20% revenue decline for you, have fun!Johnson Controls divides its business into three segments: Building Efficiency, Power Solutions, and Automotive Experience. The company's Global Workplace Solutions segment that provided facilities service and other real estate services was sold in September of 2015.The Building Efficiency segment does around $10.5b in sales and was up 4% in 2015 versus 2014.Automotive Experience does about $20-22 billion in revenues and was down 9% in 2015 versus 2014. ~$1.6 billion of this was due to currency translation.It should be noted that the company announced it was spinning off this division into a separately traded public company in October of 2016.This move is strange to me because it is by far the company's biggest segment and the move was announced before the Tyco merger was made public. I am very interested in the spin-off at the right price and could see how it might be a juicy target for another auto parts maker like Delphi to approach once it is spun off.An important consideration is how much debt will the new company have. Many spin-offs of this type are successful because of the reasons management doled out when announcing the venture but many have also failed as the parent company unloaded most of their debt.Power Solutions does about $6.5 billion in revenue and sales were down 1% year over year while operating income was up 10% due mostly to cost cuts.Results ContinuedRecent 5-year results for Johnson Controls are listed below.The numbers are fairly tepid. Sales growth of 5% over 5 years for a CAGR of 1.01%. Net income grew at a CAGR of 2.09%. Diluted EPS grew slightly faster at 2.7%, mostly due to buybacks but the share count did not drop dramatically as you can see at the bottom of the above chart.At first glance these numbers might make it understandable while JCI is on the path to transforming into an entirely new company with these few transactions outlined above, but I think the telling thing is these results are not all that different then many companies are experience.The difference I see is that JCI has not chosen, like many of its peers, to ramp up debt levels to buy back stock. Debt increased $1.6 billion in these 5 years. Compare that to industrial bellwether 3M which increased long term debt from $4.5 billion to $8.7 billion in this same 5 year timeframe. Total liabilities increase $5.2 billion as well.This accelerated bottom line growth while revenues remain stagnant has been the story for years now and has so far continued to propel many stocks higher. It remains to been seen if JCI was brilliant or foolish not to follow the consensus on this topic and instead embark on this journey of transformation. I personally would have liked JCI to continue along their once present course as I watch debt levels carefully when investing and do not mind slow and steady growth if it comes from reality rather then leverage or financial engineering.We will only know that likely a few years after the merger is complete, if it goes through.Tyco MergerAnd now to the elephant in the room. The merger is expected to realize $650 million in synergies over a three year period after the merger closes. Some analysts think this is low.The new JCI after all the pieces fall is expected to have 4.5 billion in EBITDA and around 10 billion in debt with a possible 3-4 billion payment coming from the Adient spin-off, according to fellow SA contributor Josh Cantrell.I do not see much advantage to the merger beyond tax savings, which are usually the point to many inversions. The merger has been in the works for about 6 months now but I still feel it is arrogant that management continued with such a merger even after many fell apart due to continued rule changes by Treasury.When I look at Tyco's business that Johnson Controls is gaining I see a slow growing business that has some overlap with JCI's business, mainly in the area of non-residential security, but I fail to see how this combination will be much better than if they had just kept the automotive segment.While negativity may persist currently about the future of the automotive industry due to disruption from Uber (NYSE:UBER) or self driving cars, I think that Adient will do fine going forward considering that many of the parts they supply will be in cars regardless or who or what is driving them.Nevertheless, the trend appears to be to separate diversified companies and try to achieve the magical synergies, but I am skeptical of most of the transactions especially if the underlying business is growing slow and steady with nothing special that stands out.Research from Bain suggests that around 70% of companies overestimate the amount of synergies that can be achieved from mergers and acquisitions, mostly to sell the deal to financiers and shareholders that must vote in favor of said deal.ConclusionMaking sense of this whole mess, I see little reason to jump into JCI now. While it is interesting that JCI shareholders get a payout from Tyco even though they are acquiring it and Tyco is taking on 4 billion in debt to do so, I see much more value in the Adient spin-off.Taking a skeptical view that the synergies in most mergers are vastly overstated and that I see little ""revenue acceleration"" forthcoming, despite a mention in the merger press release, I am not very interested in JCI. If the spun-off Adient is given a low valuation by the market and not loaded up with debt from the parent, it could be very interesting.As for the JCI, I will wait patiently for the smoke to clear and see if revenue does indeed accelerate faster than the 1-2% that both Tyco and JCI have been running at the past few years. Only at that point will I be interested and the buy finger start to rumble into action."
3848706,95526,2016-01-29T16:01:26-05:00,"Johnson Controls is in the process of transforming into an almost totally different company.The transformation is not without bumps in the road, but management is doing a good job as change-agent.JCI is basically three companies in one and breaking it into its component parts will unlock a surprising amount of value for those who stick with it.","I have previously written about Johnson Control's evolution (NYSE:JCI) from an auto parts manufacturer into a multi-industrial with a focus on energy efficient buildings and energy storage and this past Tuesday I wrote about the mechanics of the JCI merger deal with Tyco (TYC) that will take effect at the end of September (and please feel free to read either or both!). Sometime next week I am hoping to provide some additional analysis as to how a combined JCI and Tyco would fit together and function, but today I want to take a look at the Johnson Controls 1Q16 earnings call that took place on Thursday. (click here for JCI 1Q16 Corporate presentation) (click here for JCI 1Q16 earnings transcript)Here are the highlights, broken down by category:(In this article, ""Post-spin JCI"" means the merged JCI and Tyco after the spin-off of Adient)Overall First Quarter ResultsJCI CFO Brian J. Stief: ""… overall first quarter revenues were down 7% to $8.9 billion… There's just short of $1 billion in (Automotive) Interiors revenue that we lost, and then we had headwinds with about $0.5 billion of foreign exchange, and then additive to that would be the Hitachi revenues of north of $500 million. So if you look at it that way and exclude those items, you end up that sales were actually up 2% on a consolidated basis and up across all three of our businesses.Gross margin for the quarter was 18.3%, up 160 basis points, and I think that's really reflective of the benefits we're continuing to see from the Johnson Controls Operating System.""Tyco Merger- Some analysts and observers have been underwhelmed by the announcement of $650 million in operational and tax synergies the post-spin JCI is expected to achieve in its first three years. For a company expected to generate $32 billion in revenue, $216.67 million in savings per year is certainly welcome, but far from overwhelming.However, JCI CEO Alex Molinaroli provided some additional color during the 1Q16 earnings call. ""We see $650 million in synergies including operational and the tax synergies that we're going to get from the deal. That's something that we've taken to the bank and we feel very comfortable that we'll be able to achieve. What we don't have in that is any revenue synergies. One of the things that you can expect from us over the next few months as we fully understand how that's going to come together and how we're going to integrate specifically, you can expect for us to update these numbers to include revenue synergies and the timing for that.""- The post-spin JCI is expected to generate $4.5 billion EBITDA and carry approximately $10.5 billion in debt. The debt will consist of (all numbers approximate): 1) $7 billion in JCI debt; 2) $2.2 billion in Tyco debt; 3) $4 billion of new Tyco debt related to the $3.9 billion cash payment to JCI shareholders. This aggregated debt will be partially offset by a $2.5 to $3.5 billion dividend payment from Adient to post-spin JCI.The $3.9 billion cash payment from Tyco to JCI shareholders looks like a clever way to give the JCI shareholders a significant accelerated future payment from Adient (that Tyco shareholders will not participate in) before the spin-off and merger as a counter-balance to the equity in Adient the Tyco shareholders will receive. Even though Tyco is initially incurring the debt on its balance sheet, the Adient dividend payment to post-spin JCI will offset a good portion of this debt (and put it onto Adient's books if Adient takes on debt to pay it, which is likely), with the remaining amount shared by both sets of shareholders in the post-spin JCI.- The equity structure of JCI currently consists of approximately 653 million shares. In December, the JCI Board re-authorized a $500,000,000 buyback of stock which had originally been authorized as a $1 billion buyback that had been placed on hold pending re-examination of certain market conditions. The buyback will commence in the second half of the fiscal year (April-September) and is expected to retire approximately 13,000,000 shares. (This would hypothetically leave about 640 million shares of JCI).- The $3.9 billion cash payment from Tyco to JCI shareholders will be used to retire approximately 111 million shares of JCI, leaving approximately 529 million JCI shares pre-merger. (There was no word as to whether these 111 million shares will be bought on the open market, if they are JCI treasury stock or some combination of both). These 529 million shares of JCI will be merged with 411 million shares of Tyco, for a total of 940 million shares of post-spin JCI.The $3.9 billion cash will be shared pro rata to the 542 million remaining shares of JCI. These numbers are not precise- market share price will have an impact on the total number of shares retired and any of the $3.9 billion used to purchase shares on the open market (rather than to retire treasury stock) will not be available for distribution to shareholders. In essence, though, Tyco is permanently cashing out about 17 % of JCI as a part of the merger, which helps in understanding the 56%-44% equity split a little better.Automotive Experience (Adient)- Sales in Automotive Seating (SE) were down 20% year over year. However, this was almost totally driven by issues related to the deconsolidation of the division from JCI in anticipation of the spin-off. Net revenue for the quarter was $4.2 billion, a decrease from $5.3 billion year over year, BUT income was UP 11% year over year, to $266 million from $240 million.- Costs associated with the deconsolidation of the Automotive Experience have topped $1 billion from the overall JCI bottom line. These costs are in line with expectations, but they are having a short term impact on profitability.- The Automotive Experience (Seating) spin-off is proceeding on track and has gained $850 million in new (unspecified) business.- Adient's initial 10-K will be out in late March or early April and will provide detailed information on the organizational and financial structure of the company. Adient will be operationally independent from JCI by mid-summer and fully independent by October 1.Power Solutions- Power Solutions (PS) overall first quarter shipments were up 3%; in the Americas, up 1%; Europe up 8%; and Asia up 7%. Segment income was $342 million for the quarter, which was up 7% year over year. The results were somewhat skewed to the upside due to the significant decrease in the price of copper year over year, but even factoring this out of the analysis, income was solid.- PS shipped 1 million batteries in China during December and almost 3 million batteries for the quarter. CEO Molinaroli said in regard to these numbers, ""…I was reflecting on that, because you know over the past few years, when I was at Power Solutions when we had our problem with the Shanghai plant, that plant was a 3 million unit (per year) plant. And so as we've moved through the past few years, we're now selling in one (fiscal) quarter of total capacity what we had when we first entered China with our Shanghai plant"".- Sales of Absorbent Glass Mat batteries (i.e. ""stop-start"" batteries for automobiles) have increased 41% year over year to 3.2 million units. The limiting factor for JCI is manufacturing capacity, not demand. Sales to Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) were up 4%, and sales to After Market (AM) were up 3%.- A new 6.5 million unit plant is under construction in China that will be operational in 2017.- In looking at the combined entity that JCI and Tyco will form after spinning off the Automotive Experience division, Power Solutions doesn't seem to fit with the rest of the company… the post spin JCI Building Efficiency division is expected to generate $25 billion in revenue and Power Solutions is expected to generate $7 billion in revenue. Is it possible that post-spin JCI will look to grow the Power Solutions division for a couple of years and then sell or spin it as well? I think it's definitely possible.Building Efficiency- Orders were up a total of 5% quarter over quarter: 8% quarter over quarter in North America; 10% quarter over quarter in Asia; down significantly in the rest of the world. Revenue was up from $2.5 billion to $3.0 billion year over year for the quarter and income was up from $164 million to $180 million. The Building Efficiency division has an order backlog of $4.5 billion.- In October, 2015, JCI and Hitachi formed a JV, of which JCI owns 60%, to sell Hitachi's line of air conditioning products through the JCI Building Efficiency division worldwide. The products include Hitachi's VRF (Variable Refrigerant Flow) technology, residential air conditioning, and high efficiency chillers that are paired and integrated with JCI's HVAC technology. The JV is expected to generate $2.8 billion in sales annually. The integration and consolidation of the Hitachi operations has caused some headwinds in the first quarter of 2016, driving margins down from 6.6% to 6.1%. However, this is expected to be a temporary issue and, once consolidation is completed, margins are expected to significantly improve.- BE lost some federal government business that they thought they had in hand in December 2015 ($125 million to $150 million aggregate). It is unclear, but appears that the funding for the projects may have fallen through. Sales to industrial customers are also down. However, institutional and commercial sales are good (ex. CB Richard Ellis).- CEO Molinaroli on the BE division: ""As it related to BE, we are seeing revenue softness in that business in primarily three areas: China, where it seems to be taking a bit longer to number one, secure order, and then number two, to get the orders executed from a revenue recognition standpoint. So, that's causing a bit of softness for us as we look through the rest of the year. The Middle East, although strong in the first quarter, it looks like with oil prices where the area that there could be some softness in the back half of the year. And then the third area that I just point to is there were three or four federal jobs, one in particular, that we thought at the end of the year fiscal 2015 (sic) that we were going to secure in early 2016, and for a variety of reasons, those jobs have not been secured yet. And if they aren't secured, that'll provide a bit of downward pressure on our previously provided guidance as well.""Ch-Ch-Cha-CHAN-GESWhat struck me listening to this report was the amount of change JCI management is dealing with across the entire organization. While the changes are (in my opinion) driven by rational, well-thought out decisions that have been (mostly) well executed and have the potential to drive significant value, the sheer amount of organizational change-management required across semi-related industries (within JCI) and multiple (global) cultures in multiple (again, global) economic environments leaves plenty of opportunity for error, even for a competent and skilled management team.Is Johnson Controls management biting off more than they can chew?Are they taking on too much reorganization at one time? Headwinds from the Hitachi integration, deconsolidation activities for the Automotive Experience (Adient), the potential loss of material government contracts for the Building Efficiency division, demand outpacing manufacturing capacity for AGM batteries, and managing and shepherding the merger with Tyco are just some of the issues management must effectively orchestrate, not in isolation, but in a unified manner that drives overall organizational momentum. It seems like a tall task. But one of the traits that drew me to Johnson Controls in the first place was the fact that it is basically three companies in one, and if those entities can be unpackaged from each other effectively I believe there is a ton of value for those who don't mind living through significant changes such as the ones JCI is currently going through.Supporting Documents"

JCI/TYC is about complementary products, supply chains, and customer bases.Both the JCI/TYC merger and the spin-off of JCI Automotive Experience into Adient (ADNT) are on schedule and on budget.","Last Thursday (April 21), Johnson Controls (NYSE:JCI) provided a general 2Q16 business update as well as confirmed that the planned merger with Tyco (TYC) and spin-off of the automotive interiors division into a new stand-alone company called Adient are on track. Overall results were quite strong, with solid prospects for continued future growth across all three current operating segments and the risk of regulatory or governmental interference with the pending merger looking fairly minimal.Photo: Johnson Controls Investor RelationsFinancial HighlightsJCI reported an overall 10% increase in 2Q year-over-year gross profit from continuing operations, despite a 2% decrease in sales YoY (excluding FX). Earnings per share improved 18% over the prior year quarter, from $0.73/share in 2Q15 to $0.83/share in 2Q16. Total net debt was steady over the quarter at $6.7 billion, while free cash flow improved from $100 million in 2Q15 to $400 million 2Q16. The company also plans to resume a $500 million share repurchase program by the end of 2016 as well.FY16 guidance was raised from $3.70 - $3.90/share to $3.85 - $4.00/share.Segment HighlightsFor a detailed look at Johnson Controls by operating segment, please see my previous article "" Johnson Controls is Evolving Back to its Roots"".Power SolutionsPhoto: Johnson Controls Investor RelationsThe automotive battery business is booming. Sales to both Original Manufacturers (OM- i.e. automotive manufacturers) and aftermarket retailers were up 3% YoY. Demand for Absorbent Glass Mat (AGM) stop-start batteries was up a robust 18% on the quarter and continues to increase as more and more OMs adopt and implement stop-start battery technology. The only limiting factor for JCIs ability to address the AGM market appears to be manufacturing capacity. JCI is essentially selling every battery they produce as soon as it is made and the company has significant additional AGM manufacturing capacity under construction in China that should be fully operational over the next two years.Building EfficiencyPhoto: Johnson Controls Investor RelationsDuring the quarter, JCI announced it will be partnering with big-box discount retailer Target (NYSE:TGT) to replace 3600 rooftop HVAC units over the next three years. This is potentially a highly interesting piece of news as it represents a move into a significant market segment in which JCI has not had a large operational presence to date.The JCI/Hitachi JV centered on expanding market share for Hitachi's Variable Refrigerant Flow (VRF) cooling systems continues to gain steam globally. Margins for this segment face some headwinds due to expenses related to expansion of distribution channels and salesforce development, but the underlying business has a significant growth trajectory.Automotive Seating/Interiors JVPhoto: Johnson Controls Investor RelationsJCI Automotive Experience already has the same volume of orders through the first half of 2016 as it had for all of 2015. The Automotive Interiors segment (of which JCI owns a deconsolidated 30% of a JV with operating partner Yanfeng Automotive Trim Systems Co., Ltd.) has secured $7 billion of business since the announcement of the JV last summer.Tyco Merger/Adient Spin-OffFor more detail on the Johnson Controls/Tyco merger, please see my previous article, "" Shareholders Rewarded in Johnson Controls/Tyco Merger"".The short story is that both the JCI-Tyco merger and Adient spin-off remain on schedule and on budget. There had been some risk that newly promulgated U.S. Treasury Department rules might complicate the merger, but it is now relatively clear that the new rules will have little to no impact on the JCI/Tyco merger.Without getting into too much gory detail, under Treasury Department rules a foreign corporation is required to own at least 40% of a combined U.S./foreign company for the two companies to reap any significant tax benefits from an inversion. But, in response to a proposed merger between mega-pharmaceutical companies Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) (a U.S. company) and Allergan (NYSE:AGN) (an Irish domiciled corporation) the Treasury Dept. issued a new ""three-year-look-back rule"", which would disqualify the stock of a U.S. company that has been accumulated by a foreign company within the last three years from consideration toward this 40% threshold. Essentially, the new rule does not allow stock accumulated through a foreign company's U.S. deals in the last three years to count towards the book value needed to meet the inversion threshold.Though it did not mention the companies by name, the new rule seemed to be specifically directed at the Allergan/Pfizer deal because of how Allergan has been put together as a company via acquisitions, almost like a ""platform"" type entity rather than an organically grown business.*This issue does not exist in the context of JCI and Tyco.Tyco (the foreign company) has not made any acquisitions of U.S. based assets in the last three years (or, if it has, they have been minimal) and therefore the combined JCI/Tyco will not violate the new Treasury ""three-year-look-back rule"". From a public policy standpoint, the JCI/Tyco merger is based on something other than the desire to avoid paying corporate taxes- the main driver of the deal is pretty clearly a logical merging of complementary supply chains, product mixes and customer bases that will result in a larger, but likely more efficient, company that has more and greater business opportunities globally.The new Ireland-based JCI WILL benefit from a substantively lower overall tax rate once the merger has been completed, but the primary goal of the merger is not to pay lower taxes. The tax rate of the new company is expected to be 17-18%.The expected date of the JCI/Tyco merger is October 1, 2016 and Adient is expected to be spun on October 31, 2016.After the spin-off, Adient will also be ""foreign domiciled"" and will have a 10-12% tax rate. The ""foreign domicile"" wasn't specified, but the presumption is that it will also be based in Ireland, since it will not be spun off until after the merger/inversion. Separation costs related to the spin-off are within the previously announced range of $400 million to $600 million, with roughly half of these expenses related to IT.In the meantime, JCI management made mention on the earnings call that the merger transition team is working on the logistics of integrating JCI and Tyco operations and that, much like the spin-off of Adient (except in reverse), the biggest expenses are related to merging corporate IT systems. Corporate integration costs are anticipated to be $150 million to $200 million. The companies continue to anticipate realizing approximately $650 million in ""synergies"" over the first three years of the new entity, with roughly $150 million of this amount coming from a lower tax structure and the remainder from operations.There certainly is the possibility that Congress could enact some sort of legislation that introduces additional hurdles to any type of inversion deal before the JCI/Tyco merger is completed in early October. However, given the strife and gridlock that has become the hallmark of Congress in recent years and that this is a particularly acrimonious election year, it would seem highly unlikely. Once the merger is completed, the new company will be ""ex-post facto"" free of any risk of ""anti-inversion"" legislation.But what about tax implications to shareholders of the merger/spin-off?One very common question JCI shareholders have had is about the tax implications to shareholders of the merger…. There was no additional insight provided on this topic on the Q2 earnings call. Whenever I hear definitive word as to what JCI shareholders should expect in terms of tax treatment I will post.In May, JCI will more specifically address the Tyco merger at the EPG (Electric Product Group) Conference on Monday, May 16 in Longboat Key, Florida.* NOTE: It's relevant to point out that it is quite possible that the newly enacted Treasury Department rules would not stand up under judicial scrutiny. Speculation has been that Pfizer or Allergan would have had a reasonable chance of having the rules overturned had they decided to bring a court challenge. However, due to the length of time such a challenge would be likely to take (probably multiple years), the decision was made to simply scrap the merger plans altogether, with Pfizer paying the (up to) $400 million break-up fee to Allergan."
3833916,95526,2016-01-26T07:10:07-05:00,"The merger deal between Johnson Controls and Tyco International initially appears complicated, but seems fairly balanced after analysis.Tyco shareholders will receive a significant equity position in the JCI Automotive Seating Spinoff, Adient.JCI shareholders are nicely compensated with 56% of the total equity in both the merged companies and Adient, as well as an upfront cash payment of $3.9 billion from Tyco.","Today, Johnson Controls (NYSE:JCI) and Tyco International (NYSE:TYC) announced a merger between the two companies that, if carried through to execution, will result in a $32 billion industrial company that is focused on providing systems and services that enhance the energy efficiency of buildings and facilities in numerous industries. The combined company will also provide power management solutions, fire safety and security services and will be a global leader in the manufacture of automotive batteries as well. The mechanics of the deal seem a bit confusing at first glance, but, in my opinion, present a fair deal to shareholders of both companies over the long term once you actually work through it.The first thing that caught my attention was a $3.9 billion cash consideration Tyco is to pay to JCI shareholders. I know every deal is unique, but if JCI is supposed to be the acquiring party, why is Tyco making such a hefty cash payment? Furthermore, the term used was $3.9B aggregate cash consideration. What does aggregate cash consideration even mean?The second thing that I found initially confusing was the exchange offer from the JCI shareholder perspective. Tyco shareholders will receive a straight 0.9550 shares of the merged company for every share they own after a planned reverse stock split. No moving parts. No tax liabilities. Just a simple, straight forward exchange that will occur automatically. However, JCI shareholders are given the option to exchange one current share for either one share in the combined company OR $34.88 in cash (which is a taxable event). Since the price of JCI's stock was around $35.60 at the open of the market today, it seemed bizarre that the corporate officers who put this deal together somehow thought a share of JCI might actually be worth LESS in eight months than it is right now, especially if the merger was as good a deal as they were representing it to be. I was starting to actively wonder if JCI shareholders were actually getting a good deal. Ultimately, however, I realized that I was probably misunderstanding some aspect of the deal, which turned out to be the case. I kept looking it over and here's how I think it all pulls together:The combined company would initially consist of four basic divisions: Batteries/Power Management; Fire Safety and Security (Tyco); Building Efficiency; and Automotive Seating. The JCI Automotive Seating division is scheduled to be spun off into a stand-alone company called Adient on October 3, 2016, and is expected to generate approximately $17 billion in revenue during FY 2016. (NOTE: JCI's Fiscal Year runs from October 1 to September 30, so the end of FY 2016 for our purposes is September 30, 2016.) The remaining three divisions are expected to generate approximately $32 billion in revenue between them during FY 2016. The combined JCI/Tyco will, therefore, generate about $49 billion in revenue for the year (although the merger itself will not take place until the END of FY 2016).It's important to make note that the spin-off of the Automotive Seating division will not occur until AFTER the merger is complete. This means that shareholders of BOTH JCI and Tyco will receive significant ownership interest in the Automotive Seating division spinoff as a part of the merger deal - JCI shareholders will own 56% of the equity and Tyco shareholders will own 44%. (Another way to look at this is that JCI shareholders would be receiving equity equaling roughly $9.52 billion of revenue per year (i.e. 56% of $17 billion in revenue generated by Automotive Seating in FY 2016) and Tyco shareholders would be receiving equity equaling roughly $7.48 billion in revenue per year. (44% of $17 billion)) This is another part of the deal that struck me as odd on first reading: This spinoff was planned well before there was any notion of any merger, and now Tyco shareholders seem to be receiving 44% of a $17 billion/year company just for agreeing to this merger. The spinoff really only consists of JCI equity (there is no Tyco Automotive Seating division that is being consolidated with Adient) and Tyco shareholders are getting $7.48 billion worth of revenue equity for free (seemingly).Shareholders would split the equity ownership of the remaining elements of the merged company (Batteries/Power Management; Fire Safety and Security; Building Efficiency) in the same ratios - JCI shareholders would own 56% of the equity in the new company and Tyco shareholders would own the other 44%. $32 billion in revenue would break down as $17.92 billion in revenue equity for JCI shareholders and $14.08 billion for Tyco shareholders. Since the merged company will consist of equity contributed by both companies, both sets of shareholders should be entitled to equity. JCI shareholders would receive $3.84 billion more in equity than Tyco shareholders, which would go part ways to offsetting the $7.48 billion in revenue equity Tyco shareholders received from the Adient spinoff, but there was still a $3.46 billion equity gap between the shareholder groups. ($7.48 billion revenue equity in Adient for Tyco shareholders minus $3.48 billion revenue equity premium JCI shareholders received above Tyco shareholders in the combined new company). This is where I think the $3.9 billion aggregate cash payment from Tyco to JCI shareholders fits in.After working through the mechanics of the deal, the $3.9 billion cash payment looks like it was made to balance out the equity in Adient that Tyco shareholders will receive. I realize there is a difference between revenue, from which expenses and operating costs must be paid, and actual free cash like the $3.9 billion. Also, revenue from one company is not necessarily as valuable as revenue from another company with better margins. So it wouldn't be appropriate to make a straight ""apples to apples"" comparison of a $3.46 billion revenue equity gap to a similar amount of free cash in hand. However, depending on the margins you are able to generate, $3.9 billion is an amount that could be earned on $3.46 billion revenue over a period of a few years. Additionally, the 44% equity in Adient that Tyco shareholders will own will very likely eventually pay some sort of dividend, which would advocate for some additional free cash payment to JCI shareholders to whom the dividends were to have been paid over time.At this point, I was feeling more confident that the values on either side of the deal can be shown to be reasonably balanced without too many mental gymnastics. However, I still had some difficulty figuring out HOW the $3.9 billion aggregated cash payment would be paid out to JCI shareholders.My notes from the JCI/Tyco conference call announcing the merger this morning (Monday, January 25 2016 at 8:45 am EST) showed that someone had asked how many total shares the new company was likely to have. I did not write down the name of either the person who asked the question or the person who answered it, but the answer was roughly ""somewhere around 940 million, but we don't have a firm number yet"". Another person asked about the $3.9 billion and whether it would be an ""either/or"" situation for JCI shareholders- either take one share of the new company for one share of the old company, or take the money, but not both. The answer was that it would depend on how many shares were submitted for redemption and that shareholders could end up with both equity in the new company and cash.The way I believe this is going to work, based on what I heard on the call this morning, is as follows: there will be $3.9 billion in cash available to JCI shareholders as a part of this merger. JCI shareholders will have the right, but not the obligation, to redeem some, all or none of their existing shares for $34.88/share in cash, which will retire one share of stock from the new company (a la buyback) and the $34.88 will be deducted from the $3.9 billion. At a redemption/buyback price of $34.88, there is sufficient capital to retire 111.8 million shares of the new company (or 111.8 million redeemed shares/940 million total shares = 11.9% of total shares), which would improve all remaining shareholders' equity by almost 12%. However, if the price of JCI is greater than $34.88 at the time of the actual merger (and I hope it is), then the incentive should be to retain the shares rather than take the cash payment. In this case, I believe, however, much cash is left over from the $3.9 billion after all voluntary redemptions are made will be distributed to the remaining JCI shareholders pro rata.Per Yahoo! Finance, JCI currently has 647.9 million shares outstanding. For the sake of this example, let's say the price of JCI is $40.00 at the time of the merger and redemptions are light, with only $900 million from the $3.9 billion spent. This would mean 25.8 million shares have been redeemed ($900 million/$34.88 per share = 25.8 million shares redeemed) and would leave $3.0 billion to be distributed to the remaining 622.1 million outstanding shares (647.9 million JCI shares outstanding minus 25.8 million redeemed shares = 622.1 million JCI shares remaining), pro rata. $3 billion/622.1 million shares = $4.82 per share payout. So, either way, redemption or cash paid directly to shareholders, JCI shareholders actually make out much better than I originally thought when I first looked this deal over.The only real drawback I see is the fact that Tyco has taken on an additional $4 billion in debt to cover the $3.9 billion payable to JCI shareholders. Tyco has a relatively light debt burden of about $2.2 billion at about 3.7% interest, so it isn't necessarily totally irresponsible to take on additional debt to finance a (transformational) transaction. However, I'm not quite as excited if it means the debt will carry forward into the new merged company.Taken as a whole, though, I actually think this is not a bad deal for both Tyco and JCI shareholders. I will try to draft another article after the two companies hold their earnings calls later this week and look at the actual fit between the two organizations and the types of opportunities this merger may generate for a combined company going forward."
3830346,68315,2016-01-25T02:22:32-05:00,"Combined value around $40 billion.
        Deal could be dilutive for Johnson Controls' shareholders.
        Tax inversion could lead to annual savings of $350 million.
        Tyco shareholders would likely see a huge gain if merger is announced.","Johnson Controls (NYSE:JCI) and Tyco (NYSE:TYC) are rumored to merge in a deal that could be announced early this week. In this article I'll take a look at the possible implications of such a deal on both companies.Company OverviewsJohnson Controls is a diversified company which is active in the buildings market, batteries field and which also supplies to automobile manufacturers.Over the last year Johnson Controls' revenue declined four percent, yet the company was able to grow net income by three percent to $1.6 billion and increased earnings per share by four percent to $2.36. Johnson Controls beat estimates for the bottom line in the last quarter, with earnings per share coming in at $1.04.Tyco International is active in the fire protection business and offers security solutions to its customers. Tyco is headquartered in Ireland.Tyco's revenues declined four percent over the last year -- as did Johnson Controls' -- but the company was not able to grow earnings despite this headwind. Tyco's net income dropped almost seventy percent to $550 million, earnings per share reached $1.30 over the last twelve months. In the last quarter Tyco earned $0.61 per share, which was in line with estimates.Combined companyAfter a merger of these two companies the combined one would have trailing revenues of $47.1 billion and net income of about $2.1 billion. The combined market capitalization is $36 billion right now, which means that the company would trade at a trailing earnings ratio of 17, which is higher than the valuation of Johnson Controls (15.0) and lower than the current valuation of Tyco (23.9).Due to the fact that the merger could come with a premium over Tyco's current valuation (sources see a premium of up to 50 percent, valuing Tyco at $20 billion) the market capitalization of the combined company could be higher. Should Tyco indeed get a valuation of $20 billion, this would mean a combined market capitalization of $43 billion.Such a move would be highly dilutive for current shareholders of Johnson Controls (when we exclude positive effects such as cost savings through better economics of scale, lower overhead etc.), since this would mean that Tyco's shares would get valued at 36 times earnings in a deal. In other words, shareholders who invest $100 in Johnson Controls right now get earnings of $6.67, whereas someone who held $100 in the combined company would see theoretical earnings of $4.88, which is almost thirty percent less than they get right now.Of course this calculation does not include cost savings through synergies (which would likely increase the combined earnings power above the trailing $2.1 billion number), and the calculation does not include another fact that could turn out as a huge positive: Since Tyco is headquartered in Ireland, a merger of the two companies could mean a so called tax inversion: Ireland is a country with very low corporate taxes, whereas corporate taxes in the US are among the highest of industrial nations. By relocating the combined company to Ireland -- which would theoretically be possible after a merger -- the company would lower its tax expenses dramatically. Ireland's 12.5 percent tax rate is substantially lower than the tax rate Johnson Controls' is paying:For the last twelve months the company's corporate tax rate was 29 percent -- Johnson Controls paid more than twice the amount the company would pay if taxed in Ireland. The tax savings would be substantial -- when using flat pre tax income of $2.2 billion and a corporate tax rate of 12.5 percent, we get to net income of $1.9 billion, which is about $350 million higher than the company's reported net income.We can thus say that despite the fact that Tyco would be valued at a steep premium over Johnson Controls, this could still be a beneficial move for the company. In addition to other cost savings the company's tax savings could amount to a substantial $300 to $400 million a year.Implications for the share priceIt is hard to determine how Johnson Controls' share price would react to a merger announcement. On one hand the possible cost savings could excite investors, on the other hand investors might be worried about possible dilution (depending on the premium Tyco shareholders get) and the possibility of a lower dividend (since Johnson Controls' yield is a lot higher than the yield of Tyco).If a deal is announced, Tyco's shares will very likely jump, if the rumors about a $20 billion valuation for the company turn out true Tyco's shareholders could see a 50 percent jump this week.TakeawayA combined company would be among the bigger industrial players, with revenues of $47 billion and net earnings of more than $2 billion. A deal would be dilutive for Johnson Controls' investors, but tax savings and other cost cutting could lead to additional net income growth over the next years.Tyco shareholders will likely see a huge gain, since the company would be valued at a premium to the current share price in any deal."
3786616,67985,2016-01-03T03:22:44-05:00,"All investors building a portfolio of stocks should include a predetermined percentage of dividend growth stocks that participate in the industrial products market.
        Johnson Controls has been engaged in acquisitions and divestitures that are part of a strategy to exit low margin businesses and focus on higher margin businesses.
        Johnson Controls transformation will allow it to focus on its market-leading building efficiency and control business and its highly profitable automotive battery business.
        Emerson Electric’s strength in process automation will reduce the cyclicality of its process management division and its divestitures will allow it to reallocate its resources to stronger divisions.
        Emerson Electric’s almost 4 percent dividend, its transformation, its reduced dependence on oil and gas markets and any upturn in depressed oil and gas markets will greatly reward shareholders.","In 2015, mainstream financial media outlets proclaimed loudly and repeatedly in article headlines that stocks were in the biggest bubble since 2007. While such headlines may be accurate for a select group of stocks, there is a wide range of dividend growth stocks that are trading at 52-week and/or multi-year lows. Two such beaten up stocks that deserve a place in any dividend growth investors' portfolio are Emerson Electric (NYSE:EMR) and Johnson Controls (NYSE:JCI). EMR is an industrial conglomerate operating in five business divisions: 1) process management; 2) industrial automation; 3) network power; 4) climate technologies; 5) and commercial and residential solutions. JCI also operates in multiple business divisions including: 1) an automotive experience division; 2) a building efficiency division; and 3) a power solutions division. Each company has been taking similar steps in the near term to jump start revenue and profit growth as economic uncertainty continues around the world. While we own shares in both companies, we thought it would be interesting to consider which company's shares we would recommend to a fellow long-term investor who could only purchase one company's shares in the near-term.For EMR, a drastic decline in oil prices has adversely effected its largest division (the process management division). Such division provides software and instruments for controlling and measuring liquids that assist oil explorers to efficiently pump oil. In addition, a strong U.S. dollar, depressed industrial spending and weakness in emerging and mature economies have also adversely affected EMR's performance. Prior to EMR's share price drop to multi-year lows in 2015, the company had already been in the midst of its strategy to transform itself to focus on higher-growth and higher-profit businesses. In mid 2015, for example, EMR announced it would spin off its network power division by the end of 2016 through a tax-free distribution to shareholders as part of its plan to streamline its business portfolio and drive growth in revenue and earnings. At the same time, the company also announced it would explore strategic alternatives for its motors and drives, power generation and remaining storage businesses. Finally, the company indicated that it would conduct a complete review and assessment of its corporate services and structure to bring them into alignment with its smaller scale. Ultimately, as EMR transforms to exit some of its weaker-performing businesses, it will be able to grow its better-performing divisions through internal innovation and through acquisitions (See this article for acquisition options that EMR may consider).For JCI, the company has struggled to achieve consistent revenue growth in a weak global economic environment and given adverse currency effects, even though it has shown operational improvements across all of its businesses. To jumpstart more consistent revenue growth, the company has been engaged in a strategy to exit its low-margin industrial businesses to focus on less cyclical higher-margin markets that are experiencing faster growth rates. Steps JCI has taken according to its strategy include: 1) an agreement to sell its Global WorkPlace Solutions business; 2) an agreement for a global automotive interiors joint venture whereby JCI would spin-off its low-margin, slow-growth automotive interiors business into a joint venture; and 3) a spin-off of its automotive experience business in a tax-free transaction to shareholders. (Further, as part of the company's spin-off preparations, JCI announced its initiation of a comprehensive cost savings program.) Each of the above-noted transactions allows JCI to divest significant portions of its low margin businesses. (We should note that JCI's exit from the automotive seating market allows it to exit a cyclical business that is highly capital intensive.) Subsequent to such divestitures, JCI will remain focused on its market-leading building efficiency business that includes its York-brand heating and air conditioning equipment for commercial buildings, and on its devices for monitoring and regulating electricity usage, temperature, fire safety and security. Further, the company will also focus on its highly profitable automotive battery business that will benefit from fuel economy regulations due to its expertise in advanced lead-acid battery technology.Emerson Electric wins in a closely matched raceChoosing between these two high quality dividend growth companies is a difficult task given that each of the companies shares trade at depressed levels in the current difficult global business environment. As noted above, each of JCI's changes of its portfolio of businesses will allow it to exit low-margin markets and enter higher margin markets. As JCI transforms its business portfolio, it will then be able to capitalize on future market trends, such as the energy efficiency concerns of office building owners and energy efficient battery technology. JCI's current price-to-earnings ratio is 16.70. Earnings estimates for JCI are $3.77 for fiscal year 2016 and $4.20 for its fiscal year 2017. In recent months, earnings estimates for JCI in both years have been reduced. JCI's shares are trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of about 10.50 based on fiscal year 2016 earnings estimates and 9.40 based on fiscal year 2017 estimates. Given the company's lack of consistent revenues and earnings growth, investors have assigned a price-to-earnings multiple to JCI that is lower than the price-to-earnings ratio awarded to its competitors. As JCI's transformation begins to show more consistent revenue growth and an increase in its profit margins, its forward price-to-earnings ratio should increase to about 15. A price-to-earnings ratio of 15 for JCI would be more in line with the price-to-earnings ratios of JCI's competitors. There is no doubt that JCI shares, already trading near 52-week lows, are cheap if 2016 and 2017 earnings estimates hold up. There is also little doubt that, over the long term, JCI's transformative actions will reward long-term investors with increasing dividends, substantial share repurchases and a rising share price. JCI is worthy of a place in most dividend-growth portfolios of a long-term investor, but let us look at why we favor EMR now.As noted above, investors have been negative towards EMR shares given its heavy exposure to oil and gas markets and emerging markets. In fact, the vast majority of the sales in the company's process management division is in the oil and gas supply market, and, as such, investors' beliefs of an extended downturn in the oil sector have punished the company's shares over the last year. EMR's strengths in the process automation market, however, help reduce the effects of the cyclical nature of its process management division. In addition, EMR's announced intent to spin off its underperforming network power segment in 2016, will likely boost the company's shares for two reasons. First, the spin-off will allow the company to reallocate its resources to its remaining divisions, including the higher-return process management, climate technologies, and commercial and residential solutions divisions. Second, any funds received from a business divestiture (including the spin-off) may be used for acquisitions to diversify the process management division that is overly exposed to the deeply depressed oil and gas market. Although EMR's transformation will boost the company's fortunes, analysts and investors believe the company will need to make more substantial acquisitions to boost revenue and earnings growth. EMR's current price-to-earnings ratio is about 12.00, and the forward price to earnings ratio is about 15.65 based on the company's 2016 earnings estimate of $3.06, and about 14.20 based on the company's 2017 fiscal year earnings estimate of $3.37. We should note that earnings estimates for 2016 and 2017 have been reduced dramatically in recent months.Choosing between EMR and JCI is a difficult choice. Each company has established an extensive dividend growth history, but EMR's dividend growth has slowed to token dividend raises while JCI's dividend growth has shown greater strength. Each company is in the midst of transforming their business portfolios away from cyclical lower-growth lower-profit margin businesses towards less cyclical higher-growth higher-profit businesses through acquisitions and divestitures. Although JCI is trading at a lower price to earnings ratio that EMR, we would choose EMR given its almost 4 percent dividend yield, its transformative actions and the potential boost EMR's shares would receive if the oil and gas market shows even the slightest stabilization or upturn. In addition, we should note that EMR insiders have made a few purchases in recent years in the price range of $49.41 to $67.12 while JCI insiders have made no purchases. For an investor seeking a 7 percent annual return goal on its overall portfolio, the addition of EMR and its almost 4 percent yield to reinvest in more shares would go along way towards meeting such goal as the company's transformation takes effect and rewards investors with increasing dividends, substantial share repurchases, and a rising share price."

In recent years, the company has announced multiple deals in an effort to accomplish such strategy. In early 2015, JCI announced an agreement for the sale of its Global WorkPlace Solutions business to CBRE Group, Inc. for $1.475 billion. The transaction is a continuation of the company's focus on higher margin business lines with sales growth potential. Also, later in 2015, JCI and Yanfeng Automotive Trim Systems Co., Ltd. announced the signing of an agreement for a global automotive interiors joint venture whereby JCI will spin-off its low-margin, slow-growth automotive interiors business into a joint venture. In late July 2015, JCI announced it would spin-off of its $22 billion in revenue (in 2014) automotive experience business in a tax-free transaction to shareholders. (The company indicated that the spun-off automotive company would benefit from its strong existing relationships with customers, well-established positions in growth markets including China, and will generate strong cash flow.) As part of the company's preparation for such spin-off, JCI also announced its initiation of a comprehensive cost savings program.In recent years, JCI has struggled to achieve consistent revenue growth, even though the company had shown operational improvements across all of its businesses. Given the company's lack of consistent revenues and earnings growth, investors have assigned a price-to-earnings multiple to JCI that is lower than the price-to-earnings ratio assigned to its competitors. Each of the above-noted transactions allows JCI to divest significant portions of its low margin businesses. Subsequent to such divestitures, JCI will continue to emphasize its market-leading building business that includes its York-brand heating and air conditioning equipment for commercial buildings, and on its devices for monitoring and regulating electricity usage, temperature, fire safety and security. In addition, the company will also be able to focus on its very profitable automotive battery business that will benefit from fuel economy regulations due to its expertise in advanced lead-acid battery technology. We should also note that JCI's exit from the automotive seating market will allow it to exit a cyclical business that is too capital intensive. We believe that the company's shares, which currently yield about 2.50 percent after a recent dividend increase, should be strongly considered for purchase as part of an investor's long-term portfolio during the overall market sell off. As the company's transformation progresses and begins to show improved results with respect to revenue and earnings growth, the company's shares will be assigned a price-to-earnings ratio more in line with the company's competitors, and investors in the company's shares will be rewarded.Fiscal fourth quarter 2015 earningsIn its late October 2015, JCI announced adjusted earnings of $1.07 per share, a 2.9 percent increased from the year-ago quarter (The company has classified its global workplace solutions business as a discontinued operation.). The company's net income was $349 million or 53 cents per share, an increase from $309 million or 46 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. Revenue for the quarter was $8.75 billion, a 12.1 percent decrease from the year-ago quarter due to deconsolidation of JCI's automotive interiors business and adverse currency effects.The company's automotive experience division recorded revenue of $4.16 billion, a 21 percent decrease from the year-ago quarter due to deconsolidation of the interiors business (Excluding the interiors' deconsolidation and adverse currency effects, revenues increased 3 percent.).Adjusted income for the division decreased to $248 million from $251 million in the year-ago quarter (Excluding adverse currency effects, division income increased 4 percent due to increased seating volumes.). The company'sbuilding efficiency division recorded revenue of $2.9 billion, in line with the year-ago quarter (Excluding adverse currency effects, revenues increased 5 percent due to improved results in North America Systems and service and the Middle East, partially offset by weakness in the European market.) Adjusted income from such division increased 4.8 percent from the year-ago quarter to $351 million due to higher volumes and favorable prices.The company's power solutions division revenues decreased 6 percent to $1.7 billion (Excluding adverse currency effects, revenues increased 3 percent.). Adjusted income for such division was $340 million, a 5 percent from the year-ago quarter.JCI expects earnings per share in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 to be in the range of 80 to 83 cents, an 8 percent to 12 percent increase from the year-ago quarter.Our viewJCI's most recent transformational actions, as noted above, are the company's most significant to date. Each of the company's divestitures or acquisitions will allow it to exit low-margin businesses and enter higher margin businesses. In addition, the company's exiting the automotive interiors business will allow it to exit a highly cyclical capital-intensive business. As JCI's transformation begins to show bottom-line results, it will then be able to capitalize on future trends, such as the energy efficiency concerns of office tower owners and energy efficient battery technology. JCI's current price-to-earnings ratio is 26.95. Earnings estimates for JCI are $3.85 for fiscal year 2016 and $4.33 for its fiscal year 2017. Earnings estimates for both years have fallen in recent months. JCI's shares are trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 11.95 based on fiscal year 2016 earnings estimates and 10.60 based on fiscal year 2017 estimates. As JCI's transformation increases its profit margins, its forward price-to-earnings ratio should increase to about 15. A higher price-to-earnings ratio for JCI would be more in line with the price-to-earnings ratios of JCI's competitors. With that said, an individual investor might want to wait for JCI to drop to a share price between $40.40 and $44.80 (a price-to-earnings ratio ranging from 10.50 to 11.65 based on 2016 earnings estimates) to establish a full position. Over the long term, JCI's near-term transformative actions will rewarding-term investors with increasing dividends, substantial share repurchases and a rising share price."
3629846,95526,2015-10-31T15:25:12-04:00,"JCI announced that the spinoff of the Automotive Experience division will occur on October 1, 2016.The Building Efficiency division is moving toward a ""product sale and distribution"" model that will begin to overlap more with the offerings in the Power Solutions division.The sale of Absorbent Glass Mat batteries for stop-start automotive power-trains is exceeding JCI's current manufacturing capacity. JCI is investing heavily in increased AGM manufacturing capacity.","1. Johnson Controls, Inc. (NYSE:JCI) CEO Alex Molinaroli announced that the spinoff of the Automotive Experience division is planned to take effect on October 1, 2016. This is the first time the company has publicly given a specific date for the spin.Takeaway: The announced spinoff date indicates the process is taking slightly longer than initially hoped but is still within a reasonable amount of time given the complexities of disengaging a portion of the company and concurrently setting it up as a fully independent entity.2. The Building Efficiency division is moving toward more of a product sale and distribution model and away from a project orientation.CEO Molinaroli:The company is also making a concerted effort to bring more (i.e. different) products to market through both the Building Efficiency and Power Solutions divisions to expand the number of total product channels-to-market. A primary example of this is the VRF (Variable Refrigerant Flow) product line through the JV with Hitachi (OTCPK:HTHIY).The recently launched lithium-ion distributed energy storage solution is an example of a technology developed in the Power Solutions division which will be distributed through the Building Efficiency division. This is likely to be a growing theme as Building Efficiency and Power Solutions' functions continue to increasingly overlap over time.Takeaway: Johnson Controls is undergoing a significant strategic shift towards a production and distribution business model. By focusing on developing more individual products and how they are distributed to market, JCI is playing to its historic strengths in developing efficient manufacturing processes and supply chain management rather than maintaining a dependence on larger construction and infrastructure projects, the undertaking and execution of which can be largely out of JCI's control.3. Absorbent Glass Mat battery sales are increasing beyond JCI's current manufacturing capacity. Sales of AGM batteries are up 44% YoY to roughly 2.9 million for the 4Q15. (Note: JCI accounts for the period July to September as 4Q rather than 3Q). The limiting factor is manufacturing capacity, not market demand. JCI is in the process of significantly expanding AGM manufacturing capacity.CEO Molinaroli:Takeaway: Absorbent Glass Mat batteries have a huge future in the automotive industry and JCI will be pursuing a market leading position as one of its primary strategic objectives. This is one of the areas of JCI's business that should benefit from decoupling with the Automotive Experience division from a resource and cash allocation standpoint.4. Building Efficiency division orders for the North American Federal Government market was down a whopping 37% in the 4th quarter due in large part to the budget fight in the U.S. Congress. Mr. Molinaroli said he believes some of this business may still be filled, but much of it likely won't, even if a budget deal is reached.CEO Molinaroli:Takeaway: This underscores one of the reasons for JCI moving toward a product and distribution orientation rather than a project by project approach. If the funding for a given project is pulled or does not come through, there really isn't much recourse, especially if dealing with governmental entities. Governmental work is a two-edged sword - it is steady, guaranteed work over time (governmental entities need facilities from which to operate), but it is also subject to political considerations (see: any daily news source anywhere).5. JCI is seeing more ""pull-through"" activity related to the sale of the Global Workplace Solutions (GWS) division to CBRE than originally expected and the increased activity began before the sale was even complete. (i.e. JCI is receiving more tangential business tied to the sale of GWS than it had thought it would.)Takeaway: This is just a nice piece of unanticipated upside.6. CEO Molinaroli:Takeaway: The emphasis on ""personalization"" is encouraging, given that Millennials seem to genuinely favor having many options to put their own individual stamps on things. (As a Gen Xer, I have to say I appreciate the Millennials pushing this trend.)It's also interesting to hear the comment about how autonomous driving will eventually impact the interior/seating industry. Mr. Molinaroli didn't have anything more to say on this subject during the call, but given the seeming inevitability of the self-driving vehicle, I would anticipate hearing more about this topic in the future.7. Chief Financial Officer Brian Stief:Takeaway: This is the discussion of the financial impact of the spinoff and forex on the corporate bottom line and it shows that the costs are not inconsequential. However, the silver lining is that if those expenses are backed out, business is improving overall company wide.8. CFO Stief:Takeaway: Expect headwinds to profitability due to continued untangling of the Automotive Experience division into a stand-alone corporation next year. However, anticipated EPS looks strong YoY.OVERALL TAKEAWAY: An okay-but-not-great quarter from a financial standpoint given that Johnson Controls is going through some massive reorganization relating to not only the spinoff of the Automotive Experience division but also changing the focus of the Power Solutions and Building Efficiency divisions from a project orientation to a production and distribution model.There isn't any getting around the fact that the 37% decrease in North American Federal Government projects is ugly, and Mr. Molinaroli's comments about JCI being caught unaware doesn't really cut the mustard when talking about such a large corporation with such significant ties to the federal government. However, it is fair to point out the recent fight over the federal budget has been pretty nasty and some collateral fallout is to be expected.Batteries, batteries, batteries. In a long-ago era, a man once gave a one-word piece of advice to a younger man looking to make his fortune: ""PLASTICS."" Well, today that word is ""BATTERIES."" It's pretty clear that JCI is pushing full blast into this market and intends to be a market leader going forward.Overall, I like the thinking behind the shift to a product focus and believe the spinoff of the Automotive Experience division is the correct move at the correct time, assuming proceeds from the spinoff find their way to the JCI RemainCo. (i.e. Power Solutions and Building Efficiency) in order to fund an aggressive growth strategy.2016 will likely provide more headwinds related to the spinoff/restructuring, but once completed, JCI will be a leaner manufacturing and supply chain oriented business with a massive opportunity in front of it.FULL TRANSCRIPT HEREJohnson Controls will hold an Analyst Day on December 1, 2015 in New York City and management has indicated more detailed information on various company initiatives will be presented and discussed at that time.The author is LONG JCIThe preceding article is provided for informational purposes only and should not be regarded as formal investment or financial advice.

3763696,76115,2015-12-17T17:45:33-05:00,"Johnson Controls Inc. is currently undervalued on a trailing and forward looking basis.With guidance from management calling for growth of 11% next year, this long-time industrial is growing profits healthily once again.Much of this is due to the breaking away of lower margin businesses like their automotive interiors division. This breaking away includes a spin-off of their remaining automotive business.By divesting their low margin businesses it will allow Johnson Controls to reward shareholders with larger bottom-line growth and higher dividends.","I have owned Johnson Controls Inc (NYSE:JCI) for most of my life; well before I was even able to say the word ""stock."" It has performed exceedingly well and has rewarded me with a mature holding with a great yield on cost. I continue to hold JCI not because I am emotionally attached to it but because I feel the company has continued to reinvest in itself and has long-term plans to continue to reward shareholders.In this article I want to focus on why JCI is both undervalued today on a fundamental basis and why it is a great holding for someone looking to start or add to a position in the stock. I believe that someone buying today will be buying at a great price that could see growing dividends as well as capital appreciation by way of the company's reinvestments. Additionally, plans to spin-off other businesses to shareholders will ultimately will unlock value for years to come.As I write, the stock price of Johnson Controls has moved back down toward the high $30s range. At first this is concerning for me because it recently was closer to the low to mid 50s not more than 6 months ago. This rise was prior to great guidance - which I'll get to shortly - and plans to divest low margin businesses which will allow the company to grow faster than it has in recent years. In essence the stock has become undervalued on a price basis while the company has added more value today and plans of value in the near future.I first want to focus on the P/E ratio as well as the margins of the company in recent years. Additionally, I'll look at the company's historic levels and then move onto its competitors and their current valuation levels.Johnson Controls Evaluated On An Individual BasisCurrently, the stock sports a P/E ratio of 11.4 based on an EPS of 3.42, excluding non-recurring items. Since the company's fiscal year ends in September this EPS is based on the trailing 12 months in that fiscal year. As we can see EPS has grown nicely from the prior year:(Source: Johnson Controls Inc. Q4 Earnings Release, Slide 4)Historically JCI has an average P/E ratio of 13.3 as shown below in the F.A.S.T. Graphs representation:Based on these two numbers alone the stock should be trading for $45.48 or 16.6% higher than it is now. However, this is based on trailing earnings and trailing fundamental metrics. Since the market is forward looking we need to adjust for what forward guidance is estimating.On December 1st management held an analyst meeting to discuss just that. For the 2016 fiscal year management expects EPS of $3.80 at the mid-point of their range. This would give the stock a forward P/E ratio of 10.7 and a stock value of $50.54 or 29.5% more than it is today based on the historic 13.3 average P/E ratio.Now I would use revenue based fundamentals to value JCI but because the company has continually divested lower margin businesses over the last several years it makes it difficult to reconcile it to present revenues in regards to valuation. Revenues have wavered over the last few years but profit has grown as shown by the below chart.This is, like I said, due to the transformation and refocusing of the company. Instead, however, I will focus on gross profit margins and dividend coverage to further evaluate the health of the company and how it relates to the stock price.What I'll be getting into first is the increase in profit margins over the last 10 years. According to the below chart the company's margins are at the highest they have been in this time frame. This is clearly visible elsewhere as there has been a low double digit increase in earnings over the last two to three years.As for their dividend payout ratio and other capital returned to shareholders, JCI has done very well. Their current dividend coverage is just over 30% using the prior $0.26 per quarter dividend and the last full year's EPS of $3.42. Based on the new 11.5% dividend raise to $0.29 per quarter and the estimated $3.80 EPS the coverage is identical going into next year. If we also factor in the share repurchases of $1.4B this past year, which equates to $2.11 per share, then the company is left with $0.27 per share or $178.6M left for other financial activities. In other words the company pays out 92% of cash to shareholders, showing that it can support rewarding shareholders today and into the next year.This factors into the stock price by recognizing the current yield relative to its historical yield. The present yield is 2.98% which is higher than the company's average which is right around 2%. If the stock price were to revert to the 2% yield area the stock would be valued at around $56 per share. With no dividend coverage worries, the higher dividend yield is an attractive sign for investors on both the income level and capital appreciation front.In Relation To Its PeersNext, I want to move on to how the company compares to its competitors. The interesting thing here is that Johnson Controls is usually labeled as an auto parts provider of some kind. While this is true for some of their businesses, it doesn't completely encompass their collective businesses. JCI is mostly in the building efficiency business along with their automotive battery manufacturing and related technology business. The remaining business deals with automotive interiors, but as I'll soon get to that, is quickly being removed to unlock value on its own.Therefore, I will be using a diversified group of competitors to make the comparison. These companies are Honeywell (NYSE:HON), ABB Ltd (NYSE:ABB), and Magna International (NYSE:MGA). Each of these companies has specifics in each corner of Johnson Controls' businesses but I believe they give a nice overview and give a rounded out comparison.To prevent information overload let's take a look at P/E first and then move to dividend payout and other fundamentals.Based on P/E ratios JCI is undervalued by an average 17% in stock price if we average the premiums of its competitors. Interestingly enough this aligns almost perfectly with JCI's average P/E of 13.3 and seems to be another pillar in the undervalued thesis.Moving on to dividend coverage we can understand how JCI compares to its peers as well.JCI seems to be in a very comfortable position relative to its peers when it comes to its dividend, its coverage, and its TTM yield (based on last dividend paid and trailing EPS, not based on newly announced increases from each company).Keep in mind that JCI raised its dividend 11.5%, as I mentioned before, while keeping its forward coverage the same and increased the forward yield to 2.95%. In comparison HON increased its dividend 14.4% and a forward yield of 2.31%. The payout ratio increased slightly to 36.33%. While not a real problem for HON shareholders, the current yield doesn't reach JCI's and increases the payout ratio, unlike JCI's increase.Spin-Offs And Unlocking Shareholder ValueOver the last few years Johnson Controls has taken steps to divest themselves from their lower performing, low margin businesses. This is good for shareholders as the company will focus on their higher margin building efficiency business and their high demand automotive batteries and energy storage division.Some of their beginnings of divestiture was their Global Workplace Solutions ('GWS') which was sold to CBRE Group. While this seemed to be a core component to its company, it had begun to realize a downward trend on revenues and the business itself had low margins even in times of revenue growth. Management felt that this was a start to leaning itself toward higher margin, in demand businesses. Some of the revenue decline within JCI in the last two years is partial to this agreement which finalized this year.Similarly, Johnson Controls sold their automotive electronics business to Visteon (NYSE:VC) in January of 2014 for $265M in cash. This is important to note because the automotive business has been exceptionally cyclical and is something that CEO Alex Molinaroli had been looking to eliminate in part of his strategy to follow through on diversifying the company's portfolio. Molinaroli had this to say at an Executive Summit this year:In the last year we have seen these steps taken by way of their joint venture with Yanfeng Automotive Trim Systems. In this case the venture will be 70% owned by Yanfeng and 30% owned by JCI. By doing this Johson Controls will remove a considerable amount of their ownership in this lower margin business but still use a joint operation to produce the largest automotive interiors company in the world.On top of this, and just in the last few months, the company has taken their strategy further to say they will spin off the entire automotive experience business which includes the joint venture with Yanfeng as well as their seating division. I think the key to point out here is that JCI has been taking steps in quick but strategically timed moments. By doing this in the way they have it has allowed the business to reach equilibrium at each step. With the venture agreement they reduced their revenue but also their capital investment in the business. Then, they allowed a few quarters of equilibrium to bring it to the next stage of fully spinning off that business. Instead of shocking the overall business and stock they have reduced liabilities in a manner that allows for less negative impact to the company's income and stock.The spinoff, which is planned for October of next year, will be done in a manner where shareholders reap the rewards as owners in the new company. The company is going about it in such a way that shareholders will retain the equity of that business and not lose the growing, higher margin company aligned for more growth. In fact William Blair & Co. said, ""Johnson Controls' exposure to the volatile automotive industry causes its stock to trade at about a 25% discount to the broader market."" If this is accurate then JCI should revert to the real market value it deserves; in a word: unlocked value.Taking this unlocked value a step further we realize that the company will not just sit idly by and not reinvest that newly found capital freedom. In fact, we can take what has happened already and what is happening right now to know that this is the exact strategy management is pursuing. Last year the company bought Texas based Air Distribution Technologies. More recently the company is looking to buy EnerSys which produces batteries and creates an extension to JCI's energy storage business. Moreover, the synergies between JCI's current battery manufacturing and the reach that EnerSys will bring creates an opportunity to have a greater supply of lead to be used in the battery manufacturing process.These couple of events are important to consider. First, the automotive interiors and seating business has a margin of around 5%. The divestiture of that business allows room for the margins of the building efficiency and energy storage, which are 6.6% and 15%, respectively, to flourish and be the leading driver of the company and its profitability. This is the definition of unlocking shareholder value if I have ever seen it.Investment ThesisBetween the market currently discounting the stock by over 15% on a fundamental basis and the shareholder value that is being unlocked with much more to still come, Johnson Controls is a company and stock that is very much worth considering. With margins expanding, less profitable businesses being sold or spun-off, a dividend that is secure and growing, there is a lot to like about JCI's future.Investors looking for an entrance into the stock or looking to add to their holdings are well served by buying at levels here in the high $30s near 52-week lows. With a current near 3% yield, there is a buy and wait strategy that pays. The planned spinoff that is scheduled to occur in October of next year will allow investors to settle in and not only collect three quarters of dividends but also be ready to receive the newly formed public company to come out of the core company.Overall, management of Johnson Controls is very active in reforming and improving the company. The best piece of information I read while doing research on this company is what I'll leave readers with in closing:"
3619716,95526,2015-10-29T11:58:18-04:00,"Johnson Controls Inc. (JCI) has announced a spin-off of its Automotive Experience division into a stand-alone company. The spin-off is anticipated to be completed by 3Q2016.
        The JCI “RemainCo.” will consist of the Power Solutions Division and the Building Efficiency Division.
        The Automotive Experience spin-off will pay a dividend-to-be-determined which will help fund growth and development of the “RemainCo.”.

It is intentionally more narrative than numerical and includes numerous links to additional (external) sources of information. It is not intended or represented as comprehensive in nature, nor is it intended as specific advice regarding any corporation or investment decision.-----------On June 10, 2015, Johnson Controls, Inc. (NYSE:JCI) announced it will be pursuing a spin-off of the company's Automotive Experience division, which manufactures seating systems and interiors for a range of automotive vehicles globally, into a stand-alone company, with the JCI RemainCo. to consist of the company's existing Power Solutions and Building Efficiency Divisions. The spin-off is expected to close by 3Q16. While it may be initially puzzling that one of the largest automotive parts manufacturers/suppliers in the world has chosen to divest its largest automotive parts division (seemingly in favor of the decidedly non-automotive parts-ish Building Efficiency division) the history and name of the company itself provide solid clues as to what may lie (in part) behind the decision and the direction it may be looking to take moving forward.___________________________________With total corporate revenue of just under $43 billion in FY 2014 and with a current market capitalization of around $26.5 billion, Milwaukee, Wisconsin based Johnson Controls, Inc. (JCI) is a global multi-industrial that operates in three divisions: Automotive Experience ($22 billion in 2014 revenue/51% of total corporate revenue), Power Solutions ($6.6 billion in 2014 revenue/16% of total corporate revenue), and Building Efficiency ($14.2 billion in 2014 revenue/33% of total corporate revenue). While the initial temptation may be to see an auto parts manufacturer (Automotive Experience and automotive battery manufacturing Power Solutions) combined with a Building Efficiency division that doesn't quite seem to fit, a quick review of JCI corporate history tells a different story.JCI (Thumbnail) Corporate HistoryFounded in 1885 as ""Johnson Electric Service Company"" by Warren Johnson in order to facilitate the commercialization of the first electric thermostats, until 1977 the company focused almost exclusively on temperature controls for non-residential buildings (the name ""Johnson Controls, Inc."" was adopted in 1974). Beginning in 1978, JCI began a new direction with its businesses by acquiring Wisconsin based automobile battery manufacturer/supplier Globe Union, Inc. A few years later, JCI developed the Integrated Facilities Management (IFM) system, which offered building control customers an integrated control system for virtually every type of mechanical and electrical system required for comprehensive building and facilities management from a single platform. In 1985, Johnson Controls purchased Michigan based Hoover Universal, Inc., a manufacturer and supplier of automotive seating components, and the company set about consolidating a highly fragmented automotive seating industry via additional acquisitions and the development and implementation of efficient supply chain and manufacturing processes.30 years later JCI finds itself at the end of that consolidation process, and it appears the time has come for JCI to evolve yet again. Having created the largest, most comprehensive automotive seating manufacturer/supplier on the planet and having helped bring relative global efficiency and lower costs to a fragmented market, JCI is now comprised of two distinct types of businesses: one half of corporate revenue comes from a mature, high-volume, low-margin, low growth, highly cyclical industry (Automotive Experience), and the other half from higher margin, high growth markets (Power Solutions and Building Efficiency) that still present tremendous opportunities for consolidation, expansion and innovation.Automotive Experience DivisionThe JCI Automotive Experience division consists of two primary components. The first is a 30% ownership interest in a joint venture with Chinese manufacturer Yanfeng to produce Automotive Interiors for most of the major global auto manufacturers (to one degree or another), and includes manufacture of instrumentation panels, door panels, and interior lighting among other comprehensive interior offerings. The venture was to have commenced on July 1, 2015 and is anticipated to generate more than $3 billion in revenue for JCI in the next fiscal year.The second, and largest single JCI division by sales volume (by far), is the Automotive Seating division, which is also the largest automotive seating manufacturer/supplier in the world, claiming 40% of total global sales in 2014. The Automotive Seating division leans heavily on massive scale and well managed supply chains and manufacturing processes to generate cost advantages that make JCI the global # 1 by sales volume for not only complete, built-to-spec automotive seating systems, but virtually every individual component (such as foam, fabric and metals), and combination of required components, for automakers that choose to handle seating manufacturing in-house. This market position as both the largest single manufacturer of complete automotive seating systems as well as the largest supplier of the raw (or minimally manufactured) individual automotive seating system components gives this division a commanding long-term market presence in this industry.Power Solutions DivisionThe Power Solutions division is the largest automotive battery manufacturer in the world. Among the 140 million+ batteries it produced in 2014, JCI claims a 35% global market share for lead acid automotive batteries, a leading position in Lithium-Ion batteries and a market leading position in Absorbent Glass Mat batteries .JCI Power Solutions produces Lead-Acid and Lithium-Ion batteries for passenger vehicles, motorcycles and powersports, light trucks, boats, heavy-duty industrial and utility vehicles among others. The batteries are sold under a variety of both JCI and private label brands around the world. While a percentage of these batteries end up in the original automakers' manufacturing process, the majority of battery sales are via aftermarket channels, through local auto parts suppliers, auto dealerships and repair shops, and both big box and online retailers.The value proposition for Power Solutions going forward appears to be on three fronts. The first is the overall increase in use of Lithium-Ion batteries in electric and electric-hybrid automotive power systems worldwide, a trend that is expected to increase in both the immediate and foreseeable future.The second, and probably bigger, opportunity is the solid product quality and manufacturing lead JCI Power Solutions enjoys in the Absorbent Glass Mat (NYSE:AGM) battery market (JCI has manufactured 28 million AGM batteries since 2007). This gives them a major competitive advantage as the number of stop-start powertrains continues to increase. The engineering complexities of a stop-start powertrain are both beyond the scope of this article and the competence of the author to understand or convey with any semblance of cohesion or competence, but the basic take-away for laymen (like the author) is that the stop-start powertrain is designed to provide 5+% fuel economy by shutting a vehicle's engine off when idling (such as at a traffic light) and then starting the engine up again when needed (with little to no noticeable""lag""). While the engine is ""stopped"", all of the various electronic components in the vehicle draw their power from the AGM battery, which also must be able to handle a larger number of starts and stops than ""normal"" batteries.JCI is expanding overall battery production capacity, with a specific emphasis on increasing AGM production capacity. The company is spending about $250 million to expand its AGM plant in Germany, and a total of $130 million for a plant in the US (Toledo, Ohio). There are additional plans to expand/build a new plant in China.Finally, the scope of the Power Solutions manufacturing operations is so large that JCI is able to glean substantial efficiencies through battery recycling programs that allow them to re-capture a portion of the raw materials used in the manufacturing process, which results in incrementally lower input costs that become incrementally larger the more batteries they reclaim.Taken together, Power Solutions and Automotive Experience should generate close to $30 billion in sales in 2015, and account for roughly 2/3 of JCI's total business. It's no wonder Johnson Controls is generally classified as an ""Auto Parts"" company in the ""Consumer Discretionary"" market sector. However, as already discussed, the company's roots truly lie in the third division, Building Efficiency.Building Efficiency DivisionJCI began life as a company focused on temperature controls for non-residential buildings and eventually evolved into a company with a comprehensive, integrated energy and system management focus. Today, according to the company's website, the Building Efficiency Division is a ""leading provider of equipment, controls and services for heating, ventilating, air-conditioning, refrigeration (HVAC) and security systems for buildings (both residential and commercial).""A representative sample of recent projects mentioned on the JCI website include: Retrofitting the Empire State Building to make it 38% more energy efficient; Partnering with Hyatt Regency in Guiyang, China to achieve LEED-Gold certification; Supplying Dubai's Burj Khalifa with an integrated security system, including cameras, intercoms and fire detection for the tower's 164 floors (which, if you saw Mission Impossible- Ghost Protocol, didn't seem to be turned on… but I digress); and Retrofitting 83,000 sq. meters of property owned by the Victorian Department of Treasury and Finance in Australia to reduce energy use by 33%, water use by 8% and greenhouse gas (NYSE:GHG) emissions by 9,400 tons annually.In March, 2015, JCI announced the sale of its Global Workforce Solutions Division (GWS) to CBRE in a deal worth an estimated $1.5 billion and which includes a ten year strategic partnership for JCI to provide building efficiency products and services for the 1.2 billion square feet of commercial property managed by GWS that were sold to CBRE.On October 1, 2015, JCI announced it has entered into a JV with Hitachi Ltd. of Japan in which JCI will own 60% of Hitachi's air conditioning equipment business (valued at around $525 million, +/- $25 million). The value of this JV to JCI is the access to Hitachi's Variable Refrigerant Flow technology, which reduces energy requirements for building heating and cooling. This JV is expected to generate $2.8 billion in 2016 sales and will be especially (though not exclusively) focused on the North American and Chinese construction industries, which represent significant growth opportunities over the intermediate to long term. (Many of the systems JCI offers can be incorporated into existing structures, offsetting at least some concerns about a slowdown in infrastructure spending in China.)Potential EnerSys AcquisitionIn addition, recent reports indicate JCI has shown interest in pursuing an acquisition or other venture with EnerSys, a global, U.S. based manufacturer/supplier of industrial energy storage devices and batteries for applications for customers in aerospace, military, mining, and railroads among others. EnerSys is also a manufacturer of ""motive"" power- electric batteries for material handling equipment (such as electric hand-trucks used at major logistical hubs to move material instead of combustion powered vehicles). While it would have been appropriate to discuss this potential deal in the Power Solutions portion of this note, I believe this type of deal represents the future of JCI in that some of the products offered by EnerSys constitute the intersection of Power Solutions and Building Efficiency- standby and reserve power for buildings and facilities. These applications include backup power for data and telecommunication centers, medical facilities, and other facilities that absolutely must have a continuous flow of uninterrupted energy.The Automotive Experience Spin-OffAssuming JCI completes the spin-off of the Automotive Experience division, there is an interesting implication that could reap some decent returns for investors and also provide some solid diversity for your portfolio.As a stand-alone company, the equity issued upon a spin-off of the Automotive Experience division may end up serving as a de facto ETF that tracks global production of new automobiles. Because automobiles (and any vehicle, for that matter) generally only have one set of seats for the duration of the lifetime of the vehicle, it would stand to reason that the single largest manufacturer of automobile seating would closely track new automobile manufacturing worldwide. While growth is not expected to be particularly spectacular, there WILL be new automobiles manufactured for a very, very long time to come.However, because this is a business that is, of necessity, so closely tied to automotive manufacturers, the Automotive Experience supply chains have to accommodate the supply chains and manufacturing centers of the automakers themselves. Likewise, a good deal of staff and staff time must be devoted to coordinating with automakers on an ongoing basis to ensure appropriate integration of operations with constantly evolving automaker designs, assembly lines and production schedules. This is potentially at odds with the Power Supply and Building Efficiency divisions supply chain and customer relation requirements- automotive batteries are required virtually anywhere you find automobiles, and Building Efficiency likewise requires more diffused operations.In addition, while it does operate on a massive scale, the Automotive Experience division also operates in a relatively low margin, low growth industry. While likely to remain relatively stable, there won't be a huge amount of upside potential in the global automotive manufacturing for a company that already has 40% of the global seating business. Profits can be paid back to investors as dividends or stock repurchases rather than used to pursue growth opportunities or invested in R&D.Any potential spin-off of the Automotive Experience division will result in a dividend of some kind being paid to the JCI RemainCo itself. These funds can be used to expand Building Efficiency and Power Solutions, while allowing both the Automotive Experience division and Building Efficiency/Power Solutions divisions to pursue their own independent business plans and strategies that are most appropriate to the type of business they are in.(On October 27, 2015, CEO Alex Molinaroli announced that the as yet unnamed spin-off will remain headquartered in Milwaukee, post spin.)The ""JCI RemainCo.""The Power Solutions and Building Efficiency divisions both offer not only individual divisional growth along current product and service lines, but also, in my opinion, some potentially significant opportunities for overlap. As previously discussed, the potential acquisition or JV with industrial energy storage company EnerSys would give JCI RemainCo a solid position in backup facility power management.A more interesting opportunity, as I see it, is that as buildings and facilities continue adding more alternative energy sources to their infrastructures, the possibility of creating autonomous facilities that are totally energy self sufficient will increase. The main issue with most alternative energy sources is that there is no broadly efficient or practical way to store the energy created from the sources when these sources are not available (think about the sun at night or the wind on a calm day).A very logical step for the Building Efficiency division/Power Solutions division to investigate and research in combination is the (eventual) practicality of manufacturing battery storage systems that will allow buildings and facilities to utilize stored alternative energy. This would not only add an additional layer of energy security for facilities such as hospitals and data centers which simply cannot afford to have power interruptions, but also allow for MOBILE facilities, such as a military Forward Operating Base (FOB), to provide more autonomous power in situations where logistics or other issues may prevent adequate outside energy supply. Eventually, such alternative energy storage systems could potentially lead to much more widespread ability to take sufficient power anywhere, even for something as simple as a camping trip.I realize that storage of alternative energy is one of the Golden Fleeces of our time and that other companies are already at work on this issue. (Tesla Motors comes immediately to mind with its home Powerwall system). The potential acquisition/JV/??? with EnerSys provides some intriguing possibilities along these lines. It would come as no surprise to me if, at some point in the near or intermediate future, JCI were to announce additional acquisitions or JVs with companies that are more directly involved with the alternative energy market, such as a solar cell or wind turbine manufacturer. But, that is a statement of pure conjecture on my part at this time. Food for thought...AddendumOn October 26, an article appeared in the AP that indicated the CEO of JCI has had past personal dealings with an individual convicted of running a Ponzi scheme. Mr. Molinaroli has denied that the relationship involved the use of any JCI corporate funds (and a subsequent investigation has backed his assertion), however, individual investors should make their own decisions as to the materiality of the issues detailed in the linked article.The author is LONG JCI.The author is not a professional or licensed investment or financial advisor and the preceding article is intended for informational purposes only.

3508466,67855,2015-09-15T10:38:24-04:00,"The company operates in two non-related industries.
        The automotive experience segment is not very profitable.
        The planned spinoff of the automotive experience segment may allow investors to focus on the more lucrative power solutions segment.","Johnson Controls Inc. (NYSE: JCI) is a diversified industrial company that specializes in energy efficiency optimization and various automobile components. The company has a long history dating back to 1885, when it was just a company that serviced automatic temperature regulation systems. As the company expanded, the firm acquired Globe-Union and Hoover Universal, which manufactured automotive batteries and automotive seats, respectively. These acquisitions led to what we see today, a company that essentially operates in two completely non-related industries. Unfortunately, shareholders aren't having a good year. Since June, the stock has shed 24%, causing shares to decline from $52.70 to $40.28. Is this rout justified?The BusinessThe company is separated into three segments: building efficiency, automotive experience, and power solutions. The building efficiency segment has a comprehensive service and product offering that is designed to improve the energy efficiency of both residential and non-residential buildings. In 2014, around 45% of the segment revenue was derived from products, meaning that there is a strong link between this segment's performance and the construction market. This volatility was offset by servicing revenue, which accounted for the other 55%. Combining these two revenue sources together provides the company with fairly stable demand from year to year. To illustrate, segment revenue was little changed from 2012 to 2014, hovering around $14.5 billion.Automotive experience is the segment that manufactures seating and interior systems. This segment was able to piggyback the auto market in recent years and has shown modest growth, as revenue increased from $20 billion in 2012 to $22 billion in 2014. The company's power solutions segment is the world's largest producer of lead-acid automotive batteries. Out of all the segments, I believe that the power solutions segment is the most stable, as 74% of its revenue is derived from the replacement market, providing a source of recurring revenue.The FinancialsThe automotive experience segment accounts for the highest proportion of sales (51% in 2014), however, it accounts for the lowest profit on an absolute basis. This sharply contrasts with the power solutions segment, which constituted 15% of net sales in 2014, but generated 37% of the total segment income. As mentioned earlier, the building efficiency segment is fairly stable. In 2014, the segment provided $930 million of operating profit and I would expect this level of performance to continue.The company also has a very solid balance sheet. Typically we would expect a high level of debt for such a diversified industrial company, this is not the case here. As of Q3 2015 (ended June), the company only had $6.5 billion worth of debt, versus $32 billion in assets. From a coverage perspective, I would even argue that the company is underlevered. Looking at Q3 results, EBIT/interest expense was at 11x!The SpinoffIn July, the company announced the intention to spinoff of the automotive experience segment. This doesn't really impact the intrinsic value of the company as it stands, but the spinoff could create value for existing shareholders. There isn't too much information on this yet as the management is still hammering out the details, but I believe this transaction will allow investors to better appreciate the company's power solutions segment. As stated previously, the automotive experience segment has very poor profitability. Despite having the second largest asset base and the largest share of revenue, the segment produced the lowest profit. This means that the return on capital is low. On the other hand, the battery segment is highly profitable, and is still growing. In fact, the company recently announced the building of a new battery factory in China. Evidently, the management is placing more emphasis on this lucrative business. By separating the ""poorly"" (relatively speaking) performing automotive experience segment, hopefully investors can focus more on the power solutions segment. All in all, I do not see anything wrong with the business, and with a spinoff planned for the near future, you may wish to pick up some cheap shares made available by the recent pull-back.Potential RisksFundamentally, I do not see any macro-trends that could significantly undermine the company's profitability (short of a global economic meltdown). While a poor construction market could impact the building efficiency segment, it will be offset by servicing revenue. In addition, the construction business is cyclical in nature, and as long as the company is not overlevered (which clearly isn't the case right now), it should be able to weather any temporary downturns. Finally, once the spinoff is completed, there may be temporary increased selling pressure as some funds may be forced to liquidate if the spun off entities no longer meet their mandate (in terms of market cap, liquidity, whether it belongs to the tracked index, etc.)"
3984321,67985,2016-06-26T05:01:00-04:00,"The company’s merger with Tyco will create a company with complementary products/services with customer/geographic overlap and significant revenue and cost synergies.The merged company will also drive growth through product cross-selling and complementary distribution networks.The new company, Johnson Controls plc, will save at least $150 million in annual taxes and $500 million in other synergies over the next three years.The company’s spin-off of its automotive experience business, known as Adient, is its most significant effort to exit low margin businesses and focus on higher margin businesses.The company’s transformation to higher margin businesses will reward investors with share price appreciation, dividend increases and a tax bill when the Tyco merger closes.","We are less than thrilled with Johnson Controls' (NYSE:JCI) actions over the past several months to ""enhance"" shareholder value through a tax inversion acquisition of Tyco International plc (TYC) and the spin-off of its automotive seating and interiors businesses into a United Kingdom based company. Our trepidation with the JCI and TYC merger is principally based on the tax bill that is coming our way when the deal closes. As our readers may know, when a tax inversion closes, shareholders of the company inverting to an overseas tax location are hit with a tax bill as if shareholders sold the stock. We bought our JCI shares at about $29 and $12 in the 2008-09 time frame so we are expecting a long-term capital gains tax on our several thousand dollar tax gain. Although we see tax inversions as a gimmick for U.S. companies to boost their profits without actually improving business operations, we have to move forward as JCI shareholders.JCI's merger with TYC and spin-off of its automotive seating and interiors businesses are the company's latest steps in the continuation of its strategy to exit its low-margin industrial businesses to focus on less cyclical higher margin markets that are experiencing faster growth rates. In recent years, the company has announced multiple deals in an effort to accomplish such strategy: 1) the company announced the sale of its Global WorkPlace Solutions business; 2) the company and Yanfeng Automotive Trim Systems Co., Ltd. announced a global automotive interiors joint venture whereby JCI will spin-off its low-margin, slow-growth automotive interiors business into a joint venture; and 3) the company announced the spin-off of its automotive experience business in a tax-free transaction. In addition to such divestitures, the company initiated a comprehensive cost savings program. JCI has taken these steps in recent years because it has been unable to achieve consistent revenue growth despite operational improvements across all of its businesses. Given the company's lack of consistent revenue and earnings growth, investors have assigned a price-to-earnings multiple to JCI that is lower than the price-to-earnings ratio assigned to its competitors.Early in 2016, JCI announced its merger with Ireland-based TYC, a fire and security provider, in a tax-inversion agreement of $20 billion. The merger agreement takes the form of a reverse takeover whereby TYC's investors will receive 0.955 shares of the combined entity for each share held and own 44 percent stake in the new entity, while shareholders of JCI will keep the remaining stake and receive an additional $3.9 billion in cash. JCI, to be known as Johnson Controls plc, will re-domicile in lower tax rate Ireland and save at least $150 million in annual taxes and $500 million in other synergies over the next three years. JCI offers products that include HVAC equipment and controls, automotive interiors and battery manufacturing, while TYC offers fire-safety and security products and services. Investors approved of the deal noting that each company offers complementary product and services with customer and geography overlap along with significant revenue and cost synergies. The combined JCI-TYC will also be able to drive growth through cross-selling of products and complementary distribution networks. We agree that the deal offers the opportunity for tax and operational cost savings and cross-selling of each company's products.The second recent significant step in JCI's transformation towards higher growth higher margin businesses is its spin-off of its automotive seating and interiors businesses into a independently traded company. The spin-off company, named Adient (to trade as ""ADNT""), will have $20 billion in annual revenues. Each JCI shareholder will receive one Adient share for every ten shares of JCI held at the close of business on the distribution record date. ADNT, upon separation, will be the global leading manufacturer of car seats and interior components with $20 billion in 2015 revenues. With a London, U.K., tax-based headquarters, ADNT will lower its corporate tax rate of 10 percent to 12 percent, down from the 17 percent JCI paid recently in the U.S. Upon separation, ADNT expects to initiate new strategies to drive improved revenue growth and profitability in addition to strong cash flows. ADNT also expects to increase its investments in innovation to grow market share. The spin-off of a business division, such as ADNT, generally leads to a substantial increase in the combined value of the two resulting companies' shares (here JCI and ADNT) given that the management of each resulting company improves the capital allocation of the respective companies and focuses on each company's strengths.Once the JCI spins off ADNT and completes its merger with TYC, the company will continue to emphasize its market-leading building business that includes its York-brand heating and air conditioning equipment for commercial buildings, and on its devices for monitoring and regulating electricity usage, temperature, fire safety and security. The company will also be able to focus on its very profitable automotive battery business that will benefit from fuel economy regulations due to its expertise in advanced lead-acid battery technology. We should also note that JCI's exit from the automotive seating market allows it to exit a cyclical business that is too capital intensive. We believe that investors should consider JCI's shares, which yield about 2.6 percent, during an overall market selloff. With the ADNT spin-off soon to be behind it and the TYC acquisition and integration upcoming, JCI will show improved results with respect to revenue and earnings growth, and the company's shares will be assigned a price-to-earnings ratio more in line with the company's competitors.Fiscal second quarter 2016 earningsIn its late April 2016, JCI announced adjusted earnings of 86 cents, an 18 percent increase from the year-ago quarter (Results for 2015 were adjusted as the company classified its global workplace solutions business as a discontinued operation). The company's revenues were $9.03 billion, a 1.8 percent decrease from the year-ago quarter due to deconsolidation of the automotive interiors business and adverse currency effects. The company's revenues did, however, benefit from increased organic volumes and additional revenues generated from its joint venture with Hitachi.The company's automotive experience revenues decreased 18 percent from the year-ago quarter to $4.3 billion due to deconsolidation of the interiors business and adverse currency effects (Excluding such items, sales increased 2 percent). Income for the business increased 24 percent to $324 million due to higher seating volumes, restructuring savings and operational efficiencies. The company's building efficiency revenues increased 33 percent from the year-ago quarter to $3.2 billion (Excluding incremental revenue associated with the Hitachi joint venture and adverse currency effects revenues increased 3 percent due to improved results in North America and Asia). Income for the business increased 42 percent to $245 million due to higher revenues from the Hitachi joint venture and higher volumes. The company's power solutions revenues remained flat at $1.6 billion (Excluding adverse currency effects and lower lead pass-through costs revenues increased 5 percent). Income for the business was $264 million, flat with the year-ago quarter.JCI raised its fiscal 2016 earnings per share estimates to $3.85 to $4.00, up from earlier estimates from $3.70 to $3.90, due to stronger expected operating performance and lower annual effective tax rate.Our viewWe believe, as noted above, that JCI's merger with TYC is a winning combination. The combined company, Johnson Controls plc, will save at least $150 million by re-domiciling in lower tax rate Ireland and $500 million in additional synergies in the next three years. The combination of JCI's products, including HVAC equipment and controls, automotive interiors and battery manufacturing, with TYC's fire-safety and security products and services makes sense. Each company offers complementary product and services with customer and geography overlap along with significant revenue and cost synergies. The combined companies will drive growth by the cross-selling of products and complementary distribution networks. Each of JCI divestitures or acquisitions in recent years has allowed it to exit low-margin businesses and enter higher margin businesses. For example, the spin-off ADNT represents about half of current JCI revenue and has 5.8 percent margins in the last fiscal year, the lowest of JCI's three businesses. Without ADNT, JCI has 8 percent margins for its building systems business and 17 percent for its battery business. Therefore, JCI's overall margins will be about 12 percent.JCI's exiting the automotive interiors business will also allow it to exit a highly cyclical capital-intensive business. As JCI's transformation begins to show results, it will then be able to capitalize on future trends, such as the energy efficiency concerns of office tower owners and energy efficient battery technology. We should also note that Moody's credit rating service believes that JCI's merger with TYC will improve its business profile, earnings and cash flow but will materially increase TYC's financial leverage (TYC will incur $4 billion in debt to fund the cash consideration of the merger). Overall, Moody's believes that the merger will provide JCI with a leading position in the market for building services, strengthening its research, performance and profitability relative to competitors.Earnings estimates for JCI are $3.91 for fiscal year 2016 and $4.31 for its fiscal year 2017. JCI's shares are trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 10.95 based on fiscal year 2016 earnings estimates and 9.95 based on fiscal year 2017 estimates. As the integration of TYC into JCI moves forward and JCI's overall transformation continues, its profit margins will increase and its forward price-to-earnings ratio will rise to about 15. A higher price-to-earnings ratio for JCI would be more in line with the price-to-earnings ratios of JCI's competitors. While we believe investors could safely purchase JCI shares now for a long-term investment, we also believe that overall market volatility could continue and potential JCI investors could pick up the company's shares in the $35 to $39 price range. Over the long term, JCI's merger with TYC and other transformative actions will reward long-term investors with increasing dividends, substantial share repurchases and a rising share price. We should note, however, that given the economy is deep into the bull market recovery and that JCI is highly exposed to the cyclical non-residential construction and automotive end-markets, any weakness in the overall global economy will adversely effect JCI's businesses and shares.Click ""follow"" next to our contributor name at the top of this article to follow our upcoming articles on JCI and more."
3399875,69565,2015-08-06T03:39:45-04:00,"Shares of Tyco International are down more than 10% year-to-date as concerns over the strong dollar and the weakening of the oil industry have prevailed.Fundamentally Tyco is solid, and more importantly is improving on its operational efficiency metrics.The current valuation seems to discount Tyco’s growth potential as overly limited.","Shares of Tyco International (NYSE: TYC) are down more than 10% year-to-date, breaking a multi-year rally in the stock that took shares from trading around $10 at the start of 2009 to as high as $45 in mid-2014.Weakness in shares so far this year can be primarily traced back to the disappointing results and guidance issued back in April when the company reported its second quarter. Most recently, on July 29, Tyco reported third quarter financial results that missed on the top line but beat on EPS.With shares still down sizably for the year, it may be worth considering if current prices offer an attractive entry point for investors.Fundamental QualityTyco is a worldwide leader in providing security products and services, fire detection and suppression products and services and life safety products through its portfolio of brands that include Tyco, SimplexGrinnell, Sensormatic, Wormald, Ansul, Simplex, and ADT (outside of the United States). Despite the company's solid position in the worldwide market, the company's operational efficiency metrics are not as high as management would like them to be. Both the company's TTM operating margin of 4.65% and TTM return on equity of 8.47% trail the security & protection services industry averages. On the bright side, Tyco does generate $0.04 more in revenue for every dollar in assets than the average company operating in the industry.Meanwhile, looking at the company's balance sheet, no major concerns are raised. The company has $531 million in cash and cash equivalents and just over $2 billion in total debt as of last count. Overall, the company has a current ratio of 1.21 and a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.47, both of which indicate satisfactory financial strength.GrowthLooking to the past, Tyco's top and bottom line growth picture has been mixed, with EPS spending several years on the wrong side of zero, and there being a massive decrease in revenue associated with the company's spin-off of ADT and Pentair.TYC Revenue (Annual) data by YChartsMoving forward, analysts expect Tyco's top line to basically flat-line, with a marginal decrease expected this year and a marginal increase expected in 2016. On the bottom line, EPS is forecasted to go from $3.97 in 2014 to $2.23 this year and $2.35 in 2016. It is worth noting that disregarding income from discontinued operations, Tyco only earned $1.71 per share in 2014.Efforts to fuel the growth of tomorrow are centered around managing weakness in some key markets for the company, while at the same time, driving organic growth in revenue and margins.The macroeconomic environment that Tyco is currently operating in is mixed, with strength in the United States and emerging markets being balanced out by weakness in Australia and Europe. The immense weakness in the oil and gas industries is also carrying through to negatively impact Tyco, which generates roughly 5% of its overall revenue from that industry. In fiscal 2015, management expects revenue to be down approximately 15% in its oil & gas segment.Then you have the downward pressure created by the incredible strength that has been seen in the dollar. In the company's most-recently reported quarter, FX headwinds shaved $0.05 off of EPS, completely erasing the $0.05 benefit that came from growth in operations year-over-year.With those issues being highlighted, it is also worth noting that the company is undoubtedly trending in the right direction. The company currently has a $4.7 billion backlog and is continuing with cost-cutting actions and restructuring initiatives that will continue to yield benefits through fiscal 2016.ValuationWhile the above valuation profile may suggest that Tyco is heavily overvalued in comparison to its industry peers from a surface level, in reality, the company's price-to-earnings ratio is currently artificially inflated. Using the average 2015 EPS estimate of $2.23, Tyco only trades at roughly 17x forward earnings.As the company reports in coming quarters, I expect Tyco's valuation to normalize to levels more in-line with the industry averages. I see shares justified in trading as high as $45 (2015 EPS estimate * 20 P/E ratio) within the next year.The TakeawayTyco is facing substantial headwinds in the form of a strong dollar and a weak oil industry, but still I believe it to be unwarranted that shares are down 10% year-to-date. Fundamentally, the company is solid, and more importantly improving its efficiency metrics. Long term, the company has solid growth potential, thanks to its diverse and attractive collection of brands.Coupled with the fact that Tyco's valuation is discounted in comparison to its industry peers, I believe current prices offer an attractive entry point for investors. Personally, I look to open a position in the company in the coming days."
3253585,24063,2015-06-11T18:08:26-04:00,New stakes by hedge funds.Spin-off guru increased stake in Johnson Controls.Potential business separation could unlock value.,"By Alex oleinicThere has been much hedge fund activity in the shares of Johnson Controls (NYSE:JCI) in the past few months. Sandy Nairn's Edinburgh Partners has the largest position in Johnson Controls at $108 million. Even after decreasing its stake by 18%, Edinburgh's position in Johnson Controls still made up 12.56% of its portfolio. Other hedge funds increased their stakes or initiated new positions in Johnson Controls. Famed special situations and spin-off investor Joel Greenblatt upped his stake in Johnson Controls by 57% to just over $78 million through his hedge fund, Gotham Asset Management. Moreover, Steve Cohen's new fund, Point72 Asset Management, increased its stake by 106% to $39.5 million. Balyasny Asset Management, led by Dmitry Balyasny, initiated a new position in Johnson Controls that amounted to $69.6 million. Along with Balyasny, Phil Gross's and Robert Atchinson's Adage Capital Management initiated a new $27.6 million position in Johnson Controls as well.Studies show that insider trading can produce alpha. While there are many reasons why an insider would sell, there is only one reason why an insider would buy. Academic research shows that certain insider purchases have outperformed the market by an average of 7 percentage points per year. Another way to beat the market is by following the small-cap stock picks of hedge funds. Our research shows that the 15 most popular small-cap stocks among hedge funds have outperformed the market by nearly a percentage point per month between 1999 and 2012. We have been forward testing the performance of these stock picks since the end of August 2012. These stocks managed to return more than 132% over the ensuing 2.5 years and outperformed the S&P 500 Index by nearly 80 percentage points.Although there has not been much buying and selling of Johnson Controls shares by insiders in the last few months, insiders acquired 641,671 shares of the company in late November of 2014 in non-open market transactions. The insider activity that followed was mostly option exercises by insiders offset by dispositions of the same magnitude.Johnson Controls is considering a spin-off or an outright sale of the majority of its automotive operations. Johnson's Automotive Experience segment generated just over $22 billion in sales in 2014; the Seating division of Automotive Experience generated $17.5 billion in sales as part of the $22 billion, while the Interiors division generated $4.5 billion in sales. Even though its Automotive Experience segment has been underperforming as a whole, Johnson plans to keep its auto battery operations, which have been a bright spot in the otherwise lagging part of the company.Johnson's revenue is expected to increase little over the coming years with a forecasted 1.09% increase in 2016 and 1.15% increase in 2017. This is largely a reflection of its slow-growing automotive operations that currently generate over half of the company's revenue but only make-up about 31% of its operating profit. Johnson would like to concentrate more on segments that are growing and highly profitable such as its Power Solutions segment, which generated $1.061 billion in operating profit on $6.632 billion in sales. If Johnson separates into two companies or sells its slow-growing, lower margin businesses, the company could become a leaner and faster growing company.Investors should watch carefully for the details behind any Johnson Controls spin-off or sale of its automotive business. Leveraging Joel Greenblatt's teachings and following his investment moves could be profitable in the long-run. Investors should watch carefully for what company insiders do in terms of where the management goes between the two companies, how and when management is incentivized to increase shareholder value, and the outlooks for the two companies. It reasons Johnson's automotive business, whether spun-off or sold, will be marginalized by investors relative to the operations Johnson keeps in the leaner company. This could create a buying opportunity in the less regarded segment as investors head for the exits and increase their stakes in the company with higher growth and margins."
3790756,98366,2016-01-05T11:50:41-05:00,2016 is predicted to be a record-breaking year for Johnson Controls.We expect a 39% return in 2016 on the back of earnings per share increasing to $3.85.The company has increased segment margins year-over-year since 2012.81 cents of its 52-week low makes this an opportune time to invest.,"It's been about two years since a new management team came in at Johnson Controls (NYSE:JCI) and all signs are pointing to a highly successful transition. Revenues are expected to increase in fiscal 2016 despite FX headwinds, and we expect the company to deliver record profitability. We therefore believe Johnson Controls would be a fantastic addition to your portfolio in 2016.Johnson Controls Inc. creates products, services and solutions to optimize energy and operational efficiencies of buildings; lead-acid automotive batteries and batteries for hybrid and electric vehicles; and interior systems for automobiles.We were impressed with the strong forecasts management gave for fiscal 2016. Management has put the company on the right path with strategic and operating plans that we expect will deliver better performance during the fiscal year.So much so, we expect the company to achieve the higher end of the earnings per share guidance offered by management that ranged from $3.70 to $3.90 for fiscal 2016. This is a nice jump from the $3.58 per share earned in fiscal 2015. Revenues, which have declined year-over-year, are expected to rise 4% to $38.6 billion in fiscal 2016 from the $37.2 billion the company pulled in during fiscal 2015.As well as the mergers and acquisitions completed by the company, we also see revenue increasing on the back of higher automotive production. As shown in the chart below from Statista, the outlook on worldwide light vehicle sales is expected to trend upwards at least until 2020. We feel investors should find this to be very encouraging.Source: StatistaWe feel this supports management's view:The Building Efficiency and Power Solutions segments should also bolster revenue. Management believes we will see a 10% increase in these segments through organic sales in fiscal 2016. In Q4 of fiscal 2015, we were very impressed with the increased profitability shown by these segments. Despite revenue being level and down 6%, respectively, the company managed to squeeze an income increase of 5% from both segments. See below for a comparison.Source: Company presentationThe Automotive Experience segment was down year-over-year in Q4, but we believe the increased efficiencies will lead the segment to profitability in fiscal 2016 despite sales being lower.The increase in segment margin has really impressed us, and gives us great confidence for the future. It has increased by 250 bps since fiscal 2012, and we anticipate further growth in fiscal 2016. We feel it's a real sign of the company becoming more and more efficient each year.Source: Company dataDividend Yield:Johnson Controls has increased its dividend by 15% on average over the last 5 years. Currently yielding an attractive 2.74%, this puts it ahead of the S&P 500 average dividend yield of 2.11%. We feel the company can easily sustain this level of dividend growth. Currently it has an average payout ratio of 43.74% which we feel is a good level to be running at, allowing the company to reinvest appropriately in its growth.Free Cash Flow:An appealing aspect of the company is its levels of free cash flow as shown below. We, like most investors, see positive levels of free cash flow as an attractive feature of an investment. After the $1.13 billion capital expenditures, JCI still has $465 million of free cash flow.Source: YchartsAlthough the company has a reasonably low Quick Ratio (0.605) compared to its industry peers, it is close to its 10-year average and has made a vast improvement year-over-year from a below average level. We wouldn't worry too much about this, as it seems to be an operational quirk of the company, rather than an indicator of poor liquidity. The Current Ratio is a comforting 1.06.Valuation:The company is down 14.64% over the last 52-weeks leaving it trading at a below average price to earnings ratio. On average in the last 5 years the company has traded at 21.18 times earnings, whereas today we find it at just 16.54 times earnings and just 81 cents off its 52-week low.We believe, however, that the stock is trading at a reasonable price to earnings ratio considering its growth prospects. The Auto Parts industry is currently trading at an average price to earnings ratio of 14.05. In time, we expect the company to trade in line with its peers, so when doing our one-year price target have factored in a gradual move to a lower price to earnings ratio.So, based on our forecast earnings per share for fiscal 2016 of $3.85, and trading at the industry average of 14.05 times earnings, we have placed a one-year price target of $54.09 on Johnson Controls. This represents a 39% increase from the last price of $39.08.Conclusion:Things are starting to look very promising and fiscal 2016 is expected to be a record-beating year for the company. We feel that at this price, it represents a reasonably low risk investment with a high margin of safety. Even at the low end of the earnings guidance, management has given ($3.70) we would see a potential return of 33% if trading at the industry average of 14.05 times earnings. Add in the dividend and I think we have a really positive investment here for all portfolios."
3192106,24361,2015-05-19T12:05:15-04:00,"Tyco is well-placed in a large, fragmented market that should be looking toward improving growth, but execution (and particularly margins) has been a company-specific challenge for a little while.
        Improving non-residential construction and renovation activity should create a tailwind in fire and security, and management is looking to restructuring and operational improvement to drive better margins.
        A ""show me"" story on the fundamentals, Tyco is a large player in a market that should be turning around, suggesting more upside if/when those operational improvements arrive.","For a company that is supposed to be in one of the more attractive industrial markets, fire and security, Tyco (TYC) hasn't lived up to investor expectations. With weaker than average growth and margins, Tyco has been lagging other fire/security players like Honeywell (NYSE:HON), United Technologies (NYSE:UTX), Stanley Black & Decker (NYSE:SWK), and Allegion (NYSE:ALLE) for some time, not to mention the market as a whole (as measured by the S&P 500).Can the company reverse this unimpressive trend? I can't immediately think of another company in this size range with as much exposure to the non-residential construction market (though Ingersoll-Rand (NYSE:IR) is close), both here and abroad, and perhaps the protracted lull in that market explains some of Tyco's underpeformance. That said, management needs to address what seems to be an elevated level of corporate expenses and a relatively bad track record of meeting projections.I don't see a large amount of undervaluation here, but this is a significant ""self help"" story where outperformance on margins can have a disproportionate benefit on the valuation. It's also arguably still at a size where a larger conglomerate could consider it an acquisition target, particularly with the prospect of rooting out the company's elevated cost structure.Soft Orders, Little Margin Improvement, And A Downward RevisionIn my opinion, the company's last quarterly report (the fiscal second quarter) is a reasonably concise summary of some of Tyco's primary challenges. While it was a pretty solid quarter overall for companies leveraged to non-residential construction/building controls like Honeywell, United Technologies, Allegion, and Ingersoll-Rand, Tyco underwhelmed with its performance.Revenue was down 2% as reported, and up about 2% on an organic basis. For this past first calendar quarter, 2% arguably earns you a ""B"" - Honeywell did about that well, Ingersoll-Rand, Danaher (NYSE:DHR), General Electric (NYSE:GE), and 3M (NYSE:MMM) did better, and a few did worse and sometimes quite a bit worse. Product revenue was the star for Tyco, while service and installation revenue were quite a bit weaker.While gross margin improved 30bp from the year-ago quarter, adjusted operating income was down 3% (with a 20bp decline in margin) and segment operating income was down about 4% (with a 20bp decline in margin). Tyco's segment margins are in the mid-13%'s now, a level that trails the comparable segments at Honeywell, United Technologies, and Allegion by about one to four points.It also doesn't appear that there's an imminent turnaround in the making. Order growth was just 1% in constant currency, with strong product orders offsetting weak order flow in services and installation. Management guided down for the remainder of the year and upped its estimated spending on restructuring. I'd also note that many analysts on the Street seemed surprised by the extent to which the company's exposure to oil/gas and Australia weighed on guidance.Well-Placed In A Well-Loved SectorOne of the primary charms to Tyco is that it is the leader player in the global fire, security and safety market, with about 8% share of installations, 15% share of services, and 10% share of products. Honeywell, United Technologies, and Allegion all strong in particular areas (Honeywell in products, UTX in fire, and Allegion in physical security products), but Tyco offers a more diversified collection of strong businesses across the globe.Along with water/filtration and healthcare, fire/security has long been a well-loved segment by investors and sell-side analysts. That's not an unreasonable view given the many positive attributes of the space. For a commercial enterprise, fire protection and theft deterrence aren't optional and they're not often areas where companies look to trim expenses in a pinch. They are also operations that support long-lived streams of recurrent service revenue that can be very profitable. It's also a large ($80 billion-plus) and still fairly fragmented global industry, which gives players a chance to roll-up rivals in accretive transactions.Can Tyco Improve Its Performance?It may well be the case that a lot of Tyco's lagging growth and margin performance over the last few years stems from the underlying weakness in its end markets. Non-residential construction has been weak for some time, and so too have important commercial end markets like retail. Now, though, indicators like the ABI are showing a more positive outlook and the managements of Honeywell, United Technologies, and other building systems companies are getting more bullish on the near-term growth outlook.So, a rising tide can help Tyco. There are also ongoing self-improvement steps that can pay off. Corporate expenses look too high, but Tyco has been targeting areas like sourcing and branch network performance for margin improvement. The company has also been trying to improve the quality of the orders it pursues and looking for longer service contracts. So far the results are mixed - adjusted operating margins have largely stayed within a one-point band over the last year and a half.M&A is also an ongoing potential source of leverage. Back in December, the company paid $330 million for Industrial Safety Technologies - a manufacturer of gas and flame detection systems that closes the gap a bit between Tyco and segment leader Honeywell (which has around 20% of the gas/flame detection market).Estimating The ValueI believe that Tyco management could drive several points of margin leverage from today's level on a non-resi rebound, but ""could"" and ""will"" are not the same thing. I suppose I place myself with the skeptics when it comes to the question of Tyco posting better results, but I will at least openly acknowledge that the potential to do quite a bit better is there. As is, I'm looking for the company to couple long-term revenue growth in the low-to-mid single digits with FCF margin improvements into the low double-digits, driving FCF growth of 12% and a fair value in the mid-$30's.I would also note that M&A is a distinct possibility on both ends. Tyco's balance sheet is pretty clean and I have no doubt that the company is looking for acquisition targets in multiple markets. I also think that Tyco could be a target itself, though the timing may be an issue. I would have thought that Danaher could be interested, but that company has obviously gone a different way. Non-residential construction/building controls is a notable gap in GE's portfolio but it too may be too busy digesting its own recent large deal. Last and not least, 3M has relatively low exposure to these end markets, but I'm not sure the company is prepared for the cultural shift that would go with a service-heavy business. Even if this isn't the right time for a deal, I do believe that Tycos' underlying markets are attractive enough that prolonged margin underperformance would/will attract outside interest - whether that's a public company, private equity, or activist investors.The Bottom LineI'm not entirely comfortable talking down a company that is highly leveraged to a market that should be on the way up and perhaps poised for several years of catch-up spending. Likewise, Tyco holds appeal as a lagging stock with a good story - something investors often like to pursue. That said, it's hard for me to be comfortable with a company that hasn't lived up to its potential for a little while now and still appears to have some internal execution challenges. While I'm definitely inclined to be bullish on the story, and I'm well aware that models can only take an investor so far, I need to see better execution before I can get comfortable with the higher estimates that would drive a higher fair value."
3177466,27231,2015-05-13T02:01:57-04:00,"Johnson Controls is a company that poses low-to-moderate risk to the value investor, overall.57% of the current price represents a premium for future growth.The company's 25% margin of safety compensates for the risk that JCI may not improve its margins further or encounter significant asset impairments in the near future.Implied top line and EPS growth expectations going forward appear conservative enough to exploit.","Company OverviewJohnson Controls, Inc. (NYSE:JCI) is a diversified technology company. The Company creates products, services and solutions for buildings; lead-acid automotive batteries and advanced batteries for hybrid and electric vehicles; and interior systems for automobiles. Its business segments include Building Efficiency and Power Solutions. The Building Efficiency business is engaged in designing, producing, marketing and installing heating, ventilating and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, building management systems, controls, security and mechanical equipment. The Power Solutions business is a supplier of lead-acid automotive batteries for every type of passenger car, light truck and utility vehicle. (Source: Thomson Reuters)Last December, the Stock Market Sherpa wrote an article expecting Johnson Controls, Inc. to run another disappointing year for 2015. Another article, written by Apus Investments in the same month, lowered the author's forward 12-month target price by $5 from $64 per share, given the 2015 guidance range. Recent articles written by our fellow contributors on Seeking Alpha also mention management's focus on transforming the company and thus increasing profitability in the medium term, which involves both efficiency improvements and strategic divestments.In addition, during last month's earnings call, Chairman and CEO Alex Molinaroli reported that JCI's employees are embracing the ""Johnson Controls Operating System"" (i.e., JCI's focus on enhancing productivity and efficiency) and adopting it much faster and more effectively than he had anticipated. He has seen early benefits in manufacturing, network optimization and purchasing activities, and more to follow as the months pass.Brian Stief, EVP and CFO, commented:While Johnson Controls' top line is expected to flounder down to $37 billion through FY 2017, and is not anticipated to even post the same level of revenues in FY 2018 as the most recent year's, we expect management's determination to instill a culture of execution, accountability, and agility (see this) to lift operating profitability to new heights not seen over the past ten years.Overall improvements to JCI's cost controls drive the company's intrinsic value far more than revenue growth, and given its current price and its current risk at the enterprise level, the company has a large enough margin of safety to offset any material disappointments with respect to strategic acquisitions and divestitures, as well as the upward trend in its margins.Risk AssessmentWe evaluated Johnson Controls, Inc. using a systematic, rule-based risk assessment method. It is a balanced scorecard that considers the past performance, historical volatility and underlying trend of over 40 different risk factors in multiple factor groups, and utilizes proprietary standards to systematically score these risk factors across five levels. We believe such analysis adds value for the reader, as they adequately define the major risks in any business, accurately measure them and succinctly describe them in an easily comprehensible format.Source: Saibus ResearchOverall, Johnson Controls, Inc. is a business that exposes the long-term investor to low-to-moderate risks. JCI's creditworthiness, efficiency, and profitability are all rated at moderate level of risk, but these are tempered by a great outlook on inherent stability and the company's future prospects. For the sake of brevity, we won't delve too far into the details, given JCI's overall risk and focus on the latter two elements, as these are forward-looking and add stability to projections and valuations.Source: Saibus Research. 1 for low risk, 5 for high risk.Under inherent stability, our research process suggests Johnson Controls places between 3rd and 2nd place in terms of relative fundamental performance when compared to a peer group comprising four competitors, which include EnerSys (NYSE:ENS), GS Yuasa Corp. (OTCPK:GYUAF), Magna International (NYSE:MGA), and Amara Raja Batteries (not available for US investors).Management candor appears to be solid. Though accruals are a cause for concern, we remain confident in the trustworthiness of JCI's management team, given zero changes to auditors, and their positions concerning the company's financial reporting, as well as the results of both the Beneish M-Score and Thomson Reuters' StarMine model. See below for the latter.Source: Thomson Reuters for the Earnings Quality model. Model results are applicable for North America. Companies are graded from 1 to 100, with 100 being the highest quality. The Beneish M-Score is computed systematically by Saibus Research, and reflects the possibility that management is manipulating reported earnings. Scores greater than -2.22 indicate higher probabilities of earnings management taking place.With Johnson Controls undergoing a multi-year transformation, we would suspect that its future prospects would not look that bright in the near future, though it is reasonable to assume the company will be able to inflate its profitability margins and maintain it at an elevated level as it pursues greater operational efficiency and an optimized business mix.We consider ""future prospects"" from two perspectives. First, we considered the possibility that the company may surprise Wall Street's expectations for cash flow per share, returns on assets and returns on equity over the next three fiscal years. Second, we contrasted Wall Street's forward 10Y EPS growth projections against the market-implied expectation of same, if the data is available.Source: Saibus Research. 1 for low risk, 5 for high risk.Above, we can see that there isn't any reason to expect major surprises in JCI's fundamental performance against the average Wall Street projections, insofar as per-share cash flows and enterprise-level returns on investment are concerned. However, there is significant divergence between earnings growth expectations set by the current market price and sell-side research, provided the latter were adjusted and weighted for analyst accuracy, estimate age and analyst experience on the job. With over 20 Wall Street analysts following JCI since May 2013, it certainly makes sense to make such adjustments.Although this cannot completely substitute for true industry research, which relay the qualitative trends and developments noted by technical and economic experts in an industry, and a thorough, qualitative perusal of the firm's strategic focus and adherence to its organizational values, appraising the detailed expectations set by Wall Street's sell-side research allows us to grasp the future prospect of the company by proxy.The table below details Reuters' compilation of analyst estimates (again, after adjusting them for the analysts' track record and level of experience, and the recency of the estimate) for Johnson Controls' financial performance, looking ahead over the next four fiscal years.Source: Thomson Reuters. Analyst estimates for revenues and degree of profitability were also included for clarity.As far as the top line goes, revenues are expected to plummet 12% for the upcoming fiscal year and more or less stagnate a bit until FY 2018, when it is expected for the company's ""Johnson Controls Operating System"" push to surface in its ability to generate sales.However, EBIT margins are expected to go above and beyond the historical 3.4-5.4% range it has been in since 2005 (other than the outlying -0.11% in 2009) and move up towards 9%. We believe JCI's reorganization - its thrust for better efficiency and profitability - will keep these new profit margins as a new normal for the years thereafter.Lastly, we also compared the market-implied expectations for EPS growth over the next 10 years against those expected by the sell-side analysts working at large firms. Wall Street expects EPS to grow 8.42% a year, whereas the market price implies growth of 5.67% a year over the same time frame, demonstrating a difference of 275 basis points. (Source: Thomson Reuters) We find this gap decent. It is not so disparate that dramatic returns can be expected at this point, but it is wide enough for investors to consider a long position in the intermediate term.Source: Thomson ReutersShortening our time frame to a five-year period, we see an identical pattern. The similarity shown by the 5-year and 10-year outlooks increase our confidence in the possibility that Johnson Controls will provide tremendous value over the long run.Investors, however, should keep an eye out for any corrections. While we are confident in the likelihood that JCI will give its bottom line a little kick, we think Mr. Market may overreact to a material drop in the top line for the current fiscal year and provide an opportunity to average down.Valuation AnalysisProceeding forward, we ran our valuation analysis using a risk-adjusted WACC of 7.03%, a terminal growth rate equal to 1.56% in long-term inflation (United States), average free cash flow margins of 5.33%, which reflects a 4.74% operating margin (5-year moving average) that is set to grow at 1% a year and plateau at 9% by 2019, a 25% effective tax rate (from Q2 2015, which is close to a trimmed average consisting of all annual tax rates above 18%) and net investments equivalent to 0.78% of sales. We also use a competitive advantage period of 8 years to account for JCI's competitive ranking and strong returns on net operating assets.Enterprise values as computed are subject to a negative $7.63 billion adjustment that accounts for non-operating cash, debt and dilution, as well as other extraneous factors like deferred tax liabilities. This overall adjustment corresponds to $11.65 per share, but 64% of this can be attributed to the firm's debt, signifying the impact of financial leverage on equity value. The adjustment also includes $3.26 for JCI's implicit admission of a nasty acquisition, which we believe is prudent, given it has nearly $6.8 billion in goodwill and the company has expensed roughly $2.7 billion in restructuring charges over the last ten years.Source: Saibus ResearchIn a steady-state scenario, we presumed sales to simply drop 11% to $38 billion and stay there no matter what the company will do from now on. We also presume that the Johnson Controls Operating System will not only fail horribly, but also worsen profitability. Thus, we hold operating margins at 4%. We also use the effective tax rate of 15% rather than 25%, to use the long-term average. This results in a NOPAT margin of 3.4%. We expect investments to remain in line with depreciation, as we are glancing at the business from the perspective of perpetual stagnation. Capitalizing the profits and adjusting them will yield a $14.22 billion equity value, or $21.71 per share.In a growth scenario, using the conservative assumptions as defined above, we further presumed a conservative CAGR sales growth of 4.25% beyond 2018. This implicitly presumes a compounded annual growth rate of 1.6% and 10.2% for sales and free cash flows, respectively, over the next nine years. Given how low sales growth is, clearly the major risk factor driving the intrinsic value is the company's success in achieving its transformation. The result is an equity value of $42.97 billion, or $65.62 per share.Before we move on, we'd like to point out that JCI traded at $50.22 per share on May 8th. Yesterday, the stock closed at $50.34. Not a big difference.The gap between Net Assets and Stagnation tells us that JCI's assets provide 74% of its earnings power. In other words, the company's competitive advantages and management team were not as effective as they should have been. The fact that Johnson Controls is undertaking an enterprise-wide reorganization under the so-called ""Operating System"" represents a tacit admission of a need to leverage its economic moat. Consequently, this pins the mediocre variance between risk-adjusted book value and Stagnation Value on past management decisions.Comparing Stagnation to the market price produces a $28.51 difference. We interpret this to mean that 57% of Johnson Controls' market price contains a premium that investors pay for the company's future growth. Referencing the risk assessment tables above, we think the firm's fundamental performance supports the premium investors are paying for at this price level. As we noted earlier, JCI ranks 2nd or 3rd on relative fundamental performance, it enjoys good returns on equity and even better returns on net operating assets, and judging by the conference calls and our fellow contributors' recent articles, its ""Operating System"" push is yielding favorable results.The two-stage DCF H-Model used to produce our estimated intrinsic value shows that the market is selling Johnson Controls, Inc. at a 23.5% discount to intrinsic value, and implies a potential upside of nearly 30.7% over the long run. We believe this is an acceptable holding period return to expect from the company, as our DCF model already accounts for more bad acquisitions down the line and expects margin enhancements to stop at a certain point. If we were to presume Wall Street's most accurate analysts are inaccurate on their projected improvements and hold operating margins at 7% from FY2017 and thereafter, the growth value would fall to $49.55, making the company fairly valued. In other words, the margin of safety also provides a cushion for the event that the improvements will not be as great as expected.Next, we take this DCF model and its adjustments and ""reverse-engineer"" our valuation to arrive at the expected growth implied by the market price and Wall Street's price targets for the next 12-18 months. As the tables below show, their expectations - including ours - appear pessimistic with respect to sales growth. Pertaining to FCF growth, we noted that JCI's historical FCFs demonstrated significant volatility with no clear trend. However, breaking down free cash flows into operating cash flows and capital expenditures, we've seen the two increase over time. Net OCF has grown at a compounded annual rate of 11.7% per year over the past ten years, and capital expenditure at 6.8% (though is relatively stable when juxtaposed against sales).Source: Thomson ReutersPresuming CAPEX to remain close to 3% of sales going forward, we think the market and the average analyst estimates are being more conservative than they should be in terms of the implied FCF growth assumptions.Source: Saibus ResearchGiven the promising reports JCI's management has given us regarding the ""Operating System"" initiative, we think there is a fair chance for outperformance in the long haul."

This marks today's bull market as the third longest in US history. Considering how traumatizing the Great Recession and the accompanying stock market collapse was for most investors, this should be good and comforting news. But unfortunately, the length and level of our current bull market seems to be conjuring up more worry and angst than comfort.For some time now, many investors have been lamenting that stocks have become too expensive, and some are even playing the bubble card. However, prudent investing requires separating fact from fiction. Therefore, prudence would also dictate taking a more analytical and less emotional evaluation of the true state and level of today's stock market. Have stocks truly become too expensive to invest in, more to the point, have all stocks become too expensive in lockstep with the market? Perhaps recent market history and precedents will provide answers.May 2015: A Fundamental Valuation Analysis of the S&P 500Utilizing the analytical power of the F.A.S.T. Graphs fundamentals analyzer software tool, let's take a factual look at the S&P 500's typical valuation ranges over recent history. The current blended P/E ratio of the S&P 500 sits between 17 and 18 times earnings. If we review the historical normal P/E ratio of approximately 19 for the market since 1997, the argument could be made that the general market might be modestly undervalued. However, that time frame includes the high P/E ratios that the market traded at during the irrational exuberant period of the mid-1990's to 2000 that skewed the average P/E ratio calculations upwards.Consequently, if we only include the time frame 2002 to current, we discover perhaps a more appropriate historical normal P/E ratio of 17. On that basis, the argument could be made that the market, as measured by the S&P 500, is currently being valued at historically normal levels. This would indicate that the market is not necessarily cheap, nor is it significantly overvalued. Instead, it might be rational to conclude that the market is currently fully valued. In other words, the S&P 500 is currently not a bargain, but nor is it dangerously overvalued, at least based on recent historical precedent.But most importantly of all, the above analysis supporting a fully-valued market in the general sense does not necessarily mean that all stocks are fully valued or even priced high if that is your view. Nevertheless, the above analysis does support the reality that with the market levels where they are today, it has become exceedingly more difficult to find sound investment opportunities or good bargains to invest in. This is a challenge for investors that currently have money that needs to be invested. The good news is that there are still good and sound long-term investment opportunities available if you're willing to look beyond generalities such as - the stock market is too high.For loyal Seeking Alpha readers I offer this link to a past article that contains a live fully functioning F.A.S.T. Graphs on the S&P 500 that can be utilized to analyze the current state and valuation of the market.Johnson Controls is Not an Overvalued StockPrudent long-term dividend growth or retired investors should not let market hype scare them away from this excellent long-term total return and above-average dividend growth investment opportunity. Although this company is not on the radar screens of many conservative long-term investors, I believe it has great long-term appeal. Johnson Controls (NYSE:JCI) has paid a dividend every year since 1887 and increased its revenues for 62 consecutive years until the Great Recession. However, the interruption in growth was short-lived and the company is back on its typical growth track as I will soon illustrate.Johnson Controls Essential Fundamentals at a GlanceJohnson Controls is an attractively valued high quality dividend growth stock possessing long-term appeal for potentially generating an above-average total return and dividend growth. However, before digging deeper into the opportunity that Johnson Controls offers today, let's start by taking a historical look at the company's essential fundamentals at a glance through the fundamental analytical power of F.A.S.T. Graphs. The primary objective of this exercise is to establish a perspective of how well this company has performed as an operating business, coupled with how the market has typically treated that performance.In order to establish the clearest perspective, I will start out by presenting the essential fundamentals of earnings and dividends without the emotional contamination that stock prices bring to the equation. Additionally, I will first look at Johnson Controls over the time frame 1996-2007 in order to analyze its operating results prior to the Great Recession. From there I will update to current time and review operating results during and after the Great Recession.From 1996-2007 Johnson Controls generated an almost flawless operating record based on earnings and dividend growth. Earnings grew from $.48 at fiscal year-end 1996 to $2.33 by fiscal year-end 2007 representing a compound annual growth rate of 15.2%. In concert, Johnson Controls' dividend grew from $.14 to $.52 for a compound annual growth rate of 10.7%.When monthly closing stock prices are added to the graph, we discover a strong correlation between price (the black line) and earnings (the orange line). Clearly, price followed earnings and periods of undervaluation (price below the orange line) and overvaluation (price above the orange line) are visibly revealed. Most importantly, the graph clearly illustrates that periods of overvaluation and undervaluation were short-lived as price inevitably, and reasonably quickly, returned to alignment with fair value (the orange line). Consequently, we are given a distinctive perspective of optimum and sound buying opportunities.A quick review of the return performance over this time frame compared to the S&P 500 illustrates that prior to the Great Recession Johnson Controls was an excellent long-term investment. Both dividend income and capital appreciation significantly outpaced the S&P 500.However, as I will cover in more detail later, the Great Recession not only took its toll on the company's earnings record, it also revealed a significant vulnerability. The company's strong exposure at that time to the cyclical North American automotive industry led to an earnings collapse of approximately 80% for fiscal year end 2009, virtually wiping out years of impeccable and consistent growth. It's important to note that the company did remain profitable, but just barely.Fortunately for shareholders, Johnson Controls' cash flows held up better than earnings, allowing management to continue paying a dividend at the 2008 rate. However, the dividend was frozen through fiscal year 2010, but has since been growing again at their historically normal rate. Importantly, the following graph also shows that earnings recovered quickly and exceeded historical highs by fiscal year-end 2010, and Johnson Controls' stock price responded accordingly. As I will also discuss later, a lot has changed and improved with Johnson Controls since the Great Recession debacle, and earnings, dividends and price are back on their historical track of growth and excellence.The final reveal that this exercise provides is that Johnson Controls is currently available for investment at fair or sound value. Therefore, this provides evidence that a deeper look and a more comprehensive research effort on Johnson Controls is justified and warranted.Reasons Why I Favor Johnson ControlsShort Business Description Courtesy S&P Capital IQ:Johnson Controls Transforming Itself into High-Margin Growth BusinessesSince the Great Recession of 2008, Johnson Controls has significantly diversified and rebalanced their business which has offset their once lopsided exposure to the extremely cyclical North American automotive industry. In 2014 their combined exposure to the automotive sector decreased to approximately 50% from approximately 70% prior to the Great Recession. As a result, the company is now less vulnerable to future recessions.MorningStar had this to say about Johnson Controls' transformation initiatives:Today the company's three primary businesses, the Automotive Group, Building Efficiency and Power Solutions, are all promising and highly profitable growth opportunities.The Automotive Experience is a $22 billion segment:The automotive group currently has excellent growth potential as the company is investing heavily in China, the world's largest automotive market. However, the North American and European markets remain strong and large contributors to this segment.Building Efficiency is a $14.2 billion segment:The building efficiency segment is currently experiencing a surge in demand as orders were up strongly, and their backlog strong at over 4 ½ billion dollars. This segment also showed strong margin improvement in the second quarter of 2015.Power Solutions is a $6.6 segment:Their power solutions segment (high-tech batteries) is showing strong growth throughout the world. Margins are also improving thanks to higher volumes and a better mix of higher-margin products. Johnson Controls is the undisputed leader in AGM (absorbent glass mat) batteries making them the major provider of the rapidly growing trend in vehicle ""Start - Stop"" technology serving automotive manufacturers' growing need to produce more fuel-efficient vehicles.Johnson Controls Ethical, Competent and Shareholder Friendly ManagementIn addition to Johnson Controls' excellent operating legacy, their management is also highly regarded as one of the most ethical and shareholder friendly. The following taken directly from their website highlight some of their most recent acknowledgments:Johnson Controls, Inc. 5757 North Green Bay Ave. Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53209-4408Notice of 2015 Annual Meeting and Proxy StatementWorldwide Presence and LeadershipJohnson Controls is a global diversified technology and industrial leader serving customers in more than 150 countries.Johnson Controls' Total Return OpportunityAs described above, Johnson Controls appears to have righted the ship and transformed the company as a result of the lessons learned from the Great Recession. Since fiscal year-end 2010 the company has achieved an average operating earnings growth rate better than 12% per annum. Consequently, the consensus forecast earnings growth rate of 12.2% by leading analysts following the company seems reasonable and achievable. If that is true, then the following forecasting calculator illustrates the potential to earn approximately 15% per annum over the next 2 to 3 years. That's a solid potential rate of return, especially considering what might be available from the market or most other equal quality companies.If we then turn to the forecasting calculator based on the long-term normal P/E ratio suggesting a minor P/E ratio contraction to 13.7, we still see an opportunity for double-digit rates of annualized total returns. Since I consider this a conservative case, I'm quite pleased with the calculation.With my final calculation, I will turn to the longer-term 3 to 5 year forecast trend line growth of 13.1% and discover the potential for in excess of 15% annualized total return out to 2020. I also consider this a reasonable estimate considering the transformation that the company has gone through, and the fact that is all but complete. Margins have been improving with the company's focus on higher margin business, and long-term sales and revenue opportunities are there.Summary and ConclusionsThe stock market as measured by the S&P 500 is, at the least, fully valued and perhaps moderately overvalued. However, that does not simultaneously imply that sound individual investment opportunities are not available. Johnson Controls represents an above-average, long-term total return opportunity that is currently fairly valued in today's bull market.Regardless of the level of the overall market, it is rare to find a company that offers double-digit earnings and dividend growth. It is even rarer to find that kind of growth available at a sound valuation. Johnson Controls appears to be a sound total return opportunity that can be purchased at a reasonable blended P/E ratio. Consequently, I believe it is a worthy candidate for a more comprehensive effort.Disclosure: Long JCI at the time of writing.Disclaimer: The opinions in this document are for informational and educational purposes only and should not be construed as a recommendation to buy or sell the stocks mentioned or to solicit transactions or clients.

3079546,67985,2015-04-18T08:36:22-04:00,The company’s announced sale of its Global WorkPlace Solutions business continues its strategy of focusing on higher margin business lines with sales growth potential.The company’s announced spinoff of its automotive interiors business into a joint venture will also allow it to unload another low margin business.The company’s latest transactions to move away from low margin businesses and focus on higher margin businesses are likely the last near-term transformational actions it will take.A potential investor should consider the company’s shares before its transformational strategy begins to show increased profitability.The company’s yearly dividend increases and substantial share repurchases will reward shareholders while waiting for the business transformation to lift profitability.,"Johnson Controls (NYSE:JCI) has been engaged in a multi-year transformation involving the divestiture of its lower margin businesses and acquiring higher margin businesses that will increase its profitability in the intermediate and long term. In recent quarters, the company struggled with consistent revenue growth, even though the company had shown operational improvements across all of its businesses. Given JCI's lack of consistent revenues and earnings growth, the company's earnings growth is below the earnings growth of its competitors, and, therefore, the market is assigning a price-to-earnings multiple to JCI that is lower than the price-to-earnings ratio assigned to its competitors. The company's fortunes may be about to change. In recent weeks, the company announced its largest and likely its last few major transactions in the intermediate term. First, JCI announced an agreement for the sale of its Global WorkPlace Solutions (""GWS"") business to CBRE Group, Inc. for $1.475 billion. Second, JCI and Yanfeng Automotive Trim Systems Co., Ltd. announced an agreement for a global automotive interiors joint venture, whereby Yanfeng will hold the majority 70 percent share in the joint venture, and Johnson Controls will hold a 30 percent share. Each of these transactions, the company's most significant transformational actions to date, allow JCI to unload significant portions of its low margin businesses. Subsequent to such transactions, JCI will continue to emphasize its York-brand heating and air conditioning equipment for commercial buildings, and on its devices for monitoring and regulating electricity usage, temperature, fire safety and security. We believe that the company's shares, which currently yield about 2.10 percent, should be strongly considered for purchase as part of an investor's long-term portfolio during the overall markets' next 5 to 10 percent pullback. We should note, however, that during recent strong overall market selloffs, JCI's shares have held up well relative to the overall market. As the company's transformation begins to show results and becomes more appreciated by investors, the company's shares will be assigned a price-to-earnings ratio more in line with the company's competitors, and investors in the company's shares will be rewarded.Fiscal first quarter 2015 earningsIn its latest quarterly earnings report, JCI announced its fiscal first quarter 2015 adjusted earnings of 79 cents, an increase of 20 percent from the year-ago quarter. The company recorded quarterly revenue that increased 1 percent from the year-ago quarter to $10.67 billion. The company's automotive experience division reported revenue that decreased 3 percent from the year-ago quarter to $5.3 billion and adjusted income that increased 26 percent to $249 million. The company's power solutions division reported revenue that increased 4 percent from the year-ago quarter to $1.84 billion, and adjusted income that increased 4 percent to $318 million. The company's building efficiency division reported revenues that increased 5 percent to $3.5 billion and adjusted income that increased 38 percent to $201 million (including the company's acquisition of Air Distribution Technologies in the third quarter of 2014). In addition, the day before JCI announced earnings, it signed an agreement with Hitachi, Ltd. and Hitachi Appliances, Inc. to form a global joint venture that will produce the variable refrigerant flow technology, room air conditioners and absorption chillers to satisfy demand for energy-efficient air conditioners. JCI expects fiscal year 2015 results to be better than fiscal 2014 results given higher profitability in all three of its businesses due to the company's strategic and financial plans leading to better performance and higher operating margins.Divestiture and spin off are last major transitional movesIn recent years, JCI has been exiting its low-margin industrial businesses in a strategic effort to focus on faster growing markets or sub-markets and away from more capital intensive and less profitable markets. The company sold off its auto electronics unit and its garage door opening business, and purchased a company that manufactures heating and cooling and security systems for residential and commercial buildings. With respect to these relatively smaller transactions, JCI exited two relatively small, capital intensive businesses to enter a business that has margins nearly double its overall net margin. In mid-2014, JCI announced its plan to spin off its low-margin, slow-growth auto interiors business into a joint venture with a division of the Chinese company SAIC. In recent weeks, however, JCI announced its most significant transactions to date that support its effort to transform the company towards higher margin businesses.At the end of March 2015, JCI announced an agreement for the sale of its Global WorkPlace Solutions business to CBRE Group, Inc. for $1.475 billion. The transaction is a continuation of the company's focus on higher margin business lines with sales growth potential, and is likely the last of its series of large divestitures. The agreement includes a 10-year strategic relationship between the two companies, whereby JCI will be the preferred provider of HVAC equipment, building automation systems and related services to the 5 billion square feet portfolio of real estate and corporate facilities managed globally by CBRE and GWS. The agreement provides JCI with new channels for its offerings and when fully operational is expected to generate up to $500 million of annual incremental revenue for the Johnson Controls' building efficiency business. Further, CBRE, in accordance with the agreement, will also provide JCI with a full suite of integrated corporate real estate services (including facilities management, project management and transaction services) on more than 50 million square feet of Johnson Controls' properties. In addition, the companies will jointly provide $40 million over 10 years to fund an innovation lab that will develop leading edge energy management solutions to lower costs and enhance their clients' work environments. JCI will treat GWS as a discontinued operation in the second quarter of fiscal 2015. The transaction is expected to close near the end of its 2015 fiscal year.In mid-April 2015, JCI and Yanfeng Automotive Trim Systems Co., Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of Huayu Automotive Systems Co., Ltd. (""HASCO"") announced the signing of an agreement for a global automotive interiors joint venture. The new joint venture, to be called Yanfeng Automotive Interiors, will be the largest automotive interiors company in the world with revenues of approximately $8.5 billion and a backlog to reach $10 billion in the next few years. Yanfeng will hold the majority 70 percent share in the joint venture, and Johnson Controls will hold a 30 percent share. The companies signed a definitive agreement in May 2014 to form such joint venture, which is expected to begin operations in July 2015. JCI's spin-off of its automotive interiors business into a joint venture is a significant action by the company to move away from lower margin businesses as it focuses on its higher margin non-auto portfolio of businesses.Our viewJCI's most recent transformational actions, as noted above, are the company's most significant to date. Each of the company's divestitures or acquisitions will allow it to exit low-margin businesses and enter higher margin businesses. With the company's transformational transactions nearing completion, the major components of the company's strategy are largely complete. The results from the company's transactions will become more appreciated by investors in the intermediate term. Near term, however, many investors are failing to appreciate the effect the company's divestitures and acquisitions will have on the company's profitability in the intermediate and long term. Further, JCI's transformation will allow it to capitalize on future trends, such as the energy efficiency concerns of office tower owners and energy efficient battery technology. JCI's current price-to-earnings ratio is 26.95. Earnings estimates for JCI are $3.58 for its current fiscal year 2015 and $4.07 for its fiscal year 2016. We should note earnings estimates for both years have fallen slightly in recent months. JCI's shares are trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 12.35 based on fiscal year 2016 earnings estimates. As JCI's transformation increases its profit margins, its forward price-to-earnings ratio should increase to about 15. A higher price-to-earnings ratio for JCI would be more in line with the price-to-earnings ratios of JCI's competitors such as: Emerson Electric (NYSE:EMR), Honeywell (NYSE:HON) and United Technologies (NYSE:UTX). With a price-to-earnings ratio that would reflect JCI's improved margins, the company's shares may increase to $60 and $65 in 18 to 24 months. That said, with most stock market indexes at or near record highs, an individual investor might want to wait for JCI to drop to a share price between $42.50 and $47.50 (a price-to-earnings ratio ranging from 10.50 to 11.65 based on 2016 earnings estimates) to establish a full position. The company's shares last fell to within this range in late 2014 through early 2015. A multi-week overall market selloff could bring the company's shares down to within such range once again. Over the long term, JCI will reward investors with increasing dividends, substantial share repurchases and a rising share price."
2873216,53262,2015-02-02T03:52:11-05:00,Consistent fiscal leadership continues.Partnerships allow for continued innovation while offsetting R&D costs.P/E ratio allows for plenty of capital appreciation.,"As I have said before in previous articles, my primary investing approach is based on chart analysis. I sometimes struggle to find something in the fundamentals to support price targets I see in the charts, but this is not so with Johnson Controls Inc. (NYSE:JCI). I found plenty of fundamental data to support even my loftier long-term price targets and a smart innovative well run company that I think is really remarkable.Johnson Controls has a long history of innovation going back to the 1880s with the patent for the first electric thermostat. In the 1990s, JCI's stock took off. This was fueled largely by the Metasys® building management system breakthrough, but also propelled by its expanding auto business. JCI continues to innovate both on the product and process fronts, striving for increased efficiencies for both, with benefits for consumers as well as investors. JCI's VP of technology management, Andreas Eppinger touts, ""process innovations are just as important to JCI as product innovations.""JCI's culture of innovation permeates throughout. Aside from the new ""Innovation Center"" in Milwaukee, and the 328 employees specially trained on ""innovative thinking,"" this value is evident when just speaking with someone from JCI. One might think that there is not a lot of room for excitement and creativity when talking about basic auto parts like seats and batteries, but to the folks at JCI, making those products lighter, stronger and in a more efficient way is gratifying.Johnson Controls is the leading supplier of seat parts and complete seat systems, as well as lead acid batteries. JCI also continues to work on advancing battery technology, with AGM and lithium ion, as well as improving production methods and recycling for lead acids. Between their various retail brands and all of the OEM ones they provide, virtually every car on the road may have a JCI battery. JCI often has a low-key relationship with the automakers, but they have highlighted a few recent notches in their belt. The Start-Stop technology in the new Ford F-150 uses JCI batteries. JCI is the leading supplier of AGM batteries to power Start-Stop vehicles. Also, they provide the entire luxury seat system and the AGM batteries for the Cadillac CTS (MotorTrend's 2014 Car of the Year).The other major core business for Johnson Controls goes back further to its original roots of both the production and development of HVAC systems and equipment, and management and integration systems. JCI's YORK brand provides air conditioning systems for over 90% of the U.S. Navy fleet, in addition to its well-known commercial and residential business. Yet they also work as consultants to custom-tailor systems to a customer's needs. JCI recently completed integration of intelligent building systems for the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, the world's tallest building. Over the last 3 years, the special JCI team installed millions of meters of cable and thousands of cameras, card readers and touchpads, making it also one of the world's safest and most comfortable buildings. This type of business often grants JCI ongoing systems maintenance contracts as well. On a related front, JCI helped the Hyatt Regency Guiyang achieve LEED gold certification. China is the third largest market for LEED, and the partnership with Hitachi will further strengthen this area of core growth for JCI, not just in Asia, but throughout the globe.Speaking of partnerships, Johnson Controls readily teams up with other companies or research departments to create new products or processes. JCI knows that the synergies of ideas can lead to great innovations. Fiscally, though, partnering with others for R&D is great for the bottom line, which in turn is great for investors. These partnerships offset a good portion of the capital outlay that can hurt the EPS for companies trying to invest in new ideas. JCI is working with Adidas on a project called Speedfactory. Together they are working to improve sewing automation, which for both car seats and athletic apparel is largely done by hand. They partnered with the luxury bedding company Harrison Spinks in the development of ComfortThin seats. Not only can they offset costs, but sometimes partnering with a university research department can help them win grants. JCI is working with various partners for the development of Tailored Hybrid Tubes using laser-brazing to weld steel and aluminum (for lighter/stronger seat construction), and of course, they have the new agreement with Hitachi for HVAC systems. From the interview with new CFO Brian Steif (cfo.com Jan 7th. 2015), and in my discussions with Fraser Engerman, the Hitachi deal is what JCI is most excited about for 2015, reinforcing a major core business for JCI with continued growth in Asia.Steif jumped right into his new CFO role with both feet, quickly working to continue to hone core business, selling off Global Workplace Solutions and completing the closeout of the electronics business. Margins have been very consistent for JCI, and under great fiscal leadership they should continue to ratchet up revenues even more, focusing on the most profitable core businesses. But improving shareholder value does not stop there. JCI has been aggressively buying back shares for 1.2B in 2014 and another 600M planned for this year. At the current price of 47, this translates to almost another 2% reduction in shares outstanding in the coming year. JCI also has planned another 18% increase in dividends this year, and that is on top of the 16% bump up it got in 2014.Now is the part where I am going to start to blend in some technical analysis with the fundamental analysis. Before looking only at the charts, let's look at JCI's P/E.True, P/E is a fundamental metric, and low=good, high=bad, simple, done, move along.BUT, what if we looked at the ebb and flow of P/E like those crazy chart analysts look at their ""tea leaves?"" Nothing crazy, no wave counts or Fibonacci retraces, let's just draw three lines to establish some historical bands for JCI's P/E...With a current P/E ratio of 21.72 now, this is just over the broad market average of 18.8. A chart of JCI's P/E over the last 5 years gives us some nice bands to watch. This shows that it can easily sustain a move to 30 (that would be $65), staying inside the green band that actually goes back well over 5 years. We can also see that holding between 30 and 50 for a sustained period of time (up to a year) is not out of the question. That is our yellow band, and at present earnings, a P/E of 50 would relate to a $108.25 share price and almost get us to the target for wave III ($112). I may have lied about the ""no wave counts"" part... The last* band is the ""extreme"" measure, since hitting a P/E of 80 has been shown to be achievable but likely short lived.While JCI was hit very hard in 2008, it recovered all of its losses by early 2011, almost making a new ATH (whereas SPX only recovered 76.4% of the loss from its 2007 high). After a strong impulsive move off the 2009 low and then a retrace of approximately 50% into 2012, JCI got another impulsive move up in the start of wave III. It confirmed a significant low in Oct 2014 after the corrective retrace from 52.25 completing a I-II and the start of the larger wave III, and is currently poised to target 60s, next holding support over 44. I think 63-72 is attainable over the next 6 months based on my Fibonacci and fan projections, which lines up nicely with a move to the green P/E line. Longer term, I think the move off the October low projects to 112 and even as high as 120.*Even longer term, maybe 5-7 years from now, we can start talking about the purple P/E band... Exceeding 250 like in 1994 would put JCI (at current earnings) over $541/share."

JCI anticipates improved results in 2015.","Linked here is a detailed quantitative analysis of Johnson Controls, Inc. (NYSE:JCI). Below are some highlights from the above linked analysis:Company Description: Johnson Controls Inc. supplies building controls and energy management systems, automotive seating, and batteries.Fair Value: In calculating fair value, I consider the NPV MMA Differential Fair Value along with these four calculations of fair value, see page 2 of the linked PDF for a detailed description:1. Avg. High Yield Price 2. 20-Year DCF Price 3. Avg. P/E Price 4. Graham NumberJCI is trading at a premium to all four valuations above. The stock is trading at a 10.6% discount to its calculated fair value of $52.32. JCI earned a Star in this section since it is trading at a fair value.Dividend Analytical Data: In this section there are three possible Stars and three key metrics, see page 2 of the linked PDF for a detailed description:1. Free Cash Flow Payout 2. Debt To Total Capital 3. Key Metrics 4. Dividend Growth Rate 5. Years of Div. Growth 6. Rolling 4-yr Div. > 15%JCI earned two Stars in this section for 2.) and 3.) above. The stock earned a Star as a result of its most recent Debt to Total Capital being less than 45%. JCI earned a Star for having an acceptable score in at least two of the four Key Metrics measured. The company has paid a cash dividend to shareholders every year since 1887 and has increased its dividend payments for 23 consecutive years.Dividend Income vs. MMA: Why would you assume the equity risk and invest in a dividend stock if you could earn a better return in a much less risky money market account (MMA) or Treasury bond? This section compares the earning ability of this stock with a high yield MMA. Two items are considered in this section, see page 2 of the linked PDF for a detailed description:1. NPV MMA Diff. 2. Years to > MMAJCI earned a Star in this section for its NPV MMA Diff. of the $2,184. This amount is in excess of the $1,200 target I look for in a stock that has increased dividends as long as JCI has. If JCI grows its dividend at 12.4% per year, it will take 1 year to equal a MMA yielding an estimated 20-year average rate of 2.47%. JCI earned a check for the Key Metric ""Years to >MMA"" since its 1 year is less than the 5-year target.Memberships and Peers: JCI is a member of the S&P 500. The company's peer group includes: Autoliv, Inc. (NYSE:ALV) with a 2.1% yield, Magna International Inc. (NYSE:MGA) with a 1.4% yield, and Lear Corp. (NYSE:LEA) with a 0.8% yield.Conclusion: JCI earned one Star in the Fair Value section, earned two Stars in the Dividend Analytical Data section and earned one Star in the Dividend Income vs. MMA section for a total of four Stars. This quantitatively ranks JCI as a 4-Star Strong stock.Using my D4L-PreScreen.xls model, I determined the share price would need to increase to $60.94 before JCI's NPV MMA Differential decreased to the $1,200 minimum that I look for in a stock with 23 years of consecutive dividend increases. At that price the stock would yield 1.7%.Resetting the D4L-PreScreen.xls model and solving for the dividend growth rate needed to generate the target $1,200 NPV MMA Differential, the calculated rate is 10.0%. This dividend growth rate is below the 12.4% used in this analysis, thus providing a margin of safety. JCI has a risk rating of 1.50, which classifies it as a Low risk stock.JCI has a strong management team and enjoys favorable growth prospects in the building controls markets served. Long-term sales and earnings growth should exceed its peers with greater earnings stability. The company is focused on new growth markets with higher returns, along with an emphasis on its presence in China.On October 30th, the company reported adjusted earnings of $1.04 per share for fiscal fourth-quarter, up 14.3% from the $0.91 in the prior-year comparable quarter. JCI anticipates improved results in fiscal 2015 versus fiscal 2014, with higher profitability from all three businesses. The company projects earnings per share in the range of $3.55 to $3.70 for fiscal 2015, compared to the $3.18 per share recorded in fiscal 2014. Sales revenues in 2015 are should benefit from improvement in the Building Efficiency and Power Solutions segments.The company has a strong balance sheet, with a low debt to total capital of 37% and free cash flow payout of 59%. The stock is trading below my calculated fair value of $52.32. However, its yield is slightly below my minimum. For now, I will continue to watch JCI before initiating a position.Disclaimer: Material presented here is for informational purposes only.

2782775,72015,2014-12-29T03:31:58-05:00,"Shares of Johnson Controls have underperformed both the S&P 500 and its largest competitors in 2014.
        The firm has adequate financial flexibility, but its earnings and share price have been highly volatile in recent years.
        Its returns on both assets and invested capital are meager compared to other auto part manufacturers.
        Despite trading at a modest forward earnings multiple, shares of Johnson Controls still appear overvalued thanks to these fundamental issues.","Johnson Controls (NYSE:JCI) was a disappointment in 2014 as neither its sales nor its earnings demonstrated any meaningful growth over the previous year's results and the firm's share price drastically underperformed competitors. The company is a global leader in automotive seat manufacturing, but also has significant exposure to industrial heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) sector. Johnson Controls' most recent corporate presentation outlines its various business segments:The good news for investors is that the stock now trades at under 12 times forward earnings, despite a projected double digit long term earnings growth rate. There is also speculation that Canadian auto parts manufacturer Magna (NYSE:MGA) might look to acquire Johnson Controls' seating business in the coming year. This article examines Johnson Controls in detail to determine whether it could outperform next year after a lackluster 2014.Please click here to read my article which outlines the DRAG analysis framework in more detail.To summarize, the four variables used in a DRAG (dividend and risk adjusted growth) analysis are as follows (each company is ranked from 0 to 3 in each category): 1) How cyclical is the industry in which Johnson Controls operates? 2) How strong is Johnson Controls' competitive position within this industry? 3) How risky is Johnson Controls' balance sheet? 4) What is Johnson Controls' dividend yield and dividend growth history?The premise is that a company that operates in a non-cyclical industry, with a strong competitive position and a clean balance sheet that pays an attractive dividend should trade at a higher earnings multiple than a company without these attributes, even if the lower quality company has higher projected future earnings growth. After adjusting for these variables, it becomes easier to compare companies in different sectors with different levels of future growth potential.Johnson Controls DRAG Analysis:Although nearly half of its business is not connected to the automotive sector, Johnson Controls is classified by most analysts as an automotive parts company and its elevated beta reflects this classification. Auto parts stocks are highly volatile; an academic research website from NYU suggests that the average stock in this sector has a beta of 1.46. Over the last five years, Johnson Controls' share price has exhibited even higher levels of volatility compared to the broader market:In addition, the firm's historical results suggest its operations are particularly economically sensitive. Its year over year earnings per share have declined five times in the last decade and the firm lost $0.57 per share in its fiscal 2009. Its elevated beta and cyclical nature warrant a significantly below average score in this portion of the DRAG framework.Although Johnson Controls does not generate impressive margins, both its gross and operating margin are modestly higher than comparable auto part manufacturers such as Magna and Lear (NYSE:LEA). Furthermore, its margins have improved slightly in recent years. Nevertheless, the company's efficiency ratios are rather poor and lower than one might expect, given the firm's dominant position in both the automotive seating and industrial HVAC industries. Johnson Controls has not managed an annual return on assets of greater than 6% at any point during the last decade and its return on invested capital has not surpassed 10% since 2011. Based on this data, the company does not possess a meaningful competitive advantage and therefore deserves a below average score for its competitive position.Although Johnson Controls' is not a highly leveraged company, its combination of significant goodwill and a low cash balance make its financial position only adequate. The firm has a total of $6.7 billion in total debt outstanding, which does not appear excessive given its $32 billion market capitalization. However, this leads to interest coverage of less than 10 times and the company's cash position of $400 million is part of the reason why its current ratio is barely above 1. In addition, goodwill accounts for more than $7 billion (more than 60%) of Johnson Controls' $11.3 billion book value of equity. While shareholders should not be particularly concerned about the firm's financial outlook, its balance sheet is also not a significantly positive attribute for investors.Johnson Controls has an impressive dividend growth history stretching back more than a decade. Although the firm did not increase its payout for three years during the financial crisis, its recent dividend growth has accelerated. In November, Johnson Controls increased its quarterly dividend from $0.22 per share to $0.26, raising its current yield to above 2% in the process. In its recently completed fiscal 2014, the company spent more than $1 billion on share repurchases compared to a little over $500 million on dividend payments. While its yield might be on the low side for some income investors, those focused on dividend growth should consider Johnson Controls as a possible addition to their portfolios.The analyst community believes that Johnson Controls' future earnings outlook with remain consistent with the previous five years, during which time its earnings per share grew at an annualized rate of nearly 12%:However, despite possessing a PEG (price to growth) ratio of less than 1 thanks to a forward price to earnings ratio of below 12, the DRAG framework believes that shares of Johnson Controls are overvalued by approximately 10%. This is due to the firm's elevated earnings volatility, low efficiency ratios and merely average dividend yield. In comparison, Magna trades at a similar valuation, yet has a higher anticipated earnings growth rate, generates a return on invested capital of almost 20% and has a nearly debt free balance sheet. While Johnson Controls is certainly an inexpensive stock relative to analysts' growth forecasts, its fundamental attributes do not suggest its fortunes will turn around in 2015. Those interested in adding an auto parts manufacturer to their portfolio should consider buying shares of Magna instead."

There can be three ways to add growth to the market share and ultimately, financial returns: tuck-in acquisitions, joint ventures and organic development. With a strategic aim to expand the building business, Johnson Controls Inc. (NYSE:JCI) has recently adopted the joint venture route by joining hands with Japan's Hitachi Limited in order to develop innovative technology products in heating, ventilation, air conditioning and refrigeration industry following the acquisition of Air Distribution Technologies last year.In this article, I will analyze the details of the agreement between the two companies and quantify its financial implications.The Details Of The AgreementTogether, the two companies aim to develop and offer its clients a broader range of air conditioning products which covers variable refrigerant flow ""VRF"" technology, inverter technology based room air conditioners and absorption chillers in addition to the high class products already being marketed by Johnson Controls. It also increases the company's geographical footprint in the Asian markets.The alliance sums the manufacturing plants to 24 and aims to utilize the research and development, advanced technology and marketing expertise of both the entities to achieve its objective. The joint venture benefits Johnson by providing added access to Hitachi's distribution channels in the high growth markets like China and Japan along with its variable refrigerant flow gear and compressors which are in high demand in the Asian continent. Similarly, Hitachi will be able to benefit from Johnson's established distribution channels in the North American region.According to Alex Molinaroli, chairman and CEO of Johnson Controls, ""This partnership reflects our strategic commitment to our buildings business as a growth platform. The joint venture will propel us forward with superior products, enabling Johnson Controls to deliver the most diverse technology portfolio in the industry to meet customer demands across the changing global marketplace.""Moreover, the global HVAC market is witnessing steady growth which indicates that the demand for energy saving air conditioners with innovative technologies is on the rise. Air conditioners form an important part of the building solutions and the combination is expected to increase the quality of solutions being delivered to the clients. Furthermore, it is also expected to enable the company to offer better solutions for other building products and related areas.Quantifying The Financial ImplicationsSource: Wall Street Journal, Yahoo FinanceAs per the terms of the agreement, Johnson Controls holds a majority stake of 60% in the joint venture with the remaining part belonging to Hitachi. The company has projected the alliance to rake in $2.6 billion in annual revenue in the fiscal year 2016. Applying the company's ownership percentage, the addition to the top line of Johnson Controls is estimated to clock in at $1.56 billion. On average, it is expected to generate profit margin of 4.50%. Applying the profit margin, the uplift in earnings is derived to be $70.20 million by the year 2016. On a per share basis, the EPS of Johnson Controls is anticipated to increase by $0.11 in 2016.Final NoteThe deal is part of the company's strategic plan to center its efforts on high margin raking non-auto business. In the wake of the gradually rising demand for building solutions, the strengthened product line and enhanced geographical outreach in Asia, I believe the joint venture is a positive step towards achieving growth by Johnson Controls."

At the time of last writing my upside case was based on a re-rated multiple of 16x forward EPS of $4.00 which equates to a target price of $64.

2740525,67985,2014-12-08T18:42:21-05:00,Management is focused on transforming the company to increase profitability in the intermediate term.Divesting of low-margin businesses and acquiring of higher-margin businesses should increase profitability.The company recently raised their dividend 18 percent.A rising dividend payout and substantial share repurchases will reward shareholders while waiting for the business transformation to lift profitability.,"Johnson Controls (NYSE:JCI) has had mixed results with regard to their revenue growth, even though the company had shown operational improvements across all of their businesses. Given such circumstances, JCI's earnings growth is below that of their competitors', and, as such, the market is assigning a price-to-earnings multiple to JCI that is lower than the price-to-earnings ratio assigned to their competitors. The company, however, is in the midst of divesting lower-margin businesses and acquiring higher-margin businesses that will increase profitability in the intermediate term.The company's shares currently yield about 2.10 percent as the company recently raised their dividend 18 percent. JCI's shares should strongly be considered for purchase as part of an investor's portfolio during the overall markets next 5 to 10 percent pullback. As recently as October 2014, during the overall market sell-off, JCI's shares dropped just below $40 and have since rebounded. As the company's ongoing transformation takes hold and becomes more appreciated by investors, the company's shares will be assigned a price to earnings ratio assigned to the company's competitors and the shares could rise to the low $60s in 18 to 24 months.BackgroundJCI is composed of three divisions. JCI's largest business division is its automotive division, which currently includes an interiors group, as well as seats, doors, and instrumentation panels. This division accounted for 51% of its 2013 revenue of $42.7 billion and 43% of its $3 billion in pretax income. The second-largest division of JCI is its building efficiencies division, which manufactures and services the infrastructure for forced-air heating and cooling in office buildings. This division accounts for 34% of 2013 revenue and 32% of pretax income. The third, the power solutions division, manufactures batteries, including standard lead car batteries and energy-efficient stop/start systems. The power solutions unit accounts for 15% of revenue and 33% of income. JCI management indicates that each division will account for essentially a third of overall revenues in the next few years.Divestitures and acquisitionsOver the last few years, JCI has worked to exit its low-margin industrial businesses and move towards faster-growing markets or sub-markets and away from more capital-intensive and less-profitable markets. By selling off their auto-electronics unit and their garage-door-opening business and buying a company that makes heating and cooling and security systems for residential and commercial buildings, JCI exited two relatively small, capital-intensive businesses to enter a business that has margins nearly double its overall net margin. Through such actions, JCI is working towards managing its capital more efficiently and increase its earnings. More recently in May 2014, JCI announced its plan to spin off its low-margin, slow-growth auto interiors business into a joint venture with a division of the Chinese company SAIC. JCI will own 30 percent of the joint venture and receive an annual dividend as well. This spin-off into the joint venture changes the profile of JCI's interiors business from being a disadvantaged business that was in low-growth regions with a high cost base to a global company, whereby the spun-off joint venture has access to low-cost tooling, manufacturing equipment, and low-cost engineering skilled workers.Fiscal fourth quarter 2014 earningsIn late October 2014, JCI announced adjusted earnings of $1.04 per share. Earnings increased 14.3 percent from 91 cents in the year-ago quarter. Including restructuring and non-recurring items, JCI's net income was $311 million or 46 cents per share.  Revenues increased 2.6 percent from the year-ago quarter to $10.98 billion. Revenue growth across all of the company's divisions led to the revenue increase.  The company's automotive experience division revenue increased 3 percent from the year-ago quarter to $5.3 billion. The company's building efficiency division revenues increased 1 percent from the year-ago quarter to $3.93 billion. The company's power solutions division revenue increased 5 percent to $1.8 billion from the year-ago quarter.JCI announced the reorganization of their building efficiency division in their fiscal 2014 fourth quarter.  The company announced their North American branch business of their building efficiency division will operate separately from the global products business. The company expects this action to be more profitable for their business.  In addition, JCI announced that their plans to divest their global workplace solutions business. The company indicated they were taking such steps to invest in businesses that are core to their long-term growth and multi-industrial portfolio.Fiscal year 2015 guidanceIn early December 2014, JCI announced that they expected to earn record profits in their fiscal 2015. The company expects diluted earnings per share of approximately $3.55 to $3.70, excluding transaction and integration costs associated with their merger and acquisition activity, on consolidated net sales of approximately $42.3 billion, an amount flat in comparison with their fiscal 2014. The company expects sales increases in their building efficiency and power solutions divisions and profitability improvements in all three of their divisions. The company's automotive seating division 2015 sales are expected to decrease 5 to 6 percent. The company's power solutions division 2015 sales are expected to increase approximately 8 to 10 percent. The company's building efficiency division 2015 sales, excluding global workplace solutions, are expected to be up 9 to 11 percent.Our viewJCI management is working to transform the company by exiting low-margin businesses and acquiring higher-margin businesses. This transformation is ongoing, and the results will become more appreciated by Wall Street and individual investors in the next 18 to 24 months. Many investors are failing to appreciate the divestitures and acquisitions JCI has been making recently to exit low-margin businesses and enter higher-margin businesses. Further, JCI's slow but steady transformation will capitalize on future trends, such as the energy-efficiency concerns of office tower owners and energy-efficient battery technology. JCI's present price to earnings ratio is 27.60. Earnings estimates for JCI are $3.62 for their current fiscal year 2015 and $4.15 for their fiscal year 2016. These earnings estimates have been falling over the last 3 months. JCI's shares are therefore trading at a forward price to earnings ratio of 13.70 based on fiscal year 2015 earnings estimates and 11.95 based on fiscal year 2016 earnings estimates. As JCI's margins increase, the company's forward price-to-earnings ratio should rise to a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 15. A price-to-earnings ratio of 15 is more in line with the price-to-earnings ratios of JCI's competitors: Emerson Electric (NYSE:EMR), Honeywell (NYSE:HON) and United Technologies (NYSE:UTX). As such, JCI's shares could reach a share price between $60 and $65 in about 18 to 24 months from now, given JCI's recent transformative actions. That said, with most stock market indexes at or near record highs, an individual investor might want to wait for JCI to drop to a share price between $42.50 and $47.50 to establish a full position. In fact, during the last overall market decline in October 2014, JCI's shares broke through the $40 level. Over the long term, JCI will reward investors with increasing dividends (as noted, a recent 18 percent increase), substantial share repurchases and a rising share price."
3062386,74855,2015-04-10T13:26:38-04:00,"Diversified technology company and business solutions provider Johnson Controls has been engaged in the process of streamlining its portfolio in order to gear itself properly towards long term growth.The company recently announced the sale of its Global Workplace Solutions (GWS) business to real estate services provider CBRE Group Inc. in a deal worth almost $1.5 billion in cash.The divestment would represent a 10% hit to Johnson Controls’ revenues. Furthermore, there are massive growth prospects in store in the global facilities management industry.There could be an estimated 2% boost to the company’s margins as a result of the sale of the GWS division.The 10-year strategic cooperation agreement between Johnson Controls and CBRE Group which is part of the deal would result in a huge boost to Johnson Controls’ HVAC business.","Diversified technology company and business solutions provider Johnson Controls (NYSE: JCI) has been engaged in the process of streamlining its portfolio in order to gear itself properly towards long term growth. To this end, Johnson Controls has previously divested from its automotive electronics business and has spun off a majority of its automotive interiors segment into independent companies. The company recently announced the sale of its Global Workplace Solutions (GWS) business to real estate services provider CBRE Group Inc. (NYSE: CBG) in a deal worth almost $1.5 billion in cash. Johnson Controls has been fully engaged in efforts towards streamlining its portfolio and focusing on its most efficient segments as part of its long term growth strategy. The company is aiming towards a high degree of operational efficiency to drive long term growth. Johnson Controls has been a steady performer financially over the course of the last few years with the recovery of the US economy aiding the company's growth. The company's HVAC business is expected to be the leading driver of long term growth amid the downsizing of its portfolio. The divestment of Johnson Controls' GWS business does seem puzzling considering the segment's 10% contribution to the company's annual revenues, but the overall benefits of the deal will offset any downsides to revenues and enhance the operational efficiency of Johnson Controls' portfolio.Potential downsides from the sale of the GWS businessJohnson Controls' Global Workplace Solutions business caters mainly to the facilitation and provision of energy solutions to corporate real estate management services. The GWS business accounts for 10% of Johnson Controls' total revenues and almost 5% of the company's share value. The divestment would thus represent a 10% hit to Johnson Controls' revenues. Furthermore, there are massive growth prospects in store in the global facilities management industry which is expected to grow at a CAGR of over 12% over the course of the next 5 years. Johnson Controls thus faces a high implicit cost or opportunity cost as well owing to its divestment from the GWS business. However, owing to the relatively smaller contribution of the GWS business to the company's share value, there are no significant long term downsides in store for Johnson Controls as a result of the divestiture of the GWS business. The opportunity cost in this case could be measured as the potential upsides to share prices that the company may have realized owing to the growth in the facilities management market. However, the opportunity cost is also minimal owing to the smaller revenue contribution of the GWS division to share value.Potential upsides for Johnson Controls from the sale of the GWS businessThe GWS division had been witnessing declining revenues over the course of the last couple of years in particular amid the loss of contracts. The segment also had poorer margins as compared to the rest of Johnson Controls' operating divisions. The divestiture would thus represent an improvement in operational efficiency and thus a boost to the company's overall margins. The poor margin contribution of the GWS segment was the main reason why Johnson Controls chose to leave the segment out of its future plans. There could be an estimated 2% boost to the company's margins as a result of the sale of the GWS division taking into account the declining margins from the segment and the resulting declining margin contribution of the segment. The divestment will thus refine the company's portfolio and put the company in a better position for achieving long term growth. Furthermore, the cash inflow from the deal would boost Johnson Controls' cash reserves immensely and help facilitate any future dividend payouts and share repurchases and thus eventually generating upside potential for the company's share prices. The 10-year strategic cooperation agreement between Johnson Controls and CBRE Group, which is part of the deal, would result in a huge boost to Johnson Controls' HVAC business as it would make the company the major HVAC equipment supplier for CBRE's massive real estate portfolio, and the synergies from the deal would result in incremental revenues of $500 million annually for Johnson Controls once the deal is fully implemented and integration is completed. The cost benefits for Johnson Controls would also be immense as they will be provided with integrated corporate real estate services by CBRE as part of the deal which would include facilities management, project management and transaction services. The benefits to Johnson Controls from the sale of its GWS business thus clearly outweigh the costs to the company.ConclusionThe sale of Johnson Controls' GWS division represents a streamlining if the company's portfolio and will allow for the refinement of it portfolio towards improving long term growth prospects. The company will face a hit to its revenues but the benefits from the deal monetary and otherwise are more than enough to offset any costs. The company has already seen its share prices rise in response to the announcement of the sale and there are definitely upsides in store for investors. Now would be a great time to go long in Johnson Controls."

The company is undergoing a transformational strategy that will likely unfold over a few years' time. JCI is currently shedding assets in markets that it does not believe it can dominate. Following the successful disposition as less desirable assets, it is likely that JCI will continue to build on its strengths in Building Efficiency assets. These changes may have a bit of a limiting effect on revenue growth, but will add significant profitability through increased margins. Proceeds from divestitures can be reinvested in higher return opportunities like Building Efficiency.Following the successful completion of the above strategies we believe JCI will be awarded a re-rating by expanding its forward P/E ratio from 14x to 16x. In this case our target price is $64/share which represents a return of 45%.Steps to Create ValueManagement has outlined several steps to create shareholder value going forward. These initiatives play a critical part in the thesis for buying JCI. Specifically, share repurchases, asset sales, and free cash flow growth should be major drivers of value. The company has outlined the following contributors to shareholder value:Overview of Business UnitsBuilding Efficiency BusinessJCI makes buildings in 125 countries more comfortable, productive and safe. The company offers a broad range of services including, HVAC equipment, building controls, and technologies. Mega trends are positive for the growth of Building Efficiency, including: higher energy prices, green house gas legislation, and high growth rates in emerging markets.Automotive SeatingJCI is a leading global provider of complete seats, and seat components. The company has a global footprint, diversified customer base and products. JCI is also an established market leader in the growing Chinese market.Power SolutionsJCI is the world's largest provider of battery power solutions for the vehicle original equipment market and aftermarket. The company has 36% global market share for SLI batteries and provides AGM batteries for start-stop vehicles and Li-ion batteries.Free Cash Flow ForecastManagement expects to generate free cash flow of $1.6 billion in 2014, $1.7 billion in 2015 and $2.0 billion in 2016.Source: IR Presentation.Free Cash Flow per share has increased significantly over the past three years, and given a combination of an increasing FCF forecast, combined with share buyback, FCFPS should enjoy a significant increase over the next 3 years. JCI Free Cash Flow Per Share (TTM) data by YChartsExpanding MarginsJCI has been expanding margins over the past 5 years, increasing to 8.8% from 4.5% (an increase of nearly 100%). EV/EBITDA margins are used as a proxy to cash flow margins.JCI EBITDA Margin (TTM) data by YChartsBase Case ValuationPeers which include Delphi (NYSE:DLPH) and Siemens (OTCPK:SIEGY) trade at similar but slightly lower multiples than JCI. On a forward P/E basis JCI trades at 14x versus Siemens at 13x and Delphi at 12x.JCI PE Ratio (Forward) data by YChartsIf we apply the free cash flow growth rate of 25% over the next two years (see free cash flow section above) as a proxy to EBITDA growth, and we apply the expanding margins trend that has been realized over the past 5 years we arrive at a 2016 EPS estimate of $4.00.By applying a constant P/E multiple of 14x we then arrive at a base-case price target of $56, which represents upside of 27% from today's price. Added on to this is an attractive divided yield of 2% which translates to a total shareholder return over the next year of 29%.Upside Case & ConclusionAs JCI completes its transformational strategy over a few years by shedding assets in less attractive markets and continuing to build on its strengths in Building Efficiency assets the stock should receive a re-rating in the market. This re-rating is likely to be the result of higher margins, a more focused business strategy, and larger market share / dominance in the markets in which it operates. Our upside case is based on a re-rated multiple of 16x forward EPS ($4.00) which equates to a target price of $64, or upside of 45%."

Under the leadership of its new CEO, Alex Molinaroli, the company has made several strategic changes, including the change in the revenue mix and geographic mix.As part of the restructuring, the company sold its automotive electronics business to Visteon, and is now focusing on the expansion of its building-efficiency portfolio. Through these strategic changes, Johnson Controls will reduce its exposure to the cyclical and lower-profit automotive industry, and redesign itself into a conglomerate.These strategic changes are projected to create a loss of $5 billion in annual sales from the automotive industry and gain $3 billion from products sold to the building efficiency markets. However, it is expected that the company's margins will expand after the restructuring, consequently improving per share earnings.Change in Revenue MixAs part of its building-efficiency portfolio expansion, Johnson Controls acquired Air Distribution Technologies, a Texas air ventilation company, for $1.6 billion. Air Distribution Technologies is one of the largest independent providers of air-distribution and ventilation products in North America. The company also provides facilities in China, India, and the Middle East.Air Distribution Technologies's business is in alliance with Johnson Controls's current business, but there is a very little overlap between the products and sales channel. Therefore, the acquisition would provide Johnson Controls with the opportunity to both expand its portfolio and its geographic presence.After the transaction, Jonson Controls's dependence on the automotive industry would further reduce, and about 40% of its revenues will be generated from the building efficiency business. It is projected that Air Distribution Technologies would generate approximately $920 million in FY14.To expand the building efficiency portfolio, Johnson Controls also entered into a strategic alliance with Hitachi. The collaboration will enable both companies to jointly work on several projects planned in the U.S. and Singapore.As commercial construction activity in both the U.S. and Chinese markets, the company's major markets, is expected to grow in the future, the company's expansion of its building-efficiency portfolio will help to grab more opportunities, eventually generating stronger revenues. Molinaroli's expertise in the building efficiency business will further benefit the company.Change in Geographic MixAs a part of its restructuring plan, Johnson Controls is also changing its geographic mix. The company has been expanding its business in the fast-growing Chinese auto market, the world's largest market, which has an annual production of 22 million vehicles. According to the company's CEO, China is the only place where the company would be making more investments in automotive sector. As a result of the change in geographic mix, Johnson Controls has planned to start a ""second corporate headquarters"" in Shanghai, and decided to base two of its 16 corporate officers in China.To gain a foothold in the region, Johnson Controls announced the opening of a new battery plant in the country in the third quarter of FY14, which is projected to produce 6 million automotive batteries per year. The company already has a major automotive battery plant in eastern China, from where it produces around 8 million batteries per year.Moreover, Johnson Controls also made a Shanghai-based joint venture with Yanfeng Automotive Trim Systems, which will supply instrument panels, door panels, and a variety of other car interior components. Johnson Controls will have a 30% stake in the venture. The venture will enable the company to participate in the rapid growth industry without making significant capital investments. Instead, the company will be able to allocate capital to other ventures.Currently, Johnson Controls has approximately $7 billion of its total business in China. In the third quarter of FY14, demand in the company's automotive business was driven mainly by China. The region contributed $1.8 billion (about 32%) to the division's total revenue of $5.7 billion.Thanks to its new ventures, it is anticipated that Johnson Controls will experience an increase in both the revenues and the profits, as the strength in the Chinese market and the margins in its auto industry will continue. According to the company's management, the revenues from the Chinese division will reach approximately $12.5 billion in FY18, compared to $7.2 billion in FY13, growing at a CAGR of 11.66%.Source: Company PresentationFinal ThoughtsAlex Molinaroli is effectively reducing Johnson Controls's dependence on the cyclical automotive industry, making the company's future revenue and profit growth more certain. Through the changes made in revenue mix, the company will lose $2 billion revenues annually, but at the same time its margins will expand, resulting in higher profits. Currently, the building efficiency industry is growing at a faster pace than the automotive industry, which will create more growth opportunities for Johnson Controls. Therefore, it is anticipated that the company's revenues will also expand in the coming years on the back of these opportunities.The company's plan to expand into the high-growth Chinese market is also a wise decision, as the region generates a good chunk of the company's revenues. The projected revenue growth in China is also quite impressive. Therefore, the geographical expansion will expand the company's top line as well as bottom line in the upcoming years.Currently, Johnson Controls is experiencing deteriorating margins due to its ongoing restructuring, but once the restructuring is complete, the margins will expand again. The margin and revenue expansion due to geographical and portfolio changes will bring handsome returns for both the company and the investors."
2526645,67985,2014-09-29T01:31:19-04:00,The company’s reorganization of its building efficiency business is in line with its long-term strategy to position the business for profitable global growth.The company has exited its low-margin industrial businesses in recent years and focused on faster-growing markets or sub-markets.We did anticipate JCI’s reorganization given the company’s stated strategy over recent years of managing its capital more efficiently and increasing its earnings.,"In mid September 2014, Johnson Controls (NYSE:JCI) announced a significant reorganization of its Building Efficiency business to better align the division with the company's long-term strategies and to position the business for profitable global growth. Effective on the date of the announcement, JCI's North America branch business began operating separately from the company's Building Efficiency's global products business. The company indicated that its core heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) products organization will drive profitable global growth through investments in key HVAC product offerings such as the recent acquisition of Air Distribution Technologies (ADTI) and the company's planned Hitachi joint venture for variable refrigerant flow (VRF) technology.Over the last few years, JCI has worked to exit its low-margin industrial businesses and move towards faster-growing markets or sub-markets and away from more capital-intensive and less-profitable markets. By selling off its auto-electronics unit and the garage-door-opening business and buying a company that makes heating and cooling and security systems for residential and commercial buildings, JCI exited two relatively small, capital-intensive businesses to enter a business that has margins nearly double its overall net margin. The recently announced reorganization of the company's building efficiency business is a continuation of the company's strategy to jump start revenue and profit growth for the company.In our previous article, we noted that earlier in 2014 the company had mixed results for top line revenue growth, even though the company had shown operational improvements across all of its businesses. In addition, we noted that the company's commercial buildings segment had been struggling because the overall market has been struggling. With JCI's earnings growth being below its competitors, the market has been assigning a price-to-earnings multiple to JCI that is lower than the price-to-earnings ratio assigned to its competitors. We concluded, however, that management's transformation by exiting low-margin businesses and acquiring higher-margin businesses would become more appreciated by Wall Street and individual investors over the next 18 to 24 months. The company's recent building efficiency business reorganization reinforces our belief that JCI shares will perform well in the intermediate and long term. Finally, we stated that potential investors should wait for JCI to drop to a share price between 42.50 and 47.50 to establish a full position. JCI's shares are now within that range at about $45 a share and investors may want to initiate at least a partial position now. Be aware that an overall 10 to 15 percent market correction could bring the shares to the $39 to $41 price range. Also, JCI's annual dividend increase is likely to occur in the next several weeks."

In an environment where raising demand may not be just a game of marketing anymore, achieving cost reduction has become one of the key objectives of many players. To facilitate food and beverage market, Johnson Controls Inc. (NYSE:JCI) has recently added ECOSS, a stainless steel evaporative condenser, to its portfolio of industrial refrigeration solutions.ECOSSThe condenser is specially designed to prevent from water problems like rust, corrosion that lead to reduced life of the product as was the case with traditional galvanized steel condensers. Apart from being light weight, the stain steel used helps in avoiding scale formation which results in lesser clean-up and passivation downtime. The cutting edge technology employed results in lower energy input. This is likely to result in operational cost savings for the clients and have a positive impact on the user's bottom line.Moreover, the ECOSS is not only efficient in operation, it also has two times the working lifespan of a traditional galvanized steel condenser. This is likely to reduce the incurrence of capital expenditure of the buyer, leading to higher demand for Johnson's ECOSS.According to Michael Colley, product manager, Industrial Refrigeration, Johnson Controls, ""the unit is ideally suited for use in the North American food and beverage market."" In an operating environment where management is constantly on the lookout to trim business running costs, the efficient features of ECOSS can be one of the ideal investments by a business in an attempt to boost profits of the buyer. Although it may be a little early to quantify the exact scale of elevation in the bottom line, Johnson Controls is likely to experience a hike in demand for its innovation.Expanding Footprint In China:De-emphasize AutoAs part of its restructuring plan to align its business, the company has divested from its auto-interior business to team up with a Chinese company, Yanfeng Automotive Trim Systems Company. The grouping will benefit Chinese auto manufacturers from designing and manufacturing to shaping products. This joint venture will mark the third fabrics facility in the country. It will provide an active opportunity for the group to exploit the expertise of Johnson to help customers in coming up with innovative vehicle programs.According to Qian Li, deputy mayor of Huainan City, ""Johnson Controls is one of the first global Fortune 500 companies to invest in Huainan. The government will support Johnson Controls and their local partners' growth in Huainan."" With the government's backing, the company is well set to take advantage of the key opportunities in this region. Also, the Chinese company has customers from the lower end of the market while Johnson focuses on the premium end which will allow both the parties to benefit from the new diversified client base.The joint venture will put Johnson in a position to leverage on the auto-interior demand in China.Source: Bloomberg, Yahoo FinanceThe joint venture is estimated to garner $7,500 million revenue in 2015 and grow at a rate of 8% going forward for the upcoming 5 years. Johnson has a 30% share in the joint venture and thus, $2,250 million revenue is likely to flow to the company in 2015, increasing to $3,306 million by 2020.The project is projected to generate pretax margin in the range of 5-6%. Roughly, this is likely to translate into a net profit margin of 4.5%. On a per share basis, this joint venture will uplift the bottom line by 0.15 in 2015, increasing to 0.22 by 2020.Emphasize Building EfficiencySince China is one of the major growth markets, the company plans to expand its headquarter building and build one in Shanghai as well. Johnson Controls has bright future prospects in China as the company's high class building technologies and solutions assist the objective of the Chinese government. The government is encouraging reduced energy usage and lowest carbon emissions in order to promote a greener and healthy environment.Source: Outlook PresentationOverall, it is expected that the company's revenue derived from China will grow to $12.5 billion by 2018, an increase of $833 million per annum. Applying the net profit margin ""ttm"" of 3.14%, this will uplift the company's bottom line by $26 million per year.ConclusionBased on the company's increasing focus on the non-cyclical segment of building efficiency and reduced concentration in the auto industry, it makes the company recession resilient. Also, the increased penetration in the high growth market like China is likely to add decent numbers to the company's top and bottom line in the upcoming years."
2113053,25871,2014-03-27T13:59:46-04:00,"Johnson Controls has been an especially consistent company, paying a dividend every year since 1887 and increasing revenues for 62 straight years until 2009.Earnings collapsed dramatically during the Great Recession due to JCI’s exposure to the cyclical automotive industry.Since 2009 the company has shown a propensity to get back to its profitable ways and is expected to grow its business nicely in the intermediate term.","Johnson Controls (NYSE:JCI) traces its roots back to an interesting bit of history. One hundred and thirty-one years ago, Warren Johnson was a professor in Whitewater, Wisconsin. It was here that he invented and installed the first electric tele-thermoscope - known today as the thermostat - in his classrooms. The invention served a dual purpose: it kept his students more comfortable and put an end to the hourly interruptions from the janitor checking the rooms' temperature. Of course we can't confirm this, but it would be our guess that Professor Warren was a regular student favorite.Shortly thereafter the Johnson Electric Service Company was launched in 1885, and in the coming decades the business brought evenly regulated temperatures to buildings around the world. Today the company is known as Johnson Controls and still has a hand in global temperature regulation. For instance, Johnson Controls' ""building efficiency"" segment contributes roughly a third of Johnson Controls' sales by increasing energy efficiency for more than one million customers in the heating, ventilating and air-conditioning areas. However, Johnson Controls has diversified greatly such that the roughly half of its business is now derived from the segment ""automotive experience"" - with 240 worldwide plants, a global capability to supply more than 50 million cars per year and a focus on seating, instrument panels and interior electronics. Finally, roughly a seventh of the business is classified as ""power solutions"" where Johnson Controls supplies over a third of the world's lead-acid batteries to major automakers.If you put it all together, the corporation has grown from a single idea in the 1800's to a $30 billion company with about 170,000 employees, 1,300 worldwide locations and sales of $42.7 billion last year.Perhaps equally impressive to the company's story is its record of consistently rewarding shareholders. Most to this point is Johnson Controls' dividend record. Johnson Controls has paid a dividend every single year since 1887 - that's consistency in 3 different centuries mind you. More than that, the company also increased its dividend every single year from 1975 to 2008. Now, it is true that Johnson Controls had to freeze its payout during the Great Recession - which was due to the massive collapse of automakers during this time. However, since 2010 Johnson Controls has gone back to its roots by increasing the payouts by an average rate of 14% per year. In other words, one might be hard pressed to find other companies with such dividend consistency that are not on fellow Seeking Alpha Contributor David Fish's ""CCC lists.""Furthermore, the company also announced a $3 billion increase in its share repurchase program which it intends to execute over the next few years. So the propensity to reward shareholders is quite high.With that, let's take a look at the company's past operating history along with how analysts are presenting viewing this company through the fundamentals analyzer software tool of F.A.S.T. Graphs™.We have already described the company's steady history, but here we can see that Johnson Controls had been a very consistent company up until the most recent recession - in fact, revenues had increased every year for 62 years until the financial crisis. Yet unlike other very consistent companies - for instance Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) or Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) - whose profits barely noticed the recession, Johnson Controls' business rode the cyclical automotive wave and took it on the chin.Earnings per share dropped from $2.27 in fiscal year 2008 to just $0.26 in 2009. Moreover, it took the company four more years to finally eclipse its previous EPS record mark. However, the long-term picture is a bit more reassuring. Since 2001 earnings have grown by about 9% a year and since 1996 the number has been closer to 12% per annum.When we look at the performance results, it's clear that the recession didn't permanently impair Johnson Controls' business. A hypothetical $10,000 investment at the end of 2000 would now be worth about $52,000. More than that, an investor would have received roughly $7,000 in dividend income as well - bringing the total annualized return up to 14.4%. This compares to the S&P 500 returning just 3.6% during the same time period. Furthermore, we think it's important to underscore the dividend per share column.As discussed above, Johnson Controls was forced to freeze its dividend from 2008 to 2010. However, notice that this was a freeze rather than a cut. Despite the seemingly bad news for shareholders, a patient investor at the beginning of 2008 would still have seen their income increase by about 9% a year since then - despite 2 years of stagnation. Even great companies can run into short-term problems, how they emerge is sometimes more important than how they got into the situation.From a historical standpoint everything appears solid - despite the recession blues. But alas one cannot prudently make investment decisions by always looking through the rearview mirror. Thus it's paramount to also consider the company's prospects moving forward. One way to accomplish this is by viewing the Estimated Earnings and Return Calculator provided by F.A.S.T. Graphs™.Here we see that Johnson Controls is presently trading at a blended P/E ratio of about 16, with a 1.9% dividend yield. More importantly, notice that analysts are projecting much higher EPS in the next couple of years along with a longer-term growth rate of almost 15%. If the estimates materialize as forecast - and Johnson Controls trades at a 15 P/E multiple in the future - this would represent a roughly 16% annualized 5-year total return estimate including dividends.When other sources are considered these estimates appear more than reasonable. However, this is certainly not to suggest that this is an absolute - the above is simply a calculator based on analysts' consensus estimates. The company could experience more hardship in the future and continue to be subject to the whims of the cyclical automotive market. More than that, any one of the company's 16 ""general"" risks and 17 ""specific"" risks listed in the firm's 10-K could materialize. For that matter, a risk outside of the 33 mentioned could formulate. It's important to remember that there is always risk involved in owning an equity investment.Taken collectively, we have found that Johnson Controls has been a remarkably consistent company with a nice story spanning back to the 1800's. It is true that the most recent recession caused Johnson Controls to temporarily stumble, but it appears the company has gotten its feet back under itself.

Johnson Controls (NYSE:JCI) shares, however, are down about 3 percent year-to-date. Stocks failing to participate in the market indexes' record run are worth looking into to see whether they provide an investment opportunity over the long-term horizon.JCI indicated earlier in 2014 that it had been having mixed results as it relates to top line revenue growth, even though the company had shown operational improvements across all of its businesses. In addition, in the company's commercial buildings segment, JCI has indicated it has been struggling because the overall market has been struggling. In particular, the most significant challenge that JCI has been having is within the federal government business. Given such circumstances, JCI's earnings growth is below that of its competitors, and, as such, the market is assigning a price-to-earnings multiple to JCI that is lower than the price-to-earnings ratio assigned to its competitors.BackgroundJCI is a company that is composed of three divisions. JCI's largest business division is its automotive division, which currently includes an interiors group, as well as seats, doors, and instrumentation panels. This division accounted for 51% of its 2013 revenue of $42.7 billion and 43% of its $3 billion in pretax income. The second-largest division of JCI is its building efficiencies division, which manufactures and services the infrastructure for forced-air heating and cooling in office buildings. This division accounts for 34% of 2013 revenue and 32% of pretax income. The third power solutions division manufactures batteries, including standard lead car batteries and energy-efficient stop/start systems. The power solutions unit accounts for 15% of revenue and 33% of income. JCI management indicates that each division will account for essentially a third of overall revenues in the next few years.Divestitures and AcquisitionsOver the last few years, JCI has worked to exit its low-margin industrial businesses and move towards faster-growing markets or sub-markets and away from more capital-intensive and less-profitable markets. JCI sold its low-margin auto-electronics unit to Visteon (NASDAQ:VC) in 2013, and its low-margin HomeLink garage-door opening business to Gentex (NASDAQ:GNTX) also in 2013. JCI then purchased a higher-margin company named Air Distribution Technologies in 2014, which makes heating and cooling and security systems for residential and commercial buildings. By selling off its auto-electronics unit and its garage-door-opening business and buying a company that makes heating and cooling and security systems for residential and commercial buildings, JCI exited two relatively small, capital-intensive businesses to enter a business that has margins nearly double its overall net margin. Through such actions, JCI is working towards managing its capital more efficiently and increase its earnings.More recently in May 2014, JCI announced its plan to spin off its low-margin, slow-growth auto interiors business into a joint venture with a division of the Chinese company SAIC. JCI will own 30 percent of the joint venture and receive an annual dividend as well. This spin-off into the joint venture changes the profile of JCI's interiors business from being a disadvantaged business that was in low-growth regions with a high cost base to a global company, whereby the spun-off joint venture has access to low-cost tooling, manufacturing equipment, and low-cost engineering skilled workers.Earnings AnnouncementLast week, JCI reported adjusted earnings of 84 cents per share in third-quarter fiscal 2014. Such earnings represented a 16.7% increase over 72 cents in earnings in the comparable quarter for 2013. The financial results for 2013 were revised, as JCI has classified the automotive electronics business as a discontinued operation. This past quarter's results, including restructuring and non-recurring items, show JCI's net income as $238 million, or 35 cents per share. JCI's earnings guidance for its 2014 fourth quarter is in the range of $1.00-$1.02, an 11 percent increase from the earnings recorded in the fourth quarter of 2013.JCI reaffirmed free cash flow guidance of about $1.6 billion. The indicated cash flow will provide opportunities for JCI's future capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, share repurchases and dividend payouts. Finally, margins are expected to improve across all operating divisions in fiscal 2014. In regard to the current overall business environment for JCI's 3 business divisions, the CEO indicated:JCI shares initially sold off sharply on the earnings release, and have trended downward slightly since the announcement of its earnings. With JCI's share price sinking in the days after the earnings announcement, the market is failing to appreciate the divestitures and acquisitions JCI has been making recently to exit low-margin businesses and to enter higher-margin businesses. In addition, JCI's transformation will serve to take advantage of future trends, such as the energy cost controls in office towers and energy-efficient battery technology.Analysts' Views and Our ViewsSome analysts believe that investors are failing to appreciate the divestitures and acquisitions JCI has been making recently to exit low-margin businesses and enter higher-margin businesses. Further, such analysts believe that JCI's slow but steady transformation will capitalize on future trends, such as the energy-efficiency concerns of office tower owners and energy-efficient battery technology.Analysts expect JCI to earn $2.5 billion in fiscal year 2015, which is $3.73 a share on revenue of $44.4 billion. Such 2015 expectations would be up from 2014 estimates of $3.14 per share on $43 billion in revenue. JCI's current price-to-earnings ratio based on fiscal year 2015 earnings is 13.4. As JCI's margins increase, analysts believe that its forward price-to-earnings ratio should rise to a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 15. A price-to-earnings ratio of 15 is more in line with the price-to-earnings ratios of JCI's competitors, Emerson Electric (NYSE:EMR), Honeywell (NYSE:HON) and United Technologies (NYSE:UTX). Analysts believe that JCI could reach a share price between $60 and $65 in about 18 to 24 months from now, given JCI's recent transformative actions. In addition, JCI has been increasing its dividend on an annual basis and engaging a substantial share buyback.We tend to agree with analysts and their intermediate-term outlook for JCI. Management of JCI is working to transform JCI by exiting low-margin businesses and acquiring higher-margin businesses. This transformation is ongoing, and the results will become more appreciated by Wall Street and individual investors in the next 18 to 24 months. That said, with most stock market indexes at or near record highs, an individual investor might want to wait for JCI to drop to a share price between 42.50 and 47.50 to establish a full position. Over the long term, JCI will reward investors with increasing dividends, substantial share repurchases and a rising share price.Disclosure: The author is long JCI, HON, EMR.

2126933,56732,2014-04-04T17:07:05-04:00,"Johnson Controls has divested an entire segment, Automotive Electronics, in parts to Gentex Corp. and Visteon (VC) for aggregate proceeds of over $965 million.The company recently sold off its headliners and sun visors unit to Atlas Holdings, a private equity firm in Greenwich.To further its battery business, Johnson Controls recently signed a collaborative agreement with Europe's largest organization for applied research, Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft.Revenue from China is expected to grow at a CAGR of approximately 12% from 2013 to 2018.","Johnson Controls Inc. (NYSE:JCI) is a highly diversified technology and industrial leader operating through three functional segments: power solutions, building efficiency and automotive experience. The company serves customers in 150 countries around the globe.The following discussion throws light on the reorganization efforts on the part of the company to shift its focus toward more profitable businesses and exit the ones with low margins. Let us see if Johnson Controls comes off as a good investment opportunity or not.Revenue DriversDividing the company's revenues into its various geographical segments, it is apparent that developed economies like the US and Europe are the largest contributors to the top line of the company. However, over the past three years, revenues from the US have increased, while Europe's contribution has declined. A plausible reason for the decline in Europe's chunk of net sales is the declining automotive and construction industries in the region.Source: Annual Report, 2013Now, let's take a look at the breakdown of the company's revenues, based on its reported functional segments. More than half of the revenues of the company are attributed to its automotive experience segment that provides seating, interiors and integrated electronics to car manufacturers. However, the segment's net profit margin hovers around low single-digits. The profit margins of building efficiency are found in the same range. The power solutions segment presently contributes just 16% to the net sales of the company, but is actually the most profitable segment, with NPM trailing around 17%.Source: First Quarter Earnings ReleaseShifting Focus to High-Margin SegmentsJohnson Controls is reportedly shifting its focus to the high-margin segments, as opposed to holding on to its low-margin segments. The company has already divested an entire segment, automotive electronics, in parts to Gentex Corp. (NASDAQ:GNTX) and Visteon Corporation (NASDAQ:VC) for aggregate proceeds of over $965 million.Moreover, the company has recently sold off its headliners and sun visors unit to Atlas Holdings, a private equity firm in Greenwich. Automotive interiors is a very low-margin unit (around 1%). The company believes that selling this unit will improve the margins of its automotive experience business. The remaining parts of the business are expected to be divested in the coming months.More likely than not, proceeds of these divestitures will be invested in the company's high-margin businesses, such as power solutions, that manufactures and markets lead-acid automotive batteries for every type of passenger car, light truck and utility vehicle.To further its battery business, Johnson Controls recently signed a collaborative agreement with Europe's largest organization for applied research, Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft. The aim behind the agreement is to come up with a more energy-efficient and cost-effective cooling system for vehicle batteries. Reportedly, scientists at Johnson Controls will be working in close collaboration with Fraunhofer's Institute for Environmental, Safety and Energy Technology (UMSICHT) and Institute for Manufacturing Technology and Advanced Materials. The successful completion of the project, which is quite likely, will enable the company to meet stricter environmental laws enacted by the European economy. Note that Johnson Controls has historically demonstrated its ability to come up with innovative ways to reduce fuel consumption and make vehicles more cost-effective for consumers. As announced by the company, the technology is expected to be introduced in Europe first, and shortly after to the US, with global adoption expected to come around 2020.Other Growth AreasWe are all aware that China offers great potential for companies seeking to expand their operations. The Chinese automotive industry is rapidly developing, which makes China a very critical market for Johnson Controls, whose profits are being compromised due to a declining (rather than stabilizing) automotive industry in Europe and increasing competition in developed economies. China alone contributed 33% to total segment sales of $5.8 billion. Overall, revenue from China is expected to grow at a CAGR of approximately 12% from 2013 to 2018.North America is the second-most crucial market for the company. Throughout the recently ended quarter, the region boosted its automotive experience segment's sales by 11%, compared to the industry's production increase of just 5%. Overall, the automotive experience segment's revenue grew by 130% YoY.Construction EfficiencyThe housing industry has remained weak in the US over the past year due to a weakened economy, among other factors. Nonetheless, Johnson Controls experienced an 11% growth in its residential and commercial business sales. Segregating the revenue further indicates that North America contributed 30% to the segment's sales, and made up 51% of the segment's total income. Going forward, the company's management has presented optimistic, though conservative, guidelines regarding heating, ventilation and air conditioning in North America.The company is doing further research, and has recently announced its York Smart Thermostat that can be controlled through Wi-Fi. The company possesses a demonstrated capability to incorporate ease and efficiency into its products.Shareholder ProfitsJohnson's dividends are increasing, while another $3 billion have been added to the company's share repurchase program in November 2013. Presently, the total authorized amount allocated to the share repurchase program has reached $3.65 billion. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2014, the company repurchased approximately $1.2 billion of shares, including $800 million as part of an accelerated share repurchase agreement under these authorizations. In addition to that, dividends paid by the company have increased at a CAGR of 14% over the past five years, as evident by the graph below.Source: Company PresentationConclusionThe company is divesting its less profitable segments and investing in high-margin markets to grow its cash flow generation. Divestment of the said segments will enable the company to improve its margins, grow its top line and improve its ROI. Furthermore, Johnson's growing dividends and share repurchase program promise reasonable returns to its shareholders. The company looks like a good investment for the long run, in my opinion.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1977421,56962,2014-01-29T14:36:00-05:00,,"Johnson Controls (NYSE:JCI) reported a good start to its fiscal year as far as overall financial results are concerned. The company is involved in manufacturing batteries and car interiors along with ventilation, heating and cooling systems for constructions. According to the Q1 fiscal 2014 earnings release the company reported a 31% rise in net profit mainly driven by sales growth in China. In absolute terms the company's net profit was 69 cents per share in Q1 fiscal year 2014 reflecting a rise from 52 cents per share as reported during Q1 fiscal year 2013. A 5% increase in revenue to $10.91 billion was also recorded compared to analysts' expectations of $10.73 billion.However, the company's share price was down 4% after the results were released. The reason behind this was that investors were expecting more from the company, especially from the company's batteries business. Investors were looking for more growth during the harsh winters that hit the US this fall. The growth in sales of cold-induced batteries was evident in the US but the warmer weather in Europe prevented the product from showing attractive growth as a whole. Therefore I will explore further whether or not this underperformance of the company's battery business will continue into the future or if the company will recover.Few analysts regarded the fall as a point of entry for potential investors as they are optimistic about the company's growth prospects. Hence, my article will also discover what has allowed the company to outperform in the recently reported quarter and if this growth is sustainable. So, on the basis of ascertaining sustainability I will conclude whether or not the drop in share price is a good entry point for buyers to take part in the company's future growth and earnings.To start, I will discuss the growth drivers for the company that allowed it to achieve its current results. I will also identify the weak performing areas of the company.Strong Vs. Weak DriversThe company operates through its three operating segments: building efficiency, automotive experience and power solutions. Statistics regarding the revenue performance of these segments are shown in the table below.Source: JCI 10K Report and Earnings ReleaseFrom the chart above you can see that the automotive experience segment generated more than 50% of the company's total revenue. Both the automotive and power solutions segments are increasing their contribution to the company's revenue. Building efficiency contributed 35.1% to the company's total revenue in 2012 but the proportion declined to 30.9% as reported in Q1 2014. So, my main focus will be upon the future outlook of the automotive experience and building efficiency segments of the company.In terms of revenue growth, the automotive experience was once again the leader logging 11.5% growth compared to the previous year. On the other hand, building efficiency recorded a 2.9% decline in its revenue in 1Q2014 compared to 1Q2013. I have prepared the following two tables to show the details of the weak performing areas within the segments.Source: JCI 10K Report and Earnings ReleaseThe table above shows that the global workplace solutions has been the major contributor to the company's revenue for the past two years and has recorded a 5% decline in its revenue growth in 1Q2014 compared to results from 1Q2012. The segment's revenue from Asia improved due to growth in construction activities in China and India. Since the North American economy is on its way to recovery the company only recorded a flat revenue growth from the area.With regards to the most crucial segment, the following table showcases where major growth was derived.Source: JCI 10K Report and Earnings ReleaseDuring Q1 of fiscal year 2014, all of the areas within the segment performed well while seating contributed around 75% to the segment's overall revenue in fiscal years 2012 and 2013. I will discuss the reasons behind the growth in this segment under the heading of sustainability below.For now let us have a brief look at the income generated by these segments.Source: JCI 10K Report and Earnings ReleaseFrom the table above you can see that the income from building efficiency has declined by 15.1% in the recently reported quarter compared to results from the corresponding quarter of the previous year. On the other hand, the automotive experience segment recorded an impressive 3 digit growth of 129.7% compared to Q1 2012. Power solutions registered a growth of 11.6% in its net income but has been regarded as a weak performer by investors as stated in the opening paragraphs of my article. The company has been taking cost-saving initiatives and strategic moves in order to improve its bottom-line performance.So, by now we have garnered enough information regarding the drivers of the company's current performance improvement as well as its weak areas. Sustainability of growth from strong areas along with recovery in weak areas will determine the outlook for the company's future performance and position. Global Car and Truck ProductionThe outlook of this industry is relevant to the company's automotive experience segment as well as its power solutions segment. In the most-recently reported quarter the company recorded a 12% increase in sales of batteries that auto manufacturers put in new cars on the assembly line.Global production of cars and commercial vehicles rose by 5.1% in 2012 compared to the previous year. China's auto manufacturing industry recorded a growth of 23.7% in its gross profit from January 2013 to November 2013. The industry logged a 17.8% rise in its core business revenue on a year-on-year basis from January 2013 to November 2013. China is the world's largest manufacturer of cars and has been a major revenue driver for Johnson Control's revenue from this industry over the past year. One out of every four cars produced in the world comes from China.The UK also contributed to the growth of this sector on a global basis as well as to Johnson Controls as new car sales in the country rose by around 10.5% in 2013. This was the highest absolute figure of sales since 2007. The economic recovery is boosting consumer income so private car buyers in the UK drove the 15% surge in new car sales. Economic recovery is still forecasted to bring in growth for the industry in 2014.Overall, the global automotive industry is forecasted to grow at a rate of 5.5% from 2010 to 2015 finally reaching a net worth of $5.1 trillion in 2015. Therefore sustainability in the company's growth in this industry in the coming years is evident. The company's battery business will also grow due to the growth in the industry and investors have underestimated the company's future growth prospects from this business.The surge in activities in the construction industry is likely to bring recovery and growth for the company's building efficiency segment.Building ConstructionConstruction activities are regarded as a sign of economic activity around the globe. The global economies are predicted to recover from the recession in the coming years so the construction industry will receive a boost as new projects begin. The improvement in the industry can be seen as beneficial to the company as it has recorded a 5% increase in the commercial backlog of orders for this segment in the most-recently reported quarter.According to MarketLine, the global construction and engineering industry is forecasted to record a handsome growth of 30% from 2010-2015 and will reach a net worth of $3 trillion by 2015. By 2025, the industry is projected to reach a net worth of $15 trillion. China and India will be the drivers of global growth in construction activities. The volume of construction is forecasted to grow by 70% over the next 12 years. China, the world's second largest economy, represented 18% of the overall global construction in 2012 and the construction market in the country is expected to increase by 8.5% in 2014. The overall output from China, India and the United States, the top three global building markets, was worth US$8.7 trillion in 2012 and will grow to US$15 trillion by 2025.The Year Ahead and My TakeJCI forecasts its fiscal Q2 earnings to be 64 to 66 cents per share while Thomson Reuters' I/B/E/S poll of analysts indicates a potential 67 cents/share. According to my analysis, weak areas as identified by investors that triggered a sell-off after the earnings release will recover in the near future. As a result the company will not only register recovery in the feeble areas but will also see improvements in its stronger areas. The company's future outlook seems bright as per current industry forecasts and investors can jump in to take their share from the company's upcoming growth.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: The article has been written by a Blackstone Equity Research research analyst.

But Intelligent Investors know that value is related to the fundamentals of the company, not what it is trading at, and Benjamin Graham taught that we must base our analysis on the fundamentals of the company in an attempt to gauge the risk level of the company and determine an estimate of the intrinsic value of the company. This is best done by utilizing a systematic approach to analysis that will provide investors with a sense of how a specific company compares to another company. By using the ModernGraham method one can review a company's historical accomplishments and determine an intrinsic value that can be compared across industries. What follows is a specific look at how Johnson Controls Inc. (NYSE:JCI) fares in the ModernGraham valuation model.JCI data by YChartsDefensive Investor - must pass at least 6 of the following 7 tests: Score = 2/7Enterprising Investor - must pass at least 4 of the following 5 tests or be suitable for a defensive investor: Score = 3/5Valuation SummaryKey Data:Balance Sheet - 12/31/2013Earnings Per ShareEarnings Per Share - ModernGrahamDividend HistoryJCI Dividend data by YChartsConclusion:Johnson Controls Inc. is not suitable for either the Defensive Investor or the Enterprising Investor. The Defensive Investor is not interested because the company has a poor current ratio, has not had sufficient earnings stability or growth over the ten year period and is trading at high PEmg and PB ratios. The Enterprising Investor is turned off by the high level of debt relative to the company's current assets. As a result, value investors seeking to follow the ModernGraham approach based on Benjamin Graham's methods should research other opportunities, such as through a review of ModernGraham Stocks & Screens. From solely a valuation perspective, the company does have some attractive qualities. EPSmg (normalized earnings) have grown from $1.00 in 2009 to an estimated $2.32 for 2014, which is a strong level of growth that outpaces the market's implied growth estimate of 6.51%. The ModernGraham valuation model does return an estimate of intrinsic value that is above the market's current price, so it appears the company may be undervalued.The next part of the analysis is up to individual investors, and requires discussion of the company's prospects.

(NYSE:JCI) made $43 billion in revenues in FY2013 through its five market leading businesses: building efficiency and global workspace solutions, automotive seating, automated interiors, and power solutions.JCI Rewarding its ShareholdersJCI has adequately rewarded its shareholders over the last 10 years and continues to do so by offering the best optimization services to clients. A comparison with its peers including UTC, Danaher (NYSE:DHR), Emerson (NYSE:EMR), Eaton (ETC), Ingersoll-Rand (NYSE:IR), 3M (NYSE:MMM), Honeywell (NYSE:HON) and ITW (NYSE:ITW) also reflects JCI's strong performance and high returns to stakeholders. Revenue has grown by a CAGR of 7.3% in the past 10 years while its peer group has exhibited a CAGR of 5.8%. Similarly the returns to shareholders were as high as 15.1% for JCI while its peers have returned 14.1% to their shareholders as illustrated in the figure below.China Continues to be a Strong Market for JCIThe Chinese market presents vast opportunities for the company. This region has contributed well in the past years and is expected to be a major contributor in the upcoming years. In 2013 a major chunk of revenues was contributed by the Chinese market, $7.2 billion, and this number is expected to rise to about $12.5 billion in 2018.Outlook for 2014The automotive and commercial building markets in Europe have seen a slowdown that is expected to continue in the upcoming year. However building efficiency markets in other regions like North America have shown signs of improvement as we observe increasing orders Q-o-Q. The battery segment will also exhibit slow improvement in the near term.JCI/Hitachi (OTC:HMTLF) HVAC Joint Venture to Bring SynergiesBoth companies manufacture HVAC technologies for commercial and residential usage including the Variable Refrigerant Flow (VRF) that is exhibiting a remarkable demand growth. The joint venture would enhance the manufacturing capabilities of the two companies and also develop JCI's distribution channels and this will considerably grow sales.Market Leader in Automotive SeatingJCI provides the best in class automotive seating ""completed product"" as well as ""seating components"". The clear dominance of JCI is shown through the different segments' market shares in the figure above. It maintains a 28% market share in the complete seats segment and will continue to benefit as the market grows. Despite the slowdown in Europe, the progression in the Chinese and North American market will continue the growing trend in this segment.Maintain a Balanced Capital Allocation to Increase Cash FlowsThe company intends to significantly increase its cash flows over the next three years. This will be driven by higher returns to shareholders, divesting JCI's less attractive ventures and mergers, and acquisition activity that will augment cash flows.The company has consistently increased its dividend over the years in line with its earnings growth. The more recent 16% increase in dividends to $0.22 per share from the previous $0.19 per share has further boosted the confidence of shareholders. The company has shown good commitment to its shareholders and promises high value for its stakeholders in the foreseeable future.Share Repurchase ProgramThe company has recently announced that it will repurchase an additional $3 billion bringing the total to $3.65 billion. Repurchases of $1.2 billion have already been completed in Q1 2014 and another $2.4 billion is expected to be completed in 2015 and 2016. This will somewhat offset the dilution due to the previous divestures of the company and expected divestures in the coming period.Expectations from Fiscal Year 2014The revenue is expected to go up by 3% to $43.8 billion in FY2014 and will be instigated by higher vehicle production in North America and China. Increasing growth will be observed in all the segments within the emerging markets. Income is expected to rise by ~15% (EPS between ~$3.15-$3.30) due to cost savings and restructuring initiatives. Capital expenditure would be focused on new automotive ventures and capacity expansions in the emerging markets especially in advanced batteries within the power solutions segment. Automotive seating also presents alluring growth prospects for the company.Building Efficiency Outlook for 2014Sales are expected to rise by 1% - 3% due to the North American market's recovery and strong emerging market growth. Margins are expected to grow from 7% to 7.2% due to structural changes and improvement in the operating model. The company is on track to achieve its 2018 targets of organic sales growth of 5% - 6% and margins of 10%.Automotive Outlook for 2014Sales are expected to rise by 1% - 2% due to growth in the North American market and continued growth in the emerging market. Margins are expected to grow from 4% to 4.2% in this segment driven by higher margins in the seating segment from 4.8% to 5%, the interiors segment's margins will increase from 1% - 2% and the electronics segment's margins will increase from 5.9% - 6% due to operational enhancements. In the mid-term the company expects that the automotive seating segment would attain annual increases of 40 to 50 bps and reach a margin of 7% by 2018.Power Solutions Outlook for 2014Sales are expected to rise by 7% - 8% due to higher market share driven by higher production in AGM batteries. Volumes would grow in all regions, particularly in China. Margins are expected to grow from 16% to 16.2% due to synergies through economies of scale and operational improvements through vertical integration and manufacturing efficiencies. In the mid-term the company expects the sales to grow by 8% - 9% by 2018 due to increasing market shares and advanced battery technology. Margins are expected to rise by 100 to 150 bps due to an improvement in the company's product mix.Electronics DivestureThe company plans to divest its electronics business in 2014. The interiors segment is a low margin segment and requires intensive capital investment. JCI currently earns $4.2 billion of revenues from its automotive interiors segment and is gradually shifting its focus away from this less lucrative segment.JCI Still Has a Positive Future on Despite Slowdown in EuropeJCI will see continued growth driven by high potential in China and an increase in the sales of its automotive and building efficiency segments. The company will continue penetrating deeper into the emerging markets and enhance its market share especially in the advanced batteries segment.Synergies for the joint venture with Hitachi is also proving to be beneficial and provides JCI them with a competitive edge over its peers. Although THE European market is expected to show slow progress in the near term the recovery of the North American and the Asian markets will drive JCI to higher profitability.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: The article has been written by a Blackstone Equity Research research analyst.

2843566,67985,2015-01-23T01:12:18-05:00,The company announced earnings that exceeded expectations as the company’s strategic and financial plans are leading to better performance and higher operating margins.Management continues to focus on transforming the company to increase profitability in the intermediate and long term.The company expects divestiture of low-margin businesses and acquiring of higher-margin businesses to increase profitability in 2015 and beyond.The company rewards investors with increasing dividends and substantial share repurchases.We did not anticipate the company beating earnings estimates but recognized the company’s efforts to increase profit by focusing on higher-margin businesses.,"In January 2015, Johnson Controls (NYSE:JCI) announced their fiscal first-quarter 2015 adjusted earnings of 79 cents, an increase of 20 percent from the year-ago quarter. The company recorded quarterly revenue that increased 1 percent from the year-ago quarter to $10.67 billion. The company's automotive experience division reported revenue that decreased 3 percent from the year-ago quarter to $5.3 billion and adjusted income that increased 26 percent to $249 million. The company's power solutions division reported revenue that increased 4 percent from the year-ago quarter to $1.84 billion, and adjusted income that increased 4 percent to $318 million. The company's building efficiency division reported revenues that increased 5 percent to $3.5 billion and adjusted income that increased 38 percent to $201 million (including the company's acquisition of Air Distribution Technologies in the third quarter of 2014). In addition, the day before JCI announced earnings, they signed an agreement with Hitachi, Ltd. and Hitachi Appliances, Inc. to form a global joint venture that will produce the variable refrigerant flow technology, room air conditioners and absorption chillers to satisfy demand for energy-efficient air conditioners. JCI expects fiscal year 2015 results to better fiscal 2014 results given higher profitability in all three of their businesses due to the company's strategic and financial plans leading to better performance and higher operating margins. The company's shares surged upward almost 5 percent on the earnings announcement.In our previous article, we indicated that JCI is in the midst of divesting lower-margin businesses and acquiring higher-margin businesses that will increase profitability in the intermediate term. We indicated further that the company was moving towards faster-growing markets or sub-markets and away from more capital-intensive and less-profitable markets. We noted specifically that the company's selling off of their auto-electronics unit, and their garage-door-opening business and buying a company that makes heating and cooling and security systems for residential and commercial buildings. We noted further that in mid-2014 JCI had announced its plan to spin off its low-margin, slow-growth auto interiors business into a joint venture with a division of the Chinese company SAIC.JCI continues to transform by exiting low-margin businesses and acquiring higher-margin businesses. Such transformation is ongoing, and the results will become more appreciated by investors in the intermediate term. We continue to believe that many investors fail to appreciate the divestitures and acquisitions JCI has been making recently to exit low-margin businesses and enter higher-margin businesses. Further, the company's transformation will capitalize on future trends, such as the energy-efficiency concerns of office tower owners and energy-efficient battery technology. JCI's present price to earnings ratio is about 26.70. Earnings estimates for JCI are $3.60 for their current fiscal year 2015 and $4.11 for their fiscal year 2016. JCI's shares are trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of about 13.30 based on fiscal year 2015 earnings estimates and 11.70 based on fiscal year 2016 earnings estimates. As JCI's margins increase, the company's forward price-to-earnings ratio should rise to a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 15, which is more in line with the price-to-earnings ratios of JCI's competitors. We consider the shares a buy for long-term investors. Be aware, however, that during the last strong overall market decline in late 2014, JCI's shares broke through the $40 level, and a similar decline could occur again under weak overall market conditions. In the long term, JCI will reward investors with increasing dividends, substantial share repurchases and a rising share price."
1916301,25120,2013-12-26T03:19:20-05:00,,"Investors in Johnson Controls (NYSE:JCI) are hardly reacting to the company's outlined guidance for next year, and the strategic plans for the years ahead.The company sees strong earnings growth, driven by margin expansion which on its turn is the result of the shift of focus away from the automotive sector to the power systems and building efficiency business. This should boost earnings growth and valuation multiples for the company going forward.2014 GuidanceLast week, Johnson Controls released its outlook for 2014. Revenues for next year are expected to increase by some 3% to $43.8 billion, in line with consensus estimates of $43.87 billion.The company does forecast strong income improvements with segment income seen up around 15% on the year before. This should translate in earnings seen between $3.15 and $3.30 per share. Analysts were projecting next year's earnings of $3.31 per share.The company sees earnings growth in all segments which includes automotive experience, building efficiency and power solutions. The company aims to rebalance the portfolio to reduce the dependency on the auto sector, benefiting from higher valuations being awarded to other industries.As a result, the company expects to remain active in terms of acquisitions and divestitures to mange the portfolio of businesses.Mid-Term Outlook Till 2018On top of next year's guidance, management gave a look into the expectations for the coming five years.Automotive experience revenues are seen flat, excluding the non-consolidated joint ventures in China for the time period. Margins are expected to increase by 40-50 basis points to 7% of total revenues on the back of integration and cost improvements.Power solutions revenues are seen up 8 to 9% on market share gains, growth in China and a better product mix. This strong sales growth should be accompanied by expanding margins to the tune of 100-150 basis points.Growth in the building efficiency business is seen between 5 and 6% on growth and market share gains. Margins are seen peaking at 10% on volumes, price initiatives and supply chain gains.ValuationAt the end of October, Johnson Controls released its fourth quarter results for the fiscal year of 2013.The company ended the year with $1.05 billion in cash and equivalents. Total debt stands at $4.57 billion, resulting in a net debt position of $3.52 billion.Annual revenues for 2013 came in at $42.73 billion, up 1.8% on the year before. Reported GAAP earnings were virtually unchanged at $1.18 billion.Trading around $51 per share, the market values Johnson Controls at $34.5 billion. This values equity in the firm at 0.8 times annual revenues and 29 times GAAP earnings.The quarterly dividend of $0.22 per share provides investors with an annual dividend yield of 1.7%.Some Historical PerspectiveLong term holders in Johnson Controls have seen excellent returns. Shares doubled between 2004 and 2007 to $40 per share. Shares saw quite a correction to $10 in 2009. Over the past year, shares have doubled from $25 at the end of 2012 to current all-time highs in the low fifties.Between 2010 and 2013, the firm increased its annual revenues by a cumulative 25% to $42.7billion. Reported GAAP earnings fell by 10% at the same time to $1.18 billion.Investment ThesisJohnson Controls continues its aspirations to transform the diversified business into faster growing, and more profitable industries, thereby boosting the valuation of the entire company. Some crucial parts of this is the Johnson Controls Operating System, aligning processes within the entire company.Sales growth partially comes from exposure to fast growing markets, but notably from China as well. The firm generates nearly a fifth of sales from China last year, a significant portion giving the company great exposure to growth. Growth is already witnessed in the fourth quarter results of 2013, when sales rose by 6% to little over $11 billion. At the same time, net income rose by 25% to $657 million, coming in at $0.95 per share.Yet not all is good, as Johnson Controls continues to suffer from the volatility of the automotive sector which is now enjoying relative good times. For this reason alone, now seems the right timing to initiate portfolio rebalancing initiatives, notably in divestitures in the area.Based on next year's projected earnings, Johnson Controls trades at 16 times earnings which seems fair given the projected margin expansion and revenue growth in the coming years ahead. Crucial to notice is the increased important of the power sales business and building efficiency, while the company aims to reduce the dependency on the automotive business.Note that the power business reports margins of around 20% in the fourth quarter of 2013, while building efficiency margins are targeted at 10% for next year. This compares to margins of around 4% for the automotive business in the fourth quarter, which reports the smallest earnings of each of the three units. This is despite making up roughly half of total revenues.Therefore the turnaround and strategic plan of the company is so important. A crucial example of these underperforming businesses is the interior business within automotive business, reporting a $13 million loss on $4.2 billion in sales. The company is exploring strategic options for the unit after selling the electronics business to Gentex (NASDAQ:GNTX) in a $700 million deal earlier this year.Despite the move away from the automotive business, Johnson will continue to operate within the industry, still being a core part of the business.Investors applaud these value-creating moves, which are accompanied by greater shareholder payouts. The company recently hiked its quarterly dividend by nearly 16% to $0.22 per share, providing investors with a 1.7% dividend yield. On top of this came a new $3 billion share repurchase authorization, allowing the company to repurchase about 9% of its shares outstanding at current levels.As such, it is notably margin expansions as well as organic revenue growth potential which should boost the value of the business. While this year's momentum has been strong, it is supported by the strong guidance and underlying performance. I applaud management decisions and remain optimistic about the firm's long term prospects given the development as outlined above.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1893051,23822,2013-12-11T16:37:28-05:00,,"(Editors' Note: This article covers a stock trading at less than $1 per share and/or has less than a $100 million market cap. Please be aware of the risks associated with these stocks.)Some of the hottest companies this year for investors are well known - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). They're very different but from one perspective both could be considered electronics companies. Whether it's phones, computers, or cars, the products these stocks produce are all electric.So if Tesla and Apple can do it, which other companies can ride the wave of electronic innovation alongside these all-stars? What is one component that is found in each of them? Well, the lithium ion battery, of course.The markets have been buzzing about lithium ion for a while but for one reason or another, the excitement tends to die down, much like the actual battery in my smartphone. But perhaps when excitement is running on empty is the best time to start considering entering the market.Lithium ore prices have been on a rise since the mid-2000s, which encourages miners to produce even more.Miners like Chemical & Mining Co. of Chile (NYSE:SQM), FMC Corp. (NYSE:FMC), and Rockwood Holdings (NYSE:ROC) have seen mixed results this year, but investors may find it more worthwhile to examine another aspect of the lithium supply chain: battery producers.Even though lithium ore prices are rising, battery producers all agree that the cost per kilowatt is sure to fall. Manufacturers are getting better at building batteries and they're passing savings down to consumers. That means in a short amount of time, lithium ion batteries will become an affordable option for consumers of all types.Investing could be a fairly simple concept if you simply pick the leading company of an industry and let your money ride. But that's not necessarily the most prudent strategy, so let's compare the industry leader with some lesser known competitors.If we look at the leader in terms of market capitalization then Johnson Controls Inc. (NYSE:JCI) would be the one. The company recently announced a $3 billion repurchase of shares, which certainly made investors happy.Even better, Johnson Controls is getting more profitable. For the fourth quarter of 2013, the company reported a record level of net income with year-over-year growth at about 25%.(Click for interactive chart. Data sourced from Zacks.)Comparing JCI's strong sales growth (2.30%) with its price makes the company a particularly attractive stock going forward. JCI is well established with operations in various industries, such as producing and marketing HVAC systems, energy management consulting, and producing and marketing interior parts for cars and vans, as a few.Its range of products simply allows JCI to be prudent about the expected growth in use of lithium ion batteries. Once batteries become even more affordable and widely adopted, a company like Johnson Controls could be best situated to quickly turn a profit.Looking at the CompetitorsBy no means is Johnson Controls the only company in the lithium ion battery scene. Although it's a leader and well established, its price point and relative volatility could be a concern for some investors. Depending on outlook and goals, investors could also be more willing to take positions on companies more focused solely on lithium ion technologies, but is their small size in comparison to Johnson Controls a worrisome sign for potential investors?Ultralife Corp. (NASDAQ:ULBI) and China BAK Battery, Inc. (NASDAQ:CBAK-OLD) are two interesting players in the lithium ion landscape. Each has its merits and also areas of concerns - especially considering their noticeably small share of the market.Take Ultralife Corp. for example, a $62.15 million industrial electrical equipment supplier. In its most recent conference call the company's CEO Mike Popielec highlighted the ability to achieve profitability in the third quarter in its battery and energy segment. But Ultralife's B&E revenues were down substantially since Q3 2012 and its gross margins have come down as well. This is largely due to the company's focus on military contracts for its battery and energy products, although it is looking to diversify its customer base.(Click for interactive chart. Data sourced from Zacks.)With military-grade batteries, the company is looking to expand into the medical devices industry, which could give it a substantial amount of sales growth with minimal product development. This synergy between what ULBI currently does and what it will do in the future could be a positive sign for investors, and could lead to greater market share, especially with strong growth in its newly developed battery products.However, with another potential government budget crisis looming as early as March 2014 (when the Treasury expects the debt ceiling to be reached again), Ultralife's dependence on government contracts could put it in a bind. Whether Congress squabbles all the way to the final hour or matures and deals with the budget as it should, defense spending towards products that Ultralife provides could be cut, which presents a fair share of risk heading into next year.Meanwhile, China BAK Battery could be showing even more significant areas of worry for investors. Its current ratio is around 0.50, which could prevent the company from capturing the gains in the growing lithium ion market.And the company could have troubles meeting its obligations, which could further hurt its prospects in getting additional funding. The company has stated on its most recent quarterly report that there are ""doubts about [China BAK's] ability to continue as a going concern."" This is fairly alarming but even more so in the context of the same statement having appeared three quarters earlier on its annual report at the end of 2012.Based on its August 23 earnings release, the company lost $4.1 million more in 2013 than during the same period in 2012. This is certainly not a great trend for the company but investors should not forget that net revenues grew by 34.4%.China BAK Battery's high-powered battery cells were among the strongest growing revenue sources in terms of percentage, which also happens to be an area of high margin for the company. With strong revenue growth, the company seems to have established good sales but questions remain whether it will still be around long enough to turn a profit.ConclusionThe market for lithium ion batteries will only get stronger as the technology becomes more established and its use becomes more widespread. With industry analysts expecting costs per kilowatt to come down to a very marketable level, the adoption of the technology is likely to become mainstream.While a company like Johnson Controls has product lines ready to capture this growth, it is also diversified among other areas. Diversification, along with strong books, will allow the company to weather a storm but could prevent it from profiting as greatly from growth in lithium ion.Micro cap stocks like Ultralife Corp. look more focused on lithium ion battery technology than Johnson Controls, and competitors like China BAK Battery could be well positioned for increased use in lithium ion as individual product lines adapts to the technology.However, even with growing revenues and expansions into different markets for lithium ion technology, growing expenditures and uncertain sources of funding mean these companies could pose some serious risk for investors compared to established players like Johnson Controls.(Click for interactive chart. Data sourced from Zacks.)Note: Investing in micro cap stocks can be considered risky as many of these companies do not file financial reports with the SEC or relevant regulators, making publicly available information about their operations difficult to find. Many micro cap stocks are new to the market and lack a proven track record. And because many micro cap stocks trade in low volumes, trades large and small can have a greater impact on the stock price compared to investments with larger market share.

1906681,56612,2013-12-19T06:05:02-05:00,,"Johnson Controls (NYSE:JCI) is currently undertaking a review of its portfolio of businesses. A possible divestment or spin-off of all or part of its Automotive business should release value at the current price. Further action on margins and growth elsewhere should release even more upside in the coming years.Johnson Controls appointed a new CEO, Alex Molinaroli, in July. This change in management seems to have triggered a change in focus. Assisted by external consultants, the company is undertaking a thorough review of its portfolio of businesses with a particular focus on opportunities with Automotive.AutomotiveOn the most recent conference call management emphasized that it would be possible, in theory, to separate out the Seating and Interior businesses. Previous decisions in the space were motivated by the belief that customers were seeking to source complete interiors from one supplier. Customers appear to have moved in the opposite direction so management is looking at options for these businesses.The Electronics business within Automotive is already up for sale. The HomeLink portion was sold earlier this year, an announcement on the remainder is expected soon. Total proceeds are expected to be, at least, $900m.Management is actively looking for a buyer for Interiors, as announced on the Q4 conference call. This business is more troubled operating at low margins and needing more capital for further restructuring within a highly competitive industry. It is unlikely that this division will yield anything in a sale. Management appear to have choicesGiven management's recent comments it seems likely Seating is also being scrutinized. In 2011, Johnson made a series of upstream acquisitions (metals and other seating components) in this category to counter pricing pressure from OEMs. Problems at other manufacturers, Lear and Faurecia, also saw the business winning a lot of new businesses. Problems have appeared in the legacy metal plants in Europe which has depressed margins. Management clearly remains confident in turning this around setting margin guidance for Seating at 7-8% in 2017, from ~4.5% in 2013. The potential for growth is strong with the Chinese seating business registering 20% annual rates.The opportunity in Seating is not, therefore, about divesting a business with poor potential but benefiting from re-rating as lower margin and slower growth businesses are separated from higher margin and faster growth ones. As a result, a spin-off would be more likely than a sale.Building EfficiencyThe Building Efficiency division manufactures and distributes control systems and compressors for commercial and residential properties. These are mostly applied in HVAC (heating, ventilation and air-conditioning) systems. The Global Workplace Solutions segment offers facilities management services related to reducing costs and improving the performance of commercial properties.Within this division, there are some further opportunities to add value. The intention with Global Workplace Solutions was to generate some demand for HVAC products but these synergies have not transpired. The business is now being run separately but it isn't clear why it wouldn't be more valuable as part of a focused facilities manager, especially as it is dragging down the faster growth of other businesses in Business Efficiency. Equally, the Residential HVAC business lacks distribution scale but a divestment here is unlikely given residential construction trends.These construction trends mean that the near-term growth outlook for this division are fairly good. Margins are improving in the North American service business too and growth should continue to be strong in Asia. However, commercial construction has clearly been weak. Recent declines in the backlog to levels below 2010 should lead investors to question management's mid-term guidance of 8-10% revenue growth.Power SolutionsThe Power Solutions division produces lead-acid automotive batteries for the OEM and replacement market. The company has developed offerings in lithium-ion and various additional technologies aimed at ""Start-Stop vehicles"" as well as recycling operations for its lead batteries.Performance in Power Solutions has surprised this year. Margins have been driven higher by improved pricing, scale in recycling, growth in absorbent glass mat batteries (they are twice as profitable as lead), and growth in China. Increasing adoption of Start-Stop batteries should boost growth in AGM batteries further. The mid-term growth target of 10-15% looks more achievable here.SummaryThe opportunities for 'self help' through corporate restructuring are strong at Johnson Controls. Selling off the worst performing divisions and spinning off the slow growth, low margin divisions should lead to re-rating in line other multi-industry names as the high quality of the Business Efficiency and Power Solutions divisions is brought into focus. The current $3.8bn buyback program could also be extended if realizations from any divestments are favourable.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Its valuation presents an attractive upside.,"Source: Yahoo FinanceJohnson Controls (NYSE:JCI) is a global technology and industrial conglomerate. It has a far-reaching global presence and serves customers in over 150 countries on six continents. Its presence in developing markets is a big source of strength since emerging markets are expected to provide healthy growth opportunities. JCI's stock has produced a 16.27% price return in one year as shown in the figure above.JCI Owns a Portfolio of Strong Global BusinessesJohnson Controls deals in diverse areas like automotive seating, automotive interior, lead-acid batteries, lithium-ion batteries, battery recycling, building efficiency, heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC), building technology, integrated facilities management and industry solutions. JCI's research and development capabilities allow it to remain at the top of the categories it deals in. JCI is the world's largest producer of acid-lead automotive batteries producing over 135 million batteries annually. JCI's business segments and their relative sizes based on revenue (FY 2013) are given in the figure below.Johnson Controls is going to form the world's largest producer of automotive interiors through a joint venture with a Chinese manufacturer. It is already operating 56 plants in 25 locations in China.The Joint Venture with a Chinese Car Manufacturer is another Step towards GrowthJCI's joint venture with SAIC, the Chinese state-owned car manufacturer, is a good step that will help JCI to grow its top and bottom lines in the future. This joint venture will create the world's largest automotive interior producer that would hold approximately 15% of the global market share. This joint venture is expected to start in 2015 and it is expected to generate an estimated $7.5 billion in annual revenue. JCI has a 30% stake in this joint venture. China is a blooming auto market that is expected to show healthy growth in the coming years and JCI is determined to capitalize on this growth.JCI's seat manufacturing segment has a strong presence with a leading market share in China through its non-consolidated joint ventures. JCI is operating about 56 plants in 25 locations in China. With a strong backlog, demand is growing at double the rate compared to demand for domestic products.Capitalizing on the Growth in the Construction Industries of Emerging MarketsThe world's urban population is expected to grow at a rapid pace in the coming years and this will create great demand for products and services related to building and construction. JCI provides the innovative products and services for construction and real estate developers so the company is expected to capitalize on this growth. The world's urban population was about 1.4 billion in 2011 and is expected to grow to 5 billion by 2030. About 90% of this growth is expected to come from the emerging markets. Between 2011 and 2030 about 20% of the newly urbanized population will be Chinese and about 16% of the newly urbanized population will be Indian. Therefore it is critical that JCI enhances its presence in these emerging markets to secure growth. JCI is already working on expansion in emerging markets through investments and joint ventures in emerging economies. JCI's presence in emerging markets including China and India is expected to provide healthy growth for the top and bottom lines.JCI has expertise in making buildings more comfortable, productive, and safe and is using this expertise in 125 countries. Trends such as high energy costs, energy shortage and the move towards energy-efficient buildings and construction are expected to give JCI growth in the coming years.Capitalizing on the Growth in Fuel-Efficient Absorbed Glass-Mat BatteriesGrowth in the demand for fuel-saving batteries is expected to remain high in the coming years. Absorbed glass-mat (NYSE:AGM) batteries use start-stop technology in cars. The start-stop feature allows engines to sleep automatically when car is idle. This decreases fuel costs by about 3-8%. It is estimated that about 40% of new car batteries worldwide will be start-stop batteries by 2018.JCI is the leading manufacturer of advanced batteries and this leading position is expected to help the company to expand its market share. JCI supplies AGM batteries to major auto manufacturers in Europe. JCI's batteries are now used in Ford's (NYSE:F) 2013 start-stop vehicles and the Chevy Malibu start-stop vehicles.A Shareholder-Friendly CompanyJCI shares its success with its shareholders. It is interesting to know that JCI has paid dividends consistently since 1887and this is evidence of the company's commitment to dividend payments. The company has increased the dividend by 16%. JCI has also initiated a share repurchase plan worth $3 billion. JCI was recognized as a shareholder-friendly company by Institutional Investor Magazine. Investors that like to receive regular dividends should consider investing in JCI.Target Price Reveals Attractive UpsideThe consensus target price reveals that JCI is underappreciated by the market at its current price of $48.45. The mean target price estimate is $56.44 and presents an upside of 16.5% at the current price. The median target price is $58 that presents an upside of 20%. The most optimistic analyst estimate is $65 if materialized and presents an upside of 34% at the current price. The most conservative analyst estimate is $42 with a downside of -13% at the current price level. Therefore an analysis of the target price polled by Thomson/First Call from 18 brokers reveals an attractive upside at the current price.Source: Yahoo FinanceMultiples Based ValuationThe price to earnings ratio is 16.59 times its current price and shows that JCI's stock is undervalued compared to the industry and sector but overvalued compared to the P/E average for the comparison category of the S&P 500. Building growth to the P/E analysis, the PEG ratio shows that JCI's stock is undervalued compared to the industry but overvalued compared to the sector and S&P500. On a whole, the analysis of the P/E and PEG ratio gives some indication of the relative price undervaluation.Source: Yahoo FinanceConclusionJCI has a strong global presence with operations in over 150 countries. Its presence in the emerging markets is expected to give it sustained growth. Strong demand for JCI's building and construction related products in emerging markets are going to drive the company's top and bottom lines. JCI is going to form a joint venture with a Chinese company to create the world's largest automotive interior business. JCI's presence in the Chinese auto market will give JCI healthy growth in the future. Its target price estimate presents an attractive upside."
1502532,23479,2013-06-14T11:54:21-04:00,,"Exide Technologies (XIDE) filed for bankruptcy on Monday, June 10, attributing Wal-Mart‘s (NYSE:WMT) decision to stop buying its products as a reason. [1] This is the second time in about a decade that the battery maker, which employs around 10,000 people, has filed for bankruptcy. In its filings, Exide said that Wal-Mart’s decision to source automotive batteries from its arch rival, Johnson Controls (NYSE:JCI) led to a significant loss in annual revenues. Thus, as the troubled battery maker goes through restructurings over the next many months, Johnson Controls will have an opportunity to bolster its position as a leading automotive battery supplier.Johnson Controls’ automotive battery segment, which employs around 13,000 people is already the largest global supplier of lead-acid batteries with 36% market share. [2] It is also a leading manufacturer of advanced battery types that include absorbent glass mat (AGM) and Li-ion batteries. In fiscal 2012, the automotive battery segment generated $6 billion of Johnson Controls’ $42 billion revenues. [2] Here, we take a deeper look at the investment strategies that Johnson Controls is employing to grow its battery business.Emerging Markets FocusJohnson Controls generates over 80% of its battery revenues from the relatively slow growing markets of the Americas and Europe, and the remaining from Asia. [3] However, the company is expanding its footprint in the fast growing markets of Asia-Pacific, especially China. Currently, it has three plants in China and it plans to build two more lead-acid manufacturing facilities so as to ramp up its lead-acid manufacturing capacity in the country to 30 million by 2017. [4] In comparison, Johnson Controls had manufactured around 135 million lead-acid batteries worldwide last year. [5] Additionally, the company is investing to increase penetration with regional auto manufacturers and build aftermarket distribution channels in China.Vertical IntegrationIn September last year, Johnson Controls opened its battery recycling facility in South Carolina that can recycle up to 14 million auto batteries in a year. [6] The usage of recycled lead in manufacture of new batteries grows margins as well as insulates the company to a large extent from fluctuations in lead prices. The impact from the full ramp up of this facility is expected to boost Johnson Controls’ battery segment results in the second half of fiscal 2013. Thus, investment in such vertical integration will also contribute to growing the company’s profits in the coming years.Development Of Advanced Battery TechnologiesAt the same time, Johnson Controls is also investing to increase production capacity of start-stop batteries, which have seen increasing adoption from consumers and original equipment manufacturers, especially in Europe. These batteries power start-stop vehicles, which turn off automatically when the vehicle comes to a rest and restart, when the clutch is engaged or brake is released. The company estimates that the global annual market for new start-stop vehicles will reach 35 million by 2017, and in this time frame over 70% of new cars being built in Europe will be based on this technology. [7] Additionally, the aftermarket for start-stop batteries is also beginning to develop.Accordingly, Johnson Controls is investing $280 million in Germany to grow its start-stop battery manufacturing capacity in the country to 11 million. It is also investing $140 million in the U.S. and $100 million in China, to grow its annual start-stop manufacturing capacity to 6 million and 2 million, respectively, in these countries. [2] The company is also investing in research to develop Li-ion batteries, targeted at the evolving hybrid and electric vehicle automobile markets.As a result of these strategic investments and despite the slowdown in Europe, revenues and profits at Johnson Controls’ auto battery segment grew by double-digits in the last quarter. Over the next few years, the company anticipates revenues at its auto-battery segment to grow by 10-15% per year on market share gains, growth from China and increasing adoption of AGM technology. [3] It also anticipates to expand its margins on benefits from vertical integration.Notes:Disclosure: No positions"
1779742,23479,2013-10-28T17:08:57-04:00,,"Johnson Controls (NYSE:JCI) will announce its fourth quarter (of fiscal 2013) earnings Tuesday, October 29. The maker of auto batteries, auto seats and interiors and York-brand air conditioners will likely post strong growth in its profits on margin expansion driven by cost-cutting measures. In the previous quarter, the company’s earnings rose significantly driven by gains from restructuring initiatives and sequential improvements in its automotive profits from Europe. We anticipate these drivers of third quarter improvement to continue to benefit Johnson Controls’ results in the fourth quarter.The company guided its fourth quarter earnings, excluding special items to rise 21-23% annually to 93-95 cents a share. [1] We currently have a stock price estimate of $40 for Johnson Controls, around 5% below its current market price.Restructuring Gains To Expand MarginsAround a year back, Johnson Controls was faced with an extremely challenging demand environment with automotive production falling in Europe and remaining weak in North America. Construction spending was also declining from Europe. These trends were impacting results across the company’s segments, namely auto batteries, auto interiors and building efficiency, which provides the York-brand air conditioners and other building systems. Faced with such an environment, Johnson Controls initiated extensive restructuring initiatives aimed at lowering its cost structures. These cost-cutting measures included headcount reductions and plant consolidations, among others. Last quarter, for the first time, gains from these restructuring initiatives exceeded their one-time costs to lift the company’s profits through margin expansion. In the fourth quarter, we anticipate Johnson Controls to further expand its margins as these initiatives continue through the quarter.Mixed Macro EnvironmentOver the past year, the demand environment across many of Johnson Controls’ markets has improved. Automotive production has recovered in North America and continues to post strong growth in China. Automotive production in Europe is also improving gradually and we anticipate the company’s earnings from its European auto business to rise sequentially, though these will likely be lower on a year-over-year basis. Additionally, we expect the company’s results to continue to benefit from its expansion in the emerging markets such as Asia-Pacific.Progress On Sale Of The Remaining Units Of Auto Electronics SegmentAlso, in focus this earnings will be the progress that Johnson Controls has made in selling the remaining units of its auto electronics segment. This segment constituted around $1 billion of the company’s $42 billion revenues last year. [2] Johnson Controls recently sold the HomeLink unit of its auto electronics segment to Gentex Corp for around $700 million and reiterated that it was in active conversation with multiple players to sell the remaining units of this segment. [3] We figure the decision to exit the auto electronics space is a step in the right direction for Johnson Controls as it was a niche player in this space providing only body electronics, driver information and some other electronics parts. To grow in this space the company would have needed to make significant investments in navigation and other auto electronic technologies. We figure the cash from these sales could be used by the company to bolster its investments aimed at further strengthening its leadership position in the auto battery, seating and interior spaces.Disclosure: No positions."

Therefore, because Earnings Determine Market Price in the long run, we expect the future earnings of a company to justify the price we pay.Since all investments potentially compete with all other investments, it is useful to compare investing in any prospective company to that of a comparable investment in low risk Treasury bonds.

(NYSE:JCI) are two auto-related companies, with low forward P/E and high expected EPS growth (next five years), receiving analysts' upgrades recently. Both stocks will be analyzed fundamentally and technically in this article. Investing strategies will also be presented.General Motors CompanyGM was up 0.18% and closed at $28.21 on March 15, 2013. GM had been trading in the range of $18.72-$30.68 in the past 52 weeks. GM has a market cap of $38.55B.On March 15, 2013, Equities researchers at Deutsche Bank boosted their target price on shares of GM from $38.00 to $39.00 with a ""buy"" rating on the stock. Analysts currently have a mean target price of $34.88 and a median target price of $35.00 for GM. Analysts are estimating an EPS of $0.56 with revenue of $36.72B for the current quarter ending in March, 2013. For 2013, analysts are projecting an EPS of $3.39 with revenue of $157.33B, which is 3.30% higher than 2012.According to RDI report, signs of an improving U.S. housing market combined with upbeat readings on U.S. consumer confidence have continued to fuel the auto industry's rally in 2013. The Fed's policy of keeping interest rates near-zero has benefited the auto industry as a majority of Americans rely on loans to purchase new vehicles. Marketing firm LMC Automotive projects new vehicle sales to grow to 15.3 million in 2013.There are a few positive factors for GM:Technically, the MACD (12, 26, 9) indicator is showing a bullish trend. The momentum indicator, RSI (14), is showing a slightly bullish lean at 54.91. GM is currently trading above its 200-day MA of $ 24.31 and is approaching its 50-day MA of $28.43, as seen from the chart below.Source: StockCharts.comHow to InvestWith the estimated 15.02% EPS growth for the next five years, GM is improving fundamentally. In the near-term, it is important to see if GM can break through its 50-day MA to determine its short-term direction. For long-term investors, a safer entry point will be around $26-$26.5 range. Investors can also review the following ETFs to gain exposure to GM:Johnson Controls, Inc.JCI was up 0.11% and closed at $34.97 on March 15, 2013.

On March 14, 2013, Credit Agricole upgraded JCI from outperform to buy with a price target of $50.00 (from $36.00). Credit Agricole's new target price is much higher than the current analysts' mean target price of $33.12 and median target price of $33.00.

For 2013, analysts are projecting an EPS of $2.59 with revenue of $43.07B, which is 2.70% higher than 2012.While there are some recent reports indicating that JCI is exploring the sale of its automotive electronics business, analysts at Morgan Stanley don't think it's a good idea to split the company as it will be destructive to shareholder value. JCI will not and should not break up the company as sum of the parts is worth less than the whole, where each stub could trade at a lower multiple than current and peer levels after the split, according to the analyst.There are a few positive factors for JCI:Technically, the MACD (12, 26, 9) indicator is showing a bullish trend. RSI (14) is indicating a strong buying momentum at 80.15, where above 70 is considered as over-bought.

With expected 11.36% EPS growth for the next 5 year, JCI still has further side potential at current valuation. In the short-term, JCI is technically bullish. However, RSI (14) indicates an over-bought condition. It does not mean JCI will pull back soon, but investors may want to wait for a pull back to establish the long-term position.

1217421,23479,2013-02-22T14:04:18-05:00,,"Quick Take Johnson Controls (NYSE:JCI) is a diversified industrial company that serves global building markets with heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) products and facility management services. The company is also one of the largest suppliers of automotive interiors and batteries to the automobile industry. We believe that the rising global automobile demand and growing building markets in Asia are the primary drivers of its value.  Partially mitigating this growth is the weakness in the European building and automobile markets, which could drag on growth.We currently have a stock price estimate of $33.72 for Johnson Controls, approximately 5% above its current market price.See our complete analysis of Johnson Controls hereFactors that drive the company’s current value:1) Rising global automobile demand: Vehicle manufacturers have been raising their production rates since the financial crisis of 2008-09 due to the growing global demand for automobiles. In 2012, more than 60 million cars were produced globally, up from 59.8 million in 2011 and 58.3 million in 2010. [1] [2] Going forward, we anticipate production volumes to rise even further driven by low car ownership rates in major emerging economies like China and India. These higher production volumes will in turn raise demand for automotive batteries and interiors manufactured by Johnson Controls.Currently, the company is the world’s largest manufacturer of lead-acid automotive batteries with an annual production output of 135 million lead-acid batteries. [3] Johnson Controls is also increasing its production capacity of advanced battery types like Absorbent Glass Mat (NYSE:AGM) that power start-stop vehicles and Li-ion that power hybrid and electric vehicles. In all, the company is raising its annual production capacity for advanced batteries to 19 million by 2015. [4] With this, it aims to address the growing demand for start-stop and hybrid vehicles in several markets, especially Europe.Johnson Controls competes with other major automotive battery manufacturers like Exide, GS Yuasa, East Penn and Fiamm in this space. Overall, automotive batteries as a segment constitutes around 30% of Johnson Controls’ value according to our analysis.The company also serves the automobile industry with interior systems that include seating, electronics, instrument and front panels, floor consoles and door systems. It counts most of the world’s leading automobile manufacturers among its clients. In January 2013, Johnson Controls unveiled a new range of luxury interior systems to address the growing demand for luxury vehicles, particularly in China. As part of these luxury systems, the company showcased its new Inspiration seating which converts a typical three-seat second-row seating in a car to two lounge seats. These new seats offer premium features like heating and ventilation, massaging, four-way lumber support and can be controlled through the iPad.The company competes with other major automotive interior suppliers such as Lear, Faurecia SA and Magna International in this sector. The automotive interior segment constitutes just over 25% of Johnson Control’s value according to our estimates.2) Growing building markets in Asia: Johnson Controls also serves building markets globally by installing HVAC systems in commercial and residential properties and undertakes long-term service contracts of the same. The upgrade or replacement of these systems in existing buildings provide the company with repeat business while the installation of these systems in new housing or commercial starts provide growth. In terms of its revenue split, Johnson Controls generates approximately 70% of its total HVAC system revenues from existing buildings and the remaining from new commercial constructions. [3]Currently, the growth in new commercial constructions in Asia and recovering housing starts in North America are driving growth in HVAC segment sales of the company. Looking ahead, we anticipate this trend to continue driven by rising construction spending in Asia, primarily China.Johnson Controls competes with several global players like Honeywell (NYSE:HON), Siemens Building (NYSE:SI), Schneider Electric (OTCPK:SBGSF), Carrier, Trane, Daikin (OTCPK:DKILF), Lennox (NYSE:LII), Goodman Global and Jones Lang LaSalle (NYSE:JLL), regional and local players in this space. HVAC system and servicing constitute nearly 40% of the total company value, according to our analysis.3) Increasing outsourcing of facility management: Another factor that is adding value to Johnson Controls is the rising trend among large corporates and government bodies to outsource their office maintenance to third parties so that they are able to better focus on their core functions.Johnson Controls addresses this market by performing tasks related to comfort and reliability of office buildings. Under its facilities management portfolio, the company manages subcontractors for cleanliness, maintenance and landscaping. It also provides energy management services which gives it a competitive advantage as clients are able to recover a significant portion of their contract expenditure through energy savings.The global market for facilities management is a highly fragmented one in which Johnson Controls competes with several small regional players. According to our analysis, this business segment called Global Workplace Solutions constitutes around 7% of the company’s total value.Mitigating these above mentioned drivers are macroeconomic issues in Europe, which is impacting demand for cars and spending on new commercial constructions on the continent. This is negatively impacting sales in all segments of Johnson Controls. If the European crisis worsens, it could result in downside to our current valuation of the company.Notes:Disclosure: No Positions"
1228411,24627,2013-02-27T05:48:35-05:00,,"Johnson Controls, Inc. (NYSE:JCI) shares have enjoyed a significant rally since July of 2012. Back then, the stock was trading for about $23, but recently it went over $32. That is a gain of nearly 50% in just a few months. However, the stock has started to experience some weakness recently, along with the markets in general. This may entice some investors to consider buying the pullback, but it seems way too early to do this, especially since the stock is still trading at the upper end of the recent trading range and still appears extended. This can be seen by looking at the chart below:Johnson Controls could benefit from signs of a early rebound in the U.S. housing market because it manufactures a number of products that are used in this industry, including integrated heating, air conditioning, and ventilation systems. It also makes building management systems, commercial and industrial refrigeration, energy efficiency systems for buildings, fire and safety solutions for buildings. However, optimism for strong sales from the housing sector is perhaps not warranted because this company also sells to the commercial sector and to many countries beyond the U.S., and the demand does not appear as strong from those two segments (as it is from the domestic housing market).Furthermore, Johnson Controls also makes automotive products such as car batteries, car interiors and seating. This is another area where sales are going well domestically, but once again, a significant portion of this company's revenues are from outside the United States. Europe is suffering from a weakening economy and increasingly high unemployment. This is seriously impacting new car sales in the Euro-zone. That weakness is likely to persist for a while, and it could lower European demand for products made by this company.As the lower blue line in the chart (above) shows, this stock might have trend line support at around $26, especially if the recent weakness turns into a more significant correction. That is one reason why this stock might pullback to that level. Another reason is because of valuation. Analysts expect Johnson Controls to earn about $2.59 in 2013. Based on that, the current price to earnings ratio is about 12 times. The average stock in the S&P 500 Index (NYSEARCA:SPY) trades for about 15 times earnings, but many stocks like Ford (NYSE:F) and General Motors (NYSE:GM) and others in the auto sector trade for around 7 times earnings. While Johnson Controls easily deserves a higher multiple thanks to its diversification into housing related products, the PE ratio of 12 seems generous.This stock was trading below $25 just about 3 months ago, so it has had a nice run and could be ready to re-test the lower levels of the trading range. With the stock appearing to have hit a top recently, and with the trend possibly reversing as weakness has surfaced in the past few days, investors might want to consider holding off on any ""bargain"" hunting until the stock trades down to about $26. At this level, the price to earnings ratio would be at about 10 times, and that appears to be more reasonable for a company that is likely to see continued weakness from Europe.Here are some key points for JCI:Current share price: $30.83The 52 week range is $23.37 to $33.78Earnings estimates for 2013: $2.59 per shareEarnings estimates for 2014: $3.08 per shareAnnual dividend: 76 cents which yields 2.4%Data is sourced from Yahoo Finance.

1074571,32081,2012-12-20T04:40:51-05:00,,"On December 19 2012, Johnson Controls (NYSE:JCI) announced higher sales and earnings forecast for year 2013. The stock closed more than 1.85% up after the forecast, at $29.76 and is already up more than 13% since the past month's low of around $26.About The CompanyJohnson Controls manufactures automotive interior systems, automotive batteries and automated building control systems. The company also makes control systems used for energy management in the facilities management business. Its major customers are Ford (NYSE:F), General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Daimler.Previous CoverageIn this July article, I had stated two key factors that could lead to increased auto sales:And in fact, auto sales for November came out to be at a five-year high according to a recent report. The increased November sales could be partially attributed to Hurricane Sandy, but nevertheless, consumer sentiment in the auto space has improved either because of the consumer's aging vehicles or because of easy availability of credit or both factors.Bullish Options ActivityOn December 19 when the company announced its positive forecast for 2013, call options were trading more than four times the average daily call volume in the name. The premium for the $30 strike calls expiring in January ran as high as $1.15, indicating that investors are bullish about the prospects of a continued upside. This was even discussed in CNBC's show Fast Money.Fundamentals and ValuationJohnson Controls has several catalysts working in its favor in the long run.Risk - Fiscal Cliff Remains An IssueThe biggest risk facing the automotive sector in general and companies like Johnson Controls specifically is of course the Fiscal Cliff. CEOs of Volkswagen and Ford have agreed that the U.S. is seeing a steady recovery in auto sales but this consumer confidence could very well falter if the fiscal cliff occurs.It is recommended that investors weigh the risk of a fiscal cliff before jumping to a conclusion about investing in companies like Johnson Controls that belongs to a sector that is heavily dependent on economic expansion.ConclusionIn my opinion, at the end of this childish drama, we will see some kind of an agreement on the Fiscal Cliff. Johnson Controls should be able to overcome relatively weaker European sales because of the strength in the domestic U.S. market. Auto sales in the U.S. are expected to increase in year-over-year in 2013 and beyond, and any stabilization in Europe should help this company further. Options activity is already suggesting a more than 5% appreciation by January expiration, and any further positive news around auto sales and consumer confidence should drive this stock further upwards from there.Disclosure: I am long JCI.

1031251,37061,2012-11-27T15:08:31-05:00,,"A123 Systems (NYSE:AONE) filed for Chapter 11 protection on the 16th of October 2012. On the same day, it signed an agreement to sell all of its automotive assets to Johnson Controls (NYSE:JCI) in a transaction valued at $125 million. According to the agreement, JCI was supposed to receive AONE's auto-assets including its automotive technology, two factories in Michigan and one in China. Also, had the agreement gone through, JCI would have become the owner of AONE's equity interest in its Joint Venture with SAIC. In conjunction with the transaction, JCI had to provide debtor-in-possession (DIP) financing of $72.5mn to AONE to support it through its Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing.However, Wanxiang Group, one of China's biggest part manufacturers, announced to outbid JCI for A123's automotive-business assets. Wanxiang was interested in buying AONE's auto-assets, well before AONE went bankrupt. According to an article published in The Wall Street Journal, Wanxiang offered $450 million for AONE's auto-assets.After Wanxiang's offer, AONE's management suspected that it would have to pay the break-up fee of $2.5 million to JCI, if the auto assets were not transferred to JCI. However, the court's decision came in favor of AONE and now AONE's assets will be sold through an auction on the 6th of the next month.Given the level of interest that has developed in the battery-maker in the last month or so, the market expects the auction to last several days.AONE's automotive business is exclusively focused on the prismatic lithium-ion batteries and has current production contracts with General Motors (NYSE:GM), BMW, Daimler, Fisker and Smith Electric. Prior to its filing, A123 was on track to make an overall loss of around $170 million (50% of this came from the automotive section). The deal will position JCI to be the dominant surviving US-based, lithium-ion battery maker. Therefore, being a monopolist, JCI will be able to increase the prices to narrow those losses that AONE had made.The acquisition is consistent with JCI's ""three era"" approach to the automobile batteries. The first era, which JCI already dominates, is about the traditional lead-acid batteries. JCI is seeking to grow the margins and the revenues through vertical integration and expansion in the emerging markets.The second era is about the AGM batteries (still based on lead-acid chemistry). The Absorbed Glass Mat (NYSE:AGM) battery type uses a start-stop technology in which the engine automatically turns off when the car is idling. JCI is also well-positioned in this segment. Barclays claims that it sees an inflection point for adoption over the next few years as part of the High Efficiency Powertrain.The third era is about the lithium-ion batteries, which have witnessed a slower than expected adoption rate. Four years ago, JCI had higher hopes for the lithium-ion business. However, after the growth stalled, JCI put the business into a holding pattern (with part of the expenses funded by the Department of Energy), waiting for both the demand to inflect and the business to consolidate.The purchase of A123's assets is consistent with JCI's holding pattern strategy. For JCI, the transaction is relatively small - only 1.9% of the assets of Power Solutions ($125 million out of $6.6 billion) and 1.4% of the revenue (A123's revenue was $84 million in 2011 versus Power Solutions' revenue of $5.9 billion). The transaction demonstrates that JCI intends to have a presence in the lithium-ion battery segment as it evolves. Further, the transaction also demonstrates JCI's patient approach to strategic growth of the business.Valuations and ConclusionThe stock is trading at a forward multiple of 8x. JCI recently reported its fourth quarter earnings. The company topped the earnings estimates and met the revenue estimates. The company significantly improved profitability at its Building Efficiency, Power Solutions and North American Automotive Experience segments. However, a weak auto industry in Europe remains a headwind in the near future.For JCI, as mentioned before, the overall transaction of acquiring AONE's acquisition is relatively small. However, this should not undermine its significance given the incremental profits and market share that JCI expects after this acquisition. For FY 2013, JCI forecasts earnings to remain flat or slightly higher on a Y-o-Y basis. However, I believe, the acquisition of AONE's segment will give a boost to its earnings. Therefore, after the acquisition, the market is expected to revise (favorably) the valuations at which JCI is currently trading. I recommend the stock as a buy.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

The  expansion incorporates a fully-automated assembly line for air handling  units [AHU] and four production lines for ductless air-conditioning and  heating [HVAC] systems. The company aims to utilize shortened lead  times and improved efficiencies to derive the said capacity gains.  However, the most important aspect of this expansion is that it will  allow Johnson Controls to address the growing demand for  energy-efficient HVAC products from the building market in China.Johnson Controls’ HVAC segment constituted $10.4 billion of the company’s $42 billion revenues in fiscal 2012.  We currently have a stock price estimate of $34 for the company, marginally above its current market price.     Building Market In China Is Projected To Grow At Strong Rates Over The Coming YearsIn fiscal 2012, Johnson Controls’ HVAC segment generated $2 billion in sales from Asia [Johnson Controls’ fiscal 2012 10-K, November 19 2012, www.johnsoncontrols.com]. More  than 50% of this came from China where the company’s HVAC sales have  grown at a compounded annual growth rate of 13% over the past five  years.Looking ahead, China will continue to be the most important growth  market for the company. The construction of residential and commercial  buildings in the country is expected to grow at strong rates over the  coming years driven by a rising urban population. Through 2025, around  350 million additional Chinese are expected to move to cities from rural  areas and 50,000 new high rises are expected to come up in the country,  according to industry estimates cited by the company. In addition, to  provide an estimate of this market’s importance relative to the rest of  the world – through 2020, around 50% of all 10+ story buildings are  expected to be built in China. Thus, Johnson Controls can ill afford to not expand in this critical growth market.Overall, Johnson Controls with its advanced product portfolio,  manufacturing facilities at Guangzhou and Wuxi, an engineering center at  Wuxi and 37 branch offices providing servicing, is well-positioned to  maintain its leadership position in the building market of China.Increased Guangzhou Capacity Will Help Offset Impact From Slowdown In EuropeIn the near term, this expansion at Guangzhou will help the company’s  HVAC segment revenues to grow again after an annual decline of nearly  3% in fiscal 2012. Last year, sales at this segment were impacted from the slowdown in  European building markets, which are reeling under the sovereign debt  crisis. Johnson Controls currently anticipates its HVAC segment sales to  grow between 2% and 4% in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 [Johnson Controls investor presentation, February 2013, www.johnsoncontrols.com].The expanded Guangzhou facility will also contain a test center for  ductless HVAC systems and small tonnage chillers where research will be  carried out to develop future energy-efficient building products.Disclosure: No positions"
1071031,21568,2012-12-18T12:57:21-05:00,,"By Jeff St. JohnIt's official: Johnson Controls (NYSE:JCI) has filed an appeal to the bankruptcy court sale that saw it lose its bid for A123's assets to Chinese auto equipment giant Wanxiang. But it's not demanding to stop the sale -- though it stands ready to take over the bankrupt lithium-ion battery maker if politics gets in the way of Wanxiang's takeover of the company.That's the gist of a Monday announcement from Johnson Controls, which said it has filed an appeal in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Delaware to get back a $5.5 million breakup fee it had given the court to participate in the bid for A123's business. Johnson Controls, which had sought to acquire A123's automotive assets out of bankruptcy for $125 million, but bowed out of the auction after a final bid of $251 million jointly with Japan's NEC, about $5 million short of what Wanxiang has pledged to pay.U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Kevin Carey put that $5.5 million in escrow last week, after being told by attorneys representing unsecured creditors that JCI had been lobbying in Congress to have Wanxiang's bid blocked. But Monday's statement from Alex Molinaroli, president of Johnson Controls Power Solutions, said that it's appealing the sale in order to get back that money.""We appreciated the opportunity to serve as stalking horse, which resulted in significant value to the estate, creditors and employees,"" Molinaroli said. At the same time, Johnson Controls defended its right to lobby the government, and stated that anything it's done along those lines in relation to A123 has been ""consistent with First Amendment rights to free speech and are strictly governed by the company's ethics policy and comply with government regulations.""The company also made it clear that it considers the sale of A123 (AONEQ,PK) to a foreign company a national security issue -- and that it stands ready to buy A123 if the sale to Wanxiang is blocked: ""Johnson Controls has consistently maintained that national security questions tied to the core technology used in all of A123's businesses represent a risk to the sale which cannot be dismissed until resolved by the government review process."" If Wanxiang's bid ends up being blocked, ""Johnson Controls remains open to considering future opportunities to acquire relevant portions of A123's assets,"" Molinaroli said.Here's our previous coverage of the latest in A123 bankruptcy news:Wanxiang has already given up a lot in its $256.6 million winning bid to take over bankrupt U.S. battery maker A123. Not only has it said goodbye to A123's U.S. government work, it has lost the remaining $120 million or so of a $249 million Department of Energy grant that's helped build A123's lithium-ion factories in Michigan -- plants that Wanxiang says it will keep open.But political opponents of A123's sale to a Chinese company are saying that may not be enough. Even A123's commercial technology is inextricably linked back to its federally funded work with partners like DOE and the Department of Defense, they say. That could allow Wanxiang to develop military applications based on A123's U.S.-funded technology, it is claimed -- and that's enough reason to block the sale.These are some of the issues facing the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. The committee chaired by Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner is in charge of deciding just what parts of a proposed sale of A123's assets and intellectual property might constitute a national security risk. This week, the group began a 45-day review of the sale, with a deadline of January 15, 2013 to make a decision.The Strategic Materials Advisory Council, an industry group, said this week that dozens of members of Congress have weighed in against Wanxiang's takeover. U.S. Rep. Bill Huizenga (R.-Mich.), representing the state with the most to gain or lose from the future of A123's U.S.-based manufacturing, took to Facebook to call it a threat to national security and economic competitiveness.Members of Congress have already been demanding investigations into A123 and key business partner Fisker Automotive, along with other DOE-backed companies that have gone under (Abound Solar, Beacon Power) in the wake of Solyndra's bankruptcy. Of course, DOE has also given money to foreign companies to create U.S. jobs, with mixed success -- LG Chem, which took a $151 million DOE award for its Michigan factory that builds batteries for the Chevy Volt, furloughed 200 workers in September.As for A123's military work, it was sold to Illinois-based Navitas Systems for $2.25 million, ensuring that Wanxiang would not take over federal contracts for projects like portable power systems and unmanned vehicles. Wanxiang gets the remainder of the Waltham, Mass-based company's assets, including its automotive business with customers like Fisker, General Motors, BMW, Tata Motors and Smith Electric Vehicles, and its grid storage business, with partners including AES Energy Storage, Sempra Energy and NSTAR.Just how many of those customers will remain with A123 through its transition remains to be seen. GM, which has tapped A123 to build batteries for its Spark EV, has remained mum on whether it will continue to work with the company as it goes through bankruptcy. Fisker, which accounted for 26 percent of A123's revenues at the time of its bankruptcy, is facing its own challenges.On the grid-scale energy storage front, AES, which accounted for 24 percent of A123's revenues at the time of its bankruptcy, last week announced a new battery partner, Mitsubishi-GS Yuasa, for a 20-megawatt lithium-ion energy storage project in Chile. AES Energy Storage President Chris Shelton said in an interview this week that the choice of a new partner wasn't related to A123's bankruptcy, and that AES envisions working with a post-reorganization A123, as well as many other battery partners in the future. He wouldn't say whether or not A123 had competed for the latest bid."

The company posted growth in Asia and  North America but this was more than offset by a decline in Europe. Company earnings were also impacted by charges related  to restructuring activities. In the fourth quarter revenues were down 4%  y-o-y to $10.4 billion and the company posted a net loss of $8 million,  compared to a net profit of $234 million in the year-ago period. For  its fiscal 2013 the company anticipates earnings to be in line with  fiscal 2012, as a slowdown in Europe and the adverse impact of currency  are expected to persist.Weaker Europe offsets gains from AsiaAll the businesses of Johnson Controls, namely heating, ventilation  and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems, automotive interiors and automotive  batteries posted growth in Asia. Though sales in local currency terms  were impacted adversely by a stronger dollar. Sales from Asia in  automotive interiors division which manufactures floor consoles,  dashboards, seats and other interior systems for automobiles increased  2% y-o-y to $663 million in the fourth quarter. Sales  and earnings from Asia also increased in HVAC and automotive battery  divisions. Asia constitutes approximately 15% of the total sales at  Johnson Controls and the company has been steadily increasing its  presence in the region over the past several years. In North America sales increased 13% y-o-y to $2.2 billion in the automotive interiors division. This  growth was in line with the overall industry expansion in North America  during the period. However, sales and earnings from North America  declined in the other divisions of the company in the fourth quarter.  The region constitutes approximately 40% of the total sales of the  company. However, gains from Asia and North America were offset by lower sales  in Europe. Sales from the region in automobile interiors division  declined 15% y-o-y to $2.2 billion in the fourth quarter. In  particular, demand from European original equipment manufacturers  (OEMs) of automobiles was weak. Sales from the region also declined in  automotive battery and HVAC divisions of the company. Europe constitutes  approximately 40% of the total sales of the company. In addition, the top line was impacted by a stronger dollar in the  fourth quarter. Excluding the impact of currency conversion, revenues  increased 1% y-o-y. Restructuring charges impact earningsJohnson Controls also initiated several restructuring activities in  the fourth quarter to better align its resources with growth markets and  to reduce its cost structures. These restructuring activities, which  included workforce reductions and plant consolidations resulted in a  $245 million pre-tax charge. This  was largely responsible for causing a net loss in the fourth quarter.  These restructuring activities are expected to continue till the end of  fiscal 2014.Weak growth forecast for fiscal 2013For full fiscal year 2012 revenues increased 3% y-o-y to $42 billion but net income declined 13% y-o-y to $1.2 billion. For  the fiscal 2013, the company forecasts weak growth. In the first half  of fiscal 2013 it anticipates earnings to be significantly lower  compared to earnings in the first half of fiscal 2012 on continued  weakness in Europe. Further, it anticipates the restructuring activities  undertaken in the fourth quarter to benefit earnings in the second half  of fiscal 2013. Overall, Johnson Controls anticipates earnings in  fiscal 2013 to be in line with the earnings in fiscal 2012.We currently have a stock price estimate of $28.68 for the company,  approximately 10% above its current market price. We are in the process  of incorporating fourth quarter earnings and will update our analysis  shortly.See our complete analysis of Johnson Controls here."
898641,30811,2012-10-02T01:23:59-04:00,,"Shares of Johnson Controls, Inc. (NYSE:JCI) have recently recovered 18.3% from their 52-week low of $23.37 reached late July. However, the stock has only appreciated 4.85% over the past 12 months. JCI has been one of the popular dividend stocks, given its decent dividend yield of 2.6% and solid market position in the cyclical automotive parts sector, which will likely outperform amid the economic recovery. Nevertheless, I remain neutral on the stock based on the following reasons:1. At $27.64 per share, JCI's LTM P/E and LTM EV/EBITDA multiples are trading very close to their 3-year lows (see charts below). Over the past year, JCI's NTM P/E multiple has been trending in line but below the S&P 500 P/E ratio (see chart below). As such, the historical stock performance has suggested a low valuation relative to the historical level. However, I believe JCI's valuations remain unattractive when accounting for the company's relative financial performance to a peer group consisting of JCI's competitors such as BorgWarner (NYSE:BWA) and TRW Automotive (NYSE:TRW).Click to enlargeAnalysts on average predict JCI's revenue, EBITDA, and EPS to rise by solid 2-year CAGRs of 4.7%, 15.8%, and 11.3% over the current and next fiscal years (see table below). The growth estimates are significantly better than the average rates of 3.4%, 7.3%, and 10.6% for the peer group. In addition, JCI's EBITDA margin is expected to expand by 1.5% in 2 years, compared to the peer average of just 0.6%. However, JCI has a low profitability. Except for the firm's LTM gross margin, which is only slightly higher than the average, all of JCI's margin and investment capital return measures are below the peer averages. JCI also assumes a relatively higher leverage as reflected by the firm's higher debt to capitalization and debt to EBITDA ratios. In terms of liquidity, JCI is the only firm that has a negative LTM free cash flow margin. Its low profitability coupled with a high leverage have resulted in a below-average interest coverage ratio. Both JCI's current and quick ratios are also below the group averages, suggesting a mediocre balance sheet.Despite the higher growth prospects, JCI should trade roughly in line with the peer group, given the firm's profitability and liquidity weakness. Nonetheless, the current valuations at 7.6x LTM EV/EBITDA and 11.0x LTM P/E represent an average valuation premium of 50% over the peer-average EV/EBITDA and P/E trading multiples (see table above), suggesting that the stock is likely somewhat overvalued.2. Although the company has a strong commitment to its dividend policy, which is reflected by a solid 10-year dividend per share CAGR of 12% over the last decade (see chart below), the current dividend level appears to be fragile, as JCI has not been able to generate positive free cash flow since 2011 (see chart below). On an LTM basis, the company's free cash flow had seen further deterioration in 2012, attributable to a mediocre operating cash flow performance and a significant increase in capital expenditure.3. From a technical perspective, the stock's 200-day simple moving average has been limiting the upside since mid-2011 (see chart below), and it appears that JCI remains under pressure to surpass that level after a few tests in 2012.Despite all the aforementioned negativity, the investment still has its merits:1. JCI has significant market position in both the developed and emerging markets, and it also has one of the strongest growth prospects. As such, the company is well positioned to benefit from the auto market's recovery in the developed countries and rapid growth in the emerging markets.2. Accounting for JCI's earnings growth potential, the stock actually trades at a relatively low PEG of 0.6x, significantly below the 1.0x benchmark and 29% below the peer average at 0.8x.3. Street analysts are generally bullish on the stock. Of the 30 ratings according to Capital IQ, there are 11 strong buys, 6 outperforms, and 13 holds. The average target price of $33.42 is 21% above the current market price.Bottom line, given the current stretched valuation and cash flow weakness, I do not recommend acquiring the shares until the price drop by 10%-15% and there is a visibility of potential cash flow improvement.Comparable analysis table is created by author, all other charts are sourced from Capital IQ, and all financial data is sourced from Morningstar and Capital IQ.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

898401,27011,2012-10-01T17:43:08-04:00,,"Shares of Johnson Controls (NYSE:JCI) declined considerably after it reported earnings last quarter, but thanks to a market rally based on more government stimulus the stock has recovered nicely. However, investors might want to consider selling or shorting the stock now, as the company looks challenged in view of the recent economic data coming from China, Europe, and the United States.Last quarter, Johnson Controls reported a profit of 61 cents per share, which was below analyst estimates of 66 cents per share. This quarter, consensus estimates are at about 75 cents per share, so the bar is set even higher. Furthermore, it appears that a number of core regions and industries have deteriorated in the past several weeks. For example, economic data in China shows reduced demand in many areas. Johnson Controls has sales and operations in China and a substantial amount of revenues coming from Europe as well. In particular, this company could be impacted by weakness in its automotive division as the European car market is under heavy pressure. A recent article summarizes the concerns of Peugeot's (OTCPK:PEUGY) CEO, who said that there will be no recovery in European auto sales for years, and that German auto sales are now starting to weaken, which is a bad sign for every company in the auto sector. Johnson Controls has supplied automotive products to Peugeot and other European automakers, which are responding to negative industry conditions by cutting production and closing plants.The United States economy is showing signs of a new slowdown and it could be poised to get much worse with the fiscal cliff, when the government cuts back on spending and raises taxes in 2013. The Chicago Purchasing Managers Index has just dropped below 50 for the first time since 2009. That level could be indicating that a recession is coming and when the U.S. economy declines, it will likely make things even worse in Europe and China.When compared to many other companies, Johnson Controls is more sensitive to an economic downturn since it manufactures automotive, heating, air-conditioning, and other products. In 2011, the company had about $20 billion in auto-related revenues, nearly $15 billion in the ""building efficiency"" division -- which includes heating and air conditioning, etc. -- and almost $6 billion in the ""power solutions"" division. This shows that the company is heavily dependent on the health of the auto industry.While car sales have been strong in the United States, that trend could be reversed and follow the declines recently seen in European. Furthermore, even as car sales have been strong in the U.S., shares of GM (NYSE:GM) and Ford (NYSE:F) have underperformed, which could be another sign that the markets do not believe auto sales will remain strong, even in the U.S. Consumers and businesses are likely to buy fewer cars, and hold off on buying heating or air conditioning systems if the economy continues to trend down. Another concern is the balance sheet, which currently shows about $610 million in cash and around 6.6 billion in debt. That is a large debt load, particularly if major regions like China, Europe, and the United States all start to sink in unison in the coming quarters.Just days after Johnson Controls reported earnings last quarter, the stock made a new 52-week low. Based on signs of global economic deterioration, a looming fiscal cliff, and a heavy debt load, it would not be surprising for this stock to revisit the 52-week low, if not make new lows, when the company releases earnings and what could be very cautious forward guidance. Investors should consider the recent bounce in the stock as an opportunity to sell or short the stock, as lower prices could be coming soon.Key Data Points For Johnson Controls:Data is sourced from Yahoo Finance.

1121211,24361,2013-01-18T17:20:05-05:00,,"While I understand that Wall Street is a discounting mechanism that looks forward more often than backward, I have a hard time reconciling the confidence that investors have shown in Johnson Controls (NYSE:JCI) over the past three months with the likely trajectory of performance.Johnson Controls said many of the right things at its recent analyst day, addressing issues like margin challenges in the automotive and building systems businesses and pointing to a promising future in batteries, but it seems like analysts are much too willing to reward the company with unprecedented operating improvements. A slight beat for the fiscal first quarter is certainly better than another miss, but back-loaded guidance and iffy auto margins leave me hanging on to some skepticism.Steps Forward, And Back, In Fiscal Q1Johnson Controls reported basically flat sales for this fiscal first quarter, and that was good enough for a slight beat relative to the average of sell-side estimates. Both automotive (down 1%) and building efficiency (BATS:FLAT) slightly outperformed expectations, while the battery business (up 4%) was just shy on 3% shipment growth.Margins, where I'd argue Johnson Controls has the most work to do and the most to prove, were a bit disappointing. Overall segment EBIT fell by a low teens percentage (13% as reported by the company, or 11% on an adjusted basis), and this was a tiny miss as was the 10bp miss in operating margin (which declined from 5.8%, or 6% reported, to 5.2%).The auto business was notably weak, with income down 50% and an 80bp margin miss. Income in the battery business fell 1%, but margins were solid (down 80bp from last year, but more than 100bp better than expected). In the building efficiency business, profits leaped 29%, margins improved 70bp, and the margin performance exceeded targets by about 40bp.Admittedly, a 10bp miss on segment EBIT margin is not normally a big deal at all. In the case of Johnson Controls, though, I think it's important to view it in the context of a company that has long needed to deliver better performance, and where investors have already rewarded the expectation of improving performance. Johnson Controls needs to deliver a few straight quarters of good, clean beats and I'm not sure this really makes the grade.Autos - Will China Pick Up Where Europe Leaves Off?As it contributes about half of the company's sales, Johnson Controls absolutely needs better top and bottom-line performance to hit sell-side targets. While U.S. auto production is looking pretty solid for 2013, Europe is most definitely not. Chinese production should help pick up some of the slack (and JCI has good share in China), so investors need to keep a careful eye on this market. Investors may also want to monitor Harman (NYSE:HAR) and Gentex (NASDAQ:GNTX) given JCI's weak performance in auto electronics (down 8% this quarter).On the margin side, there's a huge amount of work to do. The auto parts industry is a tough one in general, but JCI lags other seating rivals like Lear (NYSE:LEA), Magna (NYSE:MGA) and Faurecia by too much in margins to just ignore. The company is taking some logical steps - improving sourcing policies, learning from recent launch mistakes, and restructuring bad programs - but the high single-digit goal the company laid out seems tough to accept given the amount of capacity in the industry and the volume pressures in Europe.Batteries And Building Hold Potential … But Also RivalsI'm relatively more positive on Johnson Controls' prospects of better results from its other two businesses. While the stagnant commercial building environment hasn't helped, nor has a reduction in government-sponsored subsidies for energy efficiency, I believe the long-term future for solutions that reduce the environmental impact of buildings is a bright one - whether it's for ""fuzzy bunny"" environmental reasons in Europe or simply reducing the strain on the power grid in markets like China and India. The key here, though, is whether Johnson Controls can reinvest and stay with/ahead of the likes of Honeywell (NYSE:HON), Siemens (NYSE:SI), and so on.On the battery side, JCI has done well maintaining its place in the auto battery business and introducing new products like absorbent glass mat ((AGM)) batteries for the stop-start market. I was a little disappointed that JCI didn't bid more for the assets and IP of bankrupt A123, but M&A price discipline is hardly a bad thing. With technology as a gating factory, I believe this can be an even higher-margin business down the road.The Bottom LineMy skepticism on Johnson Controls comes down to the numbers. Although Johnson Controls' near-consistent double-digit returns on invested capital and high single-digit long-term owner earnings growth suggest quality, the company's free cash flow production has always been poor. I realize that free cash flow isn't a flawless metric in isolation (it does tend to punish investing for future growth), but an entire decade of sub-3% free cash flow margins bugs me. More to the point, I think it also creates a very high bar for the company, as many sell-side analysts are blithely predicting fiscal 2014 free cash flow production at a rate not seen in company history, with more growth to follow.For me, I see a long-term CAGR of about 4-5% on revenue, but much less free cash flow leverage. I believe Johnson Controls' FCF will continue to bump along in the single digits, rising maybe to 5% far down the road. Discounted back, that suggests fair value of about $25. If these analysts are right, though, and JCI's free cash flow production ramps up and ultimately starts approaching the levels of companies like Honeywell, then all bets are off and maybe Johnson Controls shoots through the $30s and into the $40s.Personally, I don't believe it, and there are too many good companies with strong track records trading at discounts to conservative fair values for me to take a chance on fixer-upper like JCI. Nevertheless, if you're a believer in JCI's vision of a substantially better future for itself, hang on because there's still a tremendous amount of improving to be done.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Its P/E is near multi-year lows, and JCI's 2.65% current yield is the second highest of the past dozen years.European woes and China's economic deceleration aren't helping JCI's automotive businesses. Even so, 2012 earnings are expected to come in at a record $2.52 for the FY ending this month. Analysts predict $2.93 for the year ahead, although, the accuracy of that forecast will depend on how macroeconomic trends play out.You could stop reading right now if you're thinking 'double-dip' recession. JCI watched its EPS plunge from $2.33 to $0.47 from 2008 to 2009. The stock price tumbled from $36.50 to $8.40 during that stretch. That extremely large sell off turned out to be the best entry point in JCI in more than fifteen years. It was also the only chance to snag a better yield than today's.Earnings per share and the shares bounced back quickly in FY 2010 to $2.00 and $40.19, respectively. Ever since, there's been solid support right around $25. Selling has kicked in between $35 and $40 on numerous occasions.Morningstar loves Johnson Controls. They see fair value as $42.Standard & Poor's loves Johnson Controls on virtually every metric. They carry a one-year goal price of $38.S&P shows an interesting chart that you don't see elsewhere. It's the historical high and low P/E range during each of the past ten years. Note how infrequently JCI has offered a better entry point. Johnson Controls has a 10-year median multiple of 14x and touched 15x or above at some point during each calendar year of the past decade.Fourteen times the $2.53 estimate for the year wrapping up would bring JCI back to above $35. That same normalized P/E could justify $41 if the world economy simply muddles along.Long-term players have been well rewarded despite 2008's meltdown and the Great Recession. Here are JCI's 10-year, split-adjusted numbers, excluding non-recurring items.The share price on Aug. 31, 2002 was $11.96. 10-years later, it's $27.21. That's good for 127.5% plus dividends even with JCI at a relative low point. Patient investors should do well with JCI regardless of near-term events.

(TYC) is getting ready to go from one business to three separate businesses in order to unlock the value of its subsidiaries.Please go here to see the details of the Tyco spin-off. Let's examine each company after the spin-off.Pentair/Tyco Flow ControlImmediately after the spin-off, Tyco Flow Control will merge with Pentair, and they will trade under the current Pentair symbol PNR.Pentair, Inc. is a focused diversified industrial manufacturing company comprised of two operating segments: Water & Fluid Solutions and Technical Products. Water & Fluid Solutions is a global leader in providing innovative products and systems used worldwide in the movement, storage, treatment and enjoyment of water. Technical Products is a leader in the global enclosures and thermal management markets, designing and manufacturing standard, modified and custom enclosures that house and protect sensitive electronics and electrical components and protect the people that use them.This merger makes a lot of sense on a couple of levels:Separately, for a cyclical company, Pentair looks fully valued.After the companies are fully merged and margins are improved, the valuation should be very similar. Here are the individual and combined results for the first six months of this year.(Click to enlarge)ADTAt the current distribution of .24 shares of Flow Control for every Tyco share and the current PNR price of $44.04, Tyco shareholders should get proceeds of $10.57 if they were to sell right away. There should be selling pressure on PNR as some Tyco shareholders dump the shares right away.ADT (ADT) shares will be coveted in the open market.Lets look at ADT's result of operations as an independent company.(Click to enlarge)Revenue has jumped due to the acquisition of Brinks Home Security Holdings in 2010. Organic revenue has been growing at a pedestrian rate of 4% a year. However, ADT executives believe Pulse will be their growth engine. Pulse allows customers to keep track of their homes from anywhere. ""It's home automation, climate, and light control and video."" It also charges a higher monthly fee than the regular home monitoring service.Due to the all the aforementioned reasons, it will probably trade around 20 times FCF of $500 million or $10 billion, which should give it a price of around $42/share.TycoWhat will be left over is the Tyco Fire Protection unit. The smaller Tyco commands about 10% of the fragmented $100 billion Fire and Security market. Here are the results of operations for the new Tyco.(Click to enlarge)Executives are targeting 4 to 5% revenue and 15% earnings growth over the next three year Like ADT, it could be a takeover target by some of its larger competitors like United Technologies Corp. (NYSE:UTX), Stanley Black & Decker (NYSE:SWK), Honeywell International Inc. (NYSE:HON) and Germany's Siemens AG (NYSE:SI). It should trade around 15 times fiscal 2012 earnings. If you add back the restructuring, asset impairments and divestiture charges (gains) of $78 million (minus taxes) to the net income it should trade around a 10 billion valuation or $21/share.ConclusionHypeZero's total sum of parts valuation comes out to $52.57($10.57+$21+$21). Obviously, the market disagrees with us, since the price of TYC is around $56.

739551,29461,2012-07-23T07:42:58-04:00,,"On Thursday, Johnson Controls (JCI) announced its earnings for the third quarter. Sales turned out to be $10.6 billion, 3% lower than analyst estimates of $10.9 billion. JCI believes that this is because of the lower than expected growth in emerging markets, and the high prices of core, which significantly damaged its Power Solution segment's income. In light of this announcement, sell-side analysts have revised their growth estimates for the next year's earnings from 25% to 5%.Company's DescriptionJCI is the largest U.S. auto supplier; it designs and manufactures automotive interiors. Alongside, it provides heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) facilities. Its third segment, Power Solutions, produces lead-acid and lithium-ion batteries.Results(Click to enlarge)Auto partsMore than 50% of total sales come from this segment. The sales were the same as estimated for this quarter. Sales growth was observed to be positive everywhere, except Europe. The following table shows the geographical segmentation of revenue from this stream for the first quarter.This shows the high dependency of the segment's sales on the European Auto Industry. However, European auto sales have been declining, as demand has been pulled back by the European debt crisis, which has negatively impacted French, Spanish and Italian auto sales.European sales for this segment have declined as a result. However, the U.S. Auto Industry is on the rise, which has offset this damage. The following chart, which shows the monthly calculated Seasonally Adjusted Annualized Selling Rate (SAAR) for both Western Europe and the U.S., clarifies our stance.(Click to enlarge)Source: QineqtThis quarter, sales were in the following proportion:Income, however, did not meet expectations, because of the operational inefficiencies in Europe where production capacity was not fully utilized. However, the company has announced that it will lay off a chunk of its workforce.Building EfficiencyThe company makes 30% of its revenues from this segment, which relied a lot on the rising demand from Europe, and emerging economies like Asia and Latin America. Although Asian sales grew by 12%, the rise was offset by the reduced sales in debt-ridden Europe and slowly growing Brazil. U.S. sales rose because of unusual warm temperatures, as the demand for air-conditioning rose. Residential HVAC sales grew by an unforeseen 24%.However, the income from this segment was above expectations, as the company's margins expanded. The margins improved by 1.63%, as the company implemented its cost-cutting and increasing market share plans.Looking forward, U.S. and European construction activity is expected to improve in the long run. However, in the short run, in light of the stagnant Architectural Billing Index, construction activity is not expected to grow.Power SolutionsThis segment, although the smallest in business, is the most profitable. Lead batteries derive their demand from the demand of auto cars. As auto sales declined, so did the revenue from batteries. Demand for replacement batteries and new batteries declined in North America and Europe respectively. To add to these woes, the price of core, which is used in recycling lead, climbed to its all time high this quarter, which eroded margins. The hike in core's price came because of lower aftermarket sales of batteries, which meant that lesser batteries would be returned, causing an overall reduction in supply. The unexpected combination of low demand and high cost of raw materials proved to be extremely detrimental to the segment's sale and income. The following chart shows the trend:(Click to enlarge)The management is hopeful that the margins and sales will improve by 2013.Bullish TrendsBearish TrendsValuationsJCI has no debt-related issues. Given that the operating cash flow from operations is in north of $1bn, the company should have no problem in tackling with its debt. The debt maturity structure is as follows:The company doesn't face any refinancing issues either.The stock can be a good player in a scenario which sees the European Auto Industry revive. With an 18% 5-year annual earnings growth rate, the stock is expected to go up as the world economy picks up.Currently, the stock is trading at 8x its forward earnings. Its depressed valuations can also be gauged by a Price/Sales ratio of 0.4x and a PEG ratio of 0.6. These low valuations can give an investor a good entry point. The stock also offers a relatively high ROE of 15%.JCI is down 36% for the year vs. its competitor Magna International, Inc. (MGA) being down 22%.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
771451,22742,2012-08-01T17:09:18-04:00,,"By Mark Bern, CPA CFANow that we own Johnson Controls (JCI) after being put the stock when the price of the stock remained below the July 2012 put strike price of $29 on the put we sold in April, we need to employ a strategy using options to enhance the income from our new holding. If you have been following the series, you will recall that we sold a put option on JCI in our October 6, 2011 article and again in December and once again in April. The first two puts we sold expired worthless and we kept the premiums of $332 (net of commission) after five months for a return of 11.1 percent. We sold another put on JCI on April 24, 2012 in our last update article on JCI which also included a discussion of Chevron (CVX), another of our favorite companies.This time we sold a JCI July 2012 expiration put with a strike price of $29 for a premium of $105 ($96 net of commission) and we were put 100 shares at $29. We now own JCI with a cost basis of $27.95 (for tax purposes; $29 - $1.05). Now we'd like to get some of that original investment back and we are going to do that by using another, relatively low-risk options strategy, called the strangle. The 52-week high and low for JCI is $36.86 and $23.37, respectively. We would like to own more JCI for the long term if we could get the stock at $20 a share or lower and we don't mind selling the stock for a profit if it goes up to make a new high. In the meantime we'd like to take some of our money back out of the stock to increase our overall return. And that is just we are going to do.Here is how we set up the position. We already own the stock with a cost basis of $27.95 and the current price is $24.31 (all quotes for this transaction are after the market close on Wednesday August 1, 2012). We sell a covered call expiring in January 2014 with a strike price of $30.00 (above our cost basis) for a premium of $1.65. We also sell a put option expiring in January 2014 with a strike of $20 (below the 52-week low) for a premium of $2.65. We will need to keep $2,000 of our extra cash available in the account to secure this put and this amount will be included in calculating the return. We have now received $412 (net of commission) in new premiums.We have three likely outcomes:If scenario one occurs we will have a gain of 15.1 percent on the total amount committed to the position of $4,795 ($2,795 + $2,000). Here is how it breaks out:Total $725If the second scenario occurs we will be obligated to purchase another 100 shares of JCI and will have brought our total investment per share down to $23.98 ($20 + $27.95)/2. But we also have other cash flows involved. We have an unrealized loss of the stock of $795 (assuming it drops down to the $20 strike price of the put), and offsetting this we still have the premiums of $412 and the dividends of $108. This brings the total loss down to $275, or about -5.7 percent. If the stock price drops to the $20 strike price of our put option it represents a 17.7 percent fall from the current price of $24.31 but only a 5.7 percent loss from our cost basis. We only lose 5.7 percent instead of 17.7 percent. Of course, if the price falls further, we will lose more, but when the stock price rebounds we will also profit more because of our lower cost basis.If the third scenario occurs we will have collected the premiums of $412 and the dividends of $108 for a total return of 10.8 percent. Remember, we make money even if the price goes nowhere and our losses don't become significant until the stock price falls more than 15 percent. This is one of the key elements of the strategy; reducing risk of loss.If the price goes up we win. If the price goes nowhere, we win. If the price drops, we are better off than just holding the stock and collecting dividends. Plus we always have another choice that we can employ in either of the scenarios: we can roll the position and systematically take more of our original investment out while retaining ownership of the stock and collecting the dividends.Here is an example of how that would work. In the case of scenario one where the stock goes up to or above the call strike price, we simply roll the call option out into either a more distant expiration or to a higher strike. Let us assume that the price goes to $32 close to the expiration date and we decide to roll the position because we do not want to have the stock called away. We will have to pay very close to $2.00 premium ($32 - $30 call strike) to buy back the call option we sold originally in order to close out the position. At this point the put will be expiring worthless so we still keep that premium and after we have closed the call position we initiate another strangle with an expiration date in January 2015. We will move both the put and call option strike prices up to maybe $27 and $37, respectively and collect the new premiums. The new premiums should be a little less than what we collected on the original positions because there will be about six months less time built into the premiums. So, we will assume that we can collect closer to $3.50 for the two options. So, we keep the stock, continue to collect the dividends and we collect another $1.50 ($3.50 - $2.00 cost to buy back the call) in option premiums. So, now we have collected a total of $585 in premiums to reduce the cost of our stock from $27.95 to $22.10 ($27.95 - $5.85). Or, at least, that is one way to look at it. Another way to look at it is that we have collected an extra 10.2 percent on the maximum funds needed to make the transaction ($2,795 + $2,700 = $5,495), plus the dividends and any appreciation in the stock price. The appreciation and dividends would amount to an additional $513, or 9.3 percent. Add that to the 10.2 to get a total return of 19.5 percent and it begins to get interesting.If the stock price drops and we decide we really don't want to buy another 100 shares, we can roll the position and take some more of our original investment out by closing out the position (buying back the put and allowing the call to expire worthless) and then selling another set of short put and call at lower strike prices with expirations in 2015. Our preference is to buy the additional shares since we already like them at the current level and will like owning more at the lower level. I love buying things on sale. Don't you? But again, if we roll the position out, we will extract about the same additional premiums that we did when we rolled the position in the earlier example. Let us say that the price goes down to $18.50 and makes a new 52-week low. Now we will buy back the put for about $1.50 per share ($20 strike - $18.50) and the call will expire worthless. We will sell a new set of put and call options with strikes around $15 and $23, respectively. Our average cost, taking into consideration all premiums collected from the earlier positions and the net new premiums we will collect from selling the new options will be near $20, so even if the stock gets called away we make something. But we always hope that the options expire worthless so we can sell some more and keep collecting more premiums and dividends.If the price were to go much lower than $20, we would most likely wait for the stock to rebound some before employing new positions. We prefer to not lock ourselves into a potential loss if the stock is called away unless the fundamentals of the company deteriorate substantially and we decide we no longer want to own the stock. Then we start selling calls closer to the current price with shorter expiration hoping to have the stock called away. In a market crash situation, we tend to average down using this strategy, collecting premiums all the way down and continually lowering our average cost per share. When the market rebounds, as it always has in the past and most likely will in the future, we tend to stick with selling puts on the way back up until the stock regains most of it prior value.I believe that I must include a warning in my articles in this series to make sure that everyone understands that there are risks to every strategy, including this one.First, as has been pointed out in the comment threads to previous articles, there is always the possibility that the selling puts strategy may not result in the purchase of the desired stock in a rapidly rising market. An investor could miss most, if not all, of a run up. It is doubtful that the full run will be missed, however, since the market (including most stocks) correct by ten percent or more usually one or more times per year. For that reason it is likely that the investor will purchase the stock at some point during a bull market, but they still may miss some portion of it (perhaps a large portion, especially in a bounce off a major bottom). On the positive side of this equation is the fact that as most major bottoms occur there is usually a day of capitulation. Capitulation days are generally heavy down days on which, if one has sold puts outstanding, the investor stands a good chance of being put the stock (purchasing at the bottom). There are no promises of that happening, but the odds are better under this strategy than following one's gut emotions. One other thing that helps offset the possible regret of missing a stock at a good price is that the seller of the puts will continue to earn a decent return on their cash (generally 8-10 percent on average) annually while they wait. Granted, that is not as good as hitting a 30 percent gain in a good year, but it sure beats sitting in a money market and earning zip.Second, as has also been pointed out in the comment threads, it is possible to end up buying a stock when the stock market tumbles and having to ride it out to the bottom. If the investor is buying a stock in a company that they want to hold for the long term, at least with this strategy they will never buy at the very top. After all, we're selling puts at below the price when the put option is sold.In addition, the investor has the opportunity to sell calls and, including dividends, receive an average of 8-10 percent in cash payments per year while they wait for the stock to rebound. If we have done our homework in picking a good company at a price that represents a good value, then the likelihood of a rebound is very strong. Practically the only way to end up losing money is by selling the stock. If you hold, you're getting paid well to do so and eventually you'll be back in the money. If the investor had purchased the stock outright at the top of the market and the market fell 50 percent, they would be down 50 percent at the bottom and need the stock to double just to get even. If they are selling calls all the way down, assuming the average length on most bear markets is about 17-19 months, the investor should have collected somewhere in the vicinity of 15 percent along the way, putting them down 25 percent at the bottom. Remember, you bought at ten percent below the top, using puts, so you could not lose the full 50 percent in any event. Now you only need half as much of a rebound to get even.The third scenario is the worst case. If an investor sells a put near the top and ends up with the stock at a 10 percent discount from the high and rides it all the way down to the bottom, collecting dividends and call premiums along the way. Now you are down 25 percent and you end up selling a call that gets exercised near the bottom and the stock is called away. But remember, you are selling calls that will net you about ten percent above the stock price at the time the option is sold; therefore you should be selling at no less than ten percent off the bottom. That would result in a total of a 15 percent loss on the total of your transactions. Now compare that to most alternatives other than picking the tops and bottoms, which no one can do consistently.An alternative to riding a stock down is to use stop loss limit orders. I recommend that investors consider using this strategy to save themselves the pain of riding a stock down during an overall market crash. Some long-term investors with a low cost basis may not want to use this strategy due to the tax consequences.The point is, while this is not the most lucrative strategy, it does bear less risk of loss than most alternatives. By taking most of the emotions out of the decision process, an investor improves their chances of producing consistently higher returns. And that is the whole point. I hope this explanation helps cure some of the over-enthusiasm. This is no get rich quick scheme. It is simply a systematic strategy that can help investors achieve market-beating returns over the long term.As always, we enjoy the comments and will try our best to answer questions if readers will take the time post them.If you are a new reader and are confused about what strategy I keep referring to please see the first article in the series for a primer.

762161,21445,2012-07-30T12:15:22-04:00,,"Tyco International (TYC) is expected to report Q3 earnings before the market open on Tuesday, July 31 with a conference call scheduled for 8:00 am ET. Analysts are looking for EPS of 93c on revenue of $4.54B. The consensus range is 84c-98c for EPS, and $4.39B-$4.68B for revenue, according to First Call. Tyco reported positive Q2 results, beating both EPS and revenue estimates. On its Q2 conference call, the company raises its FY12 adjusted EPS view to $3.65 from prior $3.55-$3.60, consensus $3.65. It also forecast Q3 EPS 92c, consensus 95c, and revenue ""just above"" $4.5B, consensus $4.51B. Q3 operating margin was seen to approach 13%, and Q3 organic revenue growth was expected to be in the low teens. Shortly after Q2 results were released in late April, the shares made a fresh 52-week high of $57.75, but have traded moderately lower over the past three months. Since early October of last year, the stock is up approximately 44%, discounting a wealth of positive news."
765231,24063,2012-07-31T12:25:41-04:00,,"By Matt DoironTyco (TYC)'s stock has risen this year, though over the last few months it has fallen to the point where it is only up 13% for 2012. The company provides a number of security products including security systems (including under the ADT brand), fire detection products, and flow control systems. Late in 2011, the company's board decided that these three business units had little to do with each other and would create more value if they were spun off. The flow control business will merge with Pentair (NYSE:PNR), with Tyco shareholders owning the majority of the combined company. The residential security business will be spun out into a separate company and Tyco will maintain control of the fire detection and suppression business unit.Partly because hedge funds like investing in spinoff situations, Tyco saw a good deal of interest from hedge funds in the first quarter of 2012. Mason Capital Management initiated a position of 3.2 million shares. Iridian Asset Management and York Capital Management both increased their positions by at least 25%, and reported owning 4.8 million and 4.0 million shares respectively. Lee Ainslie's Maverick Capital didn't add any shares, but kept its holdings constant at 6.0 million making it the top 13F holder of the stock. In addition, billionaire Ken Griffin's Citadel Investment Group increased its position in Tyco 71% to 2.2 million shares (see more of Ken Griffin's stock picks). With all these investors adding shares, and yet the stock price not budging since the end of March, current investors are likely getting in at a level where the hedge funds think the stock is a buy.Two insiders have sold stock earlier this year not connected to stock options, at prices between $50 and $55 per share. While it is possible that these senior vice presidents were skeptical of continued rises in the stock price, insiders may sell for many other reasons. The sales related to stock options, too, were likely driven by a desire to hold cash or diversify portfolios.Tyco's 10-Q for the quarter ending in March, which was the second quarter of its fiscal year, showed a rise in both products and services revenue compared to the same period in 2011. This contributed to a small increase in revenue for the first six months of Tyco's fiscal year. Net income was down for the first half of the year earnings per share were down 15%, ignoring the effects of discontinued operations (which contributed positively to earnings last year and very little this year). However, much of this decline was due to separation and restructuring charges as a result of the spin-off decision. The recently released earnings report for Tyco's third quarter beat expectations. Though net income was down from the third quarter of last year, this was again partly due to separation and restructuring costs, which are not likely to recur once the company has split up. The market had a weak positive reaction to the report as the stock opened up about 1%.Tyco's peers include a number of diversified machinery businesses. General Electric (NYSE:GE) trades at similar earnings multiples to Tyco, with a trailing P/E of 18 and a forward P/E of 12 (compared to 18 and 13 for Tyco). Of course, while GE produces a number of machine products it also has a number of other businesses including a large financing arm. Honeywell (NYSE:HON), perhaps a closer peer due to its inclusion of sensing and security products in its portfolio of businesses, has seen good earnings growth recently and is priced for it, trading at 20 times trailing earnings but a similar forward ratio. United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) has earnings ratios in the teens as well. On that basis all four companies appear about level in terms of their pricing relative to their fundamental value; however, these three peers also pay higher dividend yields than Tyco if that is of interest to investors.There's no compelling reason to pick Tyco according to a value, growth, or income thesis. The reasons these hedge funds are getting behind it are the attractive economics and empirical performance of spinoffs. The stock does not seem to be particularly overpriced and once the breakup of the company into three - with one unit merging with Pentair - is complete, management of each piece may be better able to focus on delivering value.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
734981,24627,2012-07-20T02:15:19-04:00,,"Johnson Controls, Inc. (JCI) recently announced results whichdisappointed the market and the stock plunged about 8%. The company reported a profit of 61 cents per share (for the third quarter), which was below analyst estimates of 66 cents per share. It cited soft demand and a falling Euro as some of the reasons for the results and lowered guidance for the fourth quarter.Many recent signs show that the global economy is trending lower. The European debt crisis remains unresolved, growth rates in China are lower, and numerous data points show that the United States could be heading towards a recession as it faces a looming ""Fiscal Cliff"" later this year. There are many issues that are clouding the visibility for investors, but one thing that can and must be looked at before investing, is the current strength of the balance sheet. Companies that have cash-rich balance sheets and little to no debt are positioned to ride out a potential recession and come out in much better shape than companies that carry high debt loads and relatively small cash levels. A balance sheet that might be adequately strong when the economy is growing or even just stable can suddenly look woefully inadequate if sales and profits start to drop and if the economy is in decline.While Johnson Controls is a fine company with good quality products, the stock has not been so fine lately, and it could continue to drop. It does not have the kind of balance sheet strength that many investors want to see in the event of continued economic weakness: The balance sheet shows only about $256 million in cash, and $6.32 billion in debt. Furthermore, Johnson Controls is in a number of economically sensitive businesses which includes automotive, heating, air conditioning, etc., and this is another reason why the balance sheet could become an increasing concern for investors. While the current situation in terms of earnings, and balance sheet is not cause for major alarm, it does warrant caution and it could be enough to keep a lid on the stock at best, and at worst, cause the stock to drift lower if the economy continues to head lower.Although the recent drop in the stock might look tempting for investors to act on, considerable downside risks remain and few major catalysts are visible for a rebound. Johnson Controls has a price to earnings multiple of about 10 times earnings. Since this company is involved in both the auto sector and heating and A/C components industry that relies heavily on new construction, it is not easy to directly compare this company to any other stock in terms of valuation. However, many stocks in the auto and industrial sector trade at just 5 to 8 times earnings. As one example of a supplier to the auto industry, American Axle & Manufacturing (AXL) currently trades at about $10, and has earnings estimates of $1.94 per share for 2012. That is a price to earnings multiple of about 5. That type of PE multiple could take this stock down below $20 per share, if earnings estimates continue to drop. As the global economy continues to drift lower, so could shares of Johnson Controls.Here are some key points for JCI:Current share price: $26.07The 52 week range is $24.29 to $40.39Earnings estimates for 2012: $2.68 per shareEarnings estimates for 2013: $3.22 per shareAnnual dividend: 72 cents which yields 2.6%Data is sourced from Yahoo Finance.

In Johnson Controls' (NYSE:JCI) case, we think the firm is fairly valued at $30, about in line to where it is currently trading.For some background, we think a comprehensive analysis of a firm's discounted cash-flow valuation, relative valuation versus industry peers, as well as an assessment of technical and momentum indicators is the best way to identify the most attractive stocks at the best time to buy. This process culminates in what we call our Valuentum Buying Index (click here for an in-depth presentation about our methodology), which ranks stocks on a scale from 1 to 10, with 10 being the best. Essentially, we're looking for firms that overlap investment methodologies, thereby revealing the greatest interest by investors (we like firms that fall in the center of the diagram below):If a company is undervalued both on a DCF and on a relative valuation basis and is showing improvement in technical and momentum indicators, it scores high on our scale. Johnson Controls posts a VBI score of 3 on our scale, reflecting our 'fairly valued' DCF assessment of the firm, its neutral relative valuation versus peers, and bearish technicals. We compare Johnson Controls to peers BorgWarner (NYSE:BWA), Cooper Tire & Rubber (NYSE:CTB), Magna International (NYSE:MGA), and Tenneco (NYSE:TEN).In the spirit of transparency, we show how the performance of our VBI has stacked up per underlying score:Our Report on Johnson ControlsInvestment ConsiderationsInvestment Highlights• Johnson Controls earns a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT, the highest possible mark on our scale. The firm has been generating economic value for shareholders for the past few years, a track record we view very positively. We expect the firm's return on invested capital (excluding goodwill) to expand to 25.4% from 21.8% during the next two years.• The company looks fairly valued at this time. We expect the firm to trade within our fair value estimate range for the time being. If the firm's share price fell below $21, we'd take a closer look.• Johnson Controls's cash flow generation is below what we'd expect from an average company in our coverage universe, and the firm's financial leverage is somewhat elevated. If cash flows continue to be weak, we'd grow more cautious on the firm's overall financial health.• The firm's share price performance has trailed that of the market during the past quarter. However, it is trading within our fair value estimate range, so we don't view such activity as alarming.• The firm sports a very nice dividend yield of 2.4%. We expect the firm to pay out about 26% of next year's earnings to shareholders as dividends.Business QualityEconomic Profit AnalysisThe best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital (ROIC) with its weighted average cost of capital (OTC:WACC). The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. Johnson Controls's 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 20.1%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 9.8%. As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT. In the chart to the right, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate.Cash Flow AnalysisFirms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. Johnson Controls' free cash flow margin has averaged about 0.8% during the past 3 years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generation is relatively WEAK. The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. For more information on the differences between these two measures, please visit our website at Valuentum.com. At Johnson Controls, cash flow from operations increased about 19% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures expanded about 105% over the same time period.Valuation AnalysisOur discounted cash flow model indicates that Johnson Controls' shares are worth between $21.00 - $39.00 each. The margin of safety around our fair value estimate is driven by the firm's MEDIUM ValueRisk™ rating, which is derived from the historical volatility of key valuation drivers. The estimated fair value of $30 per share represents a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 12.7 times last year's earnings and an implied EV/EBITDA multiple of about 9.8 times last year's EBITDA. Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 5% during the next five years, a pace that is higher than the firm's 3-year historical compound annual growth rate of 2.4%. Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 5.9%, which is above Johnson Controls' trailing 3-year average. Beyond year 5, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 2.9% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For Johnson Controls, we use a 9.8% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows.Margin of Safety AnalysisOur discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $30 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future was known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values. Our ValueRisk™ rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock. In the graph above, we show this probable range of fair values for Johnson Controls. We think the firm is attractive below $21 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $39 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion.We strive to answer a few questions that investors often ask: 1) What are the chances of a total loss of investment in this company? and 2) What is the chance that the company is really worth twice what I paid for it? The probability (fair value < 0) strives to answer the first question. It indicates the chance that the firm may encounter insolvency based on the characteristics of its cash flow stream, capital structure, and risk profile. The probability (fair value > 2x current share price) strives to answer the second question. It is our best estimate of whether investors are participating in a half-off sale by buying the company's shares at current prices.Future Path of Fair ValueWe estimate Johnson Controls' fair value at this point in time to be about $30 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart to the right compares the firm's current share price with the path of Johnson Controls' expected equity value per share over thenext three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate. The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year 3 represents our best estimate of the value of the firm's shares three years hence. This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the firm's future cashflow potential change. The expected fair value of $38 per share in Year 3 represents our existing fair value per share of $30 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.Pro Forma Financial StatementsDisclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
689571,29191,2012-06-28T05:51:13-04:00,,"Earlier this week, I wrote an article about Illinois Tool Works (NYSE:ITW), the diversified industrial powerhouse. In it, I found that while the company and the stock will (eventually) do fine, there are other companies that are comparable and that could provide more upside when the climate gets more positive. Those seemed like companies worth looking into as potential switches in the industrial space.The first of those was Johnson Controls Inc. (NYSE:JCI). The company has produced a pair of shaky quarters to start its fiscal year 2012 (which runs October 2011-September 2012, a quarter ahead of the calendar year), and the stock has suffered as a result. In fact, Johnson has underperformed its sector despite the sector struggling as a whole. This underperformance doesn't exactly exaggerate Johnson's rough patch, but instead places the burden strongly on the company to prove it can achieve results. As such, we might be a quarter or two away from a safe entry point for owning the stock. Still, there is intriguing upside here if the company can put it together.JCI data by YChartsJohnson Controls is a Milwaukee-based industrial company with a market cap of over $18 billion. The company has three main divisions: Building Efficiency, Power Solutions, and Auto Experience. The auto business makes up about half of the company, with the building efficiency and power solutions units providing 1/3 and 1/6 of the business, roughly (based on 2011 figures for sales). The company splits its sales about evenly between North America, Europe, and the rest of the world, with the last having the least weight.Johnson's auto business is the strongest as well as the largest for the firm. The company makes, ""seating, overhead systems, door and instrument panels, and interior electronics."" The segment has grown sales over 11% so far in FY 2012. Income in the segment has trailed that due to recent integration costs related to the acquisition of a metals company. Still, considering the current robust nature of the auto industry in the U.S. and the record-high average age of cars on U.S. roads, Johnson Controls seems to be well-positioned for a demand cycle that should persist. Even in Europe, Johnson had an increase in sales in the last quarter, though partially fueled by an acquisition.The power solutions unit is a slower growing but higher margin one for Johnson. Power solutions as a segment is also tied to autos: this is essentially Johnson's automotive battery unit. The company produces both lead-acid (i.e. traditional) batteries and, ""advanced batteries for Start-Stop, hybrid and electric vehicles."" While this business is again levered to the auto industry, it underperformed last quarter mostly due to mild weather, which prevented aftermarket customers from restocking fully. Presumably, restocking and replenishing of inventories will have to happen sooner or later, and CEO Stephen Roell suggested that this could lead to upside in the summer.The building efficiency unit has been the biggest drag on the company's performance this year, increasing sales only about 3% while seeing a slight decrease in income in the segment. Johnson's business here is to provide, ""equipment, controls and services for heating, ventilating, air-conditioning, refrigeration and security systems."" This makes Johnson a major green industrial company, and the company boasts of its renewable energy projects and contribution to large savings of carbon dioxide emissions. This is the sort of secular trend (see Johnson's work on the Empire State Building) that will eventually win out over temporary market currents but, in an uncertain period, suffer as companies and builders seek to cut costs. The company's performance and confidence in this sector became a bone of contention in the most recent conference call, more on which below.For a large cap industrial company, Johnson has a lot of positive ""soft"" values that can make investors feel warm and fuzzy about owning the stock. While these are not values one can bank on, they are encouraging nevertheless. The company boasts of being an annual nominee to the Ethisphere magazine's list of most ethical companies in the world and to Corporate Responsibility magazine's ""Best Corporate Citizens"" list, as well as a number of other awards. Most valuable to investors may be the company's moniker as, ""one of Institutional Investor magazine's most shareholder-friendly companies in America.""Some of the other values translate into opportunity, however. As mentioned, the company is a green company, and behind that comes a spirit of innovation. The start-stop batteries, for example: when a car using one of these batteries comes to a stop, the battery stops powering the engine, and as soon as the driver either puts the shift into first gear or touches his/her foot to the gas pedal, the battery kicks the engine back on. These batteries can be used in all cars and not just hybrids, and the technology is not only feasible but totally non-intrusive once one gets used to it (I speak from the experience of renting a Toyota (NYSE:TM) Yaris equipped with said battery; if I, a terrible driver, could manage to use the car fine, anybody can). Not all of Johnson's investments in this area have paid off, but this is a growing market: Pike Research projects a CAGR of 32% for the use of stop-start batteries over the course of the decade.While Johnson has visibility for growth in the longer term, it has struggled in 2012. The company took a big hit in both stock price and reputation after its first quarter report, in which the company missed estimates slightly and lowered guidance by 5% for the year. The second quarter was an improvement in so much as the company kept guidance steady and hit the midpoint of its quarterly aim, but the forecast for the 2nd half of the year featured a back-loaded guidance, with Q4 expected to be stronger than Q3. This raised questions among analysts about whether the company could deliver, with questions around the company's confidence in its building efficiency business especially sharp. Considering the company initially guided to hit 9 to 11% sales growth in that segment and has only done about 3% so far this year, the questions are warranted. It should be mentioned that analysts as a whole are bullish on the company, suggesting that the valuation and positioning of the company in strong markets are undeniable.Speaking of valuation, here's a chart comparing Johnson to Illinois Tool Works, but also more auto-parts-centric companies, including BorgWarner (NYSE:BWA), Magna International (NYSE:MGA), Dana Holding (NYSE:DAN), and Genuine Parts Company (NYSE:GPC):(Sources: TDAmeritrade, WSJ)(Note: JCI's fiscal year ends in September; EPS growth for JCI and MGA are for one year only)As a whole, this sector has been battered. It could be due to the idea that people who have postponed their car purchases during the recession have already bought replacements, or that the new cars have already been built and the gains already factored in. There are also the omnipresent European fears and general macro concerns that weigh down cyclical stock prices like these.That creates a longer term opportunity for investors for when the stocks rise to more average multiples. And amongst this group, Johnson presents the most attractive mix of growth (only BorgWarner has higher forecast growth and only Dana a lower PEG ratio), valuation (cheaper than all but Dana and Magna), and income. Johnson has raised the dividend twice since the 2008-09 crisis and is due to make it three years in a row in the second half of the year. The payout ratio sits at 30% of last year's earnings and 26.5% of this year's projected earnings, suggesting it has room to rise.This chart also helps crystallize the exaggerated, often supercilious emphasis placed on pegging companies stiffly to quarterly numbers. Johnson missed Q1 and lowered guidance for the year and it is important to hit one's own targets for credibility's sake. Both statements are true. But if Johnson hits the low end of guidance, which would be $2.7/share, the company would still achieve 11% earnings growth year over year. That is perfectly decent for a cyclical company in a difficult environment.That said, analysts' opinion holds weight, and it is fair to hold JCI management's collective feet to the fire to see if the company can hit the second-half targets for FY 2012. Until JCI produces a solid quarter - at least hitting the guidance it laid out in the Q2 conference call (an implied $.67/share) and maintaining the strong growth guidance for Q4 - the stock is going to be both vulnerable to general market fears and cyclical shocks and to the negative sentiment swirling around the analyst community.Johnson's positioning in interesting and secular markets and long-term track record imply that this is an investment that should pay off in the 2-4 year range and over longer periods. With good performance and a tiny bit of brightening in the overall economic picture, the company could regain 12x earnings multiples, which on next year's earnings would be about 40/share, a 50% increase from current levels. 12x forwards earnings is hardly an unattainable multiple: the stock traded at about 14x forwards earnings in 2006, for example.But at this point, the stock may not have yet hit bottom. This is a case where I would rather wait and buy the stock on the way up, after a strong quarter. There is a lot of room for Johnson to run once it gets its operating engine back to full force. Unlike cars powered by its stop-start batteries, however, Johnson's overall business hasn't turned on with a mere touch of the gas pedal. The company should iron out the bumps in its performance; it's just a matter of waiting to see when it happens.Disclosure: I am long ITW."
584501,24866,2012-05-13T05:48:22-04:00,,"Given concerns about a double dip, many investors are looking to diversify their portfolios. Conglomerates provide an ideal way to spread out capital through various sectors and industries. Even still, they often come with significant volatility depending on what sectors they are invested in. General Electric (NYSE:GE), for example, has largely become a financial (and is even categorized as one on Google Finance). Accordingly, it has a high beta of 1.6. By contrast, 3M (NYSE:MMM) is invested in stable sectors, like healthcare, protection services, and fixtures, and, accordingly, has a low beta of 0.9. Tyco International (TYC) falls between these two conglomerates in terms of liquidity and focuses on electronic security, fire protection, and control systems.In this article, I will run you through my DCF model on Tyco and then triangulate the result with a review of the fundamentals against 3M and GE. I find that GE is the most undervalued of the three.First, let's begin with an assumption about the top-line. Tyco finished FY2011 with $17.4B in revenue, which represented a 2% gain off of the preceding year: acceleration. I model 11.8% per annum growth over the next half decade or so.Moving onto the cost-side of the equation, there are several items to consider: operating expenses, capital expenditures, and taxes. I model cost of goods sold as 62% of revenue versus 27% for SG&A and 7.5% for capex. Taxes are estimated at 27% of adjusted EBIT (ie. excluding non-cash depreciation charges to keep this a pure operating model.)We then need to subtract out net increases in working capital to get free cash flow. I model this metric hovering around -3.5% of revenue over the explicitly projected time period.Taking a perpetual growth rate of 2.5% and discounting backwards by a WACC of 10%, I find a fair value figure of $40.91 for 26% downside to the close of trading on May 11, 2012. My model also calculates around $2B worth of free cash flow by 2017, which means the current price-to-2017 free cash flow multiple is 12.7x. This makes the stock fairly expensive. Nevertheless, the stock continues to be appreciate on the Street. According to NASDAQ, it is rated near a ""strong buy"". Here's why...All of this falls within the context of solid operating performance:From an earnings multiples perspective, Tyco appears more undervalued than what my DCF model suggests. It trades at a respective 18.2x and 13.2x past and forward earnings. Corresponding figures are 15.6x and 10.8x for GE and 14.3x and 12.4x for 3M.Consensus estimates forecast GE's EPS growing by 13.1% to $1.55 in 2012 and then by 13.5% and 18.2% in the following two years. Assuming a multiple of 14x and a conservative 2013 EPS of $1.73, the stock would hit $24.22 for 21.6% upside. GE is led by terrific management, but carries more risk than what a cursory analysis suggests. GE Capital continues to represent a sizable portion of business and carries systemic risk from capital market volatility. This risk will enable higher returns as execution undermines bearish fears.Consensus estimates forecast 3M's EPS growing by 7.4% to $6.40 in 2012 and then by 9.1% and 8.5% in the following two years. Of the last 13 revisions to EPS, all have gone up for a net change of 1.3%. According to NASDAQ, the stock is rated around a ""hold"". Assuming a multiple of 14x and a conservative 2013 EPS of $6.95, the stock would hit $97.30 for 12.2% upside.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
712571,29461,2012-07-10T14:23:37-04:00,,"Johnson Controls Inc (JCI) was doing well before 2009 when a crash in the economy also led to a sudden drop in revenues, and the firm could not adjust fixed costs accordingly, leading to the only year in the company's 21-year history when earnings fell. However, the firm pounced back with a totally restructured firm, canceling several joint ventures, like the partnership with Saft (to make lithium ion batteries), and building new strategic partnerships like a joint venture agreement with Pricol Limited in India to manufacture components for cars and motorcycle suppliers. The firm's current policy is to penetrate and dominate in emerging markets.Even though margins are lower, still the firm is likely to experience increased earnings in the future due to its diverse operations. Its power solution segment is likely to bring a fortune, given that the Automotive Industry shifts to alternative sources of fuel. With a forward P/E of just 8x, JCI's shares present an opportunity to buy a high growth and innovative company at cheap valuations.Following is a deeper look into the three divisions of the firm:BUILDING EFFICIENCYThe company operates in more than 125 countries. With over 650 branch offices and 3,600 distribution partners around the world, the firm makes almost 30% of its total revenues from this division. The company forecasts a growth in this segment due to the following factors:The pie chart shows the situation graphically.It is worthwhile to say that JCI is in a position to benefit from this situation only because of its presence in these areas.In this segment, the firm has developed an integrated system software by the name of Panoptix. This global ERP system helps the firm understand the building dynamics in which their customers live. Using that knowledge, accompanied with their expertise, the firm suggests energy conservation methods. This software has helped the firm reduce operating costs by 9%. This software has given the firm a competitive advantage in this field, and has made the process of interacting with the customer a lot easier.The segment is expected to grow 9-11% in this year and 10-15% annually till 2016.Automotive Experience (AE)AE is the biggest segment of the firm, and accounts for more than 50% of the firm's revenue. The firm has used the concept of vertical integration to increase its technological expertise and presence in emerging markets, which is considered to offer a promising future.The chart shows that the major chunk of AE's sales come from Europe. The sales for this year have improved by 7% from $5.2 billion to $5.6 billion quarter-to-quarter. The reasons for this rise are:However, the following factors also negatively affected revenues:In forecasting future earnings from this segment, the following factors need to be considered:We can safely say that as long as the vehicles are being produced in the world, AE will keep making business.The firm is very enthusiastic about its future in automotive interiors. The company claims that it enjoys the competitive advantage in this segment, since it focuses on the latest technology in interiors, and is working to implement them with the help of joint ventures with automobile OEMs. It has projected a global market of over $300 billion in 2017-18. It is also hopeful of cashing in from a big emerging market in China. The following graph was taken from its presentation in 2011. CHINA'S SALES FORECASTPower SolutionsThis division of the firm, even though it generates the least amount of revenues as compared to the other two, has the greatest potential to boost the firm's sales and profitability in the future, given the gradual change in the Automotive Industry and the increasing penetration of hybrid and electric cars in the global automotive market, especially in the U.S.With 30 manufacturing facilities and 13,000 employees, JCI calls itself to be the largest provider of battery solutions to vehicle original equipment and the aftermarket. By aftermarket, we mean warranty supports and after-sales services.JCI has predicted the evolution of energy usage in the following manner:With the production of lead-acid batteries, the firm has also focused on production of energy efficient solutions. The recent introduction of the Absorbed Glass Mat (AGM) battery type is a fine example of this practice. This battery, that gives 15% gain in fuel efficiency, uses a start-stop technology, in which the engine automatically turns off when the car is idling.It is imperative to say that because of a global presence in all of its three divisions, and its diversified operations in the field of automotive and energy conservation, the firm does not seem to be in trouble in the future, despite the current economic downturn.ValuationsWith a forward multiple of 8x and earnings growth rate of 18%, the expected EPS and market price are given in the table below. These estimates seem plausible given the steady growth of the firm. However, the firm is actively trying to penetrate emerging markets. This can lead to increased revenues in the future. Also, the firm's power solutions business needs to be closely watched as the economy slowly moves towards alternative sources of fuel in light of the hike in oil and gas prices.The earnings announcement a week later will clarify further the firm's future intentions regarding its power solution business.The table given below compares JCI with one of its competitors, Magna International Inc (MGA). MGA is a global automotive supplier. The firm designs, manufactures and assembles automotive components into complete vehicles in order to sell them to OEMs of vehicles. Major divisions of MGA are automotive interiors and lithium-ion batteries against which JCI competes.Even though the operations of JCI are much diversified than that of MGA, yet the financials show us that JCI is doing better. Also, the firm has no debt-related issues and the operating cash flow is positive. The stock also offers a dividend yield of 2.7%. We recommend buying the shares of JCI.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
834091,34221,2012-08-28T18:14:27-04:00,,"by Chris MartinIt's been a very busy year for Switzerland-based Tyco International (TYC). The multinational conglomerate has a diversified product line that ranges from fire protection equipment to valves and controls to home security system products and services. Investors like what they've seen from Tyco in recent months - but what is in store for the firm in the future?The answer to that question is somewhat muddled after Tyco posted third-quarter results that were decidedly mixed. On July 31, the company reported a profit of $242 million for the period, which was 33% lower than the year-earlier quarter. But Tyco's earnings per share and revenue numbers were higher than many analysts' expectations. The corporation's per-share adjusted net income figure was $1.01, or 8% higher than what experts had predicted. Tyco also pulled in $4.46 billion (up 3.9% from a year ago) in revenue for Q3, or about $250 million more than was estimated.Tyco has been under scrutiny by investors since it announced in March that it was spinning off its pipes and valves division into another company that would merge with filter and pump manufacturer Pentair. Tyco officials believed that the conglomerate would be valued higher as two separate companies, so they initiated the merger (which still has to be approved by shareholders). In the third quarter, Tyco recorded $61 million in separation costs. Ed Breen, the CEO of Tyco, told shareholders after the earnings announcement that the deal is expected to be completed by the end of September.However, many people in the industry are not bullish on Tyco's fourth-quarter earnings. At the end of the second quarter, analysts predicted Tyco's Q4 earnings per share to be around $1.07, but that figure has slipped to $1.04 after the recent earnings announcement. But Breen remains optimistic, saying earlier this month that Tyco plans to ""focus on growth, cost management, and productivity initiatives aimed at expanding our operating margins.""Another factor in Tyco's outlook may be its recent strong showing in the stock market. The price of Tyco stock (which trades on the Nasdaq) has risen about 41% over the last year to $58.47 going into the final week of August. That's a figure above which Dividend.com is saying that the stock would experience ""overhead resistance"" in the near future. This analysis, combined with continued merger-related uncertainty, may lead some observers to believe that Tyco stock may have reached its near-term peak.Therefore, investors may not want to seek out the Tyco International stock to add to their portfolio anytime soon. While it's not unwise to hold onto the stock for the long-term, investors who are looking to boost their portfolio liquidity may want to consider selling a portion of their current holdings in Tyco. It's quite possible that Tyco's merger will proceed smoothly and the corporation may indeed see the cost savings that they are predicting. But those positive outcomes may not become apparent for a few quarters at least - and with a U.S. presidential election occurring in the meantime, the uncertainty surrounding changes to the economy in 2013 and beyond may affect Tyco's results in ways that are hard to predict. In short, investors probably shouldn't make any significant effort to buy Tyco stock now - but if they already own shares, it's not a bad idea to hang onto them for awhile to see what happens to the company over the next twelve months or so.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

And not long after that the conglomerate he expanded into a global empire will wink out of existence, its rump spun off into three separate companies that, with some luck, might become someone else’s trophies.It’s taken a decade to undo the handiwork of Kozlo and his predecessors, and so far only the shareholders of medical products maker Covidien (COV), spun off in 2007, have had much to show for the effort. But Tyco has done better lately, its shares nearly tripling off the 2009 bear-market low and surging 30% since early October.And investors are now in line for further gains, because the final three-way split, due to be completed by year’s end, involves profitable, attractive businesses. They’re not exactly fast-growing—Tyco’s most recent quarter featured a 4% revenue gain.But the growth is starting to pick up a bit, and the home alarm, corporate fire protection and flow control divisions are already very reliable producers of cash flow. Released from the Tyco umbrella, they will all have a better chance to be acquired.Take ADT Alarms, the North American home and small-business security business that will account for some 18% of Tyco’s revenue at spinoff. It’s the leading home-security brand with 25% market share in the US and Canada, and is growing at 4% annually by adding customers to its 6 million base and squeezing more from each account each year.In Monday’s upgrade of Tyco from Neutral to Outperform, Credit Suisse notes that the market seems to be valuing ADT’s mostly subscription based revenue at 4.1 times cash flow, versus 6.7 times for cable companies. Closing that valuation gap after the spinoff would be worth roughly $8 a share, according to the analyst, who raised his price target on the shares to $60.Others expect the spinoff to unlock even more value. At the time the plan was announced last fall, Bloomberg News pegged the sum-of-parts value at $64 a share, based on the analyst estimates it monitors, and quoted one investment manager aiming for $70.ADT isn’t even the jewel in Tyco’s crown. That would be the flow-control business, which includes industrial valves, thermal controls, and water transport. This unit accounted for roughly 21% of Tyco’s revenue last year... and a lot more of its growth.In the most recent quarter, the division posted revenue growth of 12% and a 16% year-over-year jump in orders. The booming energy industry accounts for 40% of sales, with miners contributing a smaller chunk. Asia-Pacific brings in 40% of the revenue.The fire-protection business, which will be merged with the commercial-security assets at spinoff, isn’t as fast growing as valves or as lucrative as home alarms, but like those units, has demonstrated incremental bottom-line improvement.Tyco’s shares suffered a spell of profit taking after the solid January 31 earnings report, but have since made up all of the lost ground, and are now challenging last spring’s four-year highs.Longtime investors badly hurt by Kozlowski’s megalomania will profit from Tyco’s demise. They might even make enough for a holiday in Sardinia."

His portfolio typically doesn't contain any non-equity positions.In Q3, Ainslie's top 2 positions were Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and Apolo (NASDAQ:APOL) and he added 2 new positions to his top 25 [Ambev (ABV) and US Bancorp (NYSE:USB)].In Q4, QCOM was reduced by 62% (making it the 24th largest position now) and Tyco (TYC) shares were increased 115% (after a 3 quarter hiatus) making that the largest position currently.Tyco is a stock that Ainslie knows well and is not afraid to come back to (TYC is also a held by Glenview, Iridian, SAC, Eminence, OZ Capital, Empyrean and Geode). Until Q3 2010, TYC was a consistent position in the portfolio but not a large one (only reaching the top 10 in Q2 at 3% of long equities). Ainslie apparently got sick of waiting for value to be realized and closed the position in Q3 2010, just before the stock had a meaningful rally.

737271,22130,2012-07-20T17:36:15-04:00,,"Johnson Controls (JCI) was pummeled after missing on fiscal third quarter earnings and reducing guidance. Shares closed Thursday at 26.07, down 8%. For investors who take a long term view, the shares are now attractively priced.OverviewThe company describes itself (in press releases) as follows:Two of the three sectors are automotive: the third is building related (HVAC). Approximately 25% of sales are automotive interiors in Europe. While the cyclical businesses and European exposure are of some concern in the present macro environment, I regard the company as high quality, and desirable as a long term holding.ValuationUsing estimates of $2.58 for 2013, and $2.56 for 2012, projected 5 year average EPS works out to $1.82 per share, influenced by a 61 cent loss in 2009 during the financial crisis. The company's midpoint multiple on that metric is 17.3, suggesting a target of $32 per share.2009 is still visible in the rear view mirror, and visibility for 2013 is clouded by uncertainty. With long term growth in the 5% area, a multiple of 15 X $2.58 calls for $39 per share.Assuming two years to hit the average of the two indications, annualized returns would be 19%, including the dividend, currently yielding 2.76%.DividendsJohnson Controls has paid increasing dividends for many years. The company held them steady in 2009 and 2010: otherwise the trend has been for an annual increase. WIth a payout ratio of 28%, and strong cash flow, the dividend is secure. It yields 2.76% at a recent price of $26.07.PensionsJohnson Controls will be revising its pension accounting to reflect mark-to-market valuations as of the end of the fiscal year. From the F3Q 2012 earnings conference call:Cash DeploymentIn addition to the $1.5 billion in discretionary pension contributions mentioned above, the company during 2011 devoted $1.2 billion to acquisitions and $1.3 billion to capex. For 9 months of 2012, another $1.4 billion has been devoted to capex.The size and timing of these investments is indicative of the strength of the company, and the skill of management. The automotive industry was under extreme pressure during the financial crisis. Coming out of that, the company was able to participate in the consolidation process and position itself to take advantage of the inevitable rebound, which has been developing favorably in North America.Free cash flow will improve going forward, based on reduced capex.Lead BatteriesResults for the fiscal third quarter were hurt by the increased cost of buying lead battery cores as feedstock for a new smelter that is going on line soon.This is a temporary situation, brought about by a mild winter last year, which reduced demand for replacement batteries, and with that, the supply of cores for recycling.The current heat wave is expected to stress batteries, resulting in a return to normal patterns and pricing during the current quarter.ReservationsThe company faces headwinds and uncertainties arising from the slowdown in Europe, as well as fiscal and monetary policy in the US. The usual analyst day has been delayed from October this year, to allow the company time to assess the political environment and the possible decrease in GDP associated with the fiscal cliff.Management expects to do some restructuring during the coming quarter, which will result in charges.Presumably contingency plans will be in place in the event our politicians do something remarkably stupid. As an investor, the only comfort available is that management is prepared to act decisively to limit losses in the event of a politically induced economic slowdown.A Long-term View on the Automotive IndustryThere is considerable pent up demand for new automobiles, due to the aging of the American private passenger fleet. I discussed the issue at some length in an article on consumer deleveraging, and without going into details here, I'm bullish on automotive stocks, particularly large, high quality suppliers such as JCI or Magna International (MGA).Strategy and TacticsAs discussed above, buying at today's prices, the investor has a reasonable expectation of receiving a steady flow of dividend income, with eventual share price appreciation.As a general rule, the effects of an earnings miss stay in force until the next earnings report. Restructuring charges when the coming quarter is reported could result in a poor headline number and another leg down. Macro events may depress economic performance and stock prices.Putting this through the blender, I'm planning to initiate a starter position during the coming quarter, with the idea of accumulating, monitoring and adding as the situation develops.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in JCI over the next 72 hours."

It is a leading global manufacturer of flow control systems for the oil and gas, water, mining, power, process and construction industries. It is also a global leader in electronic security products and services, protecting about 9 million commercial, government and residential customers. ADT is one of its famous brands. Tyco also has a fire protection arm that provides fire detection and protection products and services to customers in more than 60 countries.Tyco looks undervalued with a forward PE ratio of 11.92, a PEG ratio of 1.04, and a price-to-book ratio of only 1.61. Now looks like a great time to get in on this undervalued stock for long-term growth.The company has a profit margin of 8.19%, an operating margin of 12.04%, and earnings per share of $2.97. Tyco brings in $2.53 billion in operating cash flow and $710.5 million in levered free cash flow. It has a solid balance sheet with total cash of $1.01 billion, total debt of $4.17 billion, and a current ratio of 1.54.Tyco has exceeded earnings estimates in its last four quarters and has 12 upward earnings revisions for 2012 and six for 2013. It is expected to grow earnings annually at 13.05% for the next five years. This is solid growth that should give it an edge over the market's performance. The company also pays a 2% dividend, so investors can expect a total annual yield of about 15% when accounting for the earnings growth.Eighty percent of Tyco's revenue comes from outside the United States. Thirty percent of its revenue is derived from emerging markets, which includes China, India, Latin America, and the Middle East.Flow ControlThe valves and controls portion of its business accounts for 60% of its revenue. Tyco differentiates itself from the thousands of other valve manufacturers by producing highly engineered valves, actuators and controls for use in the most demanding environments. These demanding environments include: high pressure, high temperature, and mission critical applications. In other words, Tyco's brands are considered market leaders with strong reputations in its various industries.The company expects to receive orders in the $50 million to $100 million range through the remainder of fiscal 2012. It plans for these projects to be shipped in the second half of 2012 and throughout 2013.Security Solutions & Fire ProtectionNorth America residential and small business accounts for 90% of its security and fire segment revenue. Tyco's security segment protects 7 million homes, 50 of the top U.S. banks, 300 international airports, and 80% of the top 100 retailers throughout the world.CFO Frank Sklarsky said that the company is continuing to focus on growing service revenue and to drive new product innovation in the fire portion of the business. Tyco is in the process of completing acquisitions that will expand its customer base in growth markets such as China, Korea, and the Middle East. These acquisitions are expected to account for $75 million of revenue in the second quarter.ConclusionWith the Dennis Kozlowski scandal far in the past and the 2008 financial crisis behind us, it looks like Tyco is heading toward a new positive horizon. If new acquisitions are done strategically and intelligently, the company can grow earnings with an edge above the market.It has been beating the performance of the S&P 500 (NYSEARCA:SPY) since about the middle of September 2011 and looks to be rising steadily. The recent sell-off in Tyco's stock since the beginning of February 2012 has placed it in oversold territory. I would consider this a good time to start a position in the stock for the long term.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
377001,24866,2012-02-19T07:05:11-05:00,,"By their very nature, conglomerates are often hard for investors to value. The trend in the activist investing space has rightfully been towards breaking up firms into relevant pieces. I proposed this for 3M (NYSE:MMM) here while Tyco (TYC) progresses to breaking up into three publicly-traded companies. Based on my review of the fundamentals, DCF model and multiples analysis, I find that the two have reasonable room for appreciation.From am multiples perspective, 3M is the cheaper of the two. It trades at a respective 14.7x and 12.7x past and forward earnings, while Tyco trades at a respective 16.5x and 11.9x past and forward earnings. To put this into perspective, consider that both firms are roughly valued at their 2 Digit MG Group average PE multiple. The Street currently rates Tyco a ""buy"" versus a ""hold"" for 3M.At the first quarter earnings call, Tyco's management noted solid performance:First quarter results were strong, with EPS of $0.84 solidly beating expectations by 6.3%. Order momentum has improved, gaining 8% y-o-y as revenue grew by 4% organically. Security Solutions, Fire Protection and Flow Protection are well-positioned, moreover, for further organic growth. The company is relatively safe, given how much of the cash flow is recurring. Splitting into three publicly-traded companies will help shed light on this strength by improving transparency. The breakup will be completed by 2012's end.Consensus estimates for Tyco's EPS forecast is that it will grow by 12.3% to $3.64 in 2012, and then by 13.5% and 12.1% in the following two years. Modeling a 3-year CAGR of 12.6% for EPS and then discounting backwards by a WACC of 9% yields a fair value figure of $58.77, implying 19.8% upside.3M, similarly, had a strong close to the year with record sales and production adjustments in consumer electronics. Fourth quarter earnings per share beat consensus by 3%. Display & Graphics still has a significant degree of certainty due to shaky demand for optical systems. Despite generally strong top-line momentum across the board, ROIC is only expected to increase nominally over the next two years, limiting value creation.Consensus estimates for 3M's EPS forecast is that it will grow by 5.5% to $6.29 in 2012, and then by 9.7% and 9.6% in the following two years. Assuming a multiple of 14.5x and a conservative 2013 EPS of $6.84, the rough intrinsic value of the stock is $99.18, implying 13.2% upside.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

316543,22742,2011-12-29T11:52:36-05:00,,"By Mark Bern, CPA CFAJohnson Controls (NYSE:JCI) was elusive in our first attempt to purchase the stock through the use of our strategy.  Those who read my first article on JCI (here) will recall that we picked up an $111 profit in just over a month without buying the stock.  That amounted to an annualized return (calculated by a method explained in the initial article of the series which is linked in the next paragraph) of 23%.  If that sort of return is of interest, please read on to understand how we achieved it and how I intend to achieve more of the same on JCI in the next few months.Let me begin by pointing to a detailed explanation of the strategy that can be found in my original article that I used to initiate this series (here). As you will see in the conclusion of this article, you may be able to collect in excess of 9% annually in cash while holding Johnson Controls. You may also get paid 8% to 10% on cash in your account while you wait for a better price.  If you find the returns mentioned in this article intriguing, I suggest that you take the time to understand the full strategy by reading that prior article.I should point out that I make use of options, but in a very conservative fashion.  Approximately 83% of all options contracts expire worthless.  That is why I do not recommend, as part of this strategy, to buy options.  I only sell options myself because that is the side of the contract that wins 83% of the time.  I like the odds to be in my favor. But I also don’t sell options just because of the odds, I do so with a purpose: To buy great stocks with rising dividends at a discount and to collect extra cash income while I hold those same stocks long-term.  My objective is to create at least 8% per year in cash payments from a combination of dividends and option premiums each year in addition to the long-term appreciation that quality stocks provide.  I believe that a 15% total return is achievable and that is what I intend to demonstrate over the next two years with this series.  I should also remind readers to never, ever sell put options on a stock that you don’t really want to own.  If it’s a stock that you would buy anyway, great; otherwise don’t fool with it.On October 6, 2011, the price of JCI stock was $28.96.  We sold one November put option on JCI with a strike price of $25 that paid us a premium of $1.20 per share (one contract equals 100 shares) or $111 net after the $9 commission.  If the price had dropped below the strike price of $25 and stayed there through the November 18 expiration date, we would have been obligated to buy 100 shares of JCI at $25.  But since we sold the put option and collected a premium of $1.20 we would have had a cost basis of $ 23.80 ($25-$1.20).  Since the stock held up and the put expired worthless we got to keep the premium for a return on the cash we held as security in our account ($2,500) of 3.8% in just over on month.  We earned an annualized rate of return of 23% (to understand how I calculated the annualized return please refer to the initial article for a detailed explanation.  It is actually a very conservative method). But now we still have the cash in our account and it’s time to sell another put.  My favorite put option for JCI right now is the April 2012 $30 strike price put with a premium of $2.30.  If put the stock we would be obligated to purchase 100 shares of JCI stock at $30 per share but would end up with a cost basis of $27.70 ($30 - $2.30).  I like that price much better than the current price of $30.65 (all premiums and prices as of the close on December 28, 2011).  If the option expires worthless we keep the $2.30 less the commission of $9 for a return of nearly 7.4% over less than four months.  That works out to an annualized return of 22.1%.  I don’t mind not getting the stock as long as I can make over 20% on cash sitting in my account. There were two other options with shorter durations that would have provided similar annualized returns.  The reason I didn’t select one of them is that I try to balance my decision between two primary factors, return and discount.  This expiration offered enough of a discount incentive for me to choose it over the others.  Of course, I also consider the cost of commissions or friction of the trading as well.  If I can make the same rate of return for four months as I can over two months I prefer to lock it in over the four months because there is more certainty to maintaining the rate of return longer and less commission cost involved.  I also prefer to buy multiple contracts when possible, but the restraints I have placed upon the portfolio combined with the diversification needs do not allow me to buy more than one in this instance.I hope readers are enjoying the series and that you are just as interested to see how this experiment all turns out over the next two years.  One last caution and I already said this once in this article before but I feel it is important enough to repeat.  Unless you really, really want to own a stock don’t sell puts on it.  Selling puts on stocks because of the premiums available only is the worst way to make a decision and usually ends up losing money.  I use stocks in my strategy that I like and want to own for the long term. I wish you all a healthy and prosperous New Year.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

The company announced growth in earnings and profits, but the numbers fell a little below the estimate consensus. The average estimated earnings on the company was 62 cents per share whereas the company's reported number was 60 cents per share. The company's revenue was 10.42 billion dollars, whereas the estimate was 10.51 billion dollars. The company posted nearly 10% of revenue and profit growth. The company's current revenue and profit numbers are at an all-time high. On the negative side, the company said that its earnings in the next quarter may not grow as fast as this quarter because of the effects of the Japan earthquake on the Japanese car industry. Today the share price was down by 8% the last time I checked. At the moment, the company is growing strongly, and I don't think that the fact that company missed the estimates by 2 cents justifies it losing 8% in market value. It's still a solid company posting solid growth. The company is clearly oversold due to panic. We know that whenever a company fails to beat earnings estimates, its stock price will always plunge in the short term. It even happened to solid companies like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG). I expect JSI to bounce back up in the near term as the share plunge is not justified at all. Keep in mind that car industry is experiencing its golden age as we speak. Most car companies are posting great profit growth in the near and long term and the trend looks very favorable. For example Ford (NYSE:F) and GM (NYSE:GM) are posting record profits as we speak. The effects of the Japanese earthquake are already fading and I don't see a downside with the company anytime soon. This is what the CEO of the company said today: ""While there are some short-term changes to our original 2012 expectations, our primary growth and profitability story is intact. Despite the near-term challenges, we believe Johnson Controls will deliver double-digit earnings increases in 2012."" The company traded between $24.29 and $42.92 dollars in the last 52 weeks. It's currently trading at $32.78, and I believe that today's plunge creates great opportunity for those wanting to initiate a long position. On another note, the company has a dividend payment, which yields 2.2% at the moment.

298309,22742,2011-10-07T15:02:27-04:00,,"By Mark D. Bern, CPA CFALet me begin by pointing to a detailed explanation of the strategy that can be found in my previous article. As you will see in the conclusion of this article, you may be able to collect in excess of nine percent annually in cash while holding Johnson Controls (NYSE:JCI).   If you find the returns mentioned in this article intriguing, I suggest that you take the time to understand the full strategy by reading that prior article.  First, we need to answer a question: I could apply this strategy to numerous other companies’ stocks, so why did I choose JCI to write about today.  JCI, founded in 1885, supplies automotive interiors, batteries and building controls.  The highest margins come from batteries where, incidentally, the greatest growth potential lies, in my opinion.  I believe we are at the beginning of a cyclical recovery in global automotive demand.  The key word in that last sentence may be “global.”  China’s auto industry is on a tear and U.S. auto companies, General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Ford (NYSE:F) are beneficiaries.  So is JCI with more than 1,300 facilities in over 150 countries worldwide.  If hybrid auto technology expands, as I believe it will, JCI is well positioned to take advantage of the trend being a leader and low-cost producer in this important battery category.  JCI will also benefit from a global trend in making older buildings more efficient.  With only 25 percent of sales for this business segment coming from new construction, JCI is insulated from the swings inherent in the construction and housing sector.  Overall, I believe JCI has a bright future.  I place JCI in the consumer discretionary sector for diversification purposes along with my other favorites in the sector: Home Depot (NYSE:HD), Kohls (NYSE:KSS), Best Buy (NYSE:BBY), Lowe's (NYSE:LOW), McDonald's (NYSE:MCD), Nike (NYSE:NKE), Staples (NASDAQ:SPLS), Sysco (NYSE:SYY), Target (NYSE:TGT), Tiffany (NYSE:TIF), and V.F. Corp. (NYSE:VFC) (see my earlier articles on BBY, LOW and VFC),JCI pays a dividend of 2.3 percent currently and has paid a dividend every year since 1887.  Dividend increases over the past five years have averaged 11 percent.  The last raise was for 23 percent on November 17, 2010, and I expect the company to raise dividends well into the future with a strong likelihood of increases of about 11 percent each year.  I also expect earnings to continue to rise by about the same rate.  JCI derives 62 percent of its revenue from outside the U. S.  The company is very well positioned to take advantage of global economic growth no matter where it occurs.  The company also has a healthy balance sheet with a debt-to-equity ratio of 44 percent, in line with the industry average.  Its capital structure provides flexibility for future investment and acquisitions when and where prudent.The company has a profit margin of four percent and its return on equity is a reasonable 15 percent. Both are somewhat below the industry averages but acceptable, in my view, considering the highly competitive sectors in which JCI operates.   When you add the expected growth in earnings of 11 percent to the current dividend of 2.2 percent you end up with an expected return of over 13 percent compounded annually.  Not bad, but I think we can do better.If you could increase your cash flow to eight to ten percent per year instead of just 2.2 percent, would it make waiting for the eventual appreciate worthwhile?  Let me show you how.The closing prices on JCI stock and selected options on October 6, 2011 (the last business day prior to my submission of this article; I always use closing prices to be fair) were as follows:Stock price:                         $28.96November Put; $25 strike            $1.20November Call; $31 strike            $1.05The assumption in these articles is that we want to own the stock of the subject company (JCI) but would prefer to buy it at a lower price and collect some income on our cash while we wait for our target price to materialize.  If the stock offers a good value at its current price of $28.96, then it should offer an even better value at a price that is eight to ten percent lower.  So, we sell one November $25 Put for $1.20 and collect the premium of $120 or $111 net after a $9 commission (assumes that we use a discount broker).  Thus far we have 3.8 percent return on our cash for less than two months.  This equates to an annualized rate of return of 23 percent.  However, since we cannot assume that the opportunity to sell an option will be available every month, or 12 times per year, I propose that we make an adjustment to the methodology used to calculate the annualized rate of return.  Instead of assuming that we can lock in that return for all 12 months, let’s assume that we can only find reasonably priced options that cover ten months out of each year when dealing with shorter term options (less than three months to expiration).  The reason is quite simple.  Even though most of the stocks we’ll discuss in my articles will have options available nearly every calendar month, some months do not have adequate trade volume to assure good trades.  Also, every stock used in my articles will have options trading at least quarterly with adequate volume.  Therefore, we can assume that if we sell options with expirations of three months or greater that we can do so consistently throughout the full twelve calendar months, while shorter durations will require an “adjustment.”  Simply put, if we sell an option that expires in one month, we will assume the rate is available for ten months or simply times the premium by ten to annualize our rate of return.  Similarly, if we sell an option that expires in two months, we will make the same assumption and times the premium by five to annualize our rate of return.  This way, if we have errors, they should be on the conservative side, meaning that we may actually do better in the real world rather than worse.Applying this method to the $111 net premium collected, the annualized rate of return would be 19.1 percent.  I don’t think I will get much argument about that sort of return on cash sitting in an account while we wait for a bargain.  Where else can you get a 19 percent annual rate on cash for a two-month holding period?But, of course, we want to own the stock so if it drops down below our strike price of $25 we could end up being put the stock at that price.  At that point our cost basis would be $23.80.  I like JCI better at this price than at $28.96.  That’s a discount from the current price of over 17 percent.  I like buying stuff on sale, especially investments.Now, let’s assume that we already own 100 shares of JCI stock and would like to increase the yield.  We do this by selling cover call options.  Since we own the stock in our account, generally brokers will require that we must sell the calls in the same account to be “covered.”  We sell one November $31 Call at a premium of $1.05 per share, or $105.  Again, we have to subtract the commission on the transaction of $9 (we have to use a discount broker to make this work well) and end up with a net of $96.  Using the annualizing method I explain in an earlier paragraph, this equates to an annual return of 16.6 percent.   Now don’t forget that if you own the stock you are also receiving the dividend and JCI’s dividend yield is currently 2.2 percent.  Add the two yields together and we now receive 18.8 percent yield on the stock.  And this is if we bought it at the current price of $28.96.  Just imagine what the return will be when we buy the stock on sale using the put option strategy!  Or follow along over the next two years (or at least a few months) to see what the real-time results would be.Watch for the update on JCI during late November or early December.  The title will be something like “Enhanced Income Strategy: JCI Update #1”.If this hasn’t made sense and you need a better explanation of the details of my strategy please refer to the original article at the link above. I have chosen to keep all the subsequent articles shorter by referring back to this article for details and explanation.  One last item that I would like to add to this article that is different from my previous articles.  Some of the comments to my previous articles have been extremely enthusiastic.  I am pleased.  Yet, I also believe that I must include a warning in all my subsequent articles to make sure that everyone understands that there are risks to every strategy, including this one.First, as has been pointed out in the comment threads, there is always the possibility that the selling puts strategy may not result in the purchase of the desired stock in a rapidly rising market.  An investor could miss most, if not all, of a run up.  It is doubtful that the full run will be missed, however, since the market (including most stocks) correct by 10 percent or more usually once or more per year.  For that reason it is likely that the investor will purchase the stock at some point during a bull market, but they still may miss some portion of it (perhaps a large portion, especially in a bounce off a major bottom).  On the positive side of this equation is the fact that as most major bottoms occur there is usually a day of capitulation.  Capitulation days are generally heavy down days on which, if one has sold puts outstanding, the investor stands a good chance of being put the stock (purchasing at the bottom).  There are no promises of that happening, but the odds are better under this strategy than following one's gut emotions.  One other thing that helps offset the possible regret of missing a stock at a good price is that the seller of the puts will continue to earn a decent return on their cash (generally 8-10 percent on average) annually while they wait.  Granted, that is not as good as hitting a 30 percent gain in a good year, but it sure beats sitting in a money market and earning zip.Second, as has also been pointed out in the comment threads, it is possible to end up buying a stock when the stock market tumbles and having to ride it out to the bottom.  If the investor is buying a stock in a company and wants to hold it for the long term, at least with this strategy he or she will never buy at the very top. After all, we’re selling puts at a price of about ten percent below the price when the put option is sold.  In addition, the investor has the opportunity to sell calls and, including dividends, receive an average of 8-10 percent in cash payments per year while waiting for the stock to rebound.  If we have done our homework in picking a good company at a price that represents a good value, then the likelihood of a rebound is very strong.  The only way to end up losing money is by selling the stock.  If you hold, you’re getting paid well to do so and eventually you’ll be back in the money.  If the investor had purchased the stock outright at the top of the market and the market fell 50 percent, he would be down 50 percent at the bottom and need the stock to double just to get even.  If he is  selling calls all the way down, assuming the average length on most bear markets is about 17-19 months, the investor should have collected somewhere in the vicinity of 15 percent along the way, putting him down 25 percent at the bottom.  Remember, the investor bought at ten percent below the top, using puts, so he couldn’t lose the full 50 percent in any event.  Now he only needs half as much of a rebound to get even.    The third scenario is the worst case.  If an investor sells a put near the top and ends up with the stock at a 10 percent discount from the high and rides in all the way down to the bottom, collecting dividends and call premiums along the way.  Now he is down 25 percent and ends up selling a call that gets exercised near the bottom and the stock is called away.  But remember, he is selling calls that will net about ten percent above the stock price at the time the option is sold, therefore should be selling at no less than ten percent off the bottom.  That would result in a total of a 15 percent loss on the total of the transactions.  Now compare that to most alternatives other than picking the tops and bottoms, which no can do consistently.  An alternative to riding a stock down is to use stop loss limit orders.  I recommend that investors consider using this strategy to save themselves the pain of riding a stock down during an overall market crash.  Some long-term investors with low cost basis may not want to use this strategy due to the tax consequences.The point is, while this isn’t the most lucrative strategy, it does bear less risk of loss than most alternatives.  By taking most of the emotions out of the decision process, an investor improves the chances of producing consistently higher returns.  And that is the whole point.  I hope this explanation helps cure some of the over-enthusiasm.  This is no get-rich-quick scheme.  It is simply a systematic strategy that can help investors achieve market-beating returns over the long term.Disclosure: I am long VFC, TGT, SYY."
296498,24866,2011-09-28T12:39:03-04:00,,"With concerns about a double-dip in the US economy, it is interesting that analysts are currently rating the highly cyclical Johnson Controls (NYSE:JCI) between a ""buy"" and a ""strong buy."" The company has a beta of 1.87 and a dividend yield of 2.28%, while trading at around 12.5x and 8.9x past and forward earnings, respectively. High risk-adjusted returns will be realized mainly through the success of Power Solutions and Building Efficiency. The consumer goods company specializes in providing automotive interiors and products that optimize efficiency for cars and buildings. It makes heating and ventilation systems and offers repair services. Despite the company's overly sensitive correlation with the United States economy, many analysts are still betting on higher demand for energy efficiency. Concerns about cost savings and domestic security during a downturn will be the main drivers in shifting demand. The risk is found in possibly lower demand in automotive production.I am anticipating that Building Efficiency will perform well into 2012. Over half of this segment's sales come through repairs and personal service for control systems. Power Solutions and Global Workplace Solutions are also looking to have strong improvements in the top line with growth rates around 11% and 17%, respectively, per year up until 2013. I find that value creation will also be improved through steadily increasing margins. The company recently had unnecessary contract issues that are unlikely to occur in the future.With that said, the company still faces a high degree of uncertainty. In issuing guidance, management should keep estimates conservative in the high-growth segments, so as to prevent any panic. Free cash flow will likely continue to be volatile, as it has in the past. *Note: Fluctuations in FCF between the years has been simplified into a connecting line.  Overall, I anticipate EBITDA growing by 13.3% and 14% in the next two years, partially driven by improvements in margins and contract renewals. Consensus estimates for EPS are that it will grow by 22% in 2011 to $2.44 and then by around 25% for both 2012 and 2013. With a PEG ratio of 0.71, I believe that the stock will provide high risk-adjusted returns in line with analyst estimates. The dividend yield of 2.28% will cushion a volatile ride.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
311052,21568,2011-11-30T15:25:52-05:00,,"Distributed renewable energy pays for itself, but Johnson Controls (NYSE:JCI) has a way to pay for it faster.Johnson Controls was already a leader in Energy Savings Performance Contracting (ESPC), or energy efficiency retrofits, when the company's “customers said, ‘We want to do all that efficiency work but we also want to do renewables,’” explained Jesse Stowell, a Johnson Controls Project Development Consultant specializing in the “bundling” of wind energy and energy efficiency retrofits.“I had seen how challenging it was to do standalone wind projects,” said Stowell, who came to Johnson Controls from the small wind business where the payback period can be protracted enough to discourage small and community consumers.Johnson Controls is one of “10 or so household-name companies,” Stowell said, including multinational giants like Siemens and Honeywell, that have grown ESPC businesses during the last three decades. In response to its customers’ interest in renewables to go with retrofits, Johnson Controls was looking for a wind guy. Stowell saw ESPC as a way to beat the obstacles facing small wind.“Once I pulled back the hood,” Stowell said, “I discovered that some of these efficiency measures have very short paybacks. When you’re doing 10, 12, 15 efficiency retrofits on a single project, quicker payback items subsidize others,” he explained. “You can include some things because others make the whole bundle perform.”Stowell oversees Johnson Controls' projects that include wind. Others of the company’s 700+ engineers specialize in bundles that include photovoltaic solar, solar hot water systems, anaerobic biogas production systems, biomass-fired boilers, or geothermal heat exchange systems.“Working with Fort Buchanan in Puerto Rico,” Stowell recalled, discussing a comprehensive efficiency retrofit for the U.S. Army where bundling was essential, “the wind energy piece couldn’t quite stand on its own” because of the need for special hurricane protections for the turbines. Financed on its own, the payback was too long. “But financed within the bundle,” he said, “the overall payback was well within the federal limit.”Lighting and building automation significantly reduce the payback period, Stowell said. “Putting in LEDs, it’s under six years to payback,” adding, “for building automation, one of Johnson Controls’ specialties, payback can take from two to eight years, and there are all kinds of neat things you can do.”Windows “almost never pay for themselves,” Stowell added, except with a “deeper retrofit where you take on more and the interdependency of all the systems, together, creates greater savings.”“Wind has the advantage of being one of the most, or the most, cost-effective renewable technology when it’s on a good site,” Stowell said. “So it often doesn’t need as much help from the bundle as other renewables.” And, he said, “It’s also very appealing for customers, because after they do all this efficiency work, which is essentially invisible to the untrained eye, they can put up this wind turbine. It’s a big statement: the bow you tie on your efficiency work.”It is, Stowell noted, “a completely different market than big wind projects that are highly dependent on federal tax incentives like the PTC [production tax credit] and the the ITC [investment tax credit]. The vast majority of the people who do ESPC are non-commercial, non-taxable entities: municipalities, schools, higher ed, federal, state and local governments,” Stowell said. “It’s totally decoupled from that roller coaster ride that the rest of the industry struggles with.”“If you tell a private sector guy that he’s got a 12-year payback, he’s usually not too interested. But if you tell a municipality there’s a 12-year payback and it’s cash-flow neutral or cash-flow positive, they’re quite interested.”Wind, Stowell said, is a low-risk, high-certainty piece of the typical Johnson Controls retrofit. Performance is guaranteed, measurable and verifiable, and installation includes a web-based dashboard that verifies the turbine’s output. “They therefore know they’re going to have a machine that operates as specified.”The 12-year payback will eventually improve, Stowell said, “when electricity rates go up and low wind speed technology gets better.”Stowell said he pushes “toward bigger machines, because you’re going to get a lower cost of energy,” but there are “influencing factors that may keep you from the largest machine” such as “building energy usage, net metering laws, wind resource, regional rate of electricity, local ordinances and height limitations, FAA regulations sometimes, as well as the pure size of the bundle, if it is going to need to be carried by the bundle.”Stowell takes a conservative attitude toward the type of turbine he recommends. “We put long-term guarantees on these machines,” he said. “I look for turbines with a proven track record, a company that has fielded a lot of units and has a lot of run-time, turbines that have certification from a reputable third-party agency to an international standard. That weeds out most of the questionable technology,” such as vertical axis turbines.A retrofit is designed in “a workshop, collaborative environment,” Stowell said. It begins with “what’s there, existing conditions and existing equipment. In some places, it’s a no-brainer to replace the boiler, but in others, it’s a very long payback and doesn’t make sense. Some places have a good wind resource and other places don’t.” For each “project-specific” undertaking, Stowell said, “We initially look at a larger swath of measures and whittle that down to the most compelling ones to make the project as financially successful as possible.”"
320771,24866,2012-01-19T18:57:57-05:00,,"Since I first argued that Johnson Controls (NYSE:JCI) was substantially undervalued here despite past volatility in free cash flow, the stock has appreciated by 28.5%. This beat the S&P 500 by around 1,770 bps and the best part is, namely, that the bull run is not over yet. Based on my multiples analysis and DCF model, I find that the company will outperform its peers and the broader index.From a multiples perspective, Johnson Controls appears at reasonable levels. It trades at a respective 14.9x and 9.9x past and forward earnings while Lear (NYSE:LEA) trades at 7.8x forward earnings and Honeywell (NYSE:HON) trades at 12.7x forward earnings. The last of these firms offers the higher dividend yield of the three at 2.6%, as well as the lowest volatility with a beta of 1.4. Within this backdrop, there is room for continued multiples expansion, but even if there is some contraction, earnings growth is still geared to drive value creation.On the third quarter earnings call, Johnson Controls' CEO, Steve Roell, noted the strong performance:Going forward, the company is well positioned to take advantage of the drive for energy efficiency. A major sustainable driver of profit comes from automotive batteries, which it ranks No. 1 in the market globally. Management has consistently returned free cash flow to shareholders and I do not see any reason to anticipate a change. Johnson Controls booked $4B of net new business in auto and has a backlog in building efficiency that ended 2011 at record levels of $5.1B. Two problems, however, add a significant amount of risk. First a majority of revenue, 51%, comes from Europe and, second, margins are at a historical trough in buildings efficiency.Consensus estimates for Johnson Controls' EPS forecast that it will grow by 22.3% to $2.96 in 2012 and then by 20.3% and 21.1% more in the following two years. Assuming a multiple of 13.5x and a conservative 2013 EPS of $3.44, the rough intrinsic value of the stock is $46.44, implying 32.5% upside. Modeling a CAGR of 21.2% and then discounting backwards at a WACC of 9% yields a fair value yet higher at $54.05. Safe to say, this company merits its ""strong buy"" rating on the Street.Lear is also attractive, but has meaningfully lower upside. Management guided for 2012 EBITDA of between $995M and $1.045B, which was below consensus. What was way below expectations, however, was guidance of $275M for free cash flow - the drive of value creation. With that said, management has boosted its buyback program and cleared up $2B worth of debt through bankruptcy restructuring. It divested its interior businesses in both Europe and North America. The company gained $2.4B worth of new business wins, which continues to rise. Again, the main problem is over exposure to Europe, where the company gets a plurality of its business from at 42%. General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Ford (NYSE:F) also contribute 40% to the top-line.Consensus estimates for Lear's EPS forecast are that it will grow by 19% to $5.26 in 2011 and then by 1.5% and 13.3% more in the following two years. Assuming a multiple of 9.5x and a conservative 2012 EPS of $5.21, the rough intrinsic value of the stock is $49.50, implying 19.7% upside.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

The trio to be formed out of Tyco include the ADT North America residential security business, low control products and services business and commercial fire and security business. Each company will have an independent existence and will be publicly traded.Tyco believes the restructuring will enable each stand-alone unit to re-focus more fully on its core business and provide improved services to its customers. The three companies will enjoy leading positions in the markets served by them, thus creating significant value for shareholders.The transaction is expected to be completed in approximately 12 months, subject to certain conditions including shareholder consent. The company estimates a one-time transaction cost of approximately $700 million, consisting of debt refinancing, separation and restructuring costs. As per the plan put forward, the ADT North America residential business is to be incorporated in the United States, while the flow control business will be incorporated outside the U.S. The commercial fire and security business will continue to be incorporated in Switzerland.If carried through, this will be the second split for Tyco.

(NYSE:JCI)  posted a modest 4% increase in profit to $383 million (excluding  non-recurring items) in the third quarter of its fiscal year ended June  30, 2011. The result compares to $367 million (excluding non-recurring  items) in the same quarter of fiscal 2010.On a per share basis, profits rose to 56 cents from 54 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 cents per share.The increase in profit was attributable to double-digit increases in  sales for all the company’s business segments, which was partially  offset by disruptions in automotive production resulting from the  earthquake and tsunami in Japan in March 2011.The company’s Automotive Experience segment benefited from a  faster-than-expected market recovery. Meanwhile, backlog in the  company’s Building Efficiency segment increased at a double-digit pace,  especially across its Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)  equipment offerings.Net sales in the quarter rose 21% to $10.36 billion, exceeding the  Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.51 billion. Gross profit increased 16% to  $1.55 billion (15.0%) from $1.34 billion (15.7%) a year ago.Segment ResultsAutomotive Experience: Sales in the segment rose 21%,   driven by higher production volumes, new program launches and  incremental sales from recent acquisitions. The impact of higher global  volumes was partially offset by lower production by Japanese automakers  due to disruptions emanating from the earthquake. Segment income dipped  17% to $142 million from $171 million a year ago.Power Solutions: Sales in the segment grew 22% to $1.4  billion, reflecting higher volumes in Asia, incremental volume  associated with the consolidation of its Korean joint venture at the end  of last year and higher lead prices. Segment income went up 21% to $163  million driven by higher volumes.Building Efficiency: Sales in the segment escalated  21% to $3.9 billion, led by sales growth in Asia (43%) and Global  Workplace Solutions (33%). Segment income inched up 9% to $207 million,  driven by higher income from North America systems and services, Global  Workplace Solutions and Asia.Financial PositionJohnson Controls had cash and cash equivalents of $335 million as of  June 30, 2011, compared with $908 million in the corresponding period a  year ago. Total debt amounted to $5.18 billion as of the above period.  This translated into a long-term debt-to-capitalization ratio of 31%,  compared with 26% in the corresponding quarter-end a year ago.In the first nine months of fiscal year 2011, Johnson Controls’  operating cash flow decreased to $561 million from $1.45 billion in the  year-ago period, mainly driven by increases in accounts receivable and  inventories and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities.  Meanwhile, capital expenditures increased to $900 million from $526  million in the prior year.OutlookJohnson Controls said it expects to earn 75 cents per share (GAAP) in  the fourth quarter of its fiscal year. This includes charges of up to 3  cents per share for acquisition and related costs and up to 2 cents per  share due to disruptions in Japanese automotive production.Our TakeWe are optimistic about Johnson Controls given its improved results and  clear cut guidance. However, tough competition and higher exposure to  original equipment manufacturers are expected to hamper its results in  the future. As a result, the company has a Zacks #3 Rank on its stock,  which translates to a short-rating (1–3 months) of “Hold”. We reiterate  our “Neutral” recommendation on the stock for the long term (more than 6  months)."
280560,24614,2011-07-20T15:00:54-04:00,,"If you’d like to invest in a group of fire and security companies, it is not easy to do. Most of the big and medium-sized players in security are conglomerates like Johnson Controls (NYSE:JCI), Bosch Security, Sony (NYSE:SNE) and Schneider Electric (OTCPK:SBGSF). These companies' security product lines are a fairly small part of the overall revenue stream. Even smaller players like Verint (NASDAQ:VRNT) and Nice (NASDAQ:NICE) have much of their revenue coming from somewhere else.Tyco International (TYC) is one of the few larger companies that get most of its revenue from fire and security. In the first six months of FY2011 (ending March 25), approximately 76% of its revenue came from fire and security. That revenue is quite diversified within the sector: Per the company's filing: With one company you can buy a lot of diversification across the sector, including manufacturing, distribution, and a rough split of 50% products and 50% services. Geographically, the business is quite North America-focused (about 60% of revenue), so you won’t get a lot of diversification there.Tyco has a colorful and complex history, dominated by a slew of acquisitions and divestitures. You can read some of it on Wikipedia here.MarketTyco participates in several distinct markets, making it difficult to predict potential growth rates. For projecting Tyco’s growth over the long term, we would tend to look first at the general health of the world’s leading economies rather than something more specific like the video surveillance market.Company PositionThe security equipment market is Tyco’s largest segment. It owns ADT, the largest security service provider in the business, which gives it a large US presence. ADT had revenues of $7.4 billion in FY2010 and represented 44% of TYC's business.Here were net revenues by segment for 2010:ADT provides a unique, vertically-integrated channel to help the sale of Tyco’s product businesses. At the same time, some security product manufacturers like Pelco/Schneider Electric and Panasonic (PC) are likely to be reluctant to partner with ADT as a service provider due to the potential for ADT to favor its own brands.  Growth RatesTyco is coming off a weak year in 2009 when revenues dropped 15-20% and a bounce back in 2010 to recover most of that. Early 2011 (after correcting for acquisitions/currency affects) growth seems to be back to about 6% per year, but much of that growth is attributable to acquisitions and currency effects. North American product growth dominated the overall company growth, with almost no growth in EMEA. Although we believe the overall fire and security market may grow in the 8-10% range, we are not as optimistic about Tyco's growth given its recent poor performance and the importance of the US-based ADT in overall operations. Growth in ADT has recently been helped by acquisition, but we are mostly interested in organic growth. For organic growth rates, overall we are assuming 5% long term. Cost ControlTyco’s cost of product sales are in the 70% range, which is not bad for a conglomerate manufacturer, and compares well to companies like Johnson Controls, Honeywell and GE. In the past year, cost of sales and cost of SG&A have all improved slightly. Net income for the first six months was up from 7.4% of revenue in 2010 to 11.6% of revenue in 2011. We’ve assumed it can achieve 9% in after-tax net profits for the long term.Inventory levels seem under control with an overall improvement in 2011 versus 2010.Transparency We rate the transparency poor. With the company realigning ADT operations and manufacturing operations into a single division, it is not breaking out performance of its largest asset, ADT. We would like to see a breakout of the various brands revenues, and costs each quarter.Risk AssessmentWe assess Tyco’s risk level as low. On the positive side, the company is well diversified within its sector, has some highly recognized brand names, and is the largest North American security sales/alarm operation. On the negative side, the company has been through some rocky financial quarters, is growing largely through acquisitions, with limited transparency as to how well its largest asset is being managed. It's largely subject to the success of the security sector; however, we believe the sector is likely to continue to expand with the current world’s obsession with security.VineSecurityJournal.com’s Proprietary Pricing ModelWe assess stocks primarily based on their fundamental value. We estimate the revenue and earnings to be generated by a company over the next ten years. We look at the risk involved in the business, look at the assets and liabilities, and we discount the value of the future earnings according to risk level. For companies with medium to high risk levels, we discount the value of future earnings more aggressively. Finally, we compare the value of those future earnings to the stock price. Are the shares “on sale” – or are they expensive?   Pricing Model Target Price: $47. Conclusion: Hold. Tyco is an option to buy into the relatively safe security and fire products sector. The market in which it focuses should have safe, if not exciting, growth for many years to come. At its current price of about $47, we would hold, or look for a possible dip to enter at about $42.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
309942,22742,2011-11-23T14:08:44-05:00,,"By Mark Bern Tyco (TYC) isn’t the glamour stock it once was. The image was destroyed by one CEO (D. K.) and even though his replacement has done much to restore the company’s credibility, the luster may be gone forever. Growth has slowed but become more stable since the financial crisis of 2008-09. Rumors are swirling about a takeover bid but the price is still moving with the market. There just doesn’t seem to be much that can help poor Tyco to differentiate itself from the pack. Honestly, as the company is currently configured, I don’t see anything very exciting either. But let’s take a closer look at the company’s latest plan to unlock shareholder value.Tyco management has decided that the company would be better off if split into three separate companies, each focusing on it end market customers and its own line of products and services. There may be some truth to that, but there is something else in this scenario that me thinks smells of greater opportunity. The company, as it is currently formed may be just too big for an acquisition or, more likely, it may not be that appealing as a whole to any one suitor. Therefore, I suspect that the better value that could be realized for shareholders comes after the split into three separate companies. Each new company will be a leader in its respective industry. Each will pay a dividend and be well capitalized, financially stable, and maintain an investment grade credit rating. What once was not so appealing to any one potential buyer may look more appetizing to three different potential buyers. Herein lays the hidden value: once split up, each company will be able to consider the best path to enhancing shareholder value. That may work out differently for each business. If one or more of the three companies finds that acquisitive potential buyers are willing to pay a significant premium to the market price, that management may seek competition from multiple bidders and find they can achieve an immediate increase of value to its shareholders of 40 percent or more. I suspect that this is the likely outcome and I also suspect that the current management knows it. They may not be able to sell the combined company for the full value that they believe shareholders can receive so why not split it up and get the premiums on those parts that buyers really crave? It will be interesting to see which of the three companies the current top execs migrate to when the split occurs. I am guessing, but I’d be willing to wager that company will go to the auction block first and that those managers in charge of it will be getting outsized severance packages. Those in the know always seem to end up in the right place at the right time.So, where is the opportunity in all this for the lowly retail investor? I am considering buying Tyco once regulators have given their approval and the final vote is scheduled for shareholders. I want to own the stock before the break up, watch where the top executives of the parent end up, and buy more of that company(s) after the split and wait for the offers to come. The key officers that I’ll be watching are the CEO, the CFO, and the COO all of whom should be privy to the detailed intentions of the split and the potential end results. I will follow the CEO first since that is where the real money should show up, in my humble opinion. I would expect the deals to start showing up sometime after the first six months of the split, but the possible wait for action may take as much as 18 months. If nothing has shown up by then I would reconsider the holdings based upon the merits of continuing operations without the buyout opportunity.Of course, I may have it all wrong and an investor may just end up with the three separate companies that pay the same dividend of about 2.2 percent and growth appreciation prospects of the current two to five percent per year. Not great, but it may be worth accepting for the potential reward just in case. That is the question each investor must determine for themselves.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

(NYSE:JCI) is scheduled to release its third quarter 2011 results before the market opens on July 20, 2011.The Wisconsin-based company earned 56 cents per share in the first quarter, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny.For the upcoming quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Johnson  Controls is pegged at a profit of 53 cents per share, which reflects an  annualized decline of 1.15%. The upside potential of the estimate,  essentially a proxy for future earnings surprises, is 13.21%. With respect to earnings surprises, the company has put together an  average surprise of 1.78% over the past 4 quarters, with a negative  surprise being recorded in one of the quarters involved.Second Quarter RecapNet sales in the second quarter grew 22% to $10.14 billion, which was  higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.25 billion.Revenues in the Automotive Experience segment went up  25% to $5.22 billion, driven by higher production volumes and automotive  seating and interior program launches. Segment revenues in North  America rose 22%, Europe increased 26% and Asia surged 37%, including a  31% rise in China.The segment reported an income of  $247 million, a 31% increase from $189 million in the corresponding  quarter of the previous year, driven by higher volumes and improved operational efficiencies.Revenues in the Building Efficiency segment escalated  18% to $3.52 billion, led by a 31% rise in sales in Asia and a 27%  increase in sales in Global Workplace Solutions. The segment recorded a  27% rise in income to $132 million from $104 million, driven by higher  volumes.Revenues in the Power Solutions segment appreciated  19% to $1.41 billion, reflecting higher shipments of both aftermarket  and original equipment batteries. Aftermarket sales increased 17% in the  Americas while original equipment (OE) and aftermarket unit sales in  Asia jumped 163% due to higher volumes associated with the consolidation  of a Korean joint venture, market share gains and incremental  production from the company's second manufacturing plant in China.The segment income soared 33% to $178 million from $134 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2010 as a result of higher volumes and strong operational performance.The company had cash and cash equivalents of $401 million as of March  31, 2011, compared with $770 million in the year-ago period. Total debt  amounted to $4.54 billion as of the above date compared with $3.38  billion a year ago.Estimate Revisions Trend                                                           The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter of 2011 is currently  pegged at a profit of 53 cents per share. Analysts are slightly  cautious on the stock considering the constant pricing pressure from the  OEMs along with the intensifying competition in the industry.Agreement of Estimate RevisionsOut of the 21 analysts covering the stock for the third quarter of  2011, one has upgraded the stock in the past 30 days. None have  downgraded.Magnitude of Estimate RevisionsFollowing the second quarter earnings release in April, the third  quarter earnings per share were projected at a profit of 67 cents.  However, in the last 60 days, the estimate dropped by a substantial  amount and stands at a profit of 53 cents per share.Our TakeJohnson Controls expects to benefit in the long-run from its focus on  China. In the seating business, Johnson Controls has acquired more than  50% of the country’s market share. The company has started to invest  $500 million in four automotive battery plants in and around Shanghai to  meet excess demand in the country. The plants will have an annual  production capacity of 30 million batteries by 2015.The company also anticipates revenues to increase 15% to $39.5 billion  in fiscal 2011, up from the previous forecast of $38.5 billion. The  increased guidance was driven by growth expectations for Building  Efficiency and a stronger Euro.Moreover, its battery business is set to grow from new hybrid wins, and  the company is adding capacity to meet demand. The acquisition of the  Delphi global battery business provides Johnson Controls with a stronger  foothold.However, the mounting pressure from OEMs to reduce prices combined with  the volatility in commodity prices may affect the company’s  profitability in the near term. Moreover, increasing debt and decreasing  cash are also among the growing concernsStrong competition from major domestic and international manufacturers and distributors of lead-acid batteries, including Magna International, Inc. (NYSE:MGA) and TRW Automotive Holdings Corp. (NYSE:TRW) is not helping matters.Keeping these factors in mind, shares  of Johnson Controls are maintaining a Zacks #3 Rank, which translates  into a short-term Hold rating. In addition, shares also have a Neutral  recommendation for the long term."
277162,22088,2011-06-29T08:53:47-04:00,,"On June 27th Johnson Controls (NYSE:JCI) hosted their 2011 Power Solutions Analyst Day and unveiled their expectations for the future of stop-start idle elimination systems. After noting that all automakers are developing a range of powertrains, JCI used this graph (click to enlarge images) to emphasize their view that the overwhelming bulk of alternative powertrain vehicles over the next five years will have simple, cost effective and fuel efficient stop-start systems.You don't see much about stop-start systems in the mainstream media because politicians and reporters are too enchanted with plug-in vehicles and other exotica to deal with mundane issues like purchase prices and payback periods, but JCI has made it crystal clear that its meat and potatos business over the next five years will be cheap, not cool.JCI's estimates for market growth over the next ten years were equally impressive, particularly when you realize that the advanced energy storage systems required for stop-start generate twice the per unit revenue and three times the per unit margins of flooded lead-acid batteries. It's a manufacturer's dream come true, stable unit volumes with rapidly increasing revenues and margins.In their presentation JCI explained that the three key attributes of energy storage systems for stop-start are:It ties perfectly to a joint presentation from BMW and Ford at last fall's European Lead Battery Conference where the two automakers explained why the stop-start duty cycle is so hard on conventional batteries. In a normal vehicle, you start the engine at the beginning of the trip and turn it off at the end. In a car equipped with stop-start, the engine turns itself off automatically every time the car is stopped and restarts automatically when the driver takes his foot off the brake. While the difference between one start per trip and one start per mile is enormous, a more critical problem arises from the fact that stop-start systems require the battery to carry all accessory loads during frequent engine off intervals.In the segment of the BMW-Ford presentation that quantified a typical stop-start duty cycle, the accessory load was 50 amps for 60 seconds, or about 3,000 amp seconds while the starter load was 300 amps for one second. In other words, the accessories accounted for a whopping 91% of total load. Their graph of AGM battery performance over time shows that charge acceptance (the downward curving blue line) plummets as the battery ages while the time required to recover from an engine off event (the upward curving red line) soars from 30 seconds to three minutes or more.Since all systems are designed to disable the stop-start functionality until the battery has recovered an acceptable state of charge, system efficiency falls off rapidly as the battery ages. The automakers want and need something better than AGM batteries, the principal solution that old line auto battery manufacturers like JCI want to provide.The first advanced technology introduced for stop-start systems was developed by Continental AG in cooperation with Maxwell Technologies (NASDAQ:MXWL) for use in diesel stop-start systems from Peugeot. In this dual device configuration an AGM battery carries the accessory load and a supercapacitor module carries most of the starter load. It insures a reliable engine restart, but can't do much about the bigger problem of accessory loads. Contiental and Maxwell expect that their system will be installed in up to a million Peugeot vehicles in the next three years. If the system works well for Peugeot and stop-start vehicle sales ramp as rapidly as JCI expects them to, implementation rates will probably be higher.A second advanced technology solution for stop-start systems is a third generation lead-acid-carbon hybrid that's being developed by Axion Power International (AXPW), which hopes to begin a commercial roll-out of its PbC battery later this year. In a joint presentation by BMW and Axion at last fall's ELBC, the performance differences were obvious. The graph that tracked PbC's performance over time using the BMW-Ford test protocol showed that charge acceptance (the flat blue line) stayed stable at 100 amps, or twice the charge acceptance of a new AGM battery, while recovery times (the flat black line) remained stable at 30 seconds.The BMW-Ford graph shows that AGM batteries fade very rapidly over the first 5,000 miles of use in a stop-start equipped vehicle. The BMW-Axion graph shows that the PbC offers optimal performance through 40,000 miles. In a recent presentation at the 2011 Advanced Automotive Battery Conference in Mainz, Germany, Axion unveiled an updated graph of follow-on testing through 80,000 cycles, or approximately eight years of use, with only modest degradation.I've been bullish about the future of stop-start idle elimination technology for a couple years. If the JCI forecasts are even close to accurate, I've been seriously understating the potential. Since JCI is the largest lead-acid battery manufacturer in the world and has a 36% share of the global automotive OEM and battery replacement markets, it will undoubtedly be the biggest beneficiary of the rapid worldwide implementation of stop-start idle elimination systems. The second biggest beneficiary will probably be Exide Technologies (XIDE), which is emerging from several years of tough restructuring and trades at a significant discount to JCI on a forward looking earnings basis. Emerging technology developers like Maxwell and Axion also have significant opportunities to grab a sizeable share of what's shaping up as $6 to $12 billion market niche. Their respective market capitalizations are summarized below:As former Axion director, I'm all too aware that it's a very little fish in a very big pond. I also understand why the PbC's extreme cycling performance and charge acceptance can be crucial to the future development of stop-start, a world-class fuel efficiency technology that's already being produced at scale and will become dominant in this decade. It's easy to dismiss my ramblings because I have a large stake in Axion. It's harder to dismiss BMW, a first tier automaker that joined Axion as a co-presenter at last year's ELBC. It will be darned near impossible to dismiss a big three US automaker that's apparently signed on as an Axion subcontractor in a pending DOE grant application.Disclosure: Author is a former director of Axion Power International (AXPW) and holds a substantial long position in its common stock."

278275,24493,2011-07-06T15:56:53-04:00,,"Looking at a 2011 price chart for Johnson Controls, Inc. (NYSE:JCI) could leave you scratching your head about where it’s headed. The channel-constrained trading is not event-driven as I mentioned in my recent Johnson Controls valuation article, where I dig deeper into the fundamental valuation, but simply an amplification of broad market movements.Johnson Controls has three main lines of business: automotive interiors (51% of sales), building efficiency (35% of sales), and power solutions (14% of sales) which focuses on automotive batteries. Revenues are increasing, but not faster than what the market has priced in. The latest outlook from Johnson Controls’ management expresses an extremely optimistic view of their power solutions market with skyrocketing demand for start-stop vehicles (as opposed to plug-in hybrids). If demand really does rise at this rate, their high margin solution will experience an onslaught of competition, forcing tighter margins and trimming total sales.My valuation puts Johnson Controls’ fair share price between $37.15 and $41.96, not coincidentally the respective floor and ceiling of the trading range throughout 2011. JCI is currently communicating a sell signal based on fundamental valuation and technical indicators. (Click to enlarge)Aside from shorting the stock, how can we bet against the realization of these wild projections? By using options to reduce our risk and enhance our return.With the volatility index (VIX) near oscillating lows, it’s a great time to buy options (as opposed to sell them). The October $41 put looks very cost-effective at $2.20, especially if you pair it with as short $39 August put for $0.65 to create a calendar spread, which you could roll forward for September and October. This would allow you to sell a total of 3 different spreads for, say, a total of $1.75 (possibly even higher as the price moves south and volatility increases.The next two months’ transactions could even be sold at the $38 strike or lower, widening your potential profit range. By October, you’re holding a nearly-paid-off spread that captures $3 worth of movement for about $0.50 in net cost. A nice 5-bagger if the stock moves to $38 or lower, or a well-insured, limited loss if the JCI continues north. As with all options transactions, be aware of your leverage and at-risk capital. Don’t over-leverage into a position, but use just enough to get the proper amount of exposure in your portfolio. For example, 100 shares of JCI will cost $4,200, but the options transactions I described above will only consume $155 from the outset for the same exposure. Place the remaining $4,045 in a low-risk allocation, and you have much less capital at risk, for the same exposure to our target valuation range.How else would you use options to play JCI right now?Disclosure: I am short JCI."

Sometimes when companies are taking things apart I find myself wondering what they were thinking when they were putting the pieces together.One of the reasons the spin-off would be good for Tyco is less earnings volatility from not being exposed to construction cycles.From the perspective of being an investor in the spin-off stock this exposure may not be so positive or at least call for an awareness of the cyclical nature of the demand for tubing, conduit, and framing systems.This seems to be a good example of why the question “are stock spin-offs good?” can’t really be answered beyond saying that they tend to be.

Segment Results ADT Worldwide   Revenue of $1.8 billion declined 3% organically as the 5% growth in recurring revenue was more than offset by a 13% organic revenue decline in Systems Installation and Service. Recurring revenue which represented over 55% of ADT's total revenue in the quarter continues to perform well. However Systems Installation and Service revenue continues to be impacted by the weak economy.  Despite pressure on the top line, the operating margin improved 180 basis points over the prior year. Restructuring activities along with cost containment actions and growth in higher margin recurring revenue business more than offset volume headwinds, resulting in the year-over-year operating margin improvement. Flow Control  Revenue in the quarter was $923 million with an organic revenue decline of 14%. Valves declined 15%, water declined 10% and thermal controls declined 14% due to continued softness in capital spending in key markets. Before special items, operating income was $118 million and the operating margin was 12.8%. The operating margin performance for the quarter was better than expected, due to product mix, particularly the strength of thermal controls during the winter months. However the significant volume de-leveraging resulted in a 170 basis point decrease in the operating margin before special items. Protection Services  Revenue for the quarter was $833 million and the organic revenue declined 6% as it continued to experience softness in Systems Installation revenue and to a much lesser degree in service revenue. Service represents about half of Fire's revenue and declined 2% organically as growth in Inspection and Maintenance revenue was more than offset by customers delaying other service projects. Systems Installation revenue declined by 10% organically in the quarter due to weaker demand in key markets. Safety Products  Revenue in the quarter was $358 million with an organic revenue decline of 14%. Organic revenue growth of 4% in Life Safety was more than offset by soft demand in Fire Suppression and Electronic Security markets. Organic revenue declined 22% in Fire Suppression and 10% in Electronic Security. Before special items, operating income was $53 billion and the operating margin was 14.8%. Better-than-expected operating income in the quarter resulted from product mix in particular higher margin Life Safety and Electronic Security products. Electrical and Metal Products  Revenue of $297 million in the quarter and experienced organic revenue decline of 30%. The revenue decline was primarily due to significantly lower selling prices for both steel and copper products. Decreased volume also contributed to the decline, although to a much lesser extent. Operating income before special items of $23 million was as expected. On a year over year basis, lower revenue was almost fully offset by improved steel strengths. Looking Ahead   In the second quarter, the company expects revenue and operating income before special items to be similar to the first quarter. Based on in-market demand and pricing activity in the quarter, as well as the seasonal lift we get in the summer months, the company expects operating income before special items for the full year to equal approximately $120 million in Electrical and Metal Products business.

209738,21618,2010-06-13T04:05:59-04:00,,"One of the last things I did in my portfolio was to unload shares of Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) on April 30, 2010, at $71.87 and purchase shares of Ecolab (NYSE:ECL) at $48.98. I did so in the face of the Deepwater Horizon Gulf of Mexico oil spill which occurred on April 20, 2010. Both shares have been relatively weak but Schlumberger, an oil service contractor, has been hit hard and closed June 11, 2010, at $59.48, down more than $12 or (17.2)% since my own sale. Ecolab closed at $46.44 on June 11, 2010, giving me a loss of $(2.54) or (5.2)% since my purchase, reflecting more the market's decline in May rather than any particular bias against the industry that SLB has been facing.In the same fashion, I do believe that the tragic oil spill that is continue to pour raw petroleum into the Gulf of Mexico shall have effects that extend beyond the directly affected states into policy being developed in Washington D.C. and likely in other capitols around the globe. Much like Three Mile Island had a terribly chilling effect on nuclear power in America, so shall the Gulf oil spill result in changes in energy policy in the United States.Johnson Controls (NYSE:JCI) may ultimately benefit from the changes in energy utilization in America and around the world. I first wrote up this Wisconsin-based firm on July 9, 2004, when the stock was trading at $53.24. With the 3:1 stock split on October 3, 2007, this gives this pick an effective cost of nearly $18 per share. JCI closed on June 11, 2010, at $27.56.I again revisited Johnson Controls on October 12, 2005, when the stock was trading at $63.60 ($21.20 adjusted for the split). On October 10, 2006, I wrote up Johnson Controls a third time, when the stock was trading at $81 ($27 adjusted for the subsequent split). Since that time I have briefly owned shares of the stock but at this time do not own any shares of Johnson Controls.Let's take another look at this company and I shall share with you why I believe it is still an interesting stock and one that deserves a spot in my blog as well as probably a position in my own trading account in the future!Johnson Controls operates in three main businesses. According to the Yahoo ""Profile"" on the company, itWeakness in both the building industry as well as the automotive industry resulted in considerable weakness in the stock price. However, both of these areas appear to be bottoming and starting a slow recovery. This recent article points out signs of a recovery in building in the recession-laden Southern California market. Similarly the auto industry is showing signs of life and recent numbers continued the '8 straight month' of auto sales increases.Johnson Controls recently launched an unsuccessful bid for auto parts supplier Visteon (OTC:VSTNQ) for $1.25 billion. Visteon has been a parts supplier for Ford (NYSE:F). That bid was rejected but reflects JCI's ambitious effort to grow their business in the midst of the weak environment. JCI also spent $6.08 million recently to purchase a 3.4% interest in Azure Dynamics Corp., a Michigan supplier to the hybrid vehicle market, a growing alternative to the internal combustion driven vehicles we all have grown up with.In the latest quarterly financial report issued by Johnson Controls, they reported that their fiscal 2nd quarter flipped from a loss the prior year of $269 million to a profit of $274 million. This worked out to $.40/share this year vs. $(.33)/share the prior year. They managed to exceed analysts' expectations of $.39/share according to Thomson Reuters. Revenue also climbed 32% year-over-year to $8.32 billion, also exceeding analysts expectations of $7.92 billion in sales. Adding some additional bullish sentiment to the announcement, the company raised guidance on 2010 earnings to a range of $1.90 to $1.95/share, compared to prior guidance of $1.70 to $1.70/share on revenue of $33.5 billion.Reviewing the Morningstar.com ""5-Yr Restated"" financials on JCI, we can see that from 2003 until 2008, revenue climbed from $27.5 billion to $38.1 billion. Revenue dipped in 2009 to $28.5 billion before climbing back to $31.6 billion in the trailing twelve months.Earnings climbed from $1.56/share in 2005 to $2.09/share in 2007 before dipping down to $1.63/share in 2008 and a loss of $(.57)/share in 2009. The company has earned $1.71/share in the trailing twelve months.The company increased its dividend from $.33/share in 2005 to $.52/share in 2008 and has kept it at that level since then. Outstanding shares have fluctuated with 583 million reported in 2005, increasing to 601 million in 2008. They dipped to 593 million in 2009 and have again increased to 637 million in the TTM.Free cash flow has remained positive even with the dip in business, declining from $1.09 billion in 2007 to $270 million in 2009 but has increased to $1.5 billion in the TTM.The balance sheet remains solid with JCI having $770 million in cash and $9.1 billion in other current assets, plenty to cover the $8.8 billion in current liabilities with another $5.6 billion of long-term liabilities reported by Morningstar.In terms of valuation, reviewing the Yahoo ""Key Statistics"" on Johnson Controls, we can see that this is a large cap stock with a market capitalization of $18.54 billion. The company has a trailing p/e of $16.15 with a forward p/e (for year ending Sep 30, 2011) estimated at 11.39. With the rapid growth expected, the PEG ratio works out to a dirt cheap level of 0.49.Yahoo reports 672.7 million shares outstanding with 622 million of them that float. As of 5/28/10, there were 7.01 million shares out short, representing a short ratio of only 1.00.Currently, the stock has a forward estimated dividend of $.52/share yielding 1.9%. This dividend is well covered with a payout ratio of only 31%. As I noted above, the company last split its stock with a 3:1 split back on October 3, 2007.Looking at a 'point & figure' chart from StockCharts.com, we can see how the previous peak in the stock price was at $41/share back in October, 2006. The stock recently bottomed at $8.50/share back in March, 2009, has subsequently rallied out of that low through 2009, and now has broken through resistance levels in the $21 range. The stock, while correcting currently, still appears to be bullishly poised for further appreciation.To summarize, Johnson Controls appears to be a timely stock pick based on a changing economy with recovery in building and automotive interiors as well as a growing participation by JCI into the hybrid market with their own growing electric battery business. Furthermore, conservation is likely to be a growing concern with the ever-present understanding of making our energy dollars go further while conserving precious resources and our environment.Disclosure: Author owns shares in Ecolab."

115207,21618,2009-01-18T03:37:15-05:00,,"A few moments ago I sold my 82 shares of Johnson Controls (NYSE:JCI) at $15.60/share. I purchased these shares at $14.83/share on 11/20/08, so I had a gain of $.77/share or 5.2% since the purchase. This wasn't a sale based on any pre-determined appreciation or loss point. This was simply my own decision that the fundamentals of the stock had changed such that I no longer felt it was an acceptable stock for my own trading portfolio. As I wrote this, JCI was trading at $15.69, down $1.38 or 8.08% on the day on the back of the 1st quarter 2009 earnings report released Friday.JCI announced that it had lost $608 million in the first quarter working out to $1.02/share. A year ago, the company reported a profit of $235 million or $.39/share. Johnson Controls had pre-announced that it expected a loss, but the level of the loss exceeded the street's expectations. Thomson Reuters analysts had expected a profit of $.01/share removing charges. Even excluding those charges, JCI came in at a loss of $.14/share.In addition, the company reduced expectations for the second quarter with guidance now to a second-quarter loss similar to the first quarter. This is below the profit of $.18/share expected by analysts. The decline in sales for this company has involved far more than just the automotive sector, with automotive sales dropping 25%, Power Solutions business (vehicle batteries) declining 32%, and building efficiency sales off 4.8%. I still like Johnson Controls for the long haul, but for the time being, I shall be stepping aside from this Wisconsin-based corporation.This sale brings me back to my minimum of five holdings. I shall look to add a new position if any of my remaining five should so indicate. I shall also replace any sales of those five with a new but smaller-sized purchase should any of them reach a sale point."

Ideally, it will result in $4.4 million in energy savings annually. The payback on green building projects like this are typically faster than in solar, where payback can take eight or more years.Some of the improvements include: 6,500 thermal windows, individual power management consoles for tenants and a retrofit of the chiller and ventilation controls.

228569,23469,2010-10-05T16:15:45-04:00,,"Profile: Johnson Controls Inc. (NYSE:JCI) is a three-pronged American auto parts maker. The company operates a building efficiency segment, automotive experience segment, and power solutions unit. The efficiency segment that produces air conditioning, controls, and security equipment maker. The automotive experience segment designs and manufactures interior products as well as designs and manufacture cockpit, overhead, and door systems. Finally, the power solutions unit makes car batteries. The company was founded in 1885 and has its headquarters in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.(Click to enlarge)ThesisThe automotive industry was crippled during the Great Recession. Automobile sales, across the board, were down, and auto parts makers were hit hard by the lack of demand. that hurt automotive sales around the world as consumers avoided big-ticket items. 2010, however, has breathed life back into the automotive industy as sales have risen exceptionally throughout the year. Projected sales this year are over 11 million, while 2009 only saw 4.8 million sales. One auto parts company in the USA looks poised to take advantage of the resurgence in the American market and its positioning in the growing Chinese automotive market.That company is Johnson Controls Inc.The American auto market has seen great recovery thus far in the USA. August was the first month in 2010 that was not higher year-over-year, but this was caused by the Cash for Clunkers craze that struck last August. In July 2010, GM (NYSE:GM) pulled a 25% increase in sales year-over-year of its four remaining brands. Ford (NYSE:F) pulled in a 3% rise. The significant year-over-year gains will slow down, but as long as things continue to get better, it is a good sign for the auto industry. Many estimates have US sales increasing to 20 million by 2015, and an auto parts maker like Johnson Controls will be at the forefront of this uptick in sales. This is because JCI supplies auto parts to every American company, and its parts are being used in nearly every model. Further, the company is dedicating to diversification in two ways: China and electric cars.(Click to enlarge)The Chinese industry became the leader of automotive sales in 2010, and it looks poised to continue to grow throughout the coming years. Chinese auto sales are estimated to grow 55% by 2015, according to JDPower.com, from nearly 9 million to over 13.5 million sales. Johnson Controls has recognized the future and opportunity in China, and the company will build three to four new plants by 2015. The company wants to be able to produce 30 million batteries in China by 2015. Luckily, JCI has great paths to entry into the market with American companies GM and Ford that are already being established in the country.Johnson Controls, additionally, is pushing itself in the path of the electric car. The company, which, operates mostly as a power train, steering, HVAC, and battery maker is looking at the electric car, which runs on batteries, as a big place for future revenue growth. Recently, the company opened its first electric battery plant in Michigan, which was the first of its kind for the company. As electric cars mount pressure to be an alternative to the combustion engine, JCI can truly prosper with this growing market.There are still some concerns for JCI from being so heavily dependent on the automotive industry. The continual struggles to get the labor market back to better employment rates and concerns of a slower than expected economy could diminish some of the upside for JCI. In 2009, for example, the compnay saw its ROIC drop to 3.3%. It has already bounced back up in the TTM to over 9% (rising ROIC is one of the best indicators of future growth). The company’s gross margins in 2009 dipped to 12.5% and are back to near 15% in the TTM. Operating margins wen negative to -0.8, and in the TTM, they are back over 3%. The company is completely dependent on the North American automotive industry being successful, which is a large risk. That does diminsh the company’s longterm outlook to some degree.Overall, though, Johnson Controls is a developing company that should continue on its path of growth that it was on prior to the automotive meltdown. The company saw great revenue growth from 2000 – 2008, more than doubling in size from $17 billion to over $38 billion. The company took a dip in 2009 back below $30 billion but has recovered back to a TTM in 2010 of $34 billion. There is no reason to believe that the company cannot make its move back to where it was in 2008 and continue to grow from that level. The company’s growth in China will be able to add more revenues onto the top of the 2008 levels.Additionally, on the financial side, Johnson Controls has been able to maintain strong free cash flow through 2009 into the TTM. In its past quarter, the company reported $922 million in free cash flow. That number gives the company an 11% FCF margin, which is a good amount. I tend to worry about anything under 10%. Cash flow is important for JCI to be able continually research new products and open new distribution channels throughout China without taking on new debt. The company’s current ratio is 1.12, which is somewhat concering. The company has a lot of liabilities, but they have an improving debt to equity ratio. Financial health may be the only concerning matter for the company. Their quick ratio sits below 1. A sustained lull in the automotive industry could be very threatening to the company.Competition for Johnson Controls comes from a number of companies in Magna International (NYSE:MGA), BorgWarner (NYSE:BWA), and TRW (TRA). Yet, Johnson is very specialized in its three-pronged approach with HVAC, batteries, and steering and has historical standings with the companies its supplies. The competition is there, but the company has proven results with its consumers. Its moat comes from its quality and consistency. Risk continues to exist from the company’s inability to diversify itself, and its dependence on the automotive industry. The company has some bright prospects in the electric battery industry and moving into China.ValuationMy fair value estimate for Johnson Controls Inc. is $35 per share based on a discounted cash-flow analysis. The company had seen incredible growth in its operating income in the eight years leading up to 2006, and there is really no worry that the industry cannot continue to grow as demand continues to grow in Americas, China and other markets. Given the development of new markets, the company’s wide distribution market, and development into new markets, the company is continuing to offer growth in its revenue. However, the stock appears to be pretty fairly valued currently given the stock’s 20% growth of late.JCI is a buy below $27, and it is a sell above $43.RiskRisk is low with Johnson Controls. The company is the leader in auto parts, and the company has a great future as recovery hits the USA. Further, as the company enters into China, the company has terrific avenues with already established companies in which they are involved. The company will need to continue to grow its margins, reduce its short term debt, and continue to operate under its similar recipe for success it has had for the past 125 years.Disclosure: No positions"
174717,21568,2009-11-22T09:35:41-05:00,,"By Michael KanellosJohnson Controls (NYSE:JCI) will informally refer to itself as the IBM of green building and in many ways the analogy is apt. Both companies have extensive histories. The Milwaukee-based company just announced another quarterly dividend, the latest in a streak that stretches back to 1887.And, like IBM, the company is pervasive in its field. Johnson is one of the principal contractors behind the retrofit of the Empire State Building. It also employs 800 LEED-accredited employees. Thus, what the company does will have some impact on the market. (It also received a $299 million grant to develop transportation batteries earlier this year.)We recently spoke to Don Albinger, vice president of renewable energy solutions. Here's what's on his mind:• Performance-based contracts continue to gain popularity, particularly with public sector companies like schools or government agencies. In these agreements, a contractor performs a retrofit and then guarantees certain reductions in energy consumption, etc. If they miss, the owner gets a refund. The contracts are similar to energy services contracts, in which the contractor gets paid through a portion of the energy saved, but there are differences.• Industrial solar steam is taking off. In these systems, heat from the sun is exploited to run industrial boilers. ""It is about a 40 percent efficient process. Solar thermal has advantages we need to capitalize on,"" he said.• Although biomass has been gathering interest in some parts of the country, it is being challenged by the relatively low price of natural gas.• One of the next waves in the industry will involve around tying building energy management systems to other enterprise applications. HVAC will be linked to building security applications and both will be integrated into financial and other applications. This will make energy savings and efficiency more dynamic and easier to measure. The company worked on a project like this with the state of Missouri, which has helped cut millions out of operating budgets.• And of course, customers looking at ways to cut power bills should always think about reducing consumption before putting up solar panels.""You've got to stop the building from losing energy before you start putting in new capital equipment,"" he said."

Especially in this time of extreme market volatility, having a plan to deal with price moves, whether they be on the upside or downside, is essential.  In my own case, each of my holdings has sale points determined at their time of purchase whether it be a partial sale of 1/7th of my holding as the stock appreciates in price, or a complete sale of the holding should the stock decline 8% (or 16% if in the last 5 of my maximum of 20 positions), or at other set points should the stock have previously appreciated and experienced partial sales of that holding.These sales drive my own responses to the market.  On the downside, I either 'sit on my hands' with the proceeds (if I am above 5 positions) or I replace that holding with a new holding of smaller size.  In any case, these downside sales drive my portfolio towards cash and away from equities.  I am simply trying to ""listen"" to my stocks as they let me know like that canary in the coal mine whether it is a 'good time' to be investing, or rather a 'bad time' and I should enjoy whatever cash position I can possibly possess.Johnson Controls (NYSE:JCI) is a rather new position in my minimum of 5 holdings.  These holdings have been decreasing in size in a planned fashion.  Tuesday morning, I sold 13 shares of my 95 share position at $20.36, 1/7th of my holding, as it hit and passed my first appreciation target which is at a 30% gain over an initial purchase.  I had just purchased these 95 shares on 11/20/08, not much more than two weeks ago, at a cost basis of $14.83.  Thus with the sale at $20.36, this represented a gain of $5.53/share or 37.3%.  It turned out to be a timely sale because as the market dipped later in the day, JCI also turned lower and closed at $19.44, down $.09 on the day.With a sale at an appreciation of a holding, I now have a 'buy signal' to add a new 6th position to my portfolio.  I shall be waiting for a suitable stock to come along that meets my own criteria for stock selection and shall keep you posted."
111650,21011,2008-12-19T15:36:13-05:00,,"We may be on the cusp of a great global boom in the automotive industry. That may be hard to believe, given all the ink spilled on the troubles at the mossbacked mastodons known as GM (NYSE:GM), Ford (NYSE:F) and Chrysler. But there are reasons to believe something big is afoot here in the land of wheels. And the investment opportunities it opens up are surprising.The first little nugget comes from The Economist, which points out that in 2008, for the first time ever, consumers in Brazil, Russia, India and China (the BRIC countries) bought more cars than U.S. consumers. The year, despite all its troubles, may still hit 59 million vehicle sales, an all-time record. By the end of this decade, which is not far off, China will pass the U.S. as the world’s largest auto market.All that must give even the most gloomy mind reason to pause. It gets better, though. Yes, all those cars will need roads. But perhaps even more interesting is to think about what will power the cars of the future.Someday, most of these new cars may be electric or hybrids. This is not some pie-in-the-sky vision. China - and the rest of the emerging markets - has an opportunity to leapfrog technologies here, just as it did with communications. China isn’t laying out miles and miles of phone lines. The country is going wireless. In the same way, don’t expect China to invest heaping piles of money in gas stations.So reasons Alex Molinaroli of Johnson Controls (NYSE:JCI), which makes car parts and specializes in battery technology. He thinks electric vehicles in China on a large scale could well happen before they do in the U.S. “They don’t have the legacy costs chasing them around,” he says, referring to America’s vast network of service stations and all that supports them.Whether that happens or not is beside the main point. The bigger idea is that we’re moving into an era when electric cars are going to be a big part of the pie, rather than a novelty. It is only a matter of time. “Just about every manufacturer is now planning to launch vehicles with hybrid powertrains within the next few years,” reports The Economist. In these so-called hybrid electric vehicles (NASDAQ:HEV), battery technology will play a big part. The battery market is hot right now.The above chart “Battery Market Booms” shows the growth in the size of the rechargeable battery market by battery type over the years. In 2008, despite all the economic woes plaguing nearly everything, the market really took off.A Key Resource in Batteries is LithiumBut there is another interesting material in the mix, too. And here we get to the surprising opportunity. If you look at that chart again, you’ll see lithium-ion batteries have come to dominate the market. In its last conference call, OM management said that “even with the recent global economic uncertainty, the lithium-ion battery market is expected to grow by 6-8% in 2009,” which is about half of the 2008 growth rate, but healthy, nonetheless.Note it’s lithium-ion, not nickel, batteries. As HardAssetInvestor.com notes: “While calling the winner in the battle of the HEVs’ battery technologies is currently impossible, one thing is clear: The winning technology will be lithium based.”The automobile will continue to be an important and highly prized product.

Rather than buy the manufacturers of these cars, or even the makers of the batteries, it may be more profitable to look at what goes in the batteries - lithium, for instance."

The only thing Tyco has done in the last month was register to sell ""from time to time an indeterminate amount of debt securities, preference shares, common shares, purchase contracts, depositary shares, warrants, units and guarantees of debt securities"" (thank you, Dow Jones and Reuters for the quote).That’s hardly incendiary.Trading volume has remained steady throughout the fall, and the company’s fundamentals are still solid. Tyco just raised its quarterly dividend 33%. And the company actually moved up its fiscal-2008 guidance about 10% in July.Tyco owns international alarm security company ADT (to be fair, I have to tell you that we’ve used their alarm system in our apartment for the last two years, but that has little to do with the share price.).The company sells fire protection products (fire alarms, sprinkler systems and specialty fire extinguishers, among other things) and commercial security devices (closed-circuit TV cameras, ink tags for store merchandise and building keycard entry systems) in a collection of eight other subsidiaries.The security and protection racket isn’t going to suffer from a recession. In fact, as crime rises (which happens in a recession), so do the number of home security systems and building alarms.This stock shouldn’t stay down for long. It’s been trading at between $40 and $50 for the last year. And according to the Omaha Principle, this is exactly when we should be buying shares: TYC is a steal at $30 (but give it a few days, you may be able to get in even cheaper).Tyco is another example of good shares gone bad because of market influences. The company is solid. The share price will return to normal levels.And I’m not the only one who thinks so. Zacks, Fitch and Standard and Poor’s have all rated Tyco as undervalued in the last month.

Below are some highlights from the above linked analysis:Company Description: Johnson Controls Inc. supplies building controls and energy management systems, automotive seating, and batteries.Fair Value: I consider four calculations of fair value, see page 2 of the linked PDF for a detailed description:
Avg. High Yield Price
20-Year DCF Price
Avg. P/E Price
Graham Number
JCI is only trading at a discount to 3 above. If I exclude the high and low valuations and average the remaining two, JCI is trading at a 10.7% premium. JCI had a Star deducted for trading at a premium in excess of 5%. Dividend Analytical Data: In this section I consider five factors, see page 2 of the linked PDF for a detailed description:
Rolling 4-yr Div. > 15%
Dividend Growth Rate
Years of Div. Growth
1-Yr. > 5-Yr Growth
Payout 15% of avg.
In this section, JCI earned one Star for 3 above. JCI has paid a cash dividend to shareholders every year since 1887 and has increased its dividend payments for 33 consecutive years.Dividend Income vs. MMA: Why would you assume the equity risk and invest in a dividend stock if you could earn a better return in a much less risky money market account [MMA]? This section compares the earning ability of this stock with a high yield MMA. In this section, two items are considered. See page 2 of the linked PDF for a detailed description:
NPV MMA Diff.
Years to >MMA
JCI earned no Stars in this section, and had one Star deducted for a negative NPV MMA Diff. The negative NPV MMA Diff. means that on a NPV basis for every $1,000 invested in JCI you would earn $855 less than a MMA earning a 20-year average rate of 4.61%. If JCI grows its dividend at 13.0% per year, it will never equal the cumulative earnings from a MMA yielding an estimated 20-year average rate of 4.61%.Other: JCI is a member of the S&P 500, a Dividend Aristocrat and a member of the Broad Dividend Achievers™ Index. JCI is a well-managed company with a strong balance sheet. In the near-term, the weak domestic auto market will be a drag on JCI's results. Other concerns include higher costs for raw materials and pricing pressure from customers..Conclusion: JCI lost one Star in the Fair Value section, earned one Star in the Dividend Analytical Data section and lost one Star in the Dividend Income vs. MMA section for a net total of negative one Star. Since my scale bottoms out at zero, this quantitatively ranks JCI as a 0 Star-Avoid stock.  Using my D4L-PreScreen.xls model, I determined the share price would have to drop to $23.84 before JVI's NPV MMA Diff. increases to the $3,000 NPV MMA Diff. that I like to see. At that price, JCI would yield 2.18%.Resetting the D4L-PreScreen.xls model and solving for the dividend growth rate needed to generate the $3,000 NPV MMA Differential I'm looking for, the calculated rate is 16.6%. This dividend growth rate is well above the 13.0% used in this analysis. JCI won't find its way into my income portfolio with results like this.Disclaimer: Material presented here is for informational purposes only.

Other chillers using sweet water cooling towers for heat rejection could have consumed up to 1300 gallons per minute of sweet water to make up for evaporation from the cooling towers. • Titanium is highly resistant to both erosion and corrosion.

16th.  For more reasons than I have time to blog, I am going to predict
they announce in-line, and either reiterate or up guidance (and if
they do beat or up guidance, it will be marginal). I think last
quarter they were being conservative with numbers because of fears in
the economy that they couldn’t control - despite them verbally saying
otherwise. In the last conference call, they said something to the effect of, ""We
don’t see the extreme downside that economists are pointing to and
other companies are foreshadowing/blaming"" (I paraphrased that quote).
The street didn’t get the raised guidance it was expecting, nor liked
that stance. That could mean two things - 1. They are dumb, and things
slowed down, so they will miss. I’m more optimistic and to lean towards
- 2. They are smart, the market didn’t believe them, and since they are
an international brand and well diversified with a very long term
backlog, things will be okay for them. My conclusion is their
conservatism, combined with the economy not slowing as much as the stock
priced in, could give the shares a boost this week.They recently announced that they are going to be one of the 12 suppliers of an expected $10B contract,
spread over 5 years. That can hypothetically add a number
somewhere around $166M per year in revenue. This is nearly
negligible to JCI’s revenue, however I’m hoping JCI is going to supply
more than one twelfth of the work. The $166M figure comes from the
math that $10B/(5 years x 12 companies) = $166M. Some recent analyst commentary contained negative things regarding the outlook for 2009. 
That’s too far away to accurately predict right now. A very respected
economist, whom I know personally, said recently, “We have never been in more
economically uncertain times.” Seriously - the fed cuts vs. not cuts -
Fed lends vs. not lends - China’s growth slows fast vs. slows slowly -
India ramps up the army of engineers faster or slower - all these
things can swing the story of 2009. I leave 2009 in the hands of the
capable management at Johnson Controls, who have
an extremely great track-record of delivering. I stay optimistic, and side with Robert Baird. Then again, I’m crossing my fingers they have an off quarter and I get to load up on shares under $30 - for the long haul.Disclosure: Long JCI and short puts for 2009."

(NYSE:JCI) has long been one of

my favorite energy efficiency picks, with an added bonus coming from their joint

venture with  Saft

to produce batteries for hybrid and electric vehicles. 

They have also shown some energy saving innovation making parts for auto

interiors. Building EfficiencyEfficient buildings are much more complex than

simply replacing inefficient HVAC and lighting with more efficient

versions.  Quite often, the most cost effective measures come from using

systems more efficiently.  As an analogy to the home, look at any list of

quick tips for energy saving around the home. This

list of ten steps on Squidoo includes five tips for using existing equipment more

wisely (programming your thermostat, cleaning air filters, loading your

dishwasher fully, and only using the dryer when you can't air-dry.) Considering

Squidoo is quite clearly trying to make money by referring people to Amazon

to buy products, it's all the more significant that half of the steps need not involve buying

anything.In commercial and industrial buildings, the most economical gains

also involve using existing equipment more wisely.  They offer a full

suite of products focused on automation and integration to businesses and residential

(with the recent York acquisition) customers alike. Building efficiency

systems comprise about one third of 2007 revenues.

Batteries and Automotive Power SystemsJohnson Controls' joint

venture with Saft has been making headlines recently, no doubt in large

part due to Johnson Controls automotive industry network.  The partnership

has won contracts to supply batteries to Chinese auto manufacturers Chery

and SIAC for their Hybrid electric vehicles, and a battery development

contract from GM to develop

Li-ion batteries for GM's Saturn Vue Green Line Plug-in Hybrid (NYSE:GM).I'm

extremely enthusiastic about the growth prospects of the automotive battery

industry, the reasons for which I detailed in

this article about another battery company, and this one about the long term

prospects

for cellulosic biofuels.  The power systems division comprises about

one third of 2007 revenues.JCI also supplies automotive battery management

systems and power systems, with a focus on energy savings, as part of their

automotive division described below.

Auto interiorsEnergy savings can come from unexpected places...

like car seats.  Johnson Controls' EcoClimate

seat provides much higher heat absorption and moisture absorption than

conventional seating, which in turn provides for passenger comfort with less

use of the vehicle's air conditioner.  New

bio based materials may also appeal to automotive consumers concerned about environmental

health effects and fossil fuel usage.  About half of JCI's 2007 sales were

in this division, but most of the company's growth comes from the other two divisions.ConclusionsWith

half of the companies 2007 revenues coming from two of my favorite alternative energy

sectors (efficient buildings and automotive batteries), and these parts of the

company growing much more rapidly than the auto parts division (which is likely

to be a great competitive advantage in selling batteries and power systems to

automakers,) JCI is a must for alternative energy investors attracted by the superior

economics of energy efficiency.  The stock has declined

significantly since the start of the year, but it currently seems only fairly

valued to me at the current price of around $34.  However, a decline in

auto sales caused by a slowing economy, along with an increased

debt burden due to recent acquisitions could easily hurt short-term

profits.  With continued stock market weakness, patient investors could

easily see some excellent buying opportunities in the next 6-12

months.  If we do, I will be buying more.

I like his rate of growth projections and how he “takes a pass” if they don’t see at least 15%-16%.
Warren Buffett never paid a dividend because he believed he could invest more wisely than any of his shareholders.   That’s essentially what Roell says, in a different way. That is, the same logic holds true for share buy-backs.  A company should only do this if it does not have any sound investments to pursue.  
Roell is pursuing rather than leveraging shareholders at increasing rates.  That said, JCI does pay a small dividend, and I think there is a small buy-back plan in place.  
Larry Smith is a highly respected, highly informed, highly driven, economics professor at the University of Waterloo. Specifically, Smith’s wisdom applies to Roell’s answer of the second question.  It’s difficult and lengthy to put into words, but simply, I like leaders who exhibit “a little contrarian” style.

I know past performance does not guarantee future results, but from all the lazy portfolios out there, JCI deserves a “thank-you”. The management at Johnson Controls has had 67 years of sales increases and they are going on their 18th consecutive year of earnings increases.What makes JCI easy to own is its diversification. It’s like 3 investments in one, and each are still small enough to grow. The “Buildings” segment earnings account for half of the profitability of JCI and it’s been the more successful segment growing due to the demand for industry to be more environmentally conscious. The automotive sector is the weakest performing and the largest segment in terms of sales however margins on the power solutions make Johnson Controls a well oiled machine.At $40 JCI is a bargain, and it’s likely because the stock is often labeled as strictly an automotive parts supplier. While it’s partly true, as discussed above it clearly is not. However, North American investors know the automotive industry is not growing at all, except China’s automotive production is up an estimated 25% according to Johnson’s management. Johnson Controls is one of the companies who is supplying automotive interiors and batteries to the companies producing these cars. So in a way, JCI is mislabeled for the exact reason it’s a safe way to add a piece of the growth in China to a lazy investor’s portfolio. Another reason not to shrug JCI off as “just an automotive supplier” is the fact that they sell after market batteries. Whether or not people are buying new cars in North America, they still need to buy car batteries. These are repeatable sales, that people won’t “go without” if the economy slows down.Looking to the future, the management has forecasted 10% increases in sales and 18% increase in earnings. The mean of the analysts at Marketwatch.com agree that company is being conservative and will outperform it’s own guidance. The company does have a track record of not missing earnings.

And talk about consistency - both the 10-year average and the 5-year average are 15.06%! Its equity growth rate has been superb over the last 10 years. And dare I say, consistently superior! The 9 year average is 16.08%. The 5 year average is 17.57%. The 3 year average is 17.13% and last year’s equity growth rate was 19.61%. And its earnings per share growth rate has followed in step with equity growth rate. The 9 year average is 16.65%; the 5 year average is 15.16%; and last year’s EPS growth rate was 23.53%. Last but not least is the sales growth rate. And once again, nice consistency with JCI delivering 11%-12% sales growth. From the fundamentals, this company looks fantastic. Let’s see how the dividend fundamentals look. Dividend Fundamentals: Johnson Controls Inc is currently sporting a 1.11% dividend yield. This is low in comparison with the dividend yield available from the S&P500 Index, and the DJIA. Now, something I like to see is solid dividend growth. And JCI has delivered to the tune of 11.40% over the 10 year period. Over 5 years, it is 13.48%. Last year’s dividend growth rate was 12%, which is a solid growth rate, and exactly what I like to see. The dividend payout ratio is low, currently sitting at 20.51%. In fact, it has been steadily decreasing over the 10-year period from a high of 36.29%. Once again, this is a huge plus. And cash flow to pay for these dividends? Over the 10-year period, its cash flow growth rate has been 9.94%. And, it has remained very steady in that 9%-10% range. Last year’s cash flow growth rate was 17.18%. Like the company fundamentals, this stock is a winner. Now let’s see how the valuations look. Valuation Models: From a yield perspective, this stock is expensive. The 5-year average high dividend yield is 1.96%. And for the last 3 years, the high dividend yield has been 1.89%, 1.9% and 1.87% respectively. So, it is really consistent. Unfortunately, JCI currently has a 1.11% dividend yield. For my model price, I will demand a yield of 1.96% which makes my model price $67.35. At the current price of $118.85, that means a premium of 76.47%. And Graham would agree. The Graham number delivers a price of $71.39 which is a premium of 66.47%. For my discounted present value, I used the following inputs: With these inputs, the model price is $96.83. But that price doesn’t make sense because in order to get my dividend yield of 1.96%, I should not be willing to pay more than $67.35. Check my calculations for JCI. Here is the one year stock price chart: ,   This stock has been an absolute superstar! In September of 2006, you could have purchased this stock for just under $70. That is right around my dividend yield model price! Conclusion: My analysis shows that JCI is a superstar dividend payer. Unfortunately, its non-stop price climb has put this one way out of reach for a reasonable price. But I will definitely add this to my watch list. Patience young grasshopper, as good things come to those who wait. Full Disclosure: I do not own any shares in JCI (yet!)."

38001,20124,2007-06-11T13:02:47-04:00,,"Tyco International (TYC) has set a date for its long awaited breakup. Shareholders as of June 18th will receive shares in two new publicly traded entities, Covidien and Tyco Electronics, on June 29th. Covidien is Tyco's healthcare unit. There's no need to buy the shares before the spin-off, as there will be a greater likelihood of one or more mispricings immediately after the spin-off. There is now sufficient public data for investors to value each of the parts: Tyco spin-off information You'll want to have your own estimates in hand before June 29th, so you can jump on any substantial discount that might exist within the first few days. Obviously, you'll want to have three estimates: What is Covidien worth? What is Tyco Electronics worth? And what is Tyco (ex Covidien and Tyco Electronics worth)?. Using a bit of sixth grade algebra, you'll be able to work back and forth from the pie to the slices and from the slices to the pie. As far as spin-offs go, this one may not present terrific mispricings as each entity will be quite large. However, I'm always amazed by how cheap spin-offs get – even when the spun-off entity is relatively large and well-known. The fact that Tyco is splitting into three different pieces makes this one even more interesting. Also, as a large company, any spin-off discount may be corrected dramatically in a matter of months as comparisons with industry peers will be very easy to make relative to the unwieldy conglomerate that was. My advice would be to come up with estimates for each of the pieces and the price at which you would buy any of the three stocks before June 29th. A lot of otherwise intelligent investors have a bad habit of waiting for a better price on a spin-off when the price they get is good enough. Generally, I think you can accept a slightly smaller margin of safety on a spin-off, because the spin-off itself is a sufficient catalyst to prevent a wide discount from continuing to exist over a long period of time. In other words, it's somewhat more likely that a spin-off will close the valuation gap within a year or so rather than three years or so when compared to other similarly mispriced stocks. This last bit of advice is for people like me who tend to be willing to accept a long wait after buying a stock at a wide discount from some clearly ascertainable economic value, because the initial discount was wide enough to allow for an acceptable annual return even after a painfully long waiting period. Spin-offs tend to involve more change both in terms of the company itself and in terms of investor perceptions of the company. Therefore, a reasonable catalyst allowance might be permissible – so if for instance you are in the habit of buying stocks at half of your intrinsic value estimate, you might want to consider a spin-off priced as high as two-thirds of its intrinsic value. I make this suggestion only because I have seen quite a few investors wait for a better price on a spin-off that they knew was an excellent opportunity, simply because they were convinced it would come down to their price. Come up with a hard estimate before the spin-off and save yourself the trouble of wondering if the stock price will fall or not. Just worry about buying something for less than you calculated it to be worth. TYC 1-yr chart:"

The higher estimates reflect firm's belief that Building Efficiency margins expand to 8.5% (previously 7.5%) by the end of the decade. While corporate margins should move from an all-time low to an all-time high over the next 10 quarters, they believe their model is still conservative in many aspects. BAC's 12 month target goes to $135 from $120 and they reiterate the Buy. - Goldman Sachs notes they increasingly see the Building Efficiency segment as JCI's primary growth engine, as it leverages cross sell opportunities through York, particularly in higher margin services, and as it reaps the benefits from efficiency gains in York's manufacturing footprint. A growing amount of ""green"" option value also exists, in firm's view, especially if regulation around building energy consumption levels gains traction. GSCO's tgt goes to $115 from $95 with Buy rating reiterated. - Baird says earnings climbed 36%, exceeding consensus by 6%. While not a ""great"" quarter (pretax income just below expectations), this reinforces the strong business model with controls, battery, and foreign automotive businesses all performing very well. They believe this is the start of several quarters of 20%-plus EPS growth. Firm is meaningfully raising estimates on higher revenue growth (euro and new business) and modestly higher margin assumptions noting their new price is $109 and could exceed $130 when valuation model rolls forward late this year. Maintains Outperform. Notablecalls: Strong results powered JCI stock to a new all-time high on Friday. There was some initial selling but buyers soon took over, lifting the stock by as much as 4 bucks from day low. This kind of action usually indicates further upside to come. Also, the analyst community is out positive on the stock today, with BAC raising their targt to $135 and Baird saying they expect their tgt to exceed $130 later this year. I would not be surprised to see JCI probe the $105 level, maybe as soon as today. JCI 1-yr chart:"

Firm expects strong revenue growth in the company's building efficiency segment to be the primary growth driver, followed by its best-in-class battery business. Margin expansion is expected to occur in all segments. Option value around the ""green"" theme lends support and offers potentially sizable longer-term upside, especially if building efficiency concerns become more widespread, as they expect they will.
Notablecalls: I highlighted JCI as a potential long already on Monday, after the stock broke to a new all-time high helped by stronger than expected Q1 results. JCI has a lot going for it (margin expansion, the green theme) and I expect GSCO's call to generate some further buy interest in the name today."

26142,20271,2007-02-06T04:33:14-05:00,,"Harley Davidson (NYSE:HOG), Coach (COH), Herman Miller (NASDAQ:MLHR), Johnson Controls (NYSE:JCI). . . the tie that binds these companies together is that their fortunes often rise or fall with the economy. As data last Wednesday showed, economic growth in the United States is humming along, having grown at a surprisingly fast 3.5 percent clip in the final months of 2006. The numbers suggest favorable momentum for the first part of 2007 - and for companies that rely on economic health. Of the names that made it onto the Reuters Select stock screens, auto and truck parts company Johnson Controls, Inc. (JCI) was ahead of the pack. Strength in personal spending helped drive the fourth-quarter expansion. Indeed, personal consumption expenditures climbed throughout 2006. It started off on a strong note, advancing at a seasonally adjusted annualized rate [SAAR] of 4.8 percent in the first quarter, according to government figures. The pace of growth then slowed to 2.6 percent in the second quarter. But, it picked up in the third and fourth quarters, growing 4.4 percent in the final three months of last year. Given the on-going strength in personal consumption expenditures, we wanted to zero in on companies that have been growing relatively quickly. We started with the 399 companies in the consumer cyclical sector and then filtered for those names that appeared on at least one of the Reuters Select stock screens. This shortened our list to 26. (Click here for an Excel sheet comparing these companies.) To narrow the list further, we filtered for companies that posted revenue and earnings-per-share [EPS] growth rates above the averages for their respective industries in the trailing 12-month [TTM] period. This left us with 14 names. It isn't enough that the growth rates are faster than the industry benchmarks, we also want some measure of quality. For this, we examined measures of management effectiveness and we filtered for companies that have generated superior return on equity [ROE] in the TTM span. We also want companies that have been doing well over a longer period of time, so we extended our search for better-than-average ROE numbers to the last five years. This resulted in six companies.  Often, companies that are growing faster than their peers command premium valuations, and we want stocks that have reasonable price tags. Filtering for companies that are trading at price to earnings [P/E] and P/Sales ratios that are south of their industry averages left us with two companies.  These below-average valuation metrics also helped Johnson Controls land on the Relative Value stock screen. The screen is designed to highlight companies that are reasonably priced on the basis of key metrics. For instance, it requires that a company's P/E and P/Sales ratios are no more than 10 percent above the industry averages. Given our stricter criteria here, it is not surprising to also find Johnson Controls on the Relative Value screen. The P/E and P/Sales ratios above are based on TTM EPS and revenue. It is also important to take into consideration valuation based on expectations of future performance. Specifically, we look at the PEG ratio, which is the forward P/E - P/E ratio based on analyst estimates for future EPS - divided by the average analyst estimate for long-term EPS growth rate. While conservative value-oriented investors generally prefer to focus on companies with PEG ratios below 1.00, numbers a bit north of this threshold are still reasonable. We filtered for the stock that had PEG readings, based on EPS for this year and next, below 2.00. This is where Johnson Controls stood out. This is also where Johnson Controls satisfied the final valuation requirement of the Relative Value screen. Much like our search criteria, the screen hones in on companies with PEG readings below 2.00. According to a recent Reuters poll, analysts following Johnson Controls expect the company to register EPS of $6.03 in fiscal year ending September 2007. They believe EPS will hit $7.01 in fiscal 2008. Given its current stock price of about $91.40, Johnson Controls is priced at forward P/E ratios of about 15.16 and 13.04, respectively. Dividing these ratios by the analyst mean estimate for the rate of future EPS growth of 13.5 percent, we see that Johnson Controls has PEG ratios of 1.12 and 0.97, respectively.

25066,20442,2007-01-25T05:12:07-05:00,,"Hollywood loves Dennis Kozlowski. With him and Kenneth Lay, they have perfect character studies to keep scripting ""big business"" as a something to be loathed, an evil coalition of men in suits who want to take everybody's money, blow up the ozone layer and kick puppies all at the same time. For all we know, maybe Kozlowski did want to do all of these things but in looking at the current CEO of Tyco (TYC), we see that Ed Breen is a man of high moral character and commitment to shareholder value. I have had the opportunity to hear Ed Breen speak, twice in the last two years, at our alma mater, Grove City College. Breen graduated from the college in 1978 and worked in the broadband and cable industry before moving into the role of President and COO of Motorola in 2001. He was named CEO of Tyco in July of 2002. Once in that role, he cleaned house of the corruption that Kozlowski left behind. He immediately fired the board who hired him and gutted the upper management positions. Starting Anew  Of the 300 employees at Tyco's headquarters in Princeton, only 12 remain that were at the company before Breen. He wanted to start fresh and needed a clean slate to establish shareholder trust and he has achieved just that, with share prices far outpacing the S&P and bringing tremendous return since he took over. Breen is a conservative, responsible CEO. Grove City's academic curriculum has always been based on strong moral convictions and rigorous academic standards. They have been ranked by Barron's as one of the 52 most competitive colleges in the nation. He was so grateful for his education there that he just donated 5.5 million dollars to the school.    Breen has utilized these values and has made it a top priority to reduce Tyco's debt, which was at $26 billion, to the company's current amount of $9 billion. The company was left in shambles by Kozlowski and Breen pulled off a remarkable turnaround. He has rolled out hundreds of six sigma programs within the company and stated that he would get rid of an individual business if it wasn't at the top of its industry. That brings us to Tyco's current state, where it's about to split its business into three entities. The company's current share price is $31 and has been hovering around the mid to high 20's for the past year. Revenue growth has been unimpressive and the company spin-off hasn't generated much excitement. The street really couldn't be more disinterested in the company as the company's P/E (15), operating margins and ROE are below industry and sector averages. JPMorgan analyst C. Stephen Tusa summed it up by saying ""Perhaps the most favorable thing one can say about Tyco is that most everybody is pessimistic about the company."" The street is down on the company and the share price has been flat-lining. Nice Returns Anticipated  With that in mind, let the contrarian investors rejoice! Company spin-offs can become very profitable (we've recently seen an ETF focus on this - CSD), as their management becomes more focused, has less constraints to maneuver around and a smaller bureaucracy to deal with. T. Rowe Price analyst Peter Bates expects $15-17 a share for the health care unit, $12-14 a share for the electronics unit and $11-14 a share for the fire-and-security unit. This points to upper range growth of 45% and lower range growth of 22%. Barron's highlighted the stock in their Jan 8th issue and Jim Cramer focused on Tyco Tuesday night (1/23), both anticipating each division of Tyco to benefit from higher P/E's. T. Rowe Price has been building their stake in Tyco as they anticipate nice returns from the spin-off. Ed Breen will take over the fire-and-security division, under which ADT falls. Kozlowski left ADT in shambles and it is just now turning the corner. Breen's decision to man the entity that needs the most work should prove to be a positive one. His track record at Tyco speaks for itself and he will right the ship in the fire-and-security division. Breen is a man of great integrity and shareholders of Tyco can be secure in knowing that the CEO will do his best to maintain a strong balance sheet, focused business and profitable future.

The author, while possibly holding a biased opinion, graduating from the same college as Ed Breen, did not receive any of his $5.5 million dollar gift to the school. TYC 1-yr chart"

18861,20282,2006-10-19T21:27:03-04:00,,"Most people are familiar with Tyco through the high-profile convictions of Dennis Kozlowski and Mark Swartz (they appealed their convictions in early October). Yes, it has been a rough few years for the company due to these scandals.  The revelations may get even worse. Another executive, Raymond Scott Anderson, recently pled guilty to falsifying tax returns back in 1999. Anderson has agreed to cooperate with prosecutors, so we’ll see if any more news emerges. Despite these stains on its reputation, Tyco is actually an excellent company. Its ADT security systems are among the best and most popular in the industry. Tyco also has excellent electronics, healthcare, and engineered products divisions. Its profit margins are near 10%, which are good for the industry, and the company is currently working hard to improve profitability. It has tried to make its inventory management more efficient and has cut employee costs, and it recently discontinued its Plastics and Adhesives division, which was hampering the company’s profitability. Tyco has little debt and pays a modest dividend. But there are reasons to be cautious beyond the bad publicity. Tyco’s growth has been pretty weak for the past couple of years. Last year showed a 25% jump in revenues, but that came from just one quarter; the rest of the year was in a lull. This year has shown minimal growth over 2005. The company recently backed off a controversial options-backdating policy after receiving a warning from an outside compensation consulting company -- which makes me wonder a bit. Of course, the electrical divisions have to contend with the soaring price of copper. Commodity prices have really taken a bite out of numerous businesses. If you’re not discouraged by the scandal headlines, you might be able to make some money on this stock -- if you buy at the right price. But I wouldn’t pick it up if you’re looking for rapid growth. Type of stock: A solid industrial company that makes excellent products despite some major (historical) management scandals. But Tyco is in the right growth areas and poised for a come back as Wall Street looks for undervalued alternatives. Price target: At $29 today, this is a volatile stock.

        Conservative street estimates.
        Compelling long-term value.","Q3 PreviewIt has been two years since my original report, and I was hoping to publish an update before Q3 results are out later today, but it now looks like it will have to wait until later this week. In the update I will discuss the company’s performance so far relative to my expectations in 2018, as well as the Hindenburg report released this summer.That being said, I did want to share a couple of observations on the stock going into Q3.Source: BloombergThat being said, I am actually quite optimistic about company’s short-term prospects.Current consensus estimates for Q3 contemplate Adjusted EBITDA of $137M[1] vs. $135M earned last year, representing 1.5% increase. These estimates appear to me to be somewhat conservative when we consider the following:Based on the above I would not be shocked if the company reports a record breaking Q3 that exceeds $150M. However, given the strong negative sentiment evidenced in the high short interest going into the quarter, even results that just meet expectations are likely to be perceived as a bullish sign by the market.Disclaimer: The information contained herein reflects the views of the author as of the date of publication.

4358346,21815,2020-07-14T09:01:46-04:00,"A short report accuses the company of self-dealing and a lack of goodwill impairment, things management vehemently disputes.While it's difficult to adjudicate who is right here, we think as long as the company delivers good results, it doesn't matter all that much, other cases show.And that the company does, although it is not entirely immune from the consequences of the pandemic.","J2 Global (JCOM) has been a reliable growth company operating mostly through acquisitions and producing significant amounts of cash flow. But now there is controversy, the result of claims by shorters of self-dealing and lack of goodwill impairment which management vehemently denies.While we do not brush off these accusations all that lightly and are not able to provide any verdict, we think similar cases show that they ultimately matter less than the company's performance, which is remaining good despite some pandemic headwind. As a result, the shares have become attractive.At first sight there isn't really a lot going wrong with J2 Global:Data by YChartsYes, the company guides some revenue declines for Q2 and withdrew guidance for the year as a whole, but this is hardly a surprise, given the circumstances, and it's fairly low key, their business seems to be in good shape and the company is still producing significant amounts of cash. Yet the shares have, well, crashed:It isn't a surprise that they're down from their pre-pandemic heights, but given the fairly mild effect of the pandemic on their business, the extent of the fall, especially in light of what happened in the rest of the market, is surprising.The answer is of course the short report from Hindenburg, which accuses J2 Global of a history of self-dealing.This obviously isn't something we can settle here, we do have a few pointers though, starting with the shorting business in general. We have nothing against shorting stocks, but we have to point out that reports like this one from Hindenburg have a mixed track record at best, for a number of reasons:A market based solution for information asymmetries relies on reputation and the importance of repeat business (the more important the latter, the more valuable the first, obviously).That is, if a Tier-1 sell-side house like Goldman Sachs comes out in defense of the company, that is usually good enough for many investors. But this works both ways.There are well known short sellers like Carson Block, who had a few hits early in his career, and might have been tempted to exploit that reputation as subsequently the strike record came down quite a bit.We have seen recent reports from shorters about Intelligent Systems (INS) by Aurelius (curiously enough, the website has disappeared) or a short report by Citron Research on Ubiquiti (UI).While share prices in both cases predictably went south, in the case of Intelligent Systems quite heavily, both companies continued to produce stellar results and stock prices have gone up. Ubiquiti's shares are now over 3x the level they were at when Citron came out with their report.That doesn't necessarily tell you there is nothing wrong with these companies, but it at least shows that not all of these short reports do long-term damage as long as the company keeps delivering good results.Producing good results is what investors expect J2 Global to keep on doing, and why not, it's what they've been doing for a long time. There is a caveat here, as two of the central claims of the Hindenburg report are:Management disputes both claims, with respect to the latter it argues (from the above linked management response):It's only part of their answer (losses on some of its acquisitions are taken as losses on investments, not impairment of goodwill, for instance) and we'll leave that to accountants to adjudicate, but what we do know is this:Data by YChartsIt's a little more difficult to tamper with cash and the company is doing fine here. While Hindenburg worried that management suspended its dividend in 2019 because of a lack of cash, the company keeps on generating lots of it, enough to embark on a share buyback program and 1M shares were bought back in Q1 (albeit 250K of these, while executed in Q1 were paid for in Q2).Q1 results were still pretty good. From the earnings deck:But there is some growth reduction expected in Q2 as a result of the pandemic, guidance for the year is withdrawn and Q2 revenue will be slightly lower, sequentially, despite having roughly 6% points growth added in the quarter as a result of two acquisitions.Their $510M ad business, which might be expected to take a considerable hit, is holding up quite well, as it happens, for a variety of reasons:Their subscription based business (roughly $850M a year) has also been holding up quite well with few cancellations nor much of a notable slowdown in their subscriber ads.There are some businesses that are doing well, their Humble Publishing (games), their medical websites, but also their cloud fax business, their eVoice Meet product (encrypted videoconferencing) are obvious examples.CEO Vivek Shah also bought shares for $1M in the open market in March.Data by YChartsValuation multiples have reached their lowest point in five years (and probably longer), we think the shares have become outright cheap. Analysts expect EPS to come in at $6.96 this year, rising to $7.57 next year, giving the company an earnings multiple of 7, which is pretty ridiculous.Even going back to a 20x earnings multiple which is still well below the average of the last five years will see the shares at $140+, well over double where the shares are trading now.While we, like many other investors, are not in a position to adjudicate the claims and counterclaims of the shorters and management, we do think several things should be kept in mind:We are starting Shareholdersunite Portfolio, our marketplace, on the lookout for small companies whose stocks have multi-bag potential, as well as trading ideas and macro content.

4380488,104812,2020-10-22T04:37:07-04:00,"Shares of J2 Global have been under pressure despite a resilient operating and financial environment this year.The company generates significant free cash flow, which supports a new share buyback program that yields over 20% through 2025.While the outlook for near-term growth is modest, the fundamentals are strong, and we like the attractive valuation and see upside in shares through next year.","J2 Global Inc. (JCOM) is an internet services provider with an extensive portfolio of digital media and cloud-based service companies. Website brands like IGN, PCMag, and Mashable, among others, are recognized as market leaders with a global audience. The services and subscription business includes tools like online fax services, VPN, and e-mail security applications used by both consumers and commercial customers. While certain parts of the business have seen disruptions due to the pandemic this year, the overall financial profile remains solid with steady growth and strong cash flows. We are bullish on shares that offer attractive value heading into the upcoming Q3 earnings release scheduled for November 2nd. This is a high-quality stock with a positive long-term outlook.(Source: Finviz)In line with broader trends in technology companies, J2 Global's operating environment has been relatively resilient despite the pandemic. In the last-reported quarter, total revenues climbed by 2.7%, while adjusted EPS was 7.0% higher compared to the period in 2019. Notably, the adjusted EBITDA margin was up 340 basis points to 40.1%, driven by some cost-saving initiatives and the revenue mix. The positive earnings environment generated $116 million in free cash flow, up 35% y/y, a quarterly record for the company.(Source: Company IR)In terms of the operating segments, 6.9% y/y growth in digital media revenue was supported by strength in online advertising, which surprised management, as they had expected more weakness due to the pandemic. On the other hand, cloud services, which include various subscription-based businesses, saw revenues decline by 1.2%. The average monthly revenue per customer at $13.66 fell 2.5% y/y.J2 Global sees opportunities to drive growth through initiatives like bundling, along with ongoing investments to expand offerings. Management notes that the retention rate has remained steady, reflecting customer loyalty.J2 Global Brand Select Portfolio(Source: Company IR / image composite)During the conference call, management noted that excluding the divestment of jBlast in 2019, the cloud services segment revenue was flat on a year-over-year basis. Some products like the cloud fax services which have exposure to the healthcare and medical industry were pressured with lower volumes considering hospital facilities limited elective surgery procedures during the period, which typically use faxing services to send documents. The company expects this business to improve gradually going forward.Finally, J2 ended the quarter with approximately $711 million in cash and equivalents against $1.1 billion in long-term debt. Considering adjusted EBITDA of $561 million over the trailing twelve months, we calculate the net-debt to leverage ratio at 0.7x, highlighting a solid balance sheet.(Source: Company IR)While J2 Global does not pay a dividend, the company is using that higher free cash flow to support a new share repurchasing program that was authorized by the board of directors announced with the last quarterly results. It may buy back up to 10 million shares of the common stock through 2025. What's impressive is that considering the 47 million shares currently outstanding, the program can generate upwards of 20% value for shareholders over the period. This implied yield supports our bullish view of the stock.Another positive development last quarter was a reinstatement of full-year guidance. Management is targeting revenues between $1.38 billion and $1.4 billion this year, and expects positive adjusted EPS in a range between $7.17 and $7.41.(Source: Company IR)The current consensus estimates for 2020 for both revenue and EPS are within the management's guidance range. Looking ahead, the market sees revenues and earnings climbing by about 5% in 2021. Overall, the outlook is for steady and moderate growth over the next couple of years.(Source: Seeking Alpha)What we like about J2 Global's business is the relative diversification across the online properties. Even if one particular site of cloud service is seeing weaker trends, there is a good chance that another property may be presenting greater market share gains. As an example, one of the themes in the broader market this year was the growth of online gaming as consumers spent more time at home looking for entertainment options. J2 Global's gaming- and PC-focused websites like IGN.com and PCMag.com likely saw a surge of users with renewed interest, which helps add to the intrinsic value of the asset. Regardless of near-term volatility in the advertising sales or cost pressures, we believe the digital portfolio has a long-term positive outlook.Similarly, cloud services products on their own may be seen as a niche segment. We argue that there should be an optionality value with the possibility that one particular tool sort of takes off with accelerating user growth. Data shows that VPN (""Virtual Private Network"") usage surged during the pandemic for a variety of reasons, including the need for enhanced security for work-from-home arrangements. With several differentiated products targeting different users, J2 Global was likely well-positioned to capture these trends.The challenge for JCOM is that despite the overall strong fundamentals, the outlook for firm-wide sales and earnings growth in the mid-single digits over the next couple of years is hardly at a level to get excited about. By this measure, the company valuation currently trading at 9.4x consensus 2020 EPS represents a cautious outlook by the market. Still, we think the value here is attractive, and there is an upside to the consensus estimates.Data by YChartsJ2 Global is set to report its Q3 earnings on November 2nd. Current estimates are for revenue at $339 million, representing a 1.6% y/y decline, while a forecast for EPS of $1.76, if confirmed, would be 3.7% higher compared to the period in 2019. The expectation is that continued cost saving measures and efforts towards efficiencies drive margins higher. We believe there is an upside to the revenue estimate that could be supported through strength in the ads business related to the election.(Source: Seeking Alpha)The big takeaway here is that despite the recent share price weakness for JCOM, the fundamentals remain strong with consistent profitability and a rock-solid balance sheet. Overall, we rate shares of JCOM as a Buy, with a price target of $80.00 for the year ahead representing about 17% upside from the current level. The expectations for only modest growth in the coming year sets a low bar we believe the company can exceed.The risk here beyond a broader deterioration of the macro outlook is that it will be important for J2 Global to stabilize the recent trends in the cloud services business. Weaker-than-expected results could force a reset of earnings expectations and further pressure the stock lower. Monitoring points for the upcoming quarters include the evolution of financial margins and continued free cash flow generation."

(JCOM) called j2 Global Is A Sleeper, I indicated that the stock was ready to break out. 6 months later, the stock has in fact broken out to new all-time highs.(Source: Yahoo Finance/MS Paint)j2 Global manages a portfolio of internet businesses, 13 business units, and 40+ recognizable brands, including Mashable, PCMag, Speedtest, and Everyday Health. j2 Global has acquired more than 170 companies in the last two decades, struggling companies, and remakes them into profitable companies.(Source: j2 Global Earnings Slides Q1 2019)When it comes to software companies, I don't rely on traditional value factors; instead, I focus on other measures, such as the software company ""Rule of 40"" and relative valuation, a concept that I recently developed that compares forward sales multiple versus estimated sales growth.In the case of j2 Global, much of the company growth comes from M&A activity and the Rule of 40 wasn't conceived for companies that grow by acquisition. Therefore, I am going to put that metric aside and provide a more basic examination of fundamentals such as free cash flow margin and revenue growth. However, I will state for the record that company management is aware of the Rule of 40 and acquires companies that meet or are capable of meeting this metric.j2 Global had annual revenue growth of ~12%, a decline from the 5-year rate of almost 19%.(Source: Portfolio123)The decelerating growth rate is primarily a result of performance in the Cloud Services business with the dying backup business and slow growth of the cloud FAX business, once j2 Global's cash cow. In addition, the company is in the process of converting into a SaaS business. In 2018, 60% of revenues were by subscription, and every move management makes is now with recurring revenues in mind. The conversion to SaaS takes a toll on revenue growth in the short term.j2 Global's free cash flow margin TTM is a fairly strong 22.2%.(Source: Portfolio123)I determine stock valuation on a relative basis by comparing sales multiples and sales growth to the company's peers. I believe that high-growth companies should be more highly valued than slow-growth companies. After all, growth is a prime factor in valuation models such as DCF. Higher future growth results in higher valuation and, therefore, higher EV/sales multiple.To illustrate this point, I created a scatter plot of enterprise value/forward sales versus estimated Y-o-Y sales growth for the 152 stocks in my digital transformation stock universe.(Source: Portfolio123/private software)The sales multiple in the vertical direction is calculated using the EV and ""next year's sales estimate"" mean value based on all analysts from the Portfolio123 database. The estimated Y-o-Y sales growth is calculated using ""current year's sales estimate"" and ""next year's sales estimate,"" also provided by Portfolio123.As can be seen from this scatter plot, j2 Global is almost sitting on the best-fit line, suggesting that its forward sales multiple is typical of its peers', given its estimated future revenue growth rate. My interpretation is that j2 Global is fairly valued relative to the average stock in my digital transformation universe.While software stock valuations have come down in recent months, they are still considered high on a historical basis. Uncertainties, such as the rising tension in the Middle East, trade disputes and President Trump's impeachment, could cause a market downturn. Software stocks tend to get hit hard during any market turbulence.j2 Global has a diversified portfolio of businesses. As such, overall company performance is likely to be in sync with the general economy. If the economy goes south, then I would expect j2 Global stock to fall in price.j2 Global acquires many companies through a given year. Any acquisition could turn bad and result in legal actions or unanticipated liabilities. Any specific company may prove more difficult than anticipated to turn profitable.j2 Global consists of a portfolio of internet businesses, including 13 business units and 40+ recognizable brands. j2 Global grows by acquiring companies and then growing them organically. Based on this business model, I expect that j2 Global stock will perform well when the economy is strong, which it currently is. The company has a strong free cash flow margin of 22%, and reasonable annual revenue growth of 12%. The stock price appears to be fairly valued according to my relative valuation scheme. Given the recent stock breakout to new all-time highs, I am retaining my bullish rating for j2 Global."
4309781,104952,2019-11-29T13:44:58-05:00,"j2 Global recently hit a new all-time high for Q3 revenue. Revenue increased by 18% YoY to $344.1 million.The company plans to scale its smaller-cap business units to achieve $75-100 million in annual revenue in the medium term.Q3 M&A deals have been strategic. BabyCenter, Spiceworks, and SaferVPN will enhance the company's growth and its market share position. OffsiteDataSync will boost profitability in a declining cloud backup segment.","j2 Global (JCOM) recently hit a new all-time high for Q3 revenue. Overall revenue increased by 18% YoY to $344.1 million. Having closed four deals in Q3 and 10 YTD, we continue to be a strong believer in j2 Global's abilities to identify attractive deals and create value through M&As. As the company plans to scale its smaller-cap business units to achieve $75 million to $100 million in revenue, we see a potential upside through more outperformance in the next few quarters.In Q3, we believe that the company has made four strong acquisitions in BabyCenter, Spiceworks, SaferVPN, and OffsiteDataSync. Overall, we feel positive about the management's strong approach and thought process in all these deals. We notice how each of them will create a significant impact on either the company's growth or profitability through striking synergies with its current assets. Its recent acquisition, BabyCenter, for instance, forms a perfect combination with What to Expect to solidify the company's positioning in the parenting and pregnancy spaces. The CEO, Vivek Shah, explained how the company would achieve this through the acquisition:With these in mind, we also view the BabyCenter M&A deal to be a strategic move to increase not only the company's growth but also the overall share of the market. On a similar note, Spiceworks acquisition will also enable the company to increase its market share in the digital community of IT professionals through the synergy with other B2B assets.(Source: Spiceworks website)We like the Spiceworks deal given its activities in both digital media and cloud businesses, which share a lot of similarities to what j2 Global does. Spiceworks maintains a well-known forum and community board for IT professionals who discuss issues such as troubleshooting and best practices. However, the company also builds its B2B cloud software solution targeted towards IT professionals, such as the help desk and inventory management system. Based on the narratives around BabyCenter and Spiceworks, we think that the company has taken a very strategic approach when scaling its newly-acquired businesses. In the digital media segment, for instance, the company has proven its awareness of how collaborations among sites and contents across various stages are critical to driving high-quality traffic and conversions.Furthermore, the OffsiteDataSync acquisition will also offset its declining yet highly profitable cloud backup business segment given its strong margins. Another thing we like in Q3 that we feel will drive growth going forward is the company's acquisition of SaferVPN. The privacy space has been trending globally in recent times as internet users in some parts of the world have been looking for solutions to bypass internet censorship and regain their privacy. Despite the lower margin, we think that SaferVPN is a strong buy for the future. In Q3, SaferVPN was the primary driver of the 14% YoY revenue growth in the cloud business segment.Typically, we see two key risks associated with a company leveraging M&A as its main growth strategy. These are overpaying and integration risks. While j2 Global does not seem to have either of these risks, its concentrated revenue despite its activities in diverse lines of businesses should raise a concern. As its 10-K indicates, 27% of its consolidated revenue is driven by eFax, which is a company that develops a fax-to-email solution. We view this as a major risk at the moment, given the lack of insights we have in the fax-to-email market's development going forward.Overall, we like j2 Global's approach and the management's capability to execute M&A deals that oftentimes come with a high degree of complexities. Since the second half of 2019, we saw j2 Global maintaining its net margin at a double-digit level while making several high-profile acquisitions. The company has also brought its TTM growth rate back up to a double-digit level at ~11.5% after the single-digit growth period in the first half of the year.Among its peers which include the likes of LogMeIn (NASDAQ:LOGM), j2 Global has a significantly higher net margin of ~11%. At the same time, we believe that there is a lot of unrealized upside from several acquisitions in Q3 that will push the overall growth rate higher than ~11.5% going forward. In that sense, we feel that at a forward P/E of 13.70, j2 Global is more attractively priced compared to LogMeIn, which offers investors only ~6% growth despite having a more expensive forward P/E of 15.39."

This is a speculative buy.As with all stock investments, this opportunity comes with significant risks.","j2 Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:JCOM), once a Wall Street darling, has been all but forgotten these last few years. Once upon a time, the company raked in dollars with its eFAX business. But now, the patents have expired, and the company has been transformed into a portfolio of internet businesses. The growth strategy has been to buy up distressed companies with the intent of nurturing them back to health. This strategy has generally worked with 5-year annual revenue growth of almost 19%. But the growth hasn't translated into investor excitement as the stock price has stalled for the last 3 years.(Source: Yahoo Finance)The stock has had difficulty penetrating the $90 mark, having reached that level many times over the last 3 years.Will this be the time that the stock breaks through?I believe there is a high likelihood that j2 Global will break upwards from here. The company doesn't quite meet the software Rule of 40 but comes close. In my estimation, the stock price is fairly valued, and I believe that the stock is a speculative buy for more aggressive investors.j2 Global is a portfolio company that provides a variety of internet services. For the last two decades, the company has acquired approximately 170 businesses. It is what they do. They acquire struggling companies and find value in them so that they become profitable. In 2018 alone, j2 Global acquired 11 companies and has acquired 6 so far in 2019.The company is arranged into two business areas, Cloud Services and Digital Media, and the company is arranged into 14 business units, each run independently with a mandate for profitability. The company has more than 40 recognizable brands, including Mashable, PCMag, Speedtest, and Everyday Health.EBITDA has grown by almost 17% and free cash flow by 18% for 6+ years.(Source: j2 Global Earnings Slides Q1 2019)However, despite the strong long-term performance, revenue growth has decelerated from a long-term 19% CAGR to 8% for the most recent twelve months. This is a result of declining revenues from the Backup business and flat sales of the eFAX business, both of which fall under Cloud Services.Back in 2011, the company introduced a dividend as a method of returning capital from its lucrative eFAX business back to the shareholder. The dividend has been steadily raised until June of this year when it was suspended, presumably to prepare for more acquisitions.The company is in the process of converting into a SaaS business. In 2018, 60% of revenues were by subscription, and every move management makes is now with recurring revenues in mind.When it comes to software companies, I don't rely on traditional value factors; instead, I focus on other measures, such as the software company ""Rule of 40"" and relative valuation, a concept that I recently developed that compares forward sales multiple versus estimated sales growth.j2 Global had a mediocre year compared to its software peers with trailing-twelve-month (TTM) revenue growth of 7.2%, while the software industry as a whole grew by more than 15%.(Source: Portfolio123)j2 Global converted to ASC 606 accounting in 2018, and this skewed revenues slightly. Without ASC 606, the revenue growth would have been approximately 8% YoY. This is still significantly less than the 5-year annual growth rate of almost 19%.The decelerating growth rate is primarily a result of performance in the Cloud Services business with the dying backup business and slow growth of the cloud FAX business, once j2 Global's cash cow.I use Portfolio123 for the calculation of free cash flow. Portfolio123 has a modified version of free cash flow that incorporates dividends paid. Normally, this isn't a problem as most of the SaaS and other software companies don't pay dividends. But j2 Global does or, should I say, did. j2 Global has canceled the dividend payout as of June, so I have eliminated the dividends from the free cash flow margin calculation.j2 Global's free cash flow margin TTM, ex-dividends, is 29.2%. With dividends included, the free cash flow margin would have been approximately 22%.(Source: Portfolio123)A rule of thumb often applied to software companies is the ""Rule of 40."" This metric helps SaaS companies balance growth and profitability. There are different ways of calculating the Rule of 40; some analysts use EBITDA, and others use the free cash flow margin. I use the free cash flow margin as I believe that it is the most meaningful factor from an investor perspective.The Rule of 40 is interpreted as follows: If a company's revenue growth rate plus free cash flow margin adds up to 40% or more, then the SaaS company has balanced growth and cash flow resulting in financial health.j2 Global's revenue growth from the most recent 12 months was 8%, while free cash flow margin for the trailing twelve months was 29.2%. Therefore:Revenue growth + FCF margin = 8% + 29.2% = 37.2%Since the calculation comes out lower than 40%, I conclude that j2 Global has some work to do. j2 Global has been acquiring companies a very fast pace, with 11 companies acquired in 2018 and 6 so far in 2019. It is quite conceivable that revenue growth will rise closer to the historical level of 18%, in which case j2 Global would meet the Rule of 40 requirements in 2019.This is where things get interesting and somewhat controversial. It seems logical to me that high-growth companies should be valued more highly than slow-growth companies. To illustrate this point, I created a scatter plot of Enterprise Value (EV)/forward sales versus estimated YoY sales growth.(Source: Portfolio123/MS Excel)The sales multiple in the vertical direction is calculated using the EV and ""next year's sales estimate"" mean value based on all analysts from the Portfolio123 database. The estimated YoY sales growth is calculated using ""current year's sales estimate"" and ""next year's sales estimate"" also provided by Portfolio123.The reason for using analysts' estimates is because SaaS stocks tend to make a lot of acquisitions which can muddy the results of the scatter plot. The analyst estimates account for these acquisitions, and the estimates are updated frequently. This makes for a cleaner chart. The sales estimates, unlike EPS estimates, are usually quite accurate for most SaaS companies except that they tend to be a little on the conservative side. Apparently, all SaaS CEOs are clones of some very conservative financial guy as they all give conservative guidance!I use an exponential best-fit trend line as it appears to be more appropriate than a linear trend line for this application. As sales growth goes up, the valuation goes up exponentially. The trend line was calculated using MS Excel. I consider the stocks sitting above the trend line to be overvalued, while stocks lying under the trend line are undervalued.As can be seen from the chart, j2 Global is sitting on the trend line, indicating that its EV/forward sales figure is average compared to its peers. In my estimation, j2 Global is fairly valued. Keep in mind that this is a relative valuation based on a universe of SaaS stocks, not an absolute valuation that one would attempt to calculate with a discounted cash flow model.An investment in j2 Global comes with several risks. For starters, the stock market bull market is long in the tooth, and we could enter a bear market in the not-too-distant future based on a slowing economy or a resurgence in trade tensions between USA and China.In addition, SaaS stocks are on a tear, and many of them are reaching all-time highs. Some analysts believe that we are in for a second ""dot-com"" crash due to lofty valuation levels and little in the way of profits. If a crash occurs, it is likely that j2 Global will crash along with the general market.Much of i2 Global is sensitive to the economy, and a recession could cause a downturn in company revenues and profits.There is also the possibility that the new initiatives by j2 Global may not be endorsed by customers.j2 Global was once a Wall Street darling but has been forgotten for the last few years. While the long-term growth rate of EBITDA and free cash flow has been impressive, the most recent year has been a disappointment, particularly in revenue growth. The company fails on the software Rule of 40 but is close enough for speculators wanting a jump on this stock, assuming that revenue growth will pick up in 2019.Management is attempting to convert the company entirely to recurring revenues, and 60% of revenues are recurring at present. By my estimation, j2 Global is fairly valued relative to its software peers. With the stock butting up against a long-term resistance level, I believe there is a strong possibility of a breakout here.

The pandemic should accelerate progress.The healthcare segment makes up 15% of the business and should continue to see strong demand amid the pandemic.The shares price has been down ~23% in the last six months, which provides a good entry point.","We maintain our bullish view on J2 Global (JCOM), the holding company of various digital media and cloud service businesses such as IGN, PC Mag, and MyFax. Since our first coverage last November, the shares price has been down by ~26%, mostly due to the COVID-19 impact on some of its businesses. J2 Global expects Q2 revenue to be slightly down YoY, as the cloud business sees slowdowns. The long-term prospect remains intact nonetheless, with J2 Global well-positioned to ride out the pandemic given its strong balance sheet and more resilient healthcare and gaming businesses.J2 Global’s healthcare businesses, such as Everyday Health and Medpage, have been resilient and gained strong traction amid the pandemic. Everyday Health’s organic ad revenue growth reached 5% in April, while Medpage Today saw a 33% increase in physician promo revenues in Q1. Given that J2 Global generates 40% of its ad revenues from the health category, we believe that J2 Global should continue to benefit from its healthcare businesses in the near term as well as longer term.(source: company’s 2019 presentation)With ~$211 million of revenue, the healthcare business made up around ~15% of J2 Global’s business in 2019. The segment grew 11% on average over the last three years, and given the increase in traffic to some of its healthcare sites during the pandemic, we expect the outperformance in its advertising business to continue and accelerate growth. Furthermore, there are also opportunities in its e-detailing pharmacy offering, Everyday Health pro, as the pandemic may accelerate the online shift in medical sales reps’ behavior. The offering enables medical sales reps to approach doctors digitally using email or newsletter, instead of physically.(source: J2 Global investor presentation 2019)We also expect the tech and gaming businesses, which include Humble Bundle and IGN, to have a sooner rebound. The gaming business typically saw a surge in activities in Q4, and we think that the pandemic should accelerate online sales further. In Q1, J2 saw a spike in the consumption of Humble Publishing as it plans to launch 19 games this year, despite the increase in delayed subscription payment into Q2, as a result of the commonly used subscription pause feature. Both tech and gaming segments generated $396 million of revenue last year, which was approximately 30% of J2 Global’s business in 2019 alone.Considering that J2 Global is an M&A-driven growth business, we accordingly expect to see much fewer deals this year due to the pandemic as well as a more modest growth outlook for the year. In addition, the segment that requires higher-touch sales efforts, such as its enterprise wireless design business Ekahau, should continue to see a slowdown that will offset the outperformance in gaming and healthcare segments.We remain optimistic in J2 Global, whose diversified portfolio of businesses should help offset the negative impact of the pandemic. J2 Global has a strong liquidity position and consistently generates $200-$300 million of FCF (free cash flow) on an annual basis. In Q1, J2 Global also ended the quarter with $625 million of cash, even after spending over $75 million in M&A and share repurchases, which demonstrate management’s continuing confidence in the business. Moreover, CEO Vivek Shah also personally bought $1 million worth of shares in March.(source: Seeking Alpha)Down ~23% over the last six months, the ~$74 per share price provides a good entry point. J2 Global trades fairly at ~19.8x P/E, considering its ~13% growth. From a P/S standpoint, we also believe that the current 2.5x P/S is attractive, and is the lowest level seen in a decade. Over the last year, net margin also saw an expansion followed by acceleration in growth, showing the management’s execution strength in driving profitable growth."

The Cloud Segment will continue to add business due to the increase in demand from health, pharma, legal and finance industries. The Digital Media Segment will continue to grow and add revenue as the number of visitors to their websites increase. These visitors will increase revenue through the commission that J2 Global will receive from the increased number “viewable” impressions that they get from their websites. The success of IGN will give J2 Global a platform into the video game sphere. J2 Global is positioned for growth in both of their segments, which will increase the stock price in the short and long term. J2 Global’s stock price is most affected by its earnings. In the third quarter earnings call, J2 Global recorded an all-time high revenue of $273.62 million, which was up 30.2% year over year. This beat the earnings estimate by $0.78 million. There are several positive to take away from the earnings call. The first is that the Digital Media Segment hit an all-time revenue high of $128 million, which is up 91% from the prior year. This shows that the company is continuing to expand in this market. The second is that the Cloud Segment has also increased its revenues year over year. J2 Global was able to increase its EBITDA margin 16.7% to $111.3 million from Q3 2016. J2 Global also ended the quarter with $402.5 million in cash and investments. This now gives them more flexibility when it comes to potential acquisitions, research and development. J2 Global has also kept their forecast for the year the same with predicted revenues between $1.107 and $1.147 billion. The company has rewarded shareholders with a dividend raise of 2.6%, which now brings the dividend to $0.395 per common share. This shows that management is taking the right steps to make shareholders happy. Amongst its competitors, J2 Global’s has a T12 Revenue of $1.05 billion, which is above the industry median. The market caps of CA US and CTXS are both above $12 billion, which explains their revenue being larger. J2 Global has the second highest operating margin at 16.34% amongst its competitors, which shows they are efficiently utilizing costs. J2 Global has T12 EBITDA of $389.77 million, which is above the industry median. I expect J2 Global to exceed their earnings estimates in the next periods, which will increase the stock price.Source: Created by author using the Bloomberg TerminalJ2 Global is well positioned in the internet software and services industry because of the diversification they have with their products. In their Cloud Segment, J2 Global is able to offer cloud services as well as online fax services. As the amount of data continues to increase so will the need for cloud storage. The online fax services segment has continued to expand as the need for information to be transmitted faster continues to increase. In the Digital Media Segment, the multiple websites they operate continue to see an increase in traffic. J2 Global continues to deliver compelling content, which will lead to an increase in ad revenue. This is because with more traffic to the websites, the greater chance of a customer clicking on an ad. Since J2 Global gets commission on “viewable” impressions, they want customers to click on ads when they are viewing content on their website. Cisco predicts that by 2020 more than half of the global population will be online which would make 4.1 billion internet users up from the 3.0 billion users in 2015. This shows that J2 Global will have an increased amount of potential viewers, which will drive growth if they can attract them to their websites. From 2011 to 2016, the NASDAQ Computer Index has increased from $100 to $212.21 and the Peer group Index has increased from $100 to $228.30. Over the same period, J2 Global has outperformed both of these indexes by returning $308.78. This shows that J2 Global continues to grow and add value as a company.Source: J2 Global 10KThe Cloud Segment remains J2 Global’s cash cow. This quarter saw an all-time high in revenue for the cloud connect segment, which amounted to $97 million. Within this segment, fax revenue came in at $80 million, which grew 3.5% over the prior year. The Voice segment recorded a revenue of $17 million, which was up 10% from the previous year. J2 Global successfully implemented Fax87 into its eFax software, which is the world’s leading online fax service. The corporate fax revenue has continued to expand since 2013. The corporate fax revenue has a CAGR of around 9% since 2013. J2 Global has positioned themselves well with the growth for fax demands with their application programming interface software. This has allowed them to make changes to subroutine definitions, protocols and tools to their fax interface to meet any changes. The increase in demand stems from compliance-oriented verticals such as health, pharma, legal and finance. These industries continue to expand to the demand for fax will continue to expand as well. The Cloud Backup produced revenue of $28 million, which has a revenue CAGR of around 96% since 2013. This is important to note because this should continue to increase now that they have an acquired and integrated cloud backup in Europe. This shows that they can continue to expand their revenue in Europe while being taxed at an Irish tax rate of 12.5%, which is beneficial to them. I expect the Cloud Segment to continue to grow at their 3-year growth of 13%.Source: J2 Global 10Q SlidesJ2 Global’s Digital Media segment continues to see large growth. Quarter 3 revenue of $128 million was up 91% from Q3 ’16. J2 Global was also able to increase their non-gaap operating profit and adjusted ebitda. This is mainly due to the number of multi-platform visits increasing to 1.4 billion. This number should continue to increase as J2 Global strengthens their own content and acquires new companies. The Speedtest app that J2 Global owns has passed over 300 million installations as there were over 16 million downloads in quarter 3. Mobile tests for speed performance hit a record of 600 million, which shows that people now more than ever are concerned with the speed of their electronics. This should continue to expand as wireless companies continue to say that their networks are the fastest. Commerce Revenue has grew 34% in Q3 ’17 over Q3 ’16. This is due to the increase in shopping clicks to third party websites off ads on J2Global websites. Shopping clicks reach a quarter high record of 36.3 million with no signs of slowing down. As more people spend more time on the internet the more likely, they are to be enticed with buying something online. The real surprise is the increase in international commerce where revenue has grown 462% since the prior year. It is vital for J2 Global to continue to increase their global revenues so they can continue to expand their revenue base. The Digital Media Segment for J2 Global looks promising for the future. I expect the Digital Media Segment to grow at 34% which is a little above their 3-year growth.Source: J2 Global 10Q SlidesIGN is a video game and entertainment company owned by J2 Global. IGN is currently expanding their programming and distribution through many channels. The first channel is through Disney (NYSE:DIS) XD. IGN made a show called “The IGN Show” which debuted in July. This show is 30 minutes and covers video game content and event coverage. It is important that IGN continue to make these shows with relevant content to keep viewers intrigued in the lineup. The second channel is through a partnership with Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). IGN’s lineup includes mid-form featurettes with themes such as cosplay makeovers and video game previews. This is another important platform for IGN because Facebook has just launched their Watch platform and if their shows get positive feedback then Facebook will renew them. The third channel is a partnership with Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) where IGN broadcast 13 hours of live programming from San Diego Comic-Con. This event was a resounding success with 68.7 million video views for the week of the event. This shows that viewers are interested in this material. IGN could have Facebook and Twitter compete against each other for who wants to broadcast the next Comic-Con. I expect IGN to be a long-term catalyst when they get more exposure and get show contracts renewed and expanded.The insider ownership in J2 Global has remained consistent over one year. The small decrease in shares owned by insiders dropped slightly because the old CEO, Nehemia Zucker sold off 28,789 shares. This is to be expected when a CEO steps down but he still owns 171,866 shares.Source: Created by author using the Bloomberg TerminalThe ownership in J2 Global has not had any drastic changes in the last year. The most significant change in ownership of stocks that Hedge Fund Managers have reduced their shares by 1.38%. This is relatively insignificant because they only owned 3.63% at the beginning of the year so they were not going to alter the stock price drastically by selling off. Investment advisors, pension funds, insurance companies and holding companies all increased positions, showing that it is a stable investment. I expect the stock to increase in price.Source: Created by author using the Bloomberg TerminalJ2 Global has above average margins across the board. It is important to note that their ROIC is higher than their WACC, which means that the projects they are investing in are creating value for the company. J2 Global’s operating margin is at 29.90%, which is well above the industry median of 8.81% that shows that they are operating efficiently. The one concern that could be had is the debt/equity percentage of 85.39%. However, this can be nullified because they have over $400 million in cash and short-term investments, which would reduce the debt/equity ratio down to the median average. This chart shows that J2 Global is in the upper class of the internet software & services industry.Source: Created by author using the Bloomberg TerminalIn conclusion, I am proposing a BUY for J2 Global. J2 Global is well positioned in their Cloud and Digital Media Segments. J2 Global has constantly managed to grow its revenue. J2 Global has the best software in the online fax business along with constant growth in other areas of the Cloud Segment. The Digital Media Segment is growing over 30% with no signs of slowing down. The long-term success of IGN will give J2 Global entry into the video game industry. J2 Global’s margins are above the industry average. A target price of $80.71 can easily be achieved. There are three possibilities to be considered with J2 Global’s stock price.Bear Case: Considering everything, there is a possibility that J2 Global cannot expand revenues as much as the forecasts predict.

Despite the favorable recent news, there could easily be a seasonal flat spot until November. A notoriously slow summer and seasonal prices for JCOM point to holding off on a buy until November or later.As a digital media company with a major footprint in cloud computing, J2 Global generates revenue in three major segments; cloud services, digital media, and IP licensing. Its most recent Q2 earnings release showed digital media growth of 85%. With cloud computing as its banner cloud service, operating in 10 different countries, cloud computing provides fax and voice services, comprising 29% of its overall revenues for Q2 2017.What’s more, the company has announced a quarterly dividend increase of $0.3850 per share. JCOM has been increasing its quarterly dividends each quarter since the inception of its dividend in 2011. Guidance for expected earnings in 2017 is $5.60-6.00. See the Q2 report here from its website.When it’s the season to buy, it’s usually easy to tell. However, markets tend to remain in summer doldrums, as is the case with JCOM. You’ll notice prices hit a flat spot until November.Figure 1: 10-Year Seasonal Chart for each month, including highs and lows.With an industry PE ratio of 20.9x, and 2017 EPS expected to be $5.60-6.00, that gives JCOM a valuation of approximately $117.04-125.40 based on price-earnings multiples and forward earnings.Table 1 Go to: Barchart.comOut of the listed competitors, J2 Global boasts the greatest value with stable earnings and top-line growth from recent years. The company also has the highest analyst rating, which is favorable, yet should be a sign of caution. At perceived market tops, the highest analyst rated stocks tend to topple, unless they are going to charge with true leadership in the coming rallies. Because the company does have a good track record, and has reported favorable expectations, it should remain a leader in its industry group based on price performance and returns. However, a turnaround in the overall markets will end up slashing a lot more value with top-heavy stocks, without continued upticks from analyst opinions. Given this variable is near a peak, it should be more of a contrarian indicator than anything.Also, be wary that JCOM’s current ratio is dangerously below 1.00, making it susceptible to falling behind with current liabilities and its ability to make payments in the near term.Figure 2: Comparison table compiled from Mergent online; cost of capital (%) estimated from EVA Dimensions research.Figure 3 Key stats comparison compiled from Fidelity online.To conclude, J2 Global is in a very exciting space for its industry group, and should continue to add value in the months and years ahead. There is a seasonal flat spot during the summer months, and don’t expect anything too spectacular in terms of imminent price performance. With a stable of dividend hikes and earnings growth, plus a potential to reap a boon from its digital media and cloud computing segments, JCOM should remain stable and favorably priced, with attentiveness on buying opportunities possible nearer to the end of the year. Look for marked improvements in the company’s balance sheet before making any buy decision."
4051958,23179,2017-03-03T14:40:26-05:00,j2 Global has an impeccable record of earnings and dividend growth.Smaller companies provide more opportunity for greater future growth.Attractive valuation in a highly valued market.Bonus - F.A.S.T. Graphs Video: Offering A More Comprehensive Look At j2 Global’s Fundamentals and Dividend Paying Capacity.,"Investment Thesisj2 Global (NASDAQ:JCOM) was founded in 1995 and went public in 1999. During its first few years as a public company, j2 Global generated operating losses; however, since 2002, the company has strung together an impressive record of rapid growth. The company initiated its first dividend in 2011, and on February 9, 2017, it increased the dividend to 2.8%, which remarkably marked its 22nd successive quarterly dividend increase. Although the company only offers a current yield of 1.8%, it has grown its dividend at a compound average growth rate of 27.1% since it initiated one in 2011.Importantly, j2 Global is currently available at a sound valuation relative to its expected future earnings growth of 16% on average over the next two years. Consistent with its long-term track record, j2 Global reported better-than-expected earnings per share in the fourth quarter of 2016. Consequently, I offer this research candidate for those investors interested in earning an above-average total return through a combination of capital appreciation and a growing dividend.Thesis for Continued Growthj2 Global offers Internet services worldwide and operates through two segments; Business Cloud Services, and Digital Media. However, the company has historically generated growth through mergers and acquisitions. The company completed 22 acquisitions in 2016, and six acquisitions in the fourth quarter alone. This included Everyday Health, Inc., its largest acquisition to date by subsidiary Ziff-Davis LLC.Importantly, this definitive business strategy implies that an investment in j2 Global today is likely to be an entirely different investment in the future. On the other hand, it is through these acquisitions where future growth might come from. The following taken from j2 Global's website summarizes the company's merger and acquisition business strategy:For further insight into the company and its operations to include its future growth potential, I offer the following short business description courtesy of S&P Capital IQ:Investing PrinciplesIt is often said that the best things in life come in small packages. However, as it relates to investing in common stocks, it seems to be widely held that bigger is better. But, if a high total return is your objective, you might want to consider that the bigger a company gets, the harder it is for it to grow fast. This is important, because if you invest in a stock at a reasonable valuation, your ultimate long-term returns will be a function of how fast the company grows.Consequently, size matters if you're looking for long-term above-average growth. In this regard, j2 Global with a market cap just under $4 billion has plenty of room to continue to grow. Although it could be argued that there is greater safety in larger companies, safety often comes with a price. When investing in common stocks, that price typically comes at the expense of a lower future total potential return. On the other hand, j2 Global's small size might partially explain why it is under-followed and often overlooked in spite of its incredible long-term track record of earnings growth and more recently dividend growth. As the title of this article indicates, it might be a mistake to overlook this attractive growing business just because of its smaller size.So yes, I will acknowledge that there might be a little more risk investing in a company like j2 Global in contrast to investing in its larger peers such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) or Oracle (NYSE:ORCL). However, it can also be argued that the future growth potential of these larger companies is behind them, whereas much of j2 Global's future growth may possibly be still ahead of it.j2 Global, a Fundamental Snapshot AnalysisNow that I discussed what j2 Global does and how it grows, it is time to take a deeper look into the company's fundamentals, its long-term growth history, and most importantly, its potential for future growth. Let's start by looking at its historical accomplishments.As an investor, I tend to admire companies that have strung together a consistent record of earnings and cash flow growth. I believe this provides insights into the attractiveness of the company's business as well as the competency of its management team. Consistent long-term above-average growth is rarely an accident. Although history does not guarantee the future, I would rather commit to a company with a great track record over a company with weak or sporadic historical results. j2 Global has put together a very impressive record of historical growth and operating excellence.The following F.A.S.T. Graphs™ plots j2 Global's historical adjusted operating results over the time frame 12/31/2002 through 12/31/2016. Adjusted operating earnings have grown at a compound annual rate of 22.5% per annum. There are two important aspects of this excellent track record of growth that should be noted. Number one, the incredible reliability and consistency of year-over-year adjusted operating earnings growth has been close to impeccable. Second, there are no forecasts included; this is the actual historical record.When looking at the company's performance to shareholders over the above time frame, it is not a coincidence nor is it an accident that capital appreciation of 22.5% equates to its earnings growth rate achievement. Furthermore (and not shown on the above graph) is the addition of more than $12,000 in dividend income from a one-time initial $10,000 investment.Personally, I prefer evaluating a stock based on non-GAAP adjusted earnings and/or cash flows. The reason I prefer adjusted earnings is because I feel they more practically reflect how the business is performing on an operating business. This is in contrast to GAAP (diluted) earnings which may include significant one-time accounting events and/or non-cash charges. However, for the GAAP earnings purists out there, j2 Global's historical diluted earnings record is also quite impressive. This is especially true when you consider that this company engages in significant merger and acquisition activity.Additionally, an examination of a company's record of free cash flow generation can also be quite revealing. This is the measure of the company's financial performance calculated as operating cash flow minus capital expenditures. In other words, this is the cash flow left over after the company has spent the necessary money required to maintain or expand its business. j2 Global's historical record of generating free cash flow is also quite impressive.F.A.S.T. Graphs Video: Offering A More Comprehensive Look At j2 Global's Fundamentals and Dividend Paying CapacitySummary and ConclusionsI believe that investors should make investment choices that meet their specific objectives. Moreover, once made, I believe those investment choices should be judged based on meeting the objective they were chosen for. For example, if the investor was desirous of achieving the highest current yield available, they should also recognize that this might limit their capital appreciation potential. It is very rare to find investments that offer both high-yield and high-capital appreciation potential. But perhaps more importantly, on the rare occasions where both might be present, the risk is typically also higher.Consequently, for the investor seeking high yield, it only makes sense to me that their focus should be on the income that the investment is throwing off. Capital appreciation, if any, should be considered a side effect or bonus under those conditions. In other words, I believe it's important, and only makes sense to be realistic with your expectations.The reason I bring this up is because my personal investment quest currently is looking for fairly valued dividend growth stocks with yields exceeding 3%. Unfortunately, I have been very frustrated in identifying many large blue-chip dividend stocks that meet my quality standards and valuation requirements in today's low interest rate environment.As a result, I've been forced to look beyond the normal channels of Dividend Aristocrats, Champions or Contenders. Unfortunately, expanding my universe has continued to provide few investment opportunities under that criteria. On the other hand, and perhaps more fortunately, it has opened my eyes to other currently attractive investment opportunities such as j2 Global.When I came across j2 Global as I searched for high-quality dividend growth stocks, I could not help but be impressed by what I saw. Therefore, I thought it was also worthy of sharing this moderately yielding, but high total return potential research candidate with my regular readers. Therefore, if your investment objective is high total return with a growing dividend kicker, then j2 Global might just be what the doctor ordered.If you enjoyed this article, scroll up and click on the ""Follow"" button next to our name to see updates on our future articles in your feed.Disclaimer: The opinions in this document are for informational and educational purposes only and should not be construed as a recommendation to buy or sell the stocks mentioned or to solicit transactions or clients.

However, j2 Global also stated that they would suspend the dividend after the next payment. The primary reason for this was due to the ""...significant number of current investment opportunities within j2's portfolio of businesses…"" Below, I discuss why I sold all my shares including volatility in diluted EPS (GAAP), increasing long-term debt, and suspension of the dividend.Source: j2global.comj2 Global provides internet services. The company operates in two business segments that are Business Cloud Services and Digital Media. The Business Cloud Services segment sells cloud-based voice, e-mail, and fax products that generate revenue based on subscription and licensing fees. Notably, faxing is not a dying industry. Internet faxing is growing because it is secure and well accepted means of sending documents. While the Digital Media segment is a collection of websites including PCMag.com, AskMen.com, mashable.com, everydayhealth.com, and others that generates revenue based on advertising and licensing fees.Some of j2 Global's WebsitesSource: j2global.comThe company is essentially a roll up of many small companies. In fact, j2 Global acquires numerous smaller companies, particularly in the cloud services market each year. In 2018, j2 Global acquired 11 companies for a total of $324.7M. This strategy has proven to be remarkably successful. Revenue, EBITDA, and cash flow have increased consistently since 2013. Revenue was $0.52B in 2013, while it was $1.21B in 2018. The charts below show the increase and growth rate of adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow.j2 Global EBITDA and Free Cash Flow from 2013 to 2018Source: j2 Global Q1 2019 Investors PresentationSaying that, diluted EPS has been more volatile due to fluctuations caused by amortization of intangible assets due to the acquisitive strategy, integration costs, share-based compensation, etc. The expected increase in acquisitions will likely result in continued volatility for EPS.j2 Global Earnings Per Share from 2009 - 2018Source: Dividend Power Based on Data from Morningstar.comj2 Global has rising long-term debt due to the large number of acquisitions. Although j2 Global maintains a respectable cash position, the company has funded acquisitions by issuing long-term debt. Long-term debt was $0 until 2012 when it rose to $245M. At end of 2018, long-term debt reached $1,013M. In turn, this has caused a rise in interest expense. The chart below illustrates the increase in both long-term debt and interest expense. The company will likely use additional debt to fund future acquisitions leading to further rise in long-term debt and interest expense.j2 Global Long-Term Debt and Interest Expense from 2012-2018Source: j2 Global Q1 2019 Investors Presentation and Morningstar.comOn a positive note, this debt is all fixed interest rate and thus there is no interest rate risk. The current debt structure is in the table below. Notably, j2 Global paid off its 8.0% Senior Notes after issuing 6.0% Senior Notes. Although the current debt structure is not onerous, one must bear in mind future acquisitions will likely increase long-term debt. In addition, the convertible note may slightly dilute existing shareholders. As of December 31, 2018, the conversion rate is 14.7014 shares of j2 Global common stock for each $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes, which represents a conversion price of approximately $68.02 per share of j2 Global common stock. j2 Global can redeem the notes in 2021. But one criterion for note conversion is if the stock price trades at 130% of the conversion price for 20 out of 30 calendar days. This price is essentially $88.426 and the stock has traded above this value periodically this year.j2 Global's Long-Term Debt StructureSource: j2 Global's 2018 Form 10-KIn the most recent earnings release, j2 Global suspended the dividend after the June 2019 payment. More specifically, the company stated the following:j2 Global has paid a consistently growing dividend for eight years since 2011 when it first initiated a dividend. One unique aspect of this dividend was that the company tended to increase it by $0.01 per quarter. However, the payout ratio had risen to over ~60% and was costing the company ~$82M in 2018, which had grown rapidly from $19M in 2011. From the above statement, it is clear that the cash flow from the dividend payment will be used for acquisitions, investment in existing business, or both.Since my original dividend growth thesis for owning this stock was no longer valid, I decided to sell the stock. One must bear in mind that despite the positive tone of the statement, companies that cut dividends tend to underperform the market. In this case, the stock was not significantly punished after the announcement and, in fact, it gained after the earnings release. But still, market research has demonstrated that on average, a company that cuts (or suspends or eliminates) its dividend will underperform by a significant margin as seen in the charts below. These stocks also tend to have higher volatility meaning higher beta and higher standard deviation. In addition, many small investors have had recent painful experiences with Kinder Morgan, Inc. (KMI), General Electric Company (GE), Mattel, Inc. (MAT), and several other companies. I have previously discussed the dividend cuts at Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (BUD) and Kraft Heinz Co. (KHC) and the impact on small investors.Dividend Cutters Underperform Dividend Growers and The Broader MarketSource: Ned Davis Research and Hartford FundsReturns of S&P 500 Stock By Dividend PolicySource: Ned Davis Research and Hartford FundsIn the case of j2 Global, the risk is amplified due to the focus on adjusted EPS. On an adjusted basis, the stock is undervalued. In fact, the forward price-to-earnings ratio is ~12.6. But the adjustments are typically amortization of acquisitions. Bolt-on acquisitions are routine part of j2 Global's business and not really one-time adjustments. In any case, the P/E ratio is ~30 based on GAAP EPS. This value is much greater than the S&P 500's current average of ~22.1 suggesting that the stock could decline if it misses revenue and earnings estimates.I have owned j2 Global since 2013 and the stock provided a growing dividend and good capital appreciation since that time. However, the combination of expected volatile EPS, rising long-term debt, and, most importantly, a cut to the dividend for the foreseeable future led me to sell my shares. The stock no longer fit my strategy of dividend growth and hence was not suitable for my dividend growth portfolio.If you would like notifications as to when my new articles are published, please click the orange button at the top of the page to ""Follow"" me."
4108169,59101,2017-09-20T00:49:14-04:00,j2 Global is experiencing tremendous growth.Its M&A activity is coming into question.Debt is increasing at an alarming rate.,"Whenever my interest is piqued in a stock, I turn to Seeking Alpha and read a score or more articles concerning the company. In my formative years as an investor, I wounded myself more than once through confirmation bias. Consequently, I always begin the SA portion of my due diligence with pieces that present a negative picture of the targeted corporation.An article excoriating j2 Global (NASDAQ:JCOM) appeared on SA back in March of last year. Titled ""Citron Exposes the Dirty Little Secrets of j2 Global,"" it created a bit of a stir among those who follow the stock.Some of the negatives in that piece continue to be voiced as concerns today, and I will review a number of those arguments below; however, I consider some of the author’s claims as specious at best, and those I will disregard.For articles focused on countering Citron’s view, look at SA contributors here and here.A large percentage of JCOM’s revenues and profits stem from the company’s fax-related businesses. Just six years ago, 80% of its business was associated with fax.Fax technology is obsolete. The first patent for fax was in the mid-1800s, and the first operational fax machine was used in 1865. In a world of secure email, file sharing and e-signature, fax is destined to go the way of the Dodo bird. Therefore, a company that relies on fax services for a very large percentage of its corporate profits will soon provide withering results.JCOM has acquired over 40 companies. That’s a lot of M&A activity for a company founded in 1995.There are those that believe there is very little organic growth exhibited by the company. Perhaps a greater concern is that JCOM is essentially a shell game, a corporation that increases revenues through acquisitions that cost too much and provide little value.Recent acquisitions have resulted in a greatly increased debt load. This, in turn, could lead to an end to the regular dividend increases provided by the company.Perhaps of greater importance, JCOM has grown rapidly by buying a series of small companies; however, in the past, those acquisitions were generally paid for without a marked increase in company debt. Therefore, it is reasonable to believe that the increased debt could result in the cessation of M&A activity that drove growth.It is true that JCOM’s revenues are heavily dependent on the fax segment. However, the company has been pivoting to a business model that is less dependent on fax.As previously stated, roughly 80% of its revenues were provided by the fax segment in 2011. By 2014, the percentage of fax-related revenue had dropped to less than 50% of the company profits.Furthermore, income garnered from fax has increased markedly during that time period. As of the last quarter (Q2 2017), sales attributed to fax represented 29% of company revenues, down from 36% in the same quarter of last year. Revenues from fax increased 11% from Q2 2016, and the subscriber base increased by +1.4%.Additionally, the fax industry is growing in size, not diminishing. According to Davidson Consulting, the fax market will experience a 10 percent annual growth rate through 2018, with the fax services market expected to grow at 15.9 percent through 2018.Research from the International Data Group (IDC) indicates that 82% of those surveyed reported increased fax usage over the past year, with only 19% indicating a decrease in the use of fax as a means of business communication.Additionally, companies reporting increased fax usage indicated a marked increase in fax volume: +27%. The same companies expected fax usage to increase by 25% over the next two years.Spiceworks, a website with over 500,000 Information Technology professionals as members, provided the following survey results concerning fax usage:A recent Forbes article entitled “A Big Challenge to GrubHub’s Post-IPO Growth? Fax Machines” attests to the embedded nature of the fax industry in American businesses.As fax revenue has grown, the percentage of income related to fax has plummeted. This is testimony to the accretive value provided by JCOM’s M&A activity and also attests to the company’s successful transition to a broader business model.Below is a partial list of the company’s M&A activity.(Source: Crunchbase)There is no doubt that JCOM acquires companies at a rapid pace. But are the acquisitions designed to create a false illusion of growth, or are they accretive in nature? My response would be that it is unlikely that the company could play a shell game throughout this century without some sort of trail.Here is the record of JCOM's revenue growth over the last five years.Revenue in thousands(Source: Company 10-K)Furthermore, M&A activity that did not prove accretive would result in quickly increasing debt loads. Until 2012, JCOM’s long-term debt was nil, and debt remained modest until 2014. It wasn’t until recently when JCOM went on a buying binge (11 acquisitions this year) that the company began piling on debt.The history of JCOM is that of a company that chooses bolt-on acquisitions that increase company profits. The most recent quarterly results provide proof.All-time quarterly record revenue $273 millionQ2 ‘17 revenue up $61 million, or 29% vs. prior year (largest QoQ increase)EBITDA up $13 million, or 13% vs. prior yearCloud SegmentQ2 ‘17 revenue of $145 million, up $2 million, or 1.5% vs. prior yearCancel rate 2.1%, the lowest since 2015Digital Media SegmentQ2 ‘17 all-time high revenue of $128 million, up $59 million, or +85% vs. prior yearQ2 ‘17 EBITDA up $11 million, or 43% vs. prior yearQ2 2017 Cloud Connect (Fax/Voice) HighlightsQ2 ‘17 all-time high Cloud Connect revenue of $96 million, +3% vs. Q2 ’16All-time high fax revenue represents 29% of consolidated Q2 ‘17 revenue vs. 36% versus prior yearSubscriber base of 2.4 million DIDs, +1.4% vs. Q2 ’16Corporate Fax revenue continues to grow, up 11% vs. Q2 ‘16Voice revenue of $17 million, grew 6% vs. Q2 ’16Q2 2017 Cloud Backup HighlightsQ2 ‘17 revenue of $28 million, flat vs. prior year in constant currenciesQ2 2017 Email Security & Email MarketingEmail SecurityEBITDA of $3.7 million (35% margin)Sequential quarterly growth of ~6.5% top line and 17% in EBITDAEmail MarketingQ2 ‘17 revenue of $7.7 million, +22% vs. Q2 ’16Q2 2017 Digital Media HighlightsQ2 ‘17 revenue of $128 million, up 85% vs. Q2 ’16Q2 ‘17 EBITDA of $37 million, up 43% vs. Q2 ’16Total multi-platform visits up 17% YoY at 1.4 billionCommerce revenue grew 45% vs. Q2 2016- From 2Q ‘17 JCOM investor sitePretty impressive results.The recent JCOM M&A binge has resulted in a fairly high debt load.I’m a guy that likes to see low debt levels in my investments. Every corporation runs over the occasional speed bump. Speed bumps don’t concern me too much. Head-on collisions do, and a nice cash stash can help get that vehicle back on the road.Today, JCOM has a long-term debt ratio of 1.0 and a debt to equity ratio of 1.3. While the current ratio stands lower than I like, it is still reasonable at 1.7.I don’t like that level of debt in my investments. As a value investor, I also don’t care for the current P/E of 25.06. As a DGI, I prefer to invest in stocks yielding 3% or more, give or take a fraction of a percentage. JCOM’s divvy barely breaches 2 percent.I’m generally a safety first kinda guy. As Warren Buffett says, ""Rule No.1: Never lose money. Rule No.2: Never forget rule No.1.""I like to think of myself as pretty good investor. I also considered myself a darn good basketball player back when I was the captain of my high school team. The NBA didn’t draft me. I’m sticking with Buffett’s advice.But nonetheless, I consider JCOM a reasonable investment. I believe its track record is the insurance I need to overcome my fear of the company’s high debt levels.I view the company’s forward P/E of 13.01, coupled with the five-year average P/E of 22.7, as an opportunity in the making. I’m also considering JCOM’s PEG of 1.62 when I make an appraisal of the company’s current value.The fact that at $74 and change the stock is well off the 52-week high of $91 is also encouraging.With a payout ratio of 47.49% and a dividend coverage ratio of 210.57%, I consider the dividend safe.And about that paltry dividend...JCOM raised the payout every quarter since the inception of the dividend in 2011. That isn’t a misprint. The company raises the dividend every quarter. It raised the dividend by a penny per share for the last seven consecutive quarters. The dividend has been raised by double digits every year since the company began paying dividends.(Metrics in this section culled from Charles Schwab)I caution readers that I am venturing a good ways beyond my normal risk/reward tolerance with this investment. However, my recent purchase represents a small percentage of my overall portfolio.I also caution that I am not much of a market timer; however, I wouldn’t be surprised to see a better entry point in the near future. I conducted my own studies of a “market timing” nature, and I noted that buying companies with JCOM’s current level of short interest can often result in a short-term loss of share price.I am concerned that should the stock not recover by late November, we could witness a sell-off related to tax harvesting, since JCOM is well off its 52-week highs.Upon acquiring 100 JCOM shares at $74.65, I immediately sold a covered call expiring on 03/16/18 at a strike price of $90. I received $100 for that contract. I will report the results and my subsequent actions regarding this call upon the options expiration in the comments section, as well as in any article published around that time period.For additional information regarding this stock, I direct you to SA contributor Chuck Carnevale’s article.JCOM investor sitej2 Global, Inc. - Presentations"

It also operates a professional version of its site to physicians and other healthcare professionals throughout the U.S.Additionally, EVDY runs the ""What to Expect"" brand which is a pregnancy, baby, and parenting media resource.A third major site in the company fold is MedPageToday, a source of clinical, policy and educational information for healthcare professionals.The company says it reaches 50 million consumers each month and more than 700,000 healthcare professionals.TermsZiff Davis has tendered a cash offer of $10.50 per share for all of the outstanding common shares of EVDY stock.The acquisition was announced on October 21. Two days prior EVDY stock closed at $8.20. One day prior to the announcement, it closed at $9.40, a 15% one-day increase as a result of media reports that EVDY was 'considering strategic alternatives.'In any event, the purchase price represents a 28% premium over where the stock was trading before its pre-announcement jump.The price also represents a 57% premium over the 12-month trailing average of EVDY's share price.Ziff Davis is paying 1.9x trailing revenues, which is a pretty good deal compared to the industry average Price/Sales valuation for publicly-held Healthcare Information & Technology companies of 3.54x.In fact, it may be too good of a price for some disgruntled shareholders. One law firm is already circling the deal to 'investigate' EVDY over what it feels is too low a price accepted.Rationale and CommentaryZiff Davis is on an acquisition spree, much like its parent j2. Since 2011, Ziff has acquired at least nine companies, not including EVDY.Acquired companies have usually been media concerns which have largely been tuck-in acquisitions to fill out Ziff's media coverage.More recently Ziff acquired a technology startup, Salesify, which sells sales acceleration software. It appears Ziff acquired Salesify to use its technology internally.Everyday Health represents a hybrid deal of sorts.Its main value to Ziff is that it appears to provide diversification into health and wellness content as the number two market participant behind WebMD (NASDAQ:WBMD). WebMD is roughly 3x the size of EVDY in traffic, users, and revenues.But EVDY also includes other assets that may be of interest to Ziff, especially its B2B division:These assets appear to be good fits for expanding the coverage of the Ziff Davis B2B division into healthcare markets.EVDY's recent results show a company that was beginning to show positive results from its recent sales force restructuring and growing professional services business.Ziff Davis appears to have taken advantage of a company on the mend and snapped it up before it got too expensive.Overall, I view the transaction as a net positive for Ziff, and one in which they acquired a number of properties at a very buyer-friendly price.Ziff's parent, j2 Global, should be very pleased with its subsidiary's future prospects.I write about IPOs, M&A, and billion-dollar technology startups.

Looking at the company's fundamentals and their solid momentum, I believe that J2 Global presents an attractive long-run investment opportunity.J2 Global is a diversified internet company, which successfully transformed itself from a small U.S. fax company. The company has now over 3,100,000 customers and over 2,400 employees in 14 countries. The company's product portfolio includes services from internet fax and virtual phone to CRM, online backup and web-hosting solutions.Over the last decade, J2 Global recorded a steady revenue growth of over 20 percent. The company operates two segments: Business Cloud Services and Digital Media. In the Q3 2017, total revenue hit an all-time record of $274M, of which $146M were generated in the Cloud segment and $128M in Digital Media segment. Although Digital Media segment expanded by 91 percent compared to the same quarter in the previous year and to a 1.7 percent growth of Cloud segment, EBITDA margin in Cloud segment is still significantly higher (52 percent vs. 36 percent of Digital Media).According to my simple DCF blended model, J2 Global's shares are currently trading with more than 150 percent upside potential. Under the perpetuity growth method, fair value of the stock is $202.7, assuming 20 percent annual revenue growth over the next five years, steady annual EBIT margin of 28 percent and terminal growth rate in perpetuity of 2 percent. Under the EBITDA multiple approach, the intrinsic value stands at roughly $181 if we assume that the appropriate exit EV/EBITDA multiple is around 10x.Based on Peter Lynch earnings line, a famous valuation technique that helped the legendary investor to achieve an annualized rate of return of 29 percent, the best 20-year return rate of any mutual fund in history, J2 Global's shares seem to be currently considerably undervalued. Using the Fast Graphs forecasting calculator with 15.5 percent operating earnings growth assumption, the company's intrinsic value by the end of FY2022 is forecasted to reach $187 USD, which implies approximately 20 percent total annualized rate of return upside potential.Source: Fastgraphs.comDespite several critical reports and articles that investors should clearly take into consideration, I believe J2 Global's business transformation provides a clear value proposition. As two proven valuation techniques indicate the company's intrinsic value is much higher than the current market price, the company's shares are set for further growth. With the company's sufficiently diversified product portfolio, the subsidiaries' specific risks are minimized and the company's overall risk-return profile looks very attractive.Author's note: To bring similar articles to your attention, please consider subscription of my SA feed by clicking on the ''Follow'' button at the top of this page.Disclaimer: Please note that this article has an informative purpose, expresses its author's opinion and do not constitute investment recommendation or advice.

The company started about 20 years ago as JFax in an apartment in New York and today it is worth almost four billion dollars. In the third quarter the company broke a number of historical records. Quarterly revenue set a record at $179 million. Representing 17% year-over-year growth. Non-GAAP EPS hit a record $1.04 up 25% year-over-year. The Cloud business (don't be mislead by the cloud moniker it is mostly Fax related) achieved record quarterly revenue of $125 million, or up 15% year-over-year. Most of the growth coming from the non-fax cloud.Mancrush on Hemi ZuckerCEO Hemi Zucker built up a track record of creating amazing value for shareholders. Earnings per share have grown by 15% per year on average, over the past ten years. The entire team is on the same page, striving for high returns on invested capital but being indifferent how that return is achieved. Organic growth, acquisitions and share repurchases are all part of the toolkit. It is a formula that works:Managing for long term cash flow and small but crafty acquisitions are really the key to the success, demonstrated in the above graph, of J2Global. To be successful through at, among other things, strings of small acquisitions you almost have to be a skilled operator. The long terms results alone would never have convinced me by themselves but when I listen to the earnings call and read the filings I have no doubt that the management team is real skilled at capital allocation.It is all about making small acquisitions, risking little capital, and then tucking them into the existing J2Global business or leverage the existing platform to rocket up sales of an acquired product. A true low-risk high-reward approach that seems to be working like a well oiled machine; the company executed 9 acquisitions last quarter.Zucker and Turichi, President and CFO, look at scores of deals every quarter but only manage to execute on 10 or so because they often don't like the price associated with the asset. They are however quite flexible in what they will buy although they are eager to capture synergies and scale-up potential.Where ATVI is screwing up overpaying for KING to acquire its platform, JCOM remains disciplined and lets the deal for Carbonite fall through.I have written about J2Global several times before. Two of my reports are part of the Seeking Alpha Pro library but are also available to OTBP subscribers:J2 Global: Legacy Fax Business Obscures Growth Potential Of A Strategically Acquired Portfolio Of BusinessesMarket Punished J2 Too Hard After Earnings Miss, Creating A Favorable Buying OpportunityThe bad news is that the company has not been cheap enough for me to buy it since my first two reports, when I neglected to take advantage. J2Global deserves a prominent place on your watchlist for small caps to buy, but at 30x Earnings and 20x Free Cash Flow, I cannot justify buying into this well-managed company today."

Moviegoers should not be expected to know whether proper materials and safeguards are in place to prevent a fire or to evaluate the probability of a personal injury in the case of an actual fire. On the other hand, ""Professional Investors"" who dominate current markets, are expected to perform a reasonable level of due diligence on securities that they purchase on behalf of their clients.So, when a short report ""hits the wires"", it will either contain new and material information that the professional investors did not consider and should lead the investor to re-evaluate his investment thesis, or it will not, potentially offering an informed investor an opportunity to buy a security he likes at attractive prices.My personal observation has been that professional investors / the market, often show a limited ability to distinguish between what constitutes ""new and material"" information and what does not. Possibly, this has something to do with the fact that an average mutual fund manager owns close to 100 securities preventing them from doing an appropriate level of research on the companies they own, but even more surprising (and potentially alarming to those who entrust their funds to professional investors), they do not appear to even read the short-sellers' work based on which they are selling the security in question.To illustrate this point, I will use Andrew Left's (Citron Research) most recent (at the time of writing) published report on j2 Global (NASDAQ:JCOM). I invite you to access the report available on Citron's website.But first, a disclaimer: I owned an equity interest in j2 Global's business prior to the short report being published and own a substantially larger position today. So, although I have no expectations that my note will ""move the markets"", I stand to benefit personally should the stock price of j2 Global goes up - consider me an interested party (as any investor who is short or long a stock they are talking about).I do not intend this to be a long report on j2. Instead, I want to highlight what I view as obvious flaws and unquestionable misstatements in the Citron short-report that should have been obvious to anyone who actually read it. Therefore, I will structure this note to go through the most salient points raised by Citron.First Allegation: j2 Global's fax business is a ""near monopoly"" that will soon crumble when ""the key"" patent expires.Source: Citron researchA Monopoly?Let us first start with Citron's claim that the fax business is a near monopoly because any intellectual property is only valuable if it allows its owners to earn excess returns by preventing competition. What would you pay for a patent on a drug that currently has multiple branded and generic competitors? The answer is probably not much.To check whether j2 Global is a monopoly requires only access to a Google search engine. The following link shows the first non-advertised results for ""internet fax reviews"" (try this yourself).Clicking on the first non-ad link you, will most likely see the following page (I am based in Canada, so that is why the prices are in Canadian dollars):SourceOut of the 9 companies shown on that list; nextiva, Maxemail, GreenFax and Sfax are not owned by j2 Global. More importantly, it looks like j2's ""core brand"", eFax, is more expensive than all the other alternatives with nextiva being cheaper than all of j2's competing offerings.Clicking on the second link unearths more non-j2 alternatives including: faxZero.com, GotFreeFax.com, Hellofax and, importantly, RingCentral, a NYSE listed company with a market capitalization of $1.26B. Here, I just illustrate the results from the two first links, but there are additional competitors in the space.Key Patents?After five minutes of ""research"", it seems quite obvious that j2 is no monopoly. Now, although we have established that j2's patent portfolio falls far short of an impenetrable moat portrayed by Citron, let us still humor the notion that j2's U.S. patent 6208638 is fundamental for the success of j2's fax business.The key piece of evidence that Citron presents is an article from Stanford Journal of Law, Business & Finance that is titled ""Intellectual Property Wrongs"". Citron specifically chose to include the following excerpt from the article that suggested that j2 has a history of aggressively pursuing litigation as a tool to weaken competition.SourceI cannot imagine that a lot of people would be surprised by the use of patent litigation as an offensive or defensive strategy. By no means does this suggest that any one patent is critical to j2, given that you can allege infringement with one random patent.Specifically, the reader should note that the excerpt makes no mention of the 6208638 patent or its importance.The same article does, however, contain a couple of other interesting passages that I included below and you can read them on page 288 of the original:SourceThis passage suggests that, between 2006-2007, j2 Global faced four antitrust claims pertaining to patents that the Company acquired in 2005 and whose general description appears to be related to the U.S. patent 6208638, but as I will mention later does not appear to include the 620 patent: ""Method and apparatus for transmission and retrieval of facsimile and audio messages over a circuit or packet switched network"".This raises a couple of questions:If patents are crucial to a successful eFax business, how was j2 Global able to build a $100M revenue business (as of December 2004) without ever owning patents at the center of the antitrust case? More importantly, this raises a question regarding the importance of the U.S. patent 6208638. If I was going to pursue an antitrust case against a competitor, I would think that it would probably be a good idea to include those patents that are actually preventing me from competing. The 6208638 patent was published in 2001 and, therefore, based on the article, would not have been at the core of the antitrust case that focused on patents acquired in 2005. So, at least based on this example, it would appear j2's actual competitors disagreed with Citron's claim as to the importance of the 620 patent. The same article also points out that only one case proceeded as far as summary judgment, where it was dismissed. So four different competitors unsuccessfully sued j2 on anti-trust grounds. Clearly the courts disagree with Citron's allegations that j2's patent portfolio has resulted in a monopoly.Finally, anyone even casually following j2 Global would know that the company separately discloses revenue that it generates from its IP Licencing activities (surprisingly this fact is omitted from the Citron report…). This segment generated a whopping $6M of revenue in 2015 or less than 1% of total. If j2 was, in fact, this aggressive litigator with a very valuable patent portfolio, you would think they would do better than $6M.We have established that j2 Global does not have a monopoly in its fax business and we should not expect upcoming patent expiration to have any impact on the company's earning power, unless you believe that Google, Microsoft or anyone else is staying out of the internet fax business because of licencing fees that have to be substantially less than the $6M that j2 generates in total from its patent portfolio. It should also be noted that j2 licences its patents on a percentage of revenue basis (usually single digit percentage) so even the smallest competitors should be able to secure licenses if they can generate comparable cash margins.Second Allegation: To disguise the company's declining fax business, the company has been borrowing and acquiring unprofitable businesses.Source: Citron ResearchSource: Citron ResearchOnce again, a reader did not have to do much work beyond the reading of Citron's own report to realize that this allegation is, at the very least, inaccurate. As in its own valuation, Citron is only using $171M as the Net Debt amount:Source: Citron ResearchYes, today, j2 has $600M million of debt outstanding, but the company also has $256M of cash and $158M of investments on its balance sheet, such that counting the full $600M as if it was deployed into growing the business is clearly inaccurate.More importantly, Citron's allegation that the company's earnings power has not grown over the past five years is obviously misleading.Through most of its report, Citron points to EBIT (operating profit), not EBITDA (a more common metric among financial analysts, although not necessarily the right one) or Free Cash Flow (a better metric).I believe that the focus on EBIT is not accidental. Because j2 allocates a substantial portion of its capital to acquisitions, its income statement includes substantial amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets.Specifically, in 2015 intangible assets amortization expense was $74M, representing 37% of reported operating income. I believe that the vast majority (~87%) of these expenses should be added back to company's operating profit as they do not represent true economic costs (refer to the bottom of the page 15 in Warren Buffett's latest letter to shareholders further discussion on accounting treatment vs. economic reality of amortization expenses).Regardless of your thoughts on how to treat amortization, I believe that most people would agree that free cash flow (cash flow from operations less capital expenditures) is generally an acceptable measure to evaluate a company's earnings power and certainly a better measure than net income in this particular case.Furthermore, for a company that allocates substantial capital to acquisitions, an even better measure would be Free Cash Flow per share (this would penalize companies that issue a lot of stock to do deals).Source: Company FinancialsBy this measure, management has done a great job at growing the earnings power of the business. And again this growth has been achieved with only $260M in incremental Net Debt over the five-year period!It is also interesting to note that, although Citron throughout most of its report, focuses on EBIT, it does refer to EBITDA in one instance:Looking at EBITDA over the past 10 or 5 years or whatever other period you chose clearly shows that this statement is factually inaccurate:Source: Company's filingsI do not know about you, but 20% 5-year compound annual growth rate does not strike me as ""running in place"".Traffic doesn't lie,: Having established that the two key allegations in the Citron report are obviously misleading, further rebuttals are probably superfluous; however, please let me indulge in one more:Source: Citron ResearchThe above allegation is self-explanatory and is supported by the following three graphs sourced from Citron's own report, with me adding two lines to better illustrate the beginning and ending values for j2's properties: the red line shows beginning level (Feb 2013) and the green line shows the ending level Jun 2015). So, when the green line is above the red line this corresponds to increasing levels of visitors.Source: Citron ResearchSo just looking visually at the data presented in Citron's own report, we see that, although the ASKMEN platform appears to be down slightly, the other two properties are up substantially over the period shown!Organizing this data into a table format makes this point even more obvious:Citron's own data shows that traffic at the company's websites is up 36% over the period shown!Although the traffic does not lie, as Citron has illustrated, you can still mischaracterise what the data is saying.Concluding remarksIt is still possible that my investment in j2 Global will prove to be unsuccessful. However, at this point, I think it is almost certain that it will not be because of the allegations raised in Citron's report. I also do not suggest that the reader speculate on the rebound in j2's share price to undisturbed levels ($80-85/share). I base my investment thesis on expectations that, over the next two years, j2 should be able to grow its earnings power per share at 15%+ on an annualized basis. And if I am right, it will not matter that Mr. Left (Citron) is more successful at winning votes (getting people to sell), because, in the long run, the market is a weighing machine where earnings power matters and empty rhetoric does not.Intelligent investing to all…"
3957765,70965,2016-03-11T11:28:10-05:00,"Citron put out a scathing report on J2 Global Thursday with a $27 price target.The report accused the company's one legacy business, eFax, of entering a period of stalled and declining growth.J2 issued a response Friday morning that failed to address the issues.","By Parke ShallOn Thursday, Citron Research published a scathing report on J2 Global (NASDAQ:JCOM). The report went into depth about several alarming parts of J2's business and concluded with a $27 price target within the next year. Many important questions were raised throughout the course of the report, and J2's muted response Friday morning does little to address them. Therefore, we believe J2 will likely be a good name to avoid going forward. Despite moving up 3% at the open Friday, we want an answer to one key question: What do the financials of the company's eFax business look like?If you have not read the full Citron report, there is a link to it here.The gist of Citron's report is that J2 is yet another roll-up style company beyond the point of no return and unnecessarily loved by sell side analysts. It goes on to argue that while J2s enterprise value and market cap continue to grow, actual earnings have remained relatively flat.The report alleges this is a product of rolling up a bunch of non-profitable, meaningless businesses, which J2 probably paid too much for, and presenting the parent as a cloud computing company. The report alleges numerous unprofitable cloud companies have been rolled up, yet we have no access to their financials and no indication of how they are performing on a standalone basis. First, and most importantly, the report talks about the company's legacy business, eFax.eFax is the key we need to single out to get a good look at how J2's business fundamentals are performing.This business is the primary revenue driver for J2 the Citron report alleges is now starting to decline. Analysts could gauge this for themselves if the fax business was broken out in the financials, but it is not. It is consolidated with numerous other companies J2 has rolled up, so there is no clear way to look at how the company's one main revenue-producing business is doing. This was one of the first red flags.Citron makes the case that ""eFaxing"" and faxing via computer will soon be on its way out due to J2's patents expiring and the nature of the business simply in decline due to everything being done electronically now. Signatures and important documents are now done through a verified online signing process and the need to fax documents, whether manually or on the computer, has diminished. The key question is ""What is the legacy business producing in terms of revenue?""If analysts or the company are unable to come out with this figure on their own, one of the key questions being raised here cannot be answered.The rest of the report goes on to talk about how the brands J2 owns are dated and worthless. A great example was that J2 owns PC Magazine; and coincidentally PC Magazine was one of the only publications to recently give eFax a great review.In one of the most alarming findings, Citron also points out the company's risk factor language changed from saying ""the company may need to acquire to grow"" to ""the company must acquire to grow"".But the growth is only in question because it has been assumed eFax is in decline. We need more commentary from the company on how the eFax business is performing to find out if Citron's claims are justified.We think this is a sure fire sign the company's legacy business has stopped growing. There are some very important points the company needs to address. Unfortunately, Friday morning's response from J2 only said the company was planning for another response, which we are guessing we will get Monday. Here's what J2 said,In Monday's response, the most important thing to look for is how the company's core eFax business is performing on its own.On top of all of this, Citron promised in Thursday's report to come out with a second report that questions the company's accounting.Until these allegations are made public, we would not try to play J2 as a rebound. The company's lack of response so far and additional coming information give us plenty of reason to stay on the sidelines for now.We can revisit our thesis if the company comes out and directly refutes the allegations. Segmenting out its businesses and talking more about its go forward growth strategy would be appropriate. Until then, we remain cautious and on the sidelines."

Founded in 1995, JCOM has consistently grown the top and bottom lines, and now commands a market capitalization of almost $4B. This analysis takes a closer look at this intriguing mid-cap investment idea to help you determine if JCOM is worthy of a place in your own portfolio.I start by exploring the structure of JCOM's online conglomerate and why it might present a competitive advantage. From there, I take a closer look at the growth history and trajectory of the business before wrapping it up by estimating the stock's intrinsic value. By the end of this article, I hope to have provided you a concise and accurate summary of this unique company.Respect My ConglomerateThe first step to understanding the investment opportunity in JCOM is to understand the company itself. While the company owns a wide variety of cloud services businesses, the company's earnings drivers can be broken down into two main business units: Business cloud services and Digital Media.Of particular interest is the eFax business. eFax is a low-cost provider of online fax services for small and medium sized businesses. At one point, this service was the single skew of the company. Since then, JCOM has come a long way. From the most recent quarterly conference call:The take home point here is that the company has done a fantastic job reinvesting earnings at high rates of return. The ability to take highly profitable eFax cash flows and reinvest them in a fast-growing cloud services company presents a unique growth driver for JCOM's shareholders. And despite the competitive nature of the cloud services space, JCOM has done a good job diversifying not only into other cloud services but also acquiring and monetizing digital media properties.So now that you have a clearer conception of what makes JCOM tick, let's take a look at the growth narrative going forward.Organic And Acquisitive Growth DriversActually, before looking at future growth, let's take a quick look at JCOM's ten-year track record. In my opinion, execution has been nothing short of impressive. The company has grown the top and bottom lines almost every year, rapidly compounding capital for shareholders.Source: Morningstar.caLooking ahead, and as discussed above, JCOM seems to be focused on continuing to grow through a mix of intelligent acquisitions and organic growth. Given the strong historical operating results, I'm comfortable with this approach on a go-forward basis. Additionally, management has been disciplined about not overpaying for acquisitions. One red flag is the amount (and rapid growth) of goodwill on the balance sheet. But to date, management has done a good job monetizing these acquired assets. As long as they can keep this up, I'll breathe easy as an investor in JCOM.Speaking of monetizing assets, this is where I believe JCOM's management really shines. The beauty of these online businesses is that they're relatively easy to optimize. By collecting user analytics data and split-testing your online properties and sales funnels, you can quickly make incremental improvements that keep adding up. JCOM seems to have this down to a science. Management commentary is typically focused on growing ARPU, rather than just blindly acquiring new users or growing traffic. This emphasis on profit rather than growth at any cost is another reason I'm happy to partner with JCOM's management.So, given this robust growth narrative, there's one big question left to answer.How Expensive is JCOM?Valuing a conglomerate is never easy, let alone a fast growing diversified cloud services company. But as prudent investors, we've got to do our best. So taking a quick look at the traditional valuation metrics:At a glance, these numbers make JCOM look a little bit expensive. But the metrics above underplay the strong growth potential for the years ahead. Other factors that could contribute to a valuation premium for JCOM are the 80% operating margins, high-quality earnings (operating cash flow is consistently above net income), and strong balance sheet.Additionally, JCOM recently increased its quarterly dividend to $0.315 per share. This represents the sixth year in a row of dividend growth (since JCOM started issuing a dividend in 2005). It is now paying shareholders about 44% of earnings via dividend.Assuming a 5-year, 15% growth rate (5-year analyst consensus) and an 11.5% discount rate, I think JCOM is currently worth around $70 per share based on the discounted future values of cash flows. However, management has shown that it can continue to consistently reinvest capital at high rates of return, so I expect to slowly ratchet up my price target on JCOM in the quarters to come, as long as results remain in line with the company's operating history.Critics of JCOM would argue that management may not be able to continue growing at historical rates, given the competitive and fast-changing nature of cloud services. While this is a real threat, I'm wiling to give management the benefit of the doubt given their impressive historical track record.Proceed, But CautiouslyI have owned shares of JCOM for a few years now. While I think JCOM has proven it's a strong company capable of operating effectively and growing value for shareholders, I do believe it's approximately fairly valued. I'll continue reinvesting dividends and buying shares slowly. On any declined pullback, I'll likely add to my JCOM position barring any big changes in the underlying fundamentals discussed above."

The headline reads Carbonite rejects offer, but Carbonite doesn't have a say in it because J2 Global made a tender offer and its shareholders can make their own decision whether they want to take it or leave it.More problematic for J2 Global is the stockholder rights plan the board adopted. This makes it effectively impossible for J2 Global to take over the company without appeasing the board. So far, the board has been vehemently defending the company from J2 Global's takeover attempts.The board cited a number of reasons for why it doesn't want to take the offer, essentially boiling down to J2 Global not offering enough money. The board may not be entirely wrong in that assessment as J2 Global's track record of achieving growth through acquisitions is pretty good, as I've covered in more detail in my article: Legacy fax business obscures growth potential of a strategically acquired portfolio of businesses (PRO).It's exactly the management's track record with acquisitions that keeps me from being worried that J2 Global will get lured into overpaying here. Making over 40 acquisitions, the company managed to attain a ROIC of over 15%. J2 Global walked away from Carbonite on resistance before and I don't see a reason why they can't do it again.The Carbonite board is hinting there are other interested parties, but hasn't disclosed any names or competing bids. Meanwhile, it is under pressure from activists who appear to be unhappy with the board not taking the money for shareholders while they are collecting large salaries.Engine capital quickly released a letter in response to the early December bid, urging the board to sell or if not, buy shares of the company. The letter by the ~2.5% shareholder included some harsh words:Meanwhile, fellow contributor Alternative Activist noted a little while ago that activist Discovery Group (which owns a ~7% stake in Carbonite) has pushed 50% of its 53 targets toward an acquisition.JCOM data by YChartsCARB data by YChartsWhen J2 Global walks away and there is no other interested party, the board will have to explain why it didn't take the 33% premium to the $11.25 pre-offer price. J2 Global and its shareholders have less to lose here.I think J2 Global is most likely going to walk away from the deal again, for now. Possibly, they are going to up the offer because they need the board to cooperate now. Finally, there is the option where activists and J2 Global will start to work on removing the board.The most important thing is I'm not worried J2 Global is going to overpay in a big way here because of its great track record, proven ability to walk away from the table, and lots of experience making acquisitions."
1832452,48311,2013-11-12T12:26:51-05:00,,"J2 Global Inc. (NASDAQ:JCOM) was founded in 1995. The company began as a cheaper alternative to owning a fax machine. Today, incredibly, it still processes more than 1 billion faxes a year for lawyers, doctors and others who rely on delivery confirmation and phone records. Since 1996, the company has been led by CEO Nehemia Zucker, who has established an impressive track record of value creation.Right now, the market is upset the company missed on earnings, and scared because the CEO is shifting the direction of the company. The stock has dropped from $55 to $45 since the latest earnings call.Prior to the recent acquisition of Ziff Davis on November 9, 2012, J2 Global operated as one segment, which is now the Business Cloud Services segment.Ziff Davis consists of primarily digital content holdings in the technology space. This acquisition expanded operations into the digital media market, an area management believes provides attractive profit and expansion opportunities.On February 1, 2013, Ziff Davis acquired IGN Entertainment, Inc. (""IGN""), an online publisher of video games, entertainment and men's lifestyle content. On May 16, Ziff Davis then bought NetShelter, the largest community of technology publishers dedicated to consumer electronics, computing and mobile communications.After the company missed on earnings, the market punished the company hard. Its apparent ""diworsification"" tactics and failure to bring home the bacon (missing earnings estimates) were enough to drop the stock from $55 to $45.The market is misunderstanding the greater strategy behind the acquisitions and overreacting to a bad quarter. The business is now harder to understand and fundamentals harder to evaluate, but they are sound and over the next two years, I expect the company to outperform the market by a solid margin.Current BusinessRight now, the company has three distinctly different sources of revenue. There are the cloud businesses with the eFax and eVoice tools, the Media Business and there are IP licensing revenues. As Zucker told Forbes, ""Everybody says fax is not sexy, but it makes a ton of cash.""Cloud BusinessThat electronic fax business still accounts for over 50 percent of J2′s annual sales and net income. In 2012, revenues were $327 million, with 88% of total revenue coming out of the DID-based services. As of November, the run rate has increased $343 million, an improvement of 5%. Most of the growth came from eFax and eVoice.In 2012, revenues for non-DID services were $25.6 million. But now, the run rate is $34.3 million, an increase of 33%. KeepItSafe is leading the charge, with 234% year-over-year growth to a run rate of $12 million. The FuseMail business grew 24%, and now is ramping to over $10 million in annual sales.Churn is at an all-time low, a sign that services are still desirable to customers.The Cloud Services business has been grown by a combination of organic growth and tuck-in M&A. That combination produces a very stable range of EBITDA margin, generally between 49% and 52%.Media BusinessQ4 is seasonally the strongest quarter for digital media companies, like Ziff Davis, that are seeking advertisers.IGN set a new profit record in September, passing 156 million visits and 476 million pages. This is up from 141 million visits in August.IGN's YouTube channel has now 3.5 million subscribers, almost 0.5 million better than last quarter. PlayStation 4 announced IGN will be available as a content service on PlayStation 4. This is basically a new feature, a channel of content for the game players. IGN will now be a featured partner on the PlayStation 4, to be launched soon.IGN AskMen is now available in India and expanding into new territory over the next year. Meanwhile, this quarter the console makers such as Sony (NYSE:SNE) are going to ship new products. In Q1 and Q2 next year, new games are going to be launched, representing very big opportunities for this segment.AskMen launched a new website in August, resulting in a doubling of the time spent on the site. PC Magazine Mobile website launched a redesign in August and this has resulted in a sevenfold increase in page views.The company also launched new IGN for the new iOS 7; the mobile app launched in September with 1.2 million customers already having updated to the latest version.The fourth fiscal quarter is the most important quarter, but there has been a marked improvement of revenue over the first 3 fiscal quarters of 2013. Sequential improvement has come not only in revenue, but most importantly, in the EBITDA margin.Getting incremental revenue will be influential in the ultimate EBITDA margin that is attainable in the Media segment. Management estimates they are somewhere in the low to mid-20s right now, but argues it's realistic to attain margins in the 30s.32-34% of the revenue in Media comes in the fourth quarter.IP LicensingThe IP (patents) Licensing produces highly volatile profit numbers. The amount of money coming in can vary wildly by quarter and they are almost 100% flow-through to EBITDA. But it can range between a low of $300,000 in Q1 of 2012 to almost $15 million last quarter in Q2 of 2013. It was a big factor in the latest earnings miss, but, at the same time, a single quarter says very little about future revenue.Market Overreacted on Earnings MissJ2 fell 9.4% on Wednesday on the back of the prior afternoon's announcement of third-quarter results, which missed analysts' forecast for earnings per share by 10% ($0.64 vs. $0.71). The decline didn't stop there. In total, the stock fell from $55 to under $45.The company missed consensus on both third-quarter earnings and revenue. But revenues increased 37% year on year and management reaffirmed its guidance for 2013 revenues of between $510 million and $535 million and adjusted earnings per share of between $2.78 and $2.98.Revenues from licensing turned out to be disappointing. This is only a very small part of the company's business but because it requires hardly any costs to drive the revenue, its effect on the bottom line is noticeable. Historically the revenue from licensing has been volatile and there is no reason to expect revenues from licensing to continue to come in at the low end of this range.Management expects the revenue trend in the Digital Media segment to improve over the next several quarters as it integrates recent acquisitions. It may also be possible to realize some synergies.Combined, these factors lead me to believe earnings are temporarily under pressure but may very well be strong over the next few quarters.JCOM data by YChartsHistory of Value CreationJ2 has historically been a serial acquirer. Hemi Zucker, J2′s CEO, joined in 1996, and this is not the first time he steered the company in a different direction. When Nasdaq threatened to delist J2, the company did a 4-for-1 reverse split of its shares in February 2001.Fighting for survival, J2 acquired its main competitor, eFax, in late 2000 and raised prices. Zucker also halved the $8 million+ ad budget, equivalent to 62% of revenue. This returned the company to profitability by 2002.Zucker has bought 40 or so companies since he took over the helm. He has taken J2 into document management, e-mail hosting, marketing services and conference calls.Through all these years he built up a track record of creating tremendous value for shareholders. Earnings per share have grown by an average of 24% per year over the past ten years. Returns on equity have been astounding; judging by his track record, the CEO is quite clearly a skilled capital allocator.The chairman of the board is Richard S. Ressler who owns approximately 3.5% of the company and is the founder of Orchard Capital. Zucker owns 0.4% of outstanding shares with a market value of over $8 million. A majority of key insiders are properly incentivized to further the goals of minority stockholders.JCOM Return on Equity (TTM) data by YChartsOf late, Zucker has increased leverage to take advantage of market conditions, a move that makes sense with cheap debt and an improving economic outlook.The company just announced its 10th consecutive quarterly dividend and ninth consecutive dividend increase. The Board of Directors has approved a dividend payout of $0.255 per share, payable on December 4 to shareholders of record as of November 18. Since starting the dividend program in 2011, the company has increased its quarterly payout by 28% cumulatively. Going forward, the sizeable dividend is likely to grow at a slower pace than historic averages would indicate.Greater Strategy Behind Digital ContentAs much as I dislike companies driving growth by acquisition, Zucker has the track record to back him up. His latest foray into digital content has a greater strategy behind it. This is clearly shown by the acquisition of NetShelter. The company is using its advanced digital ad targeting platform and Ziff Davis B2B, a leading provider of research to enterprise buyers and leads to IT vendors, to expand its services to businesses.Going forward, I expect management will seek to acquire more content platforms in the technology space to expand on the reach of its new ad network. By building a highly targeted network with enough reach, the company will have an attractive offering for large advertisers.Increasing the number of advertisers will drive interest among publishers to sign up to the ad network. When 3rd party adoption of the advertising network can be accelerated, the segment can quickly grow profits. Ads on third party websites will leverage the digital ad targeting platform asset and drive profit with almost no incremental expense.Another strategic benefit of the NetShelter engine is to allow the company to extract incremental value from investments into media companies. When management acquires enough niche websites or signs up 3rd party publishers, the company is effectively digging a moat around its business.When its ad network has both scale and is highly targeted, it will become very hard for other networks to match J2's effectiveness per dollar spent. At the same time it allows management to capture a little bit of extra value on investments, making it a little bit easier to continue its excellent record of returns on equity.Both its historic track record and current strategic positioning strengthen my confidence the company will achieve better returns on equity than the general market over the next few years.Valuation Discounted Cash FlowJ2 is trading at a P/E of 17. However, short-term earnings are distorted by the acquisitions earlier this year and the IP licensing results. It trades at a PEG ratio of 1.06, a more favorable number but still based on distorted figures. Enterprise Value / EBITDA is just 12.33, Price/Book 3.24 and Free Cash Flow per share is $3.93.Many readers prefer a DCF calculation. When I plot the company's expected future cash flows and discount them against the S&P 500 I arrive at a net present value of $59. That makes JCOM 31% undervalued today.I based my calculation on current free cash flow. I didn't adjust for the licensing revenues coming in low, the increased traffic on the media properties or the expected increased media revenue in Q4. I projected growth only a few years in the future, mainly because the company doesn't have a competitive moat around its business yet. As such, in my opinion it is unreasonable to expect outperformance further into the future.My DCF calculation was made using several conservative assumptions to allow for disappointments. However, there are still real threats that could manifest faster or have a greater effect than anticipated. One of the greatest risks to my valuation and the company's near-term profits is a steep decline in revenues of its fax services.Currently, a substantial portion of the overall traffic on the Business Cloud Services segment's network is fax-related. That segment's success is therefore dependent upon the continued use of fax as a messaging medium and/or the company's ability to diversify its offerings and derive more revenue from other services, such as voice, email and unified messaging solutions.If the demand for fax as a messaging medium decreases, and the company is unable to replace lost revenues from fax services with a proportional increase in revenues from other services, the business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.One of the attractions to fax is that fax signatures are a generally accepted method of executing contracts. There are on-going efforts by governmental and non-governmental entities to create a universally accepted method for electronically signing documents. Widespread adoption of so-called ""digital signatures"" could reduce demand for the company's fax service.ConclusionThe CEO has a great track record of capital allocation. My analysis of the strategy behind the latest string of acquisitions shows the soundness of his current plans. This indicates Zucker has a good chance to keep batting his historic averages of creating tremendous value for shareholders -- or do even better, given the currently increased leverage.The stock price has declined significantly (from $55 to $45) on the earnings miss. The stock is trading at an important 31% discount to its intrinsic value.The market is incorrectly projecting temporarily depressed earnings into the future. This creates an opportunity to buy J2 and wait for the market to recognize the company's true worth when future earnings reports paint a clearer picture.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

The company stated its board will review the proposal. Shares of Carbonite have jumped and trade above $14 now, meanwhile J2 Global saw its share price decline on the news. A fairly typical reaction in these situations. On Seeking Alpha, it was further reported that the firm acquired a string of internet firms in recent years. That's factually correct but investors should realize these ""internet firms"" can be divided into roughly two categories: ""cloud services"" and ""advertising based business.""To make the situation that more interesting, Engine capital almost immediately released a letter urging the board to sell or if not, buy shares of the company. The letter by the 2.5% shareholder included some harsh words:I don't think investors should be worried too much about this acquisition. J2 Global doesn't have the typical track record of destroying shareholder value by acquisitions. In fact, in my PRO article called: Legacy Fax Business Obscures Growth Potential Of A Strategically Acquired Portfolio Of Businesses I describe the strategy behind the two types of business lines and how JCOM's intrinsic value is obscured because of the legacy cash cow business of e-fax. The high growth rate and potential operating leverage of the advertising based business and cloud business are not immediately apparent.Zucker has bought 40 or so companies since he took over at the helm. He has taken J2 into document management, e-mail hosting, marketing services, conference calls and now media. Through the years, he built up a track record of creating tremendous value for shareholders. Returns on equity have been astounding (Every year over 15% and often above 20%). Judging by his track record, the CEO is quite clearly a skilled capital allocator and the philosophy of careful capital allocation appears to be ingrained throughout the management team.The company is building out its advertising based business and cloud business depending on valuation levels in these respective markets. Wall Street may not like that the company is jumping between these industries, one day growing one segment and another day focusing on another. Admittedly, it's true this limits the speed at which operating leverage can be achieved in the ad based business, however it's hard to argue with the long-term results of opportunistic capital allocation. I hope management continues with its strategy and don't think shareholders need to be overly worried management will overpay for Carbonite.At the same time, JCOM is not the bargain it used to be. J2Global is a fine company to hold as a core long-term holding but given its valuation, active investors seeking ambitious returns, way above market returns, should look elsewhere."

Moreover, Q1 revenue is up 30% vs. the prior year and EBITDA margin has swelled to 32% from 26%. The company has grown revenue over the last 10 years by 18.87% while the three-year growth is north of 20% per year.However, the great thing about this company is not just its growth trajectory. The company has a healthy payout ratio of 45.4% while yielding 1.77% for investors. ROIC and ROE are 9.85% and 15.22%, respectively, while free cash flow per share has tripled in the last 10 years. Free cash flow to sales is at 27%, which is a very healthy indicator of potential acquisitions in the future. Further, the company has very strong free cash flow to net income at 1.49, which is higher than competitors Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO), which have net income to sales ratios at 1.37 and 1.21, respectively, while realizing much slower growth. Forward PE is relatively cheap at 15.8 while price to sales is at a very reasonable 5.2x. Figure 1 provides an outlook into the company's future net worth based on its cash flows.Figure 1It is important to take note of the company's growth level for ancillary services such as email security and cloud backup security storage. The company has seen growth of over 330% in email security while cloud backup is up 68%. I believe this is the real catalyst for future growth for the company as it looks to pivot its technology and scale further into the enterprise. Despite this incredible growth, there are some headwinds for the stock. Competition is fierce and the company will have to come up with new verticals as it seeks new growth opportunities. We believe the competition risk for the company's ancillary services are large since names like FireEye (NASDAQ:FEYE), Barracuda (NYSE:CUDA) and Fortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT) can easily enter this space for high-end threats given their strong development and patent base.The cancel rate (the rate of cancellations for its cloud services after a four-month period) also is a real risk since full-service firms like Microsoft carry large weight on providing total enterprise solutions for the small-to-medium turnkey enterprise market. This creates substantial pricing power and could drawdown revenue for a small-cap name like J2 Global which is dependant on further growth in its subscription model.There also is concern with regard to the company's digital media segment, which has competition from platform providers like the Meredith Corporation or Time Inc. These companies have similar business models on a digital scale and are extremely cyclical. Names in this space are down over 8% YTD and there is no reservation that this may not weigh on J2 Global's results for the foreseeable future given that over 25% of total revenue comes from this space. Further, the company is down for the month as the market is wary given macroeconomic uncertainties.Overall, we still remain bullish on the stock given its solid execution and strategy. The Logos LP price target on the stock is $82 and we are interested in getting into the name in the low 60s."
2924256,48311,2015-02-18T18:16:49-05:00,"J2 Global presented impressive earnings and the market responded by trading the stock up both before and after the earnings call.The most impressive achievement is the growth of the Media Segment which I've touched on in previous articles.I continue to be impressed with this management team.Yet, given the modest discount to intrinsic value and acquisitions ahead I'm fine on the sidelines.","J2 Global (NASDAQ:JCOM) managers are consistently inconsistent with where they invest the cash that's being thrown off by its businesses and always keep shareholders and analysts guessing as to whether the next acquisition will be in its cloud or media segment. That's a good thing, as it is a function of management allocating capital to the segment where it sees the best deals in the market. Managements track record over the past 10 years of RoIC and RoE is very, very strong - think >20%.Every earnings call I review, it shows management is acutely aware of how to allocate capital efficiently. An example of how this shines through from the most recent one is the following bit (emphasis mine):In my PRO article called: J2 Global: Legacy Fax Business Obscures Growth Potential Of A Strategically Acquired Portfolio Of Businesses I wrote:I think this is really starting to play out now. At the time quarterly Business Cloud Services operating income dwarfed Digital Media's with $49 million vs. $4.6 million. This quarter cloud services and IP produced $56 million in EBITDA (which is very good) but the media business now produced $21 million in EBITDA.The Digital Media segment is really starting to have an impact on the bottom line. Management still expects to not only be able to grow this segment in terms of revenue but to drive margins further as well. What that means is that this segment is likely to outpace Business Cloud Services (which contains its legacy cash cow fax business) by a wide margin. Because the Business Cloud Services segment has been the driver as far as the markets determination of the company's value goes, the growth coming out of the Media segment may come as something of a surprise.Even though the company continues to execute on its tried and tested method of making acquisitions and achieving synergies in Business Cloud Services I expect the most from its acquisitions in the Media space. The reason I'm cheering when the company makes a media acquisition or achieves strong organic growth is the company's acquisition of NetShelter.NetShelter gave the company an advanced digital ad targeting platform geared toward the technology niche. When J2 Global acquires more content platforms in the technology space to expand on the reach of its new ad network it gains incremental value from its acquisitions. By building a highly targeted network with enough reach, the company will have an attractive offering for large advertisers.An acquisition not just serves to increase revenue and share the burden of overhead over a larger revenue base but it also makes the ad platform more attractive to advertisers. More advertisers in turn will drive interest among publishers to sign up to the ad network. When third party adoption of the advertising network can be accelerated, the segment can quickly grow revenue. Ads on third party websites will leverage the digital ad targeting platform asset and drive revenue with almost no incremental expense, in turn driving the bottom line very hard. When its ad network has both scale and is highly targeted, the company is digging quite the moat around its business.Even with the price increase before and after the earnings call, paying 24x earnings may not be as egregious as you would think it to be at first glance. Paying 24x times earnings with this management team, the growth left to squeeze out of the media segment and the opportunity to build out the ad network is not a bad deal in my opinion. However, I think there is a fair chance a better opportunity will present itself when earnings disappoint after a few troublesome acquisitions. With several of these on the roll, I'm fine on the sidelines."

The orange line on the graph plots earnings per share since 2004. A quick glance vividly reveals the historical operating record of the company.J2 Global (NASDAQ:JCOM) provides Internet services through its two divisions: Business Cloud Services and Digital Media Division. The Business Cloud Services Division offers Internet fax, virtual phone, hosted email, email marketing, online backup, unified communications and CRM solutions.This article will reveal the business prospects of J2 Global Inc through the lens of the FAST Graphs fundamentals analyzer software tool. Therefore, it is offered as the first step before a more comprehensive research effort. Our objective is to provide companies that have excellent historical records and appear reasonably priced based on past, present and future data and expectations.A quick glance at the graph itself and the orange earnings justified valuation line will tell the readers volumes about how well the company has historically been managed and performed as an operating business. Simply put, the reader should ask whether this example is worthy of a greater investment of time and effort based on the data as presented and organized. The FAST Graphs' unique advantage is the graphical articulation of the price value proposition.Earnings Determine Market Price: The following earnings and price correlated FAST Graphs™ clearly illustrates the importance of earnings. The Earnings Growth Rate Line or True Worth™ Line (orange line with white triangles) is correlated with the historical stock price line. On graph after graph the lines will move in tandem. If the stock price strays away from the earnings line (over or under), inevitably it will come back to earnings.Earnings & Price Correlated Fundamentals-at-a-GlanceA quick glance at the historical earnings and price correlated FAST Graphs™ on J2 Global Inc shows a picture of undervaluation based upon the historical earnings growth rate of 16.4% and a current P/E of 12.1. Analysts are forecasting the earnings growth to continue at about 6.5%, and when you look at the forecasting graph below, the stock appears undervalued (it's inside of the value corridor of the five orange lines - based on future growth).J2 Global Inc: Historical Earnings, Price, Dividends and Normal P/E Since 2004Performance Table J2 Global IncThe associated performance results with the earnings and price correlated graph, validates the principles regarding the two components of total return: capital appreciation and dividend income. Dividends are included in the total return calculation and are assumed paid, but not reinvested.When presented separately like this, the additional rate of return a dividend-paying stock produces for shareholders becomes undeniably evident. In addition to the 10.9% capital appreciation (green circle), long-term shareholders of J2 Global Inc, assuming an initial investment of $1,000, would have received an additional $102.87 in dividends (blue highlighting) that increased their total return from 10.9% to 11.4% per annum versus 5% in the S&P 500.The following graph plots the historical P/E ratio (the dark blue line) in conjunction with 10-year Treasury note interest. Notice that the current price earnings ratio on this quality company is as low as it has been since 2004.A further indication of valuation can be seen by examining a company's current P/S ratio relative to its historical P/S ratio. The current P/S ratio for J2 Global Inc is 4.03, which is historically low.Looking to the FutureExtensive research has provided a preponderance of conclusive evidence that future long-term returns are a function of two critical determinants:Forecasting future earnings growth, bought at sound valuations, is the key to safe, sound and profitable performance.The Estimated Earnings and Return Calculator Tool is a simple yet powerful resource that empowers the user to calculate and run various investing scenarios that generate precise rate of return potentialities. Thinking the investment through to its logical conclusion is an important component toward making sound and prudent commonsense investing decisions.The consensus of seven leading analysts reporting to Capital IQ forecast J2 Global Inc.'s long-term earnings growth at 6.5% (orange circle). J2 Global Inc has medium long-term debt at 30% of capital (red circle). J2 Global Inc is currently trading at a P/E of 12.1, which is inside the value corridor (defined by the five orange lines) of a maximum P/E of 18. If the earnings materialize as forecast, based upon forecast earnings growth of 6.5%, J2 Global Inc.'s share price would $54.46 at the end of 2018 (brown circle on EYE Chart), which would represent a 11.9% annual rate of total return, which includes dividends paid (yellow highlighting).Earnings Yield EstimatesDiscounted Future Cash Flows: All companies derive their value from the future cash flows (earnings) they are capable of generating for their stakeholders over time. Therefore, because Earnings Determine Market Price in the long run, we expect the future earnings of a company to justify the price we pay.Since all investments potentially compete with all other investments, it is useful to compare investing in any prospective company with that of a comparable investment in low risk Treasury bonds. Comparing an investment in J2 Global Inc. to an equal investment in 10-year Treasury bonds illustrates that J2 Global Inc.'s expected earnings would be 5.6 (purple circle) times that of the 10-year T-bond interest (see EYE chart below).

2224263,48311,2014-05-19T17:17:28-04:00,"Legacy fax business obscures growth potential of J2's other cloud services and media business.
        Management with history of value creation and with ownership in the company.
        Media acquisitions are value adding on their own but also contribute to a greater strategy.
        Only if the cash cow fax business dies real quickly, or similar negative events can be expected, should the company be considered overvalued.
        When operating leverage in the Digital Media segment doubles operating margins, this will drive the company's bottom line.","J2 Global Inc. (NASDAQ:JCOM) was found in 1995. The company began as a cheaper alternative to owning a fax machine. Today, incredibly this is still a cash cow, J2 still processes more than 1 billion faxes a year for lawyers, doctors and others who rely on delivery confirmation and phone records. Since 1996, the company has been led by CEO Nehemia Zucker, who has established an impressive track record of value creation.Last year the market got really upset when the company missed on earnings, and scared because the CEO moved away from acquisitions in the cloud space to acquiring assets in the media space.The stock dropped from $55 to $45 after that earnings call. I subsequently discussed the company and since that time the stock held up reasonably well but made a less pronounced dive after the most recent earnings call again, back to just $46 per share:JCOM Total Return Price data by YChartsEven though results, as presented by the CFO, were not all that bad:Current BusinessRight now, the company has three distinctly different sources of revenue. There are the cloud businesses with the eFax and eVoice tools, the Media Business and there are IP licensing revenues. As Zucker told Forbes:In the Q4 2013 call he offered an enlightening perspective on that Buffetesque statement:What is especially interesting about this dynamic of having a legacy cash cow business complemented with a fast growing portfolio of businesses acquired at reasonable prices, is that the growth speed of the new business is not immediately clear when evaluating the company numbers.This allows us, as investors, to acquire these fast growers at an attractive price. This legacy business is also one of the biggest liabilities of an investment into J2. More about that later.IP licensing revenue is highly volatile and not a lot compared to the company's total revenue. For example, in Q4 it was $1.6 million. That's why it is somewhat underestimated by investors. In reality this revenue falls almost completely to the bottom line. The volatility of this revenue stream, because it often involves litigation, can make the company's valuation multiples look somewhat elevated at certain points in time.Promising Media BusinessManagement has noted that the reason it has recently mostly been buying media companies is a matter of price. Although it is also interested in building out its cloud business, the asking price by sellers was not at a point management expected to be able to attain the desired ROIC.In the Q4 2013 call there were a few especially intriguing bits when thinking about future growth:The company wants to launch local versions of its magazines across the globe. I expect management to execute this with the intent to utilize operating leverage as much as possible. It also indicated that the recent pullback has them more optimistic about getting M&A going in the U.S. Before they have been looking across the globe in search of more attractively priced assets.Getting incremental revenue will be influential in the ultimate EBITDA margin that is attainable in the Media segment. Management estimates they are somewhere in the low to mid-20s right now, but argues it's realistic to attain margins in the 30s. The 4th quarter of 2013 was highly promising in this regard, because management indicates that this high revenue quarter saw almost all the additional revenue fall directly to EBITDA.Obviously high growth in revenue combined with margin expansion will exponentially inflate the bottom line.Management with history of value creationJ2 has historically been a serial acquirer. Hemi Zucker, J2′s CEO, joined in 1996, and this is not the first time he steered the company in a different direction. When Nasdaq threatened to delist J2, the company did a 4-for-1 reverse split of its shares in February 2001.Fighting for its dear life, J2 acquired its main competitor, eFax, in late 2000 and raised prices. Zucker also halved the $8 million+ ad budget, equivalent to 62% of revenue. This returned the company to profitability by 2002.Zucker has bought 40 or so companies since he took over at the helm. He has taken J2 into document management, e-mail hosting, marketing services, conference calls and now media.Through all these years he built up a track record of creating tremendous value for shareholders. Earnings per share have grown by an average of 24% per year over the past ten years. Returns on equity have been astounding; judging by his track record, the CEO is quite clearly a skilled capital allocator.A philosophy of careful capital allocation appears to be well ingrained in the entire management team as President Scott Turichi spelled it out in the latest earnings call:The chairman of the board is Richard S. Ressler who owns approximately 5.26% of the company and is the founder of Orchard Capital. Zucker owns 0.4% of outstanding shares with a market value of over $8 million, in May he, along with other insiders, has acquired some more shares. A majority of key insiders are properly incentivized to further the goals of minority stockholders.Concerns surrounding the legacy fax businessCurrently fax is still quite an important segment of the company. That segment's success is dependent upon the continued use of fax. If the demand for fax decreases, and the company is unable to replace lost revenues from fax services with an increase in revenues from other services, J2's financial condition, operating results and cash flows could come under a lot of pressure.One of the attractions to fax is that fax signatures are a generally accepted method of executing contracts. There are on-going efforts by governmental and NGO entities to create a universally accepted method for electronically signing documents.Widespread adoption of ""digital signatures"" could suddenly reduce demand for the company's fax service. At this time, the fax business is still growing just at a much slower pace compared to the overall business.Greater Strategy Behind Digital ContentAs much as I dislike companies driving growth by acquisition, Zucker has the track record to back him up. His latest foray into digital content has a greater strategy behind just prudently investing capital into cash generating businesses.I've reported on this before but it is vital to understand this in order to judge the company's prospects correctly. Paramount to this strategy is the acquisition of NetShelter. The company is using its advanced digital ad targeting platform and Ziff Davis B2B, a leading provider of research to enterprise buyers and leads to IT vendors, to expand its ad platform and data providing services to businesses.Going forward, I expect management will seek to acquire more content platforms in the technology space to expand on the reach of its new ad network. By building a highly targeted network with enough reach, the company will have an attractive offering for large advertisers.Increasing the number of advertisers will drive interest among publishers to sign up to the ad network. When 3rd party adoption of the advertising network can be accelerated, the segment can quickly grow revenue. Ads on third party websites will leverage the digital ad targeting platform asset and drive revenue with almost no incremental expense. In turn driving the bottom line very hard.Another strategic benefit of the NetShelter engine is to allow the company to extract incremental value from investments into media companies. When management acquires enough niche websites or signs up 3rd party publishers, the company is effectively establishing a moat around its business.When its ad network has both scale and is highly targeted, it will become very hard for other networks to match J2's effectiveness per dollar spent on ads.Both its historic track record and this ongoing strategic execution strengthen my confidence the company will achieve better returns on equity than the S&P 500 over the next few years.Valuation by Discounted Cash FlowAt first glance the company is not especially attractive. J2 is trading at a P/E of 19. The EV/EBITDA ratio is 9, P/B is ~3 and FCF per share is $3.4. When you examine the forward P/E of 13 and the PEG ratio of 1.3 things start to look a lot better. When relying on historic cash flow or earnings growth rate, you should keep in mind that only recently the fax business is becoming less important. Before, the fax business was dominating both on revenue and at the bottom line. This is a part of the business that is growing at a much lower pace. This means there now is upwards pressure on the company's overall growth rate going forward.This is much easier to see when I break out the numbers by division:Note that the company segments only into Business Cloud Services and Digital Media. Fax is part of Business Cloud Services and I have attempted to extract its separate numbers, going by the numbers provided through quarterly earnings calls. Clearly fax is growing much slower than the other segments. Operating margins on fax are not available but I expect them to be in line or better than Business Cloud Services overall numbers. Obviously these margins are not expanding very much, while great operating margin is expected from Digital Media. Ultimately into the 30's.This will have a profound effect on the bottom line contribution coming from Digital Media. Currently Business Cloud Services operating income dwarfs Digital Media's with $49 million vs $4.6 million. Yet, last year Digital Media was still operating at a net loss.Although the numbers currently available since the company moved into the Media segment are anything but stable, in conjunction with what we know about the operating leverage of the Digital Media segment and the greater strategy behind these acquisitions, they make sense:The quarterly picture already shows a strong move in the right direction and Q1's are known to be very weak quarters for Digital Media. Generally expected to represent a fifth of full year revenue without further acquisitions.One of the reasons I'm not breaking out CAPEX is that this will only serve to confuse the issue. All segments have very capital light business models and the CAPEX required to maintain FCF is negligible. Most of the company's CAPEX goes towards acquisitions. Because management is very value sensitive, they will allocate CAPEX to the segment where it can achieve its desired ROIC targets. This can be different from quarter to quarter.J2 is one of these businesses that is extremely hard to value. In my earlier article I performed a DCF calculation, this time I've expanded upon it by including three sets of assumptions: A neutral, optimistic and pessimistic set.The pessimistic scenario shows the present value of the business if you expect the fax business to be killed of relatively quickly, yet the rest of the business continues to perform well. If you model according to these assumptions the shares are 28% overvalued. For this to be an accurate present value you need to be comfortable with fading out all revenue from the fax business quickly and maintaining a strong growth rate of FCF of the media and remaining cloud business over an extended period of time.In a neutral scenario the company grows total FCF at 15% annualized as far as 7 years into the future. This can be realized through growing the Digital Media segment and expand its margins and by having the fax segment spewing cash for a few more years. Given these assumptions the stock is worth 45% more.If you expect a bright future where everything comes together and management is able to fully capitalize on the operating leverage of the newly acquired media business, the stock is currently as much as 84% undervalued. For this to be true it has to be highly likely the company can grow its current total FCF 15% annualized as far as 10 years into the future.ConclusionThe CEO has a great track record of capital allocation. My analysis of the strategy behind the latest string of acquisitions shows the soundness of his current plans. This indicates Zucker has a good chance to keep batting his historic averages of creating tremendous value for shareholders.The market is underestimating the company's room to increase margins at the Media business and continue growing revenue at its historic pace. This creates an opportunity to buy J2 and wait for the market to recognize the company's true worth when future earnings reports paint a clearer picture.Sources:In addition to the sources linked directly I have consulted the 2013 10-K, Q1 2013 earnings call and the Q2 2013 earnings call.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1504852,30811,2013-06-17T06:20:42-04:00,,"Robust profitability, stable cash flow, healthy growth prospect, and attractive valuation are the key criteria for stock investing. J2 Global Communications (NASDAQ:JCOM) is such a quality investment that offers all those merits. In this note, I will walk you through my investment analysis that supports my bullish view on the stock.Business OverviewFounded in 1995, J2 is a technology company that provides cloud and digital media services to business and individual customers. The firm has two business segments - Cloud and Media (see slide below).The Cloud segment offers a variety of office cloud services to business clients. Under the Direct Inward Dial (DID) category, J2's products include eFax, MyFax, Fax.com, and SmartFax that enable business users to send and receive faxes through their email accounts. The firm's voice products including eVoice and OneBox help customer establish a virtual phone system with various enhancements. In the Non-DID category, J2's FuseMail and Campaigner products provide customers email, archival, perimeter protection, as well as enhanced email market solutions. The firm also offers data back-up CRM customer relationship solutions through KeepItSafe and CampaignerCRM. The Cloud segment derives its revenue mainly through subscription fee and patent licensing.J2's Media segment operates two portfolios of web properties under Ziff Davis and IGN, respectively. Ziff Davis' web properties primarily provide trusted reviews of technology products, technology-oriented commentary, professional networking services, and online deals for business and individual customers. IGN operates IGN.com and AskMen.com, which offer leading gaming and men's lifestyle information services, respectively. The Media segment generates revenue primarily through selling display advertising, logo and copyright licensing, as well as customer and business leads.Stock OverviewJ2 has a market capitalization of $1.9B. The stock has steadily climbed by almost 66% over the past 60 months and is currently trading at its 5-year high of $42.30 with a 2.3% dividend yield (see chart below).Growth Strategy & FinancialsAs the Media business was recently acquired in November 2012, J2 generated a majority of its total revenue (97%) from the Cloud business in 2012. Despite the fact that the fax and voice cloud service market is fairly matured, J2 has managed to achieve a CAGR of 11.4% over the past 5 fiscal years through organic growth and numerous acquisitions (see chart below).J2's growth strategy has long been focusing on maintaining superior business margin and steady cash flow conversion. The robust cash flow then would be spent on M&A activities that help the company expand into adjacent markets where J2 can leverage its existing competencies to generate accretive return. The cash return from the acquired business and existing operation would again be invested in new acquisitions, forming a lucrative M&A cycle.J2 has managed to sustain a very steady and robust margin trend over the past 5 years (see chart below). The company has also been able to convert at least 80% of EBITDA to operating cash flow every year (see chart below). Given the fairly matured fax and voice cloud businesses, the limited capital expenditure allows J2 to produce significant free cash flow. In the 5-year period, J2's levered free cash flow margin averaged at 40.3%, which is almost on par with its average EBIT margin of 41.9% (see chart below).With the efficient cash-generating cycle, J2 has completed a total of 27 tuck-in transactions over the past 5 years, and the firm was able to produce at least a 20% annual return on equity in each year (see charts below).Acquisition of Ziff Davis and IGNIn November 2012, J2 made a modestly transformational move by acquiring Ziff Davis, a digital media company that operates various websites providing technology-oriented review, commentary, and networking services. The company further expanded its presence in the digital media space by acquiring IGN in February 2013. The two transactions were aimed to improve J2's growth profile and ultimately strengthen the company's cash flow position to better service the M&A cycle.By the end of 2013, J2 expects the Media segment to represent approximately 25% of the revenue mix and the company's overall margin to be slightly lower in the near term due to the higher fixed cost for the Media business. But given that the segment remains in an early growth phase and digital media is a secular growth space as opposed to the existing fax and voice cloud businesses, the margin profile is forecasted to improve over time as the Media revenue grows.In a company presentation in May 2013, J2 provided a few updates on Ziff Davis' recent performance (see slide below) and IGN's integration status. Both Ziff Davis' web visits and page views have increased markedly by 19% and 30%, respectively, in Q1 2013 on a year-over-year basis. Its revenue has ramped up by 22% in the quarter and EBITDA has risen substantially by 152% year-over-year. On the IGN side, all of the originally planned IGN integration has been executed successfully, which includes divesting some non-core assets as well as reducing headcounts and other non-staff costs.Upside Driver 1 - Ample Liquidity for Continued AcquisitionsThe stellar stock performance over the past 5 years is believed to be largely driven by a series of J2's M&A activities as J2's management has demonstrated its ability to pursue accretive transactions and implement business integration as planned. Going forward, I expect J2 to continue having ample liquidity to sustain the current acquisition pace, which allows the company to gradually shift away from the matured fax and voice businesses.I have performed the following quantitative analysis with some conservative assumptions to demonstrate J2's acquisition firepower:1) Currently, the consensus estimates predict J2 to generate EBITDA of $230.3M and $245.3M in 2013 and 2014, respectively. To establish my own EBITDA assumptions, I discounted the consensus estimates by 3% and only considered $223.4M and $237.9M as my estimated EBITDA for 2013 and 2014.2) Given the fact that J2 has managed to improve its EBITDA to levered free cash flow conversion rate somewhat steadily from 79% in 2008 to 89% in 2012 (see chart below), it would be reasonable and conservative to assume an 82% conversion rate for 2013 and 2014, which is near the low end of the 5-year historical range.3) Under those assumptions, J2 would generate $183.2M and $195.1M in levered free cash flow in 2013 and 2014, respectively, which would be available for acquisition, dividend payout, and share repurchase.4) J2 paid out a total dividend of $40.3M and bought back approximately $60.3M value of shares in 2012. The dividend per share has been growing at an annualized rate of 12% since 2011. By fixing the dividend growth rate and assuming a 3% growth in share repurchase, the total capital return would consume about $108.5M and $117.0M of the total free cash flow in 2013 and 2014, leaving $74.7M and $78.0M cash available for M&A activities in the two years.Essentially, the above analysis suggests that J2's existing operations would be able to generate sufficient funding to support medium-size tuck-in acquisitions without impacting the capital return plan. In addition, J2's other funding sources include an ample cash pile of $294M as of March 31, 2013 and a $40M revolving facility which has not been drawn. Moreover, the company currently has a net cash position of $49.2M. Given J2's robust cash generating capability, the company would be able to assume additional debt at a reasonable cost, giving J2 a strong financial capacity to go after some larger transformational deals.Upside Driver 2 - Significant Valuation Upside PotentialDespite the strong price run-up in the past 5 years, I believe the stock remains cheap as the company's future growth potential has not been fully priced in. Even with a 5-year price appreciation of 55%, J2's trailing P/E multiple is now just slightly above the 5-year historical average (see chart below).The stock's forward P/E multiple has expanded by 20% over the past 6 months from 11.9x to 14.3x, which may seem to be significant. However, considering the facts that the company's consensus revenue, EBITDA, and EPS estimates for the current and next fiscal years have all experienced very substantial upward revisions over the period and that the firm's consensus 5-year earnings growth estimate has also been raised from 7.6% to 10.8%, the 20% multiple expansion is completely warranted (see charts below, sourced from S&P Capital IQ).Further, although the forward multiple gap between J2 and S&P 500 Index has narrowed from 12% to 6% over the 6-month period (see chart below), the below-market valuation still looks very compelling as I believe J2's current fundamentals and growth potential should reasonably command an above-market valuation provided that 1) J2's 5-year consensus earnings growth estimate at 10.8% is notably above the average estimate of 8.2% for the S&P 500 Index; 2) J2's various operating metrics including profitability margins, ROE, ROIC, and free cash flow margin are markedly above the market averages; and 3) J2's current dividend yield is in line with the S&P 500's average and the stock price is also supported by the buyback program.I also performed a 10-year DCF valuation to gauge the various assumptions that are implied by the current share price (see DCF template below).To yield a share value close to the current price of $42.30, the following key assumptions were incorporated in my model:1) Revenue growth rate was assumed to decline from 4.6% in 2014 to 1.5% in the terminal year, representing a 10-year CAGR of just 3.0%. It is noted that J2's management has indicated the company's organic growth would likely to be around 8% year-over-year over the medium term, while the current model assumption is substantially below that expectation.2) EBITDA margin was assumed to be constant at 43% from 2015 to the terminal year. This margin assumption was also much more conservative than management's expectation that the margin will potentially expand over time (currently at 46.5% as of March 31, 2013 on a trailing 12-month basis) as a large portion of the Media segment's cost is fixed while the segment revenue would continue to grow.3) Depreciation and tax rates were forecasted based on their historical percentage to the total revenue.4) Capital expenditure as percentage of the revenue was assumed to rise from 2.5% in 2013 to 7.0% in 2019 to account for the case that J2 may increase spending to boost the Media segment performance. The ratio was then modeled to decline to 4.0% in the terminal year. It is noted that the ratio estimates are considerably above the historical range.5) Net working capital investment was projected based on its historical relationship with the total revenue.6) A WACC of 10.7% was used. The assumptions used in the calculation were conservative. For example, a 3.5% company specific risk premium was added to account for the financial projection risk (though a number of them were already very conservative).Apparently, the current share price has not priced in any upside resulted from future acquisitions. Even for the organic growth case, the current share price has only baked in a very conservative scenario.Upside Driver 3 - Dividend Hike and Increased Share RepurchaseDue to the strong cash flow generation, J2 initiated its first dividend of $0.20 per share in August 2011. Since then, the dividend payment has been raised 7 times and by 20% to the current $0.24 level. As the Cloud business continues to generate steady cash flow with additional contribution from the high-growth Media segment, it is expected that management would continue raising the dividend and size of share buyback. Based on my liquidity analysis discussed previously, the probability that J2 would sacrifice the dividend growth for continued M&A expansion is likely to be low as the firm is currently sitting on a large cash balance and also has an ample borrowing capacity.ConclusionJ2's strong profitability and cash flow generation allow management to continue executing the organic and M&A expansion strategy. As the current share valuation has not yet matched the company's fundamentals and growth prospects, I would strongly recommend buying the shares at the current level. My target share price of $52 is 23% above the current price and is derived from a revised DCF model with more reasonable revenue, EBITDA, and capital expenditure assumptions (see DCF model below). Based on the consensus next 12 months EPS estimate of $2.99, my $52 price target implies a forward P/E multiple of 17.4x. Factoring in J2's consensus 5-year earnings growth estimate of 10.8%, the stock's 5-year PEG ratio of 1.7x remains below the S&P 500's average of 1.8x (calculated with 15.1x forward P/E and 8.2% long-term earnings growth estimate). It should be noted that my $52 target is still not reflective of any future M&A upside, and as such, potential return could be even higher.All facts and data used in the article are sourced from S&P Capital IQ, company financial filings, and company presentation unless otherwise specified.Disclosure: I am long JCOM.

If they aren't highly informative, they are at least entertaining. The research outfit doesn't disappoint with its latest report on j2 Global (NASDAQ:JCOM). This is a company I know fairly well and have written about on Seeking Alpha on several occasions. Because I think Citron is taking it over the top in this particular report, I want to address the dirty secrets it identified. By the way, ""dirty secrets"" is kind of a misnomer, as it implies activity that's dishonest or dishonorable AND secret. Nothing Citron addresses is any of that, with the exception of the way j2 Global apparently treats customers who want to cancel.Another thing - Citron makes it sound like the company has been hiding its reliance on its eFax business. That's not the case. On the Q4 2013 earnings conference call, CEO Zucker broke out the non-fax business, for example (emphasis mine):Citron is implying it found an obscure mention in the 10-K, but in reality, it is no secret to those following the company. On to the real dirty secrets:Dirty secret #1Citron makes a good point that the patent expiration may be a problem. I think this is valuable input on its part and deserves to be taken into account when valuing j2 Global. I don't think the expiration is as disastrous as it would be for a profitable medicine, as the industry isn't nearly as attractive, but there is no doubt this can only be a negative.Dirty secret #2The only way j2 has been able to maintain the profitability of its fax-to-email business is through highly controversial and aggressive (if not fraudulent) billing practices.Here, Citron Research implies j2 is struggling to maintain profitability at the fax-to-email business and had to resort to these tactics. Although the use of these tactics in itself is, again, great digging by Citron, the profitability of j2's fax business is very healthy. Margins are something like 50%.It is also under this header that Citron Research says the backup / storage / email security / email marketing / web hosting and other businesses compete in a commoditized space.I agree, the services are commodities, but that does not mean they are without competitive advantage. I suspect customer captivity is pretty high with these. If you are a small business owner and your workforce is working and trained with one application (perhaps mission-critical), do you really want to switch? The same is true for other customers. The fee is probably not high enough to warrant a switch and the cumbersome learning process associated with that.Second, the strategic rationale behind picking up a number of these businesses and the client relationships that go with them does make sense to me. Later on, Citron will try to disqualify the quality of these relationships, but j2 Global isn't selling major luxury items... it is selling small enterprise applications few companies can live without, but no one wants to think about too much. Owning a number of these applications and picking up the e-mail lists of these companies is valuable. It is possible this strategy won't work out as Citron asserts, but I understand the rationale.Dirty secret #3Citron posits traffic is down across all of j2 Global's flagship properties and traffic doesn't lie. Implied conclusion: these were terrible acquisitions. I have always been under the impression that j2 Global's culture is one of prudence. The company doesn't buy assets when it is high-flying and has a bright future, but makes careful prudent buys and squeezes all the value it can out of them. In the words of President / CFO Turichi (emphasis mine):Declining revenue / traffic businesses can be excellent assets if you are able to grow earnings off of them. Furthermore Citron calls out the company for not having a mobile strategy, but its content is all readily accessible and mobile responsive. You can check out all the flagship properties through MobileTest.me.Dirty secret #4 (The biggest secret of them all)Citron calls j2 Global out for changing the word ""may"" to ""must,"" and to be fair, it is certainly peculiar and looks like an admission of having no organic growth. But the company doesn't say it ""must make acquisitions."" It says ""must make acquisitions"" to ""sustain growth."" That's a difference, because there is another choice: not sustaining the same growth.As the company is growing in size and becoming increasingly diversified, it is harder to make truly small tuck-in acquisitions that move the needle. The smaller you can buy, the smaller multiples tend to be and the easier it is to make value-added acquisitions. This is probably one of the reasons every platform story runs into a wall at some point. It is probably also at least in part for this reason that j2 openly asks cloud and media businesses to come to it for a partnership or a buyout. It makes sense to communicate the company's intent online, as this is a global business and it is run by people who are online-savvy and will find their way around the internet, but Zucker is unlikely to meet the business owners he wants to meet at the local golf track.ConclusionIn this particular case, Citron is hyping the wrongs at j2 in this entertaining signature fashion. It is very crafty at writing in such a way that much is implied, but when you read precisely what's in black/white doesn't measure up to these expectations. I do think several of its observations have merit and deserve to be thought about, but I would be surprised if j2 Global is an accounting manipulating platform bust, as the company and its earnings growth strategy have survived several market downturns (when these things tend to surface) before. Not in the least, the 2008 bust.Perhaps the most important thing I agree with Citron on is the valuation of j2 Global isn't attractive. As I put it in my last article on the stock:Citron puts a price target of $37 on the stock, and as I don't own shares, I wouldn't mind if it gets there, because I would take a very hard look at that time to buy. Citron is threatening with a second report about accounting shenanigans, and I expect a treatise of the company's amortization practices. It will be interesting!"

However, upon further review of j2′s M&A strategy and recently  released financial statements for Ziff Davis, the company actually meets  many of j2′s requirements for its diversification acquisitions: Ziff  Davis has a strong management team, operates in a fragmented market and,  perhaps most importantly, is increasing revenue.Technology content provider Ziff Davis Media was a powerhouse in its  time, but it struggled as consumers moved from print to digital media.  Total revenue at the company declined from $300m in 2001 to $76m in  2007, when more than half of its revenue was still coming from print  advertising.Ziff Davis filed for bankruptcy in 2008, and was subsequently carved  up in four transactions. The Ziff Davis chunk being acquired by j2 is  owned by CEO Vivek Shah and Great Hill Partners. Shah, a digital  publishing veteran with experience at Time Inc. and the Fortune/Money  Group, and his team helped turn around ailing Ziff Davis, bump up  revenue and return it to profitability.J2 released financial statements this week for Ziff Davis that show  the company is in growth mode. Unaudited results for the nine months  ended September 30 show revenue increased 70% over the prior year to  $32m. In the 12 months ended September 30, the company generated almost  $45m in revenue, with nearly $8m in EBITDA."

The company has grown mainly through acquisitions. Indeed, over the last decade they have spent $347M of $715M in FCF on acquisitions. After reviewing the company's investor presentations and reading through their 10-Ks something strange caught my eye.The company reports monthly churn rates of a little over 3% in FY2009, dropping to about 2.4% in FY2011. This monthly churn equates to a customer staying with company for approximately three years. However, the company discloses in its 10-Ks that it amortizes acquired customer relationships over much longer periods of time.In the chart below we show the differences in the average customer relationship and the length of time JCOM amortizes acquired customer relationships. We were unable to find monthly churn data prior to FY2009.It's also worth noting that JCOM discloses two different amortization periods for 2010. In its FY2010 10-K the company says its weighted average amortization period for customer relationships is 6.3 years. A screenshot of the relative portion of the 2010 10-K is below.In the FY2011 10-K the company now says in amortized customer relationships over 6.7 years. A screenshot of the relevant section of the 10-K is shown below.Just how significant are changes to the amortization period for customer relationships? Well, lengthening the time over which you amortize something reduces the expenses you recognize each year. As an exercise in comparison we show what JCOM's earnings would look like over the past three years based on an estimate of customer relationship amortization costs if those costs had been amortized over the same period as the company's average customer relationship as implied by its monthly churn numbers.A chart showing the pro forma additional amortization expenses and pro forma net income and EPS is shown below followed by an in depth explanation of our methodology for estimating additional amortization costs.We estimated the additional amortization expense associated with the decrease in the weighted average amortization period for customer relationships by estimating the original amortization amount ascribed to customer relationships by dividing the historical cost of acquired customer relationships by the weighted average amortization period disclosed by the company. We then took the difference of that value and the value of the historical cost of customer relationships divided by the average length of customer relationships as implied by the companies average monthly churn rates. We also cross referenced the amortization estimates of our model with the estimates the company disclosed for that year. We found our model likely under estimated the additional amortization costs by about several million dollars each year.We wonder why the company chooses amortization periods for customer relationships that are almost double the length of its average customer relationship?Disclosure: I am short JCOM."
312057,21636,2011-12-06T08:07:46-05:00,,"Last week, I suggested that j2 Global Communications Inc. (NASDAQ:JCOM) could have misinterpreted certain accounting rules and that it should consider restating its financial reports issued in 2010. My analysis was based on a report issued by independent research firm Gradient Analytics and an examination of accounting rules and company disclosures. This blog post will examine how j2 Global has attempted to downplay certain problems in its financial reporting and provide even more compelling reasons for the company to consider restating its financial reports.BackgroundUp to 2010, j2 Global apparently estimated the remaining life under its annual contracts with eFax customers to compute its deferred revenues, revenues, and earnings. In the first quarter 2011 10-Q report j2 Global disclosed that it upgraded its accounting systems and started using the actual useful life under its annual contracts with eFax customers to compute those numbers:The determination of the actual remaining life of an annual service contract involves a simple computation. For example, assume a company has a December 31 year-end. On November 1, a customer purchases an annual contract with an advance payment of $120. The company earns $10 per month under the annual contract ($120 divided by 12). At year-end, the company reports $20 of revenue to reflect income earned during November and December. In addition, it reports a deferred revenue liability of $100 to reflect the unearned income for the remaining 10 months under the contract. It’s not rocket science. Apparently, j2 Global’s accounting systems could not make such a computation, so the company estimated the number. It turns out that its estimates were significantly incorrect.In the first quarter of 2011 j2 Global upgraded its accounting systems and was now able to calculate the actual remaining life under its annual service contracts with eFax customers. In that quarter, the company recorded a one-time cumulative adjustment to increase deferred revenues by $10.3 million, decrease in revenues by $10.3 million, and decrease net income by $7.6 million to accurately reflect its actual remaining service obligations under annual contracts with eFax customers.Cumulative one-time adjustments in current periods relate to numbers reported in prior periods. Therefore, the company apparently understated its deferred revenue liability and overstated both revenue and net income reported in 2010 because it was unable to accurately measure the remaining life of annual service contracts with eFax customers. j2 Global claimed that those adjustments stemmed from a “change in estimate” under accounting rules. Therefore, it could use a one-time cumulative adjustment in the current quarter to correct unearned and earned income reported in previous periods.Last week, independent research firm Gradient Analytics issued a report that questioned whether j2 Global appropriately treated those adjustments as a change in estimate. Based on its examination of the j2 Global’s financial disclosures, applicable accounting rules, and limited feedback from the company, Gradient reported that “…the description of the underlying circumstances sounds more like a correction of an error in prior-period financial results.” If those adjustments were considered an accounting error rather than a change in estimate, a restatement of j2 Global’s 2010 financial reports may be warranted if such errors are considered material under accounting rules.Earlier company disclosuresFor years, j2 Global warned investors about potential ""failures or errors"" in its billing systems. For example, in the 2010 10-K report issued just months before it made those one-time adjustments, the company disclosed:If there were no “failures or errors” in j2 Global’s billing systems, logically there would have been no one-time adjustments in the first quarter of 2011 to correct an understatement of deferred revenue liabilities and overstatement of revenues and net income reported in 2010. However, when the accounting adjustments came as warned, the company did not admit to any foul ups. In its first quarter 2011 10-Q report, it tried to put a good face on the issue. The company said it upgraded its systems and started using actual numbers for the remaining life of annual contracts to eFax customers. It's like an army general who doesn't want to admit retreat and brags about advancing to the rear.SingerLewak LLP signed off on j2 Global's 2010 audit and internal controls on February 25, 2011, 56 days into the first quarter of 2011 (See 10-K report page 62). The close timing of the sign off by the auditors and the subsequent report of one-time adjustments raises concerns about the quality of their audit work and internal control environment at j2 Global.Gradient raised similar concerns in its report:A recent Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB)  inspection report issued on April 29, 2011, cited SingerLewak for various audit deficiencies, including ""the failure to perform sufficient procedures related to the testing of revenue."" The PCAOB report did not identify the company involved in that audit.j2 Global attempts to play down significance of one-time adjustmentsOn May 5, 2011, CFO Kathy Griggs sought to downplay the significance of its one-time adjustments during the first quarter 2011 earnings call with investors and analysts:The so-called first quarter 2011 “change in estimate” related to annual eFax subscribers. Logically, those one-time adjustments can only relate to revenues reported in 2010, not the entire thirteen year period. The adjustments increased deferred revenue liabilities by $10.3 million, decreased revenues by $10.3 million, and decreased net income by $7.6 million. Griggs used thirteen years of cumulative revenues amounting to $1.6 billion to make an inappropriate comparison to the $10.3 million revenue adjustment. She should have compared the $10.3 million revenue adjustment to $255.4 million of revenues reported in 2010.Kathy Griggs tried to explain the significance of its one-time adjustments purely in terms as a percentage of cumulative revenues. That was wrong, too. Relatively insignificant misstatements in reporting revenues can have a significant effect on reported growth trends in revenues and earnings. Furthermore, relatively small revenue misstatements can hide a company’s failure to meet or beat analyst’s consensus earnings forecasts. Whether you call it a change in estimate or an accounting error, relatively small misstatements of revenues can have a significant impact on a company’s reported financial performance.Was it a change in estimate or an accounting error?Last week, Gradient Analytics examined j2 Global's first quarter 2011 10-Q report and questioned whether j2 Global had appropriately treated those adjustments as a change in estimate:I'll try to explain the situation involving j2 Global's accounting issues in simple terms. A person could not count the fingers on his right hand without a calculator. He looked at his right hand and estimated that he had four fingers. After that person bought a calculator, he realized that there are actually five fingers on this right hand instead of four.Is the one finger adjustment a change in estimate or an error under accounting rules? In such a case, the actual amount of fingers already existed, was not subject to uncertainty, and did not come about because of new information. Therefore, the adjustment should not be a change in estimate under accounting rules. The person made a mathematical error. The miscounting of fingers arose from an oversight or misuse of facts at the time they were counted. If he couldn't count his fingers, he should have used a calculator to count them. Therefore, the adjustment should be considered an accounting error. The same logic appears to apply to adjustments made by j2 Global to deferred revenues, revenues, and net income.Gradient's concerns seem well-founded. If we are to accept j2 Global's rationale that its adjustments were a change in estimate, any public company that does not have adequate internal controls in place to report correct numbers can avoid reporting an accounting error when it turns out that previously reported numbers were incorrect.j2 Global treated its adjustments of overstatements of deferred liabilities and understatement of revenue and earnings as a “change in estimate” under accounting rules. That allowed it to make a one-time cumulative adjustment in the current quarter to correct unearned and earned income reported in previous periods. If j2 Global had considered those adjustments as stemming from a material accounting error it would have been required to restate its previously affected financial reports rather than make a one-time adjustment.Furthermore, it's troubling that j2 Global apparently stopped responding to Gradient as it made further inquiries about the change in estimate. Why clam up? The company did find time to comment about other aspects of Gradient's report to CNBC Senior Stock Commentator Herb Greenberg ( Video link to ""Herb Alert"" on CNBC).MaterialityIf we assume that j2 Global’s adjustments to deferred revenue, revenue, and net income stemmed from an accounting error instead of a change in estimate, the next step is to determine if the misstatement was material in affected previous reporting reports. According to Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 99 (SAB No. 99) some of the measures used to determine if accounting error is material are: “whether the misstatement masks a change in earnings or other trends” and “whether the misstatement hides a failure to meet analysts' consensus expectations for the enterprise.” If a misstatement causes a company to report an increase in revenues rather than properly report a decrease in revenues or if a misstatement hides a failure to match or beat analyst’s estimates, it is considered material and previously issued financial reports must be restated.In the third quarter of 2010, j2 Global’s revenues increased by a mere $977,000 to $62.778 million compared to $61.801 million in the previous year’s third quarter. Its earnings per share matched the previous year’s comparable numbers – no growth. RTT News reported that j2 Global beat earnings beat analyst’s estimates by just $0.01 per share in both the third quarter and second quarter of 2010.The understatement of deferred revenues and overstatement of revenues and earnings by j2 Global could have caused the company to report higher revenues and earnings per share in the third quarter of 2010 instead of lower revenues and earnings when compared to 2009's third quarter. In addition, they could have caused the company to beat analyst's estimates for third quarter and possibly the second quarter of 2010, too. Therefore, based on the size of the one-time adjustments it is possible there was a material misstatement of j2 Global’s financial performance in 2010.Other itemsIn its recent 8-K report for the third quarter of 2011, j2 Global presented a full non-GAAP income statement and reconciled it side-by-side with its GAAP numbers. According to S.E.C. Regulation G Compliance and Disclosure Interpretations , the company cannot present a full non-GAAP income statement. See below:The company should change its future non-GAAP presentations to comply with S.E.C rules.Closing commentsWhether or not there was a change in estimate or an accounting error, j2 Global needs to be more transparent with investors about its financial reporting issues.

I posted in the March 5, 2012 article the series of option trades recommended to create a 34% gain in a stock which actually traded down from our original purchase price of $33.39 (final cost basis $19.59). Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) was called away at $21 with a 14% gain since January 29, 2012. I never complain about profits, but clearly this is a case where buy-and-hold would have yielded a higher profit than the option strategy.Jabil Circuit Inc. (NYSE:JBL) was called away at $21 with a 39% gain since January 27, 2011 on a position that we originally recommended at $20.56 (final cost basis of $12.89). Western Refining Inc. (NYSE:WNR) was called away at $16 with a quick 17% gain on the buy/write strategy recommended on January 29, 2012 (final cost basis of $13.40). Xyratex Ltd (NASDAQ:XRTX) was called away at $15 with a 22% gain after being recommended on December 17, 2010 (final cost basis $11.58). Lastly, we had to spend $0.12 to close the LDK Solar Co (NYSE:LDK) Mar $5 put and sold to open the LDK Jun $5 put for $1.20.March expiration closed 5 positions, and so we have cash to open new positions, long or short. Let me get back to the opening line of this article, which is the first of those positions, JCOM. The Grumpy Old Accountants published an article March 8, 2012 which details how many view JCOM as having ""promised you heaven and then put you through hell."" The company has tried to pass off an accounting error as a change in estimate. The explanation(s) offered by the company seem to fail the sniff test of many experienced forensic accountants. If the SEC agrees with Gradient Analytics (which graded the earnings quality of JCOM an ""F"" on November 21, 2011) and others, then JCOM would be forced to restate prior year earnings. Herb Greenberg issued a ""Herb Alert"" on JCOM in November prior to the Q1 announcement.Accounting issues aside, highly competitive pricing in the eFax business has caused a sharp decline since 2007 in revenue per customer for JCOM. The company has used acquisitions to grow revenues, but the core business earnings quality appears to be very suspect. ""An angel's smile is what you (JCOM) sell"" and with the possible accounting errors also overhanging the company ""you're to blame,"" causing me to say ""you give love (stocks) a bad name."" My recommendation is to enter a short position in JCOM.On the long side we want to get exposure to copper, which rallied Friday on the economic news. Freeport-McMoRan Copper and Gold, Inc. (NYSE:FCX) is my choice as a proxy for exposure to copper. Based on Friday's closing price of $38.56, we can obtain initial exposure at a forward P/E of 7.19. The 18 analysts following FCX anticipate $4.17 in earnings for 2012 and three have upgraded their estimates for the June quarter in the last 30 days. By selling the FCX May $40 call (FCX120519C00040000) for approximately $1.46 and selling the FCX May $40 put (FCX120519P00040000) for approximately $3.10, we can enter with an anticipated cost basis of $34 and a target of being called away (or rolling to a forward expiration) in May at $40.Western Digital Corp. (NASDAQ:WDC) is the second long position I would like to recommend. The 5-year expected growth rate by the 10 analysts following WDC is 20.09% and we can gain exposure (before using our buy/write strategy) at a forward P/E of 4.34. That is the kind of relationship between earnings growth to forward P/E we like to see. WDC also has $585 million in levered free cash flow, along with $3.92 billion in cash. As always, we want to buy ½ the number of shares we are willing to own at approximately $38.26 (Friday's close). Then by selling the WDC July $40 call (WDC120721C00040000) for approximately $2.80 and selling the WDC July $40 put (WDC120721P00040000) for approximately $4.45, we can gain the exposure desired at an anticipated cost basis of $31.01 and a target of being called away (or rolling to a forward expiration) in July for $40.Valassis Communications, Inc. (NYSE:VCI) is worth long exposure, as 8 of 9 analysts who follow VCI have raised their 2012 earnings targets in the last 30 days, to $3.11. The forward P/E, based on Friday's closing price of $24.01, is 6.8. VCI has a high short float of 16.2%, which could provide additional upside if the analysts are correct on their increases in earnings for the coming quarters and year. The options for VCI have good liquidity, and so I recommend entering ½ the long exposure desired in VCI and selling the VCI June $25 call (VCI120616C00025000) for approximately $1.50 and selling the VCI June $25 put (VCI120616P00025000) for approximately $2.50. We will have the desired long exposure at an anticipated cost basis of $20.01, with a target of being called away (or rolling to a forward expiration) in June for $25.These 3 long positions (FCX, WDC and VCI) using the buy/write strategy and shorting JCOM give us ""a loaded gun"" again, and we still have one position to add in the short term.Recommendations:Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
309674,21636,2011-11-22T15:09:27-05:00,,"j2 Global Communications Inc. (NASDAQ:JCOM) may have misinterpreted  certain accounting rules and needs to consider restating its financial  reports issued in 2010 based on certain new information it obtained from  a “systems upgrade” in early 2011 that “permitted an accurate  measurement of the remaining useful life” in its annual contacts with  eFax customers.BackgroundIf a customer pays an annual fee in advance, a company reports a  deferred revenue liability (unearned fees) because the fee is not yet  earned. As time progresses on the annual contract, the company reduces  its deferred revenue liability and increases its revenues as those fees  are earned. Up to 2010, j2 Global apparently estimated the actual  remaining life under those contracts to compute its deferred revenues,  revenues, and earnings.In the first quarter  of 2011, j2 Global upgraded its accounting systems and started using  the actual useful life under its annual contracts with eFax customers to  compute deferred revenues, revenues, and net income. In that quarter,  the company recorded a one-time cumulative adjustment to increase  deferred revenues by $10.3 million, decrease in revenues by $10.3  million, and a decrease in net income of $7.6 million to accurately  reflect its actual remaining service obligations under annual contracts  with eFax customers. Cumulative one-time adjustments in current periods  relate to numbers reported in prior periods. Therefore, the company  apparently understated its deferred revenue liability and overstated  both revenue and net income reported in 2010 because it was unable to  accurately measure the remaining life of annual service contracts with  eFax customers.j2 Global claimed that those adjustments stemmed from a “change in  estimate” under accounting rules. Therefore, it could use a one-time  cumulative adjustment in the current quarter to change unearned and  earned income reported in previous periods.Gradient Analytics questions accounting treatmentYesterday, independent research firm Gradient Analytics issued  a report that questioned whether j2 Global appropriately treated those  adjustments as a change in estimate. Based on its examination of the j2  Global’s financial disclosures, applicable accounting rules, and limited  feedback from the company, Gradient reported that “… the description of  the underlying circumstances sounds more like a correction of an error  in prior-period financial results.” If those adjustments are  appropriately considered an accounting error rather than a change in  estimate, a restatement of j2 Global’s 2010 financial reports may be  warranted if such errors are considered material under accounting rules.Was there a change in estimate or an accounting error?Gradient Analytics suggests that j2 Global should have considered  adjustments affecting deferred revenues, revenues, and net income as  stemming from an accounting error, rather than a change of estimate:If we assume that j2 Global’s adjustments to deferred revenue, revenue,  and net income stemmed from an accounting error instead of a change in  estimate, the next step is to determine if the misstatement was material  in affected previous reporting reports. Further analysis is provided  below.MaterialityIf an accounting error is material, a company is required to restate its  financial reports to correct the error. According to Securities and  Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 99  (SAB No. 99) one of the measures used to determine if accounting error  is material is “whether the misstatement masks a change in earnings or  other trends.” For example, if a misstatement causes a company to report  an increase in revenues rather than properly report a decrease in  revenues, it’s considered material. Another measure used to determine  materiality under SAB No. 99 is “whether the misstatement hides a  failure to meet analysts' consensus expectations for the enterprise.” In  other words, if a misstatement causes a company to match or beat  analyst’s estimates, it is considered material.As I detailed above, j2 Global first quarter 2011 adjustments reduced  revenues by $10.3 million and reduced basic and diluted earnings per by  $0.17 and $0.16, respectively. Those adjustments appear to affect 2010’s  reported numbers.In the third quarter  of 2010, j2 Global’s revenues increased by a mere $977,000 to $62.778  million compared to $61.801 million in the previous year’s third  quarter. In addition, its third quarter 2010 earnings per share matched  the previous year's comparable numbers. RTT News reported that j2 Global beat earnings beat analyst’s estimates by just $0.01 per share in the third quarter of 2010 :Therefore, if j2 Global's adjustments to revenue and net income are  considered accounting errors, they could have caused the company to  report higher revenues and earnings per share in the third quarter of  2010 compared to the previous year's third quarter. In addition, they  could have caused the company to beat analyst's estimates for third   quarter and possibly the second quarter, too.RTT News reported that j2 Global’s second quarter 2010 earnings beat analyst’s estimates by just $0.01 per share:Assuming that j2 Global’s adjustments to revenues and net income are  considered accounting errors, the relative size of those adjustments  compared to the company’s second and third quarter financial results  suggest that such misstatements could be material and a restatement of  financial reports is warranted.Disclosure: I am a convicted felon and a former CPA.

587921,29891,2012-05-14T15:22:03-04:00,,"J2 Global Communications (NASDAQ:JCOM) operates in Internet Software & Services industry and is a small cap stock. I think this stock highly undervalued by up to 64% or even more.Discounted Free Cash Flow ValuationIn this article I will run you through my DCF model on JCOM. In particular I will be using free cash flow to the firm FCFF model to valuate the stock.Let's start with the top line. JCOM recorded $330M revenue in 2011 which represented 29% growth from 2010. I don't see this growth rate sustainable for the near future and I predict 7.12% growth in 2012, 5.47% in 2013, and 3-5% for the next 4 years.Coming down to the cost side I predict 42% EBIT margin for the 5 year period projected. Interest expense should stay low because of little long term debt. I forecast taxes to be 24% on average for the 5 year period.Then I subtract increases in working capital and capital expenditures. I model working capital to increase 7.5% of the revenue increase per annum. Capital expenditures should be relatively low at 1% of the total revenue.This model uses WACC to discount FCFF backwards to find out the present value. Beta of this stock is 0.92. I project the WACC to be 8.86%. However, I feel in reality WACC could be higher on average in the long term so I will do further calculations with 10% WACC.I get the value of the firm by discounting the projected FCFF by WACC and adding the terminal value at the end of the 5 year period by calculating a perpetuity with growth of 2.5% and 10% WACC.I get the value of equity by subtracting the market value of debt and adding back current cash and marketable securities.Equity value per share is $40.92, which means the stock is 64% undervalued.Multiples ValuationJCOM is also undervalued in terms of P/E (10.52) compared to industry (19.07). It's biggest direct competitor Open Text Corp. (NASDAQ:OTEX) is almost 3.5 times bigger in terms of revenue and has P/E ratio of 20.29.P/S ratio for JCOM (3.33) is higher than the industry average (2.12), but that does not necessarily mean that JCOM is overvalued in these terms. It has much higher operating margin (43.82%) than the industry (0.64%) and OTEX (14.32%).EasyLink Services International Corporation (NASDAQ:ESIC) is a smaller competitor, which made $186M revenue in 2011, compared to $343M of JCOM. ESIC has smaller P/E ratio of (8.63) compared to JCOM (10.52), but it has much lower operating margin (16.29%) compared to JCOM (43.82%).JCOM has 600 employees with is exactly in par with the industry average. In comparison, OTEX has 4,600 and ESIC - 541 employees.Analyst ratingsMean analyst target price for JCOM is $32.17, which shows almost 29% upside potential.More positive factsThreatsFinancial data taken from Yahoo Finance.Disclosure: I am long JCOM."
257077,23407,2011-03-08T14:26:20-05:00,,"Short sellers are betting heavily against electronic fax goliath j2 Global, assuming j2 will be unable to offset the seemingly inevitable decline of fax use globally.  But short sellers are too complacent and too crowded in this trade, and that means good news for long investors.j2 Global has long been a player in the shifting needs of small business.  Clearly, faxes are no longer the preferred communication tool in a highly connected world.  But the death of the fax hasn't been nearly as complete as shorts have hoped.  While desktop fax machines have gone the way of the horse and buggy, small businesses haven't been willing to discard the technology completely.  Instead, they've relegated the clumsy hardware to the closet and opted for desktop software fax solutions, and that's been good news for j2 Global, a pioneer in bringing faxes to computers."
190090,22884,2010-02-23T06:07:35-05:00,,"As we've pointed out previously, j2 Global Communications (NASDAQ:JCOM) has been a large opportunity cost for us over the past year. Last spring, we considered using our position as a source of funds to acquire more shares of then extremely depressed REITs (where we were making selective purchases).Unfortunately, we didn't make the move and now these same REITs are 3-4x where they were while JCOM is virtually flat. Truthfully (full disclosure), we still may use a portion of our position as a source of funds to purchase out of favor names where we see potential for more long-term upside.That said, like last year, we have a hard time parting with any of our shares because there simply aren't many (any?) companies that have the margin/return (ROE/ROIC) profile of j2. Please let us know if you're aware of similar companies. The company's incredibly high margins (gross > 80%, operating > 40%) and stable, consistent revenue base enable gigantic excess cash generation. Plus, we trust management and expect them to responsibly deploy excess cash to maintain high returns on capital.Nonetheless, as indicated by a trailing twelve month P/E of 11x and a TTM FCF multiple of 9x (7x on EV basis excluding interest income), we think j2 Global gets little respect by the Market because of growth concerns. While the company still grew last year -- through the recession -- growth of 2% Y/Y (and 9% in 2008) are well below historic levels as the digital fax market matures and some businesses simply scan/email documents instead of using fax. To us, using scan/email versus fax for sensitive personal data still gives us the heebie jeebies. As a result, we still use plain old fax service (and have a free eFax account for inbound faxes).The market doesn't know if the the slower growth is cyclical or secular (e.g. is fax going away) and, therefore, seemingly views JCOM as a value trap. We think the company's digital fax business is somewhat impacted by both factors, yet still see a long life for digital fax services (enterprise and international are growing) that will generate mountains of cash for j2. Meanwhile, j2 will continue to expand into other digital communications markets such as voice and email, where the company is making strides.Thus, we continue to believe j2 Global is not akin to Earthlink (NASDAQ:ELNK), which is trading at an EV/EBITDA of 2x as dial-up revenue erodes but cash keeps building on the company's balance sheet. We could also look at Deluxe Corp. (NYSE:DLX) which is managing a decline in its cash cow check printing business (fewer and fewer checks used these days) by diversifying into business services and digital solutions. Total revenue is expected to decline another 2% in 2010 before stabilizing in 2011.Deluxe's stock actually tripled over the past year but still trades at only a TTM P/E of 10x and offers current buyers a secure 5.5% dividend yield. j2 Global's margin and growth profile are also different from that of Deluxe, but risk exists that JCOM continues to trade at a low multiple and/or even sees further multiple compression if growth does not accelerate.For the importance of growth and corresponding Market perception, look no further than the performance of Priceline (PCLN), VistaPrint (VPRT), and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) over the past year. Of course, there are plenty of low growth companies that garner high multiples -- see PF Chang's China Bistro Inc. (NASDAQ:PFCB) trading at 18x forward earnings (27 TTM) and Iron Mountain Inc. (NYSE:IRM) trading at 22x forward earnings (30x TTM).The latter company is a favorite of Warren Buffett/Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B) and certain other value investors such as Davis Selected Advisers. Berkshire Hathaway apparently bought more IRM shares during the December quarter (please see this media report). Iron Mountain provides a necessary service that will always be around (arguably supporting a higher than average valuation), yet is a somewhat capital intensive business (~11% of revenue) with low historic returns on equity/capital (sub 10%).The good news is that j2 Global reported 4Q09 results last Thursday and guided to 2010 revenue growth of +3-7% Y/Y with a target of 5% Y/Y. The bottom-line is expected to remain similar to 2009 results as the company steps up marketing efforts to drive growth and build voice/email brands. Management believes the economy turned the corner and expects higher marketing expense to bear fruit going forward relative to uncertainty that plagued 2009 and brought j2 to rein in spending.Summary 2009 results from j2's 4Q earnings presentation:After record free cash generation of $101.6 million in 2009, the company's cash balance stands at $244 million or 26% of j2's market capitalization. We thought we might hear news of a new share buyback program or even a first time dividend (please see prior post here), yet management indicated that potential M&A transactions remain priority number one with numerous deals in the pipeline. Recent deals and pipeline commentary:Accordingly, for now, the company has no board authorization for other uses of excess capital. We look for more news on this front later this year. If high return uses for cash fail to materialize in the near-term, we expect to see at least a buyback authorization. A dividend would also be nice, although a repurchase is arguably more sensible if the company can buy in shares at current levels (i.e. FCF yield of 10% or more).Again, with no debt and annual free cash generation of approximately $100 million, j2 Global will have bulging pockets of cash.Below, we include a slide showing historical development from j2's presentation (click to enlarge):How many companies have this type of historic development and margin profile?Disclosure: Author holds a long position in JCOM, BRK.B"

Small business price.” It’s a concept that resonates pretty strongly among entrepreneurs who don’t want to lose sales just because they don’t have the infrastructure capabilities of the bigger guys who are willing to spend more on overhead.After all, the costs of starting a new business are high enough – and only get magnified when you factor in things like the cost of a fax machine or toll free number. But that was the past. Since the mid 1990s, online services have been popping up to offer entrepreneurs a cheaper communications solution. Today, services like eFax, Onebox, and Phone People offer things like online faxing, virtual phone systems, and toll free vanity numbers at a fraction of the cost of the in-house solutions used by larger companies. And in the process of helping small businesses grow, one company is taking its business to new heights: j2 Global Communications (NASDAQ:JCOM). j2 Global Communications operates 16 services that provide online faxing, voice services, and email services to more than 11 million customers. And those don’t just include small businesses anymore… cost-conscious larger businesses are realizing that outsourced communications make a lot of sense in a lot of cases.JCOM has an impressive track record – the company survived the dot com bubble and ensuing recession only to return a staggering 2,745% to investors who stuck it out with the company between 2001 and now. That’s in large part due to this company’s financial performance. Communication for CashIn its latest quarter, ended September 2008, the company reported record profits despite the negative effects of the economy. JCOM’s earnings increased 20% over the prior year to $18.8 million, and the company reaffirmed its guidance for the fourth quarter. Translation: Expect another highly profitable quarter from this company.JCOM’s balance sheet is equally attractive. Right now the company has almost $141 million in cash, no debt, and very few looming financial obligations. Based on the company’s current coffers, it could operate for more than a year without taking in a single penny.Part of the reason that JCOM is in such good financial shape is the company’s ability to parlay its revenues into profits. JCOM’s operating margins have grown by almost 3% in the last year, which suggests that the company is actively working to cut the costs required to bring their products to market. As a whole, JCOM is a lean company – net margins were a whopping 30.5% last quarter – that’s a good thing to see at times when external financing sources are scarce.A Growing CompanyJCOM’s impressive 10.4% revenue growth last quarter was fueled by a combination of acquisitions and organic growth into new markets. In 2008, a couple of the company’s acquisitions included Phone People holdings, a San Diego-based voice service provider, and the digital faxing business of a European communications company. Expansion into new markets, like Onebox and eVoice’s debuts in Mexico, were another catalyst for growth.Ultimately, j2 Global Communications should be able to perform well in spite of the operating challenges most other companies will be faced with in 2009. And with their next earnings call scheduled for February 19, it won’t be long before we get a glimpse at how the company will be starting off their year.The Rhino Stock Report took a position in JCOM at $17 in a Rhino Alert sent out to subscribers on January 23. Despite this company’s climb since then, I anticipate a price in approaching $30 in the next 6 to 12 months if JCOM can meet – or beat – analyst expectations. Disclosure: JCOM is a long position in the Rhino Stock Report’s model portfolio."

It offers services such as IP faxing, voicemail, and unified communications. I added JCOM into the idea pipeline as one of my legacy stocks.JCOM currently trades at ~$24-25.1- Business Performance Risk (+/=) and intrinsic returns (=)While the business has good returns and cash generation, I am a bit concerned by the low to negative growth recently (are they under threat by other services such as Google?). In addition the company has not done anything with its cash and just accumulates it instead of redistributing to shareholders either through dividends or buybacks (average buyback: 2% p.a.).In terms of intrinsic returns, growth becomes a question mark and the single biggest driver. Analyst consensus seems to be ~11%, which I think is high given recent history. I will use 5% for now:-          Dividend: 0%-          Growth: 5%, requiring about 25% of the earnings to be reinvested-          Buybacks/cash: with the 75% of earnings remaining, JCOM could buyback up to 5% of its shares back given the current earnings yield of ~7%Total potential intrinsic return: 10%, highly dependent on JCOM’s growth potential.2- Balance Sheet Risk (=)No balance sheet risk. If anything the current ratio is very high which reflects the “cash hoarding” by management over the last few years.3- Valuation Risk (=)JCOM”s cash retun is much higher than its earnings yield (the inverse of P/E) given the large amount of cash JCOM is carrying on its B/S ($200M cash on a valuation of $1.1Bn!).  Taking cash away, JCOM’s P/E would be around 12x.  Overall JCOM’s valuation appears to be reasonable but not necessarily attractive enough to provide a margin of safety.ConclusionWhile JCOM’s business is strong with high returns, growth is really at the crux of the investment story here, especially as valuation while not expensive is not cheap either for a stock that would require a high margin of safety given the questions around growth. I will not perform a Company Analysis for now, but will reconsider my position if the price drops by ~10% (and I have a better understanding for why revenues have slowed).Disclosure: Long JCOM"

Unlike last quarter, when j2 reported an 11% Y/Y increase in net income and the stock went down -- which didn't make one iota of sense -- this time, j2 reported a 19% Y/Y increase in adjusted net income and the market noticed.The company reported June quarter revenue of $62.5 million and non-GAAP earnings of $0.48, ahead of Wall Street expectations of $61.0 and $0.44, respectively. Non-GAAP net income is adjusted upward for $0.04 of stock based compensation and a one-time, non-recurring impairment charge of $0.19 related to impairment of auction rate and related securities. We normally look at GAAP earnings, but in this case, the impairment obfuscates comparable results and we believe j2's earnings quality is very high. Other quick highlights:Despite the persistent short thesis that fax is a dinosaur (see earlier post re: Barron's article), we continue to believe that j2 Global can keep growing through an increasingly diversified product portfolio. As the company grows, the business should keep generating significant excess cash that shareholder friendly management can use for reinvestment, acquisitions, and share buybacks. We think j2's high quality business model could fairly trade at 15 times trailing free cash flow (7% yield), which would put shares at $30, up 22% from current levels.Disclosure: Long JCOM."

JCOM is an online communications company best known for their flagship product Efax. Efax is the largest provider of web-based faxing (fax-to-email, computer-to-fax). As of the end of Q1 2005, JCOM had 600k subscribed phone lines paying $17 a month. In addition, JCOM has 8.5 million free fax users. Since turning profitable in Q1 2002 JCOM has rapidly grown its earnings. JCOM produced $0.40 a share in Q1 2005.
Valuation 
At $36 a share, JCOM trades forward P/E ratios of 20.6 for 2005 and 16.2 for 2006 earnings estimates. Given that the company has consistently outperformed guidance nearly every quarter for 3 years, the true ratios are likely even lower. The company is estimated to grow at earnings 40%+ this year and next. If you look at the enterprise value (back out cash) divided by run-rate earnings (current quarter earnings * 4), they are trading at one of the lowest valuations since turning profitable (less than 21 run rate earnings). If they hit their guidance when they report on 7/25/05 (which they indicated they would 3 times in June) then that ratio drops to about 18.5. Outside of the huge run up in late 2003, JCOM has mainly traded between 20 and 26 x run rate earnings and their expected growth rate has remained extremely high (40%+). JCOM an enterprise value of about $750 million and a free cash flow run rate of $40 million. Simple math: if you assume that JCOM can get to 3 to 6 million paying subscribers globally, they could be earning 5 to 10 times what they are now.

	• 	Patent portfolio seems to be preventing large players from challenging JCOM’s position

	• 	Low stock option dilution 
Potential Catalysts - Short Term (1-2 months)

	• 	Create a new pricing model to convert free customers (e.g. $20 a year)

Risks – I don’t expect these will happen quickly or abruptly
	• 	Competition

	◦ 	Large telcos could bundle product

	◦ 	Price war by another player

	• 	Advent of online digital signatures

	• 	Gradual decline of fax machines in favor of emails
Full disclosure: I am (very) long JCOM at the time of writing."
8025,20141,2005-12-05T04:55:25-05:00,,"Since my initial analysis of J2 Global Communications (JCOM), the stock has performed quite well – up over 30%. People are asking me if they should sell their shares. Since my last post, I have purchased and sold calls as well as sold about 10% of my holdings. I sold mainly to diversify. JCOM is still my largest holding (over 30% of my portfolio!) and I still believe their business and stock have a ton of potential, but I do have some short term concerns. I will start with my concerns and then move to long term potential.



Short Term Concerns:



Revenue growth is slowing – that is well known. It is hard to keep 50%+ revenue growth up (unless you are Google). What would be a true concern if growth stops (or god forbid declines) in the US market – this could indicate market saturation or a slowdown driven by a housing market downturn. Overall, I expect that any slowdown could be addressed with product and marketing shifts (different product tiers to convert more free subs, more aggressively licensing and partnerships). However, a slow growth quarter could severely hurt the stock in the near term.



Q3’s performance was within guidance. JCOM hit the top end of their guidance range (48-49 cents), but did not exceed it as it usually does. For many high-growth companies, this is fine, but JCOM has historically given conservative guidance.  For JCOM to only ""hit"" the top end of the range, it may indicate that growth was not as robust as they had hoped. To be fair, JCOM was coming off of strong growth in Q2. Nonetheless, it is worth watching earnings growth rates.



Q4’s guidance is wide and the low end implies low growth. Q3’s earnings (excluding a one time gain) was $0.49 and guidance for Q4 is $0.50 to $0.54. I could say, “Hey, $0.54 would be great!"
305279,22829,2011-11-04T05:51:40-04:00,,"By Brenon DalyIn reporting third-quarter financial results after Wednesday’s  closing bell, j2 Global Communications (NASDAQ:JCOM) not only posted record revenue  and cash-flow levels but also highlighted the returns it has generated  in its recent M&A spree. And the communication services provider,  which has some $162m in cash and short-term investments in its treasury,  hinted that more deals are coming. J2 has done three acquisitions so  far in 2011, after eight in 2010.The purchases come as part of a dramatic overhaul of the company,  which has expanded through M&A from its core fax offering to now  include a number of services for small businesses including email,  Web-based collaboration and even marketing. Most recently, it has moved  into online backup, buying three small startups – all of which are based  in Ireland – just in the past year. The European acquisitions are also  part of a larger effort at j2 to increase international revenue, which  accounts for only about 15% of total sales.Overall, j2 has spent almost $400m on M&A over the past  half-decade. One of the reasons why the company has money to go shopping  is that it generates a ton of cash each quarter. In Q3, j2 recorded  $86m in sales and $37m in free cash flow (FCF), an enviable 43% FCF  margin. And we should note that the cash is being generated as the  company continues to grow at a healthy clip. It guided that sales for  2011 should come in at about $340m, which represents a 33% increase from  2010. Granted, much of that increase is coming from j2’s $213m all-cash  purchase of Protus IP Solutions last December. (Protus had recorded  $72m in the year leading up to its sale to j2.) But as the company has  said in the past, it ‘isn’t picky’ when it comes to organic versus  inorganic growth."

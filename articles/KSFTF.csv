4356688,39591,2020-07-02T05:01:28-04:00,"Kingsoft Corporation recently spun off its cloud business, Kingsoft Cloud Holdings Limited (KC), on the Nasdaq in May, and Kingsoft Cloud's share price has almost doubled from its $17 IPO price.
        It came as a surprise that Kingsoft Corporation chose to raise approximately HK$3.0 billion from the issuance of new convertible bonds recently despite a strong balance sheet.
        My sum-of-the-parts valuation implies a 6% upside for Kingsoft Corporation based on a target price of HK$38.20.","I downgrade my rating on Hong Kong-listed Chinese software and internet services company Kingsoft Corporation Limited (OTCPK:KSFTF) (OTCPK:KGFTY) [3888:HK] from Bullish to Neutral.This is an update of my prior article on Kingsoft Corporation published on April 21, 2020. Kingsoft Corporation's share has price increased by +29% from HK$27.95 as of April 20, 2020 to HK$36.05 as of July 1, 2020 since my last update. My sum-of-the-parts valuation implies a 6% upside for Kingsoft Corporation based on a target price of HK$38.20.Kingsoft Corporation recently spun off its cloud business, Kingsoft Cloud Holdings Limited (KC), as a separate listed entity on the Nasdaq in May, and Kingsoft Cloud's share price has almost doubled from its $17 IPO price. It is reasonable to assume that the cloud business spin-off catalyst has already been fully priced into Kingsoft Corporation's valuations, barring a significant increase in Kingsoft Cloud's share price going forward.Also, it came as a surprise to the market that Kingsoft Corporation chose to raise approximately HK$3.0 billion from the issuance of new convertible bonds in April 2020, despite the company's strong net cash balance sheet. This raises questions about Kingsoft Corporation's capital allocation strategy, and the risk of potential dilution for its equity shareholders if the convertible bonds are converted to shares. Readers have the option of trading in Kingsoft Corporation shares listed either on the Over-The-Counter Bulletin Board (OTCBB) as ADRs with the tickers KSFTF and KGFTY or on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange with the ticker 3888:HK. For those shares listed as ADRs on the OTCBB, note that liquidity is low and bid/ask spreads are wide.For those shares listed in Hong Kong, there are limited risks associated with buying or selling the shares in terms of trade execution, given that the Hong Kong Stock Exchange is one of the major stock exchanges that is internationally recognized and there is sufficient trading liquidity. Average daily trading value for the past three months exceeds $65 million, and market capitalization is above $6.3 billion, which is comparable to the majority of stocks traded on the US stock exchanges. Institutional investors which own Kingsoft Corporation shares listed in Hong Kong include The Vanguard Group, JPMorgan Asset Management, UBS Asset Management, and BlackRock, among others. Investors can invest in key Asian stock markets either using US brokers with international coverage, such as Interactive Brokers, Fidelity, or Charles Schwab, or local brokers operating in their respective domestic markets.In my prior article on Kingsoft Corporation published on April 21, 2020, I emphasized that the planned spin-off of its cloud services business will be a key re-rating catalyst for the stock, and that has indeed been the case.Kingsoft Corporation's cloud business, Kingsoft Cloud was listed on Nasdaq on May 8, 2020, and Kingsoft Cloud's share price was $32.21 as of July 1, 2020, close to double that of its IPO price of $17. The market currently values Kingsoft Cloud at consensus forward FY2020 and FY2021 Enterprise Value-to-Revenue multiples of 7.3 times and 4.7 times, respectively. Following the listing of Kingsoft Cloud, Kingsoft Corporation's share price increased by +40% from HK$25.75 as of May 22, 2020 to HK$36.05 as of July 1, 2020, in tandem with the strong share price run-up for its listed cloud services business. It is clear that Kingsoft Corporation's spin-off has helped to unlock value of its cloud services business that was previously obscured as a loss-making arm of the holding company.Furthermore, Kingsoft Cloud is now less of a drag for Kingsoft Corporation, in terms of headline financial numbers. Prior to the listing of Kingsoft Cloud on Nasdaq, the loss-making Kingsoft Cloud was a listed subsidiary of Kingsoft Corporation. With the completion of the IPO of the cloud services business and the reduction in Kingsoft Corporation's equity stake in Kingsoft Cloud to 46.3%, which means that Kingsoft Cloud is now an associate company and Kingsoft Corporation recognizes a smaller proportion of the losses from Kingsoft Cloud. Earlier, Kingsoft Corporation hinted at the possibility of raising the company's dividends following the Kingsoft Cloud's IPO at the company's FY2019 results briefing on March 24, 2020. Kingsoft currently offers a very low historical FY2019 dividend yield of 0.3%.Also, Kingsoft Cloud is a beneficiary of the Work-From-Home or WFH trend brought about by Covid-19, and Kingsoft Corporation is confident that such positive tailwinds will continue even after Covid-19. At the company's 1Q2020 earnings call on May 26, 2020, Kingsoft Corporation highlighted that there will be ""a long-term impact on the whole industry on users' acceptance and transfer to the idea of remote working, on online collaboration"" and added that""the digital transformation here in these industries is not going to go backwards after the COVID period."" Kingsoft Corporation also guided earlier in March 2020 that Kingsoft Cloud could achieve break-even at the EBITDA level in FY2020.On the negative side of things, if sentiment on US-listed Chinese companies such as Kingsoft Cloud turns negative, Kingsoft's Cloud's valuations could possibly suffer from a de-rating. On May 21, 2020, the Senate passed the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act which required US-listed Chinese companies to be compliant with US standards with respect to audits and the sharing of information. Notably, ""all auditing documents on overseas listed Chinese companies be kept"" in the country based on Chinese laws as reported by Caixin Global. Prominent Chinese companies listed in the US such as NetEase (NTES) and JD.com (JD) have already done secondary listings on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. As a newly-listed company in the US, it is uncertain what are Kingsoft Cloud's alternatives, if Chinese companies were compelled to de-list in the US.More importantly, unless Kingsoft Cloud's share price continues to increase significantly going forward, it is likely that the cloud business spin-off catalyst has already been fully priced into Kingsoft Corporation's valuations.Kingsoft Corporation has always been in a very strong financial position. The company had approximately net cash of RMB9.5 billion as of end-FY2019, and its net cash balance grew to RMB11.2 billion by March 31, 2020 which accounts for about a quarter of its market capitalization. In addition, Kingsoft Cloud had RMB2 billion of cash on its books as of December 31, 2019, and raised an additional $474 million (RMB3.3 billion) in proceeds from the recent IPO.It came as a surprise that Kingsoft Corporation chose to raise approximately HK$3.0 billion from the issuance of new convertible bonds recently, as per the company's announcement on April 29, 2020. In the announcement, Kingsoft Corporation explained that the funds raised from the issuance of new convertible bonds will be utilized for ""general corporate purposes, for strategic investments and acquisitions, if appropriate, and to supplement working capital."" On the positive side of things, the coupon rate on the convertible bonds is low at 0.625%, and the conversion price for the convertible bonds was set at a reasonably high HK$35.7637 (close to a 30% premium based on Kingsoft Corporation's share price in end-April 2020 but close to current share price). Notably, a sell-side analyst noted that Kingsoft Corporation has ""ample cash in our balance sheet"" and asked the company to ""share a little bit more about the capital allocation strategy"" at the company's 1Q2020 earnings call on May 26, 2020. In response, Kingsoft Corporation emphasized that ""a good cash level will make our business more stronger and safer."" The company also added that it is looking for investment and acquisition opportunities to ""accelerate our digital transformation"" for its various businesses.However, the key question is whether Kingsoft Corporation needed to take the risk of diluting its equity shareholders with the issuance of convertible bonds (potentially convertible to a maximum of 8.668 million shares of 5.9% of enlarged share capital post-conversion), when the company had such a strong balance sheet.Kingsoft Corporation trades at consensus forward FY2020 and FY2021 P/E multiples of 80.1 times and 56.3 times, respectively based on its share price of HK$36.05 as of July 1, 2020. My sum-of-the-parts valuation implies a 6% upside for Kingsoft Corporation based on a target price of HK$38.20.The assumptions for my sum-of-the-parts valuation for Kingsoft Corporation include an earnings multiple of four times for the games business, and valuing Kingsoft's stakes in the recently listed cloud business Kingsoft Cloud, the listed office software business Beijing Kingsoft Office Software [688111:CH] (a 40% discount is assigned to the valuation of Beijing Kingsoft Office Software as it is traded on a new Nasdaq-style stock exchange in Mainland China) and associate company Cheetah Mobile (CMCM) at market value, and a 30% holding company discount.The key risk factors for Kingsoft Corporation are a de-rating of Kingsoft Cloud's valuations if sentiment on US-listed Chinese companies turns negative, and sub-optimal capital allocation decisions that are not value-accretive for shareholders.Note that readers who choose to trade in Kingsoft Corporation shares listed as ADRs on the OTCBB (rather than shares listed in Hong Kong) could potentially suffer from lower liquidity and wider bid/ask spreads.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange. Please be aware of the risks associated with these stocks."
4338788,39591,2020-04-21T10:00:29-04:00,"Kingsoft Corporation had net cash equivalent to 27% of the stock's market capitalization as of end-FY2019, and a potential dividend raise in the future is a catalyst for the stock.Kingsoft Corporation announced on April 4, 2020, that the company filed a registration statement with the SEC in relation to the listing of the cloud services business's ADSs on Nasdaq.My updated sum-of-the-parts valuation implies a 30% upside from Kingsoft Corporation's share price of HK$27.95 as of April 20, 2020.","I maintain my ""Bullish"" rating on Hong Kong-listed Chinese software and internet services company Kingsoft Corporation Limited (OTCPK:KSFTF) [3888:HK].This is an update of my prior article on Kingsoft Corporation published on December 6, 2019. Kingsoft Corporation's share price has increased by +59% from HK$17.60 as of December 4, 2019, to HK$27.95 as of April 20, 2020, since I upgraded my rating on the stock to ""Bullish"". My updated sum-of-the-parts valuation implies a 30% upside from Kingsoft Corporation's current share price. A potential dividend raise and a planned spin-off of the cloud services business are the key re-rating catalysts for Kingsoft Corporation.Kingsoft Corporation had net cash equivalent to 27% of the stock's market capitalization as of end-FY2019, but the stock's trailing dividend yield is only 0.35%. The company has committed to reviewing its dividend policy at the recent earnings call, which could potentially lead to a dividend raise in future.Another catalyst for Kingsoft Corporation is the planned spin-off and listing of its cloud services business as a separate listed entity. The company has recently filed a registration statement with the SEC in relation to the listing of the cloud services business's ADSs on Nasdaq.Readers are advised to trade in Kingsoft Corporation shares listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange with the ticker 3888:HK, where average daily trading value for the past three months exceeds $65 million and market capitalization is above $4.9 billion. Investors can invest in key Asian stock markets either using U.S. brokers with international coverage, such as Interactive Brokers, Fidelity, or Charles Schwab, or local brokers operating in their respective domestic markets.As of December 31, 2019, Kingsoft Corporation had approximately net cash of RMB9,495 million on the company's books, which is equivalent to 27% of the stock's market capitalization. While it is positive that Kingsoft Corporation proposed a dividend per share of HK$0.10 for FY2019 despite being loss-making last year (primarily attributable to investments in the fast-growing cloud services business), this only implies a trailing dividend yield of 0.35% which stands in stark contrast with the company's huge cash pile. Furthermore, market consensus expects Kingsoft Corporation to reduce its dividends per share from HK$0.10 in FY2019 to HK$0.049 and HK$0.075 for FY2020 and FY2021 respectively.Although investors are not necessarily buying growth stocks like Kingsoft Corporation for their dividend yields, a decent dividend payout track record gives investors confidence that a company strikes a good balance between a capital return to shareholders and capital investment. In the case of Kingsoft Corporation, there is a risk that the company could spend most of its excess cash on acquisitions which may or may not be value-accretive for shareholders.It is encouraging that Kingsoft Corporation noted at the company's 4Q2019 earnings call on March 24, 2020, that ""we will revisit our long-term dividend policy after the IPO of the cloud business (discussed in the next section of my article).""Kingsoft Corporation is, currently, keeping a huge cash pile on its books and holding back on significant dividend payouts for three key reasons.Firstly, the company thinks that it is prudent to hold more cash during this uncertain market environment resulting from the coronavirus outbreak. Secondly, Kingsoft Corporation wants to have the firepower to acquire good companies at attractive prices if such opportunities emerge. Thirdly, the company's cloud services business is the only loss-making (and cash flow negative) business of its three business segments (games and office software are the other two), and the cash flow drag from the cloud services business has constrained Kingsoft Corporation's ability to pay higher dividends.Looking ahead, Kingsoft Corporation's operating cash flow and capacity for increased dividend payout are likely to improve in the future, following the planned spin-off of the cloud services business.In addition, Kingsoft Corporation, currently, holds a 52% equity interest in the loss-making cloud services business, so the planned spin-off could potentially lead to a de-consolidation of the cloud business's financial results (and losses). The cloud services business is likely to be recognized as an associate company rather than a subsidiary of Kingsoft Corporation post-spin off as Kingsoft Corporation reduces its stake in the cloud services business below the 50% mark.This suggests that a potential dividend raise for Kingsoft Corporation is on the cards sometime in the future, which could serve as a re-rating catalyst for the stock.On April 17, 2020, Kingsoft Corporation announced that the company filed a registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission with respect to the planned spin-off and separate listing of the company's cloud services business, Kingsoft Cloud Holdings Limited. Kingsoft Corporation plans to list Kingsoft Cloud Holdings Limited's American depositary shares or ADSs on Nasdaq.The value of Kingsoft Corporation's cloud services business, Kingsoft Cloud Holdings Limited is ""hidden"" when investors assess and value the stock from a P/E perspective. This is because the cloud services business generated an operating loss of RMB905 million in FY2019, despite contributing 46.8% of Kingsoft Corporation's revenue last year. A spin-off and a separate listing of Kingsoft Cloud Holdings Limited will help investors to recognize the hidden value of Kingsoft Corporation's cloud services business, as it becomes a separate listed entity with its own market price and valuation.The cloud services business remained loss-making in FY2019, as Kingsoft Corporation continued to invest to grow the business which has paid off in the form of strong top-line growth. The cloud services business was the fastest-growing segment of the company's three businesses, posting a +73% YoY growth in revenue to RMB3,847.2 million for FY2019. Notably, Kingsoft Corporation guided at the company's 4Q2019 earnings call on March 24, 2020, that ""we are confident that we will maintain similar growth rate (of revenue for the cloud services business) in 2020.""The company also acknowledged at the recent earnings call that its cloud services business has been a beneficiary of more people working from home in 1Q2020 as a result of the current coronavirus outbreak. In the medium to long term, the growth prospects for Kingsoft Corporation's cloud services business look promising, as it increases its penetration of existing verticals and enters new verticals. Currently, Kingsoft Cloud is focused on growing its market share in the video, financial, government, and healthcare cloud verticals.More importantly, Kingsoft Cloud's profitability is improving. Kingsoft Corporation's cloud services business's gross profit margin was positive for the first time in 3Q2019 and Kingsoft Cloud continued to deliver positive gross profit in 4Q2019. On a full-year basis, Kingsoft Cloud's operating profit margin expanded by more than 1,000 basis points YoY in FY2019.Kingsoft Corporation highlighted at the company's 4Q2019 earnings call on March 24, 2020, that ""we may be able to achieve or close to achieve the EBITDA breakeven point (for the cloud services business) by the end of this year."" The company also gave an indication of what it sees as the future profitability of Kingsoft Cloud at the recent earnings call, by noting that U.S. IaaS (Infrastructure As A Service) businesses of a certain scale can achieve operating profit margins of 20% and above.In other words, the improvement in profitability of Kingsoft Corporation's cloud services business over time is a key medium-term catalyst for the stock.Kingsoft Corporation trades at 87.5 times consensus forward FY2020 P/E and 46.1 times consensus forward FY2021 P/E based on its share price of HK$27.95 as of April 20, 2020. My sum-of-the-parts valuation implies a 30% upside for Kingsoft Corporation based on a target price of HK$36.50.The assumptions for my sum-of-the-parts valuation for Kingsoft Corporation include an earnings multiple of five times for the games business, a revenue multiple of three times for the cloud services business, and valuing Kingsoft's stakes in both the listed office software business Beijing Kingsoft Office Software [688111:CH] (a 20% discount is assigned to the valuation of Beijing Kingsoft Office Software as it is traded on a new Nasdaq-style stock exchange in Mainland China) and associate company Cheetah Mobile (CMCM) at market value, and a 30% holding company discount.Kingsoft Corporation offers consensus forward FY2020 and FY2021 dividend yields of 0.2% and 0.3% respectively.The key risk factors for Kingsoft Corporation include a longer-than-expected time taken for the cloud services business to be spun-off and listed as a separate entity, weaker-than-expected profitability for the cloud services business, a failure to increase dividend payout in the near future, and the utilization of the company's cash pile in a manner that destroys value for shareholders such as overpaying for acquisitions."
2662525,67313,2014-11-11T01:19:08-05:00,Kingsoft's Q314 once again shows robust financial metrics that mask a set of deteriorating operating metrics.Online gaming seems to be losing pricing power while engagement levels are trending lower for CMCM.Kingsoft and CMCM remain my short picks.,"EventKingsoft (OTCPK:KSFTF) (3888 HK) reported 3Q14 earnings with revenue in-line with consensus and net income beating consensus on one-off gain from the disposal of Kuaipan Personal, a mobile cloud storage software. Despite the strong headline numbers, the quarter's underlying operating metrics suggests a negative trend which makes me question the sustainability of the post result share rally (+3% at the time of writing). Most notably, the sharp decline in ARPU points to a weakening pricing power despite a +12% y/y increase in online gaming revenue. Furthermore, engagement metrics continues to decline in Cheetah Mobile (NYSE:CMCM), which now accounts for 52% of Kingsoft's total revenue.In the near-term, I believe the market will cheer to the strength in CMCM's growth in overseas markets where 65% of its MAUs are based. In the long-term, I expect CMCM's declining engagement metrics to negatively impact its revenue growth. In addition, CMCM's junk cleaner app does not significantly differ from that of the competitors, putting the sustainability of the growth profile into question. I reiterate my bearish view on CMCM and Kingsoft. (See: Cheetah Mobile: This Cat Has A Long Way To Go; Initiating With $16 Target, 24% Downside and Cheetah Mobile: Will The Real Clean Master Please Stand Up? )HighlightsNot as impressive as it seems. Revenue of Rmb852m (+55% y/y) was in-line with consensus and net income up +41% y/y to Rm231m, beating the consensus of Rmb175m on a $193m gain from the sale of Kuaipan. Excluding one-time gain, net income growth of +19% y/y is driven by a decline in OPM on higher opex for mobile apps/games.Online game losing pricing power. Online game revenue of Rmb304m (+12% y/y) was driven by the JX Online III but the underlying ARPU decline of -15% y/y suggests a loss of pricing power. The sharp increase in APA (+33% y/y) to 2.4m suggests that most of the paying accounts are of lower quality (ie. low paying ARPU). Management is positive on the upcoming ""Cang Xue Long Cheng"" expansion pack for JX Online III that is scheduled to launch in late November to reverse the ARPU trend, but I am going to wait for the print on this one.Engagement on a decline at CMCM. CMCM revenue of Rmb446m (+155% y/y) was driven by strong IVAS and online marketing. Most notably, mobile MAU from CMCM increased 183% y/y to 341m users in the quarter with a total mobile installment base of 862m (vs. 662m in June). Despite the strong headline numbers, engagement metrics for CMCM declined to 39% compared with 42% last quarter. I suspect that CMCM is aggressively installing its software with handset OEMs to expand its reach but it is worth noting that this is an unsustainable strategy, in my view.ConclusionI remain bearish on Kingsoft and CMCM. A friendly reminder, CMCM reports on Monday before the US market opens.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

4311046,39591,2019-12-06T09:52:02-05:00,"Kingsoft has completed the listing of its office software business, Beijing Kingsoft Office Software, on the STAR market in November 2019; the company has guided for improved segment operating margins in FY2020.The cloud services business broke even at the gross profit level for the first time in 3Q2019, with a planned listing.The performance of the games business in FY2020 is dependent on the success of its ""3+3"" games pipeline, and the official commercial launch for the JX Online III mobile game.Kingsoft trades at 47.8 times consensus forward FY2020 P/E and 28.8 times consensus forward FY2021 P/E.My updated sum-of-the-parts valuation implies a 25% upside from Kingsoft's share price of HK$17.60 as of December 4, 2019.","The successful spin-off of its office software business and the cloud services business breaking even at the gross profit level for the first time were the key positives for Hong Kong-listed Chinese software and internet services company Kingsoft Corporation Limited (OTCPK:KSFTF) [3888:HK] in 3Q2019. These positives were partially offset by negatives such as a weak games business and a decline in operating margin for the office software business.This is an update of my initiation article on Kingsoft published on September 9, 2019. Kingsoft's share price has increased slightly by +3% from HK$17.16 as of September 6, 2019, to HK$17.60 as of December 4, 2019.I upgrade my rating on Kingsoft from ""Neutral"" to ""Bullish"" as my updated sum-of-the-parts valuation implies a 25% upside. The increase in my target price for the stock is mainly driven by the listing of spin-off and listing of its office software business in November 2019; I am valuing the office software business based on market capitalization now rather than a multiple of earnings. A planned spin-off of Kingsoft's cloud services business could be the next catalyst for the stock.Readers are advised to trade in Kingsoft Corporation shares listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange with the ticker 3888:HK where average daily trading value for the past three months is close to $30 million and market capitalization is above $3 billion. Investors can invest in key Asian stock markets either using U.S. brokers with international coverage such as Interactive Brokers (IBKR), Fidelity, Charles Schwab (SCHW) or local brokers operating in their respective domestic markets.On November 18, 2019, Kingsoft announced that it has successfully completed the spin-off and listing of its office software business, Beijing Kingsoft Office Software Inc. [688111:CH] on the new Science and Technology Innovation Board of Shanghai Stock Exchange, or STAR, market (a Nasdaq-style China stock exchange focused on technology companies).Beijing Kingsoft Office Software issued 101 million new shares at an IPO price of RMB45.86, which represented 21.91% of the company's total shares outstanding. Kingsoft still holds a 52.71% stake in Beijing Kingsoft Office Software post-listing. Beijing Kingsoft Office Software last closed at a share price of RMB139.66 on December 4, 2019, which was roughly three times its IPO price. Kingsoft raised approximately RMB4.5 billion from the listing of Beijing Kingsoft Office Software, which will be largely used to fund future investments in artificial intelligence, software optimization, cloud-based services and other research & development activities.Kingsoft's office software business, or Beijing Kingsoft Office Software, delivered a strong set of results in the most recent quarter, based on Kingsoft's 3Q2019 results released on November 13, 2019. Revenue from the office software business was up +49.6% YoY to RMB383 million in 3Q2019 on the back of a +33% YoY and +10% QoQ increase in monthly active users to 382 million as of end-September 2019. While segment data was not provided as part of the quarterly results announcement, Kingsoft disclosed at the company's 3Q2019 earnings call on November 13, 2019, that the office software business segment's operating profit margin was above 20% in 2019, but down by a few percentage points YoY compared with 2018 (25%).The strong top-line growth for Kingsoft's office software business was the result of a +120% YoY increase in personal monthly paying users to 6.7 million as of end-3Q2019 driven by value-added services for WPS Office personal edition, and an increase in software licensing sales for the WPS enterprise edition.The decline in the office software business' operating profit margin was primarily due to an increase in research & development spending. For example, Kingsoft doubled the number of engineers employed in the office software business in the past year to improve its product capabilities and drive overseas expansion (WPS Office 2020 international suite launched in New Delhi, India, on August 28, 2019).But Kingsoft has guided for improved operating margins for its office software business in FY2020, which will be higher than that of both FY2018 and FY2019, on expectations of increased high-margin enterprise license sales in China backed by strong domestic demand. Looking ahead, operating leverage is also expected to be a driver of higher operating margins in the next few years for Kingsoft, with the company highlighting a slower pace of growth in costs compared with revenue going forward.With the successful spin-off of its office software business, Kingsoft has another one in the pipeline. On November 14, 2019, Kingsoft announced that it is considering a possible spin-off and separate listing of its cloud services business, Kingsoft Cloud Holdings Limited. Details relating the planned spin-off such as listing venue, offering size, IPO price range have yet to be confirmed.Considering that Kingsoft Cloud Holdings is a 51.6%-owned subsidiary of Kingsoft and the fact that cloud business remains unprofitable (at operating profit level), a spin-off and separate listing could potentially lead to a de-consolidation of the cloud business' financials, which will improve Kingsoft's overall profitability.Kingsoft's cloud services business has achieved a positive gross profit for the first time in 3Q2019, notwithstanding that certain verticals within the business still have negative gross margin. While the company did not wish to commit to a timeline for break-even (at operating profit level) for the cloud services business at its 3Q2019 results briefing on November 13, 2019, it emphasized that ""it's not going to be too far away."" Kingsoft also guided that the losses for its cloud services business will continue to narrow in FY2020.Revenue growth for the cloud services business continued to be robust in 3Q2019, growing 62% YoY to RMB976 million. The increase in customer usage for the mobile video sector and a growth in revenue from the enterprise cloud segment were responsible for the high YoY revenue growth. However, it needs to be highlighted that the YoY top-line growth rate in 3Q2019 was slower than YoY revenue growth rates of +96% and +68% for 2Q2019 and 3Q2018 respectively.Going forward, Kingsoft expects the strong revenue growth momentum for the cloud business to be sustained in FY2020, with the video, finance and government cloud verticals expected to be the key growth drivers.In my initiation article published in September 2019, which I referred to in the ""Elevator Pitch"" section of this article, I highlighted that a combination of existing games approaching the mature stage of their life-cycles and technical issues with the initial launch of JX Online III mobile game (beta testing version) resulted in a -2% YoY and -5% QoQ decline in games segment revenue to RMB569.8 million for 2Q2019.The performance of Kingsoft's games business continued to be uninspiring in 3Q2019. Revenue for the games business decreased 2% YoY to RMB663 million. Daily Average Peak Concurrent Users, or DAPCU, dropped -22% YoY and -16% QoQ to 571,992 for 3Q2019, while Monthly Average Paying Accounts, or APA, decreased -41% YoY and -20% QoQ to 2,021,129 in the same quarter. On the flip side, Kingsoft's games business 3Q2019 revenue of RMB663 million represented a +16% QoQ growth, which was driven by a full quarter's contribution from JX Online III mobile game (launched in 2Q2019) and increased revenue from JX Online III PC game.Kingsoft is still in the process of optimizing the JX Online III mobile game and expects that the official commercial launch for the JX Online III mobile game to happen in two to three months' time in 1Q2020. A minor update for the JX Online III mobile game was done in October 2019, and a major update (to address technical issues) for the game will be completed in time for its official commercial launch.Looking ahead, Kingsoft has a ""3+3"" pipeline for its games business in FY2020, which includes three games ready for launch, and another three innovative games in new gaming categories. The three games ready for launch in FY2020 include JX Online II mobile game (note that this is not a typo, JX Online II mobile game is launched after JX Online III mobile game), Moyu 3D mobile game and Wolongyin PC game, which have already obtained their licenses and are very advanced in terms of development progress. The other three innovative games in new gaming categories are possible candidates for launch in FY2020.Kingsoft trades at 47.8 times consensus forward FY2020 P/E and 28.8 times consensus forward FY2021 P/E based on its share price of HK$17.60 as of December 4, 2019. My sum-of-the-parts valuation implies a 25% upside.I arrive at a target price of HK$22.00 for Kingsoft by using a sum-of-the-parts valuation methodology. My valuation assumptions include a 5 times earnings multiple (reduced from 10 times in my initiation article to account for the weak performance of the segment) for the games business, a price-to-sales multiple of 3 times for the cloud services business, and valuing Kingsoft's stakes in the listed office software business Beijing Kingsoft Office Software (a 20% discount is assigned to the valuation of Beijing Kingsoft Office Software, as the STAR market is a new Nasdaq-style stock exchange only recently launched in July 2019, so it is more conservative to take a haircut) and associate company Cheetah Mobile (CMCM) at market value, a 30% holding company discount.Kingsoft offers consensus forward FY2020 and FY2021 dividend yields of 0.2% and 0.3% respectively.The key risk factors for Kingsoft are a delay in new game approvals, worse-than-expected response to new games, a slowdown in the growth of monthly active users for the office software business, a longer-than-expected time for the cloud business to be profitable (at the operating profit level) and a delay in the spin-off of its cloud business."
4094366,58641,2017-08-03T13:32:18-04:00,"I am writing this on Writer, the word processor software of the free WPS Office 2016 productivity suite from Kingsoft Software. It looks and acts like Word 2013 from Microsoft.WPS Office, not Google’s G Suite, is now the biggest threat to Microsoft’s Office and Office 365 suite. A spin-off of WPS Office subsidiary is a brilliant move.Kingsoft will probably give WPS Office the Cheetah Mobile treatment. King will likely sell some shares to raise funds, but it will hold on to a controlling stake.Chinese investors will likely snap up WPS Office shares. WPS Office touts more than 1.25 billion installs worldwide.After WPS Office is spun out, Kingsoft can concentrate on its core video games and cloud services.","I will do some profit taking on Apple (AAPL) this week to finance going long on Kingsoft Software (OTCPK:KSFTF) (HKG:3888). I argued before that Kingsoft’s freemium WPS Office 2016 is a threat to Microsoft’s (MSFT) Office productivity suite. I know Kingsoft generates most of its revenue/profit from its subsidiary, Cheetah Mobile (CMCM). However, the popularity of its WPS Office is why Kingsoft is famous around the world. The free and premium WPS Office desktop and mobile productivity suite versions tout 1.25 billion installs.The business unit responsible for WPS Office is the smallest but second-fastest growing revenue contributor to Kingsoft software over the last four years, 742% growth in revenue from 2012 to 2016.(Source: Kingsoft) Figures above are in Renminbi. 1 RMB = $0.15The global success of WPS Office has inspired Kingsoft to apply a separate stock market listing for it at Chinext Shenzhen Stock Exchange. Once approved, the WPS Office subsidiary can concentrate more on improving the paid ($29.99/year Premium version, $79.99/year for a lifetime license) versions of WPS Office.(Source: Kingsoft Software)Going forward, I believe Kingsoft will treat this WPS Office spin-out listing at Chinext like it did when Cheetah Mobile got publicly listed in the U.S. Like Cheetah, Kingsoft can raise funds by selling shares of WPS Office division, but it will retain a controlling stake. The Cheetah Mobile IPO in 2014 raised $168 million, representing sales of 12 million American depositary shares at $14 each.Before it did its IPO, Cheetah Mobile’s Q1 2014 revenue was $50.8 million. The WPS Office subsidiary of Kingsoft had Q1 2017 revenue of RMB 127.8 million or $19.17 million (up 58% Y/Y). WPS Office listing at Chinext could probably raise at least $70 million for Kingsoft. The $70 million relative guesstimate is based on Cheetah's quarterly revenue and IPO cash raised. $19.17 is almost 40% of $50.8, $70 million is almost 40% of $168 million.Retail and institutional investors who play the Chinese stock market know that WPS Office is 90% similar to Microsoft’s Office 2013. The User Interface and features of WPS Office’s word processor, spreadsheets, and presentation software programs are very similar to Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint.I can customize the ribbon menu of Kingsoft’s free Writer word processor to actually look like Word 2013. This unrestricted ability of Kingsoft to copy the User Interface [UI] and User Experience [UX] of Microsoft Office programs is why I am bullish on its stock. Kingsoft’s WPS Office enjoys this unique advantage against other rivals of Microsoft’s Office productivity suite.I opine that Microsoft would have sued Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) if it tried to copy Office 365 or Office 2016’s User Interface design. Microsoft will also not hesitate if Corel Office or Corel WordPerfect starts copying the User Interface look of Microsoft Office. WPS Office’s future market valuation resides in its invidious advantage that it can copy the user interface/experience of Microsoft Office without fear of reprisals.Small and large business users of Microsoft Office will have an easy time migrating to the cheaper business editions of WPS Office. There is almost-zero learning curve when they defect to WPS Office 2016 from Microsoft Office 2013/2016/Office 365.Kingsoft’s co-founder and chairman is Lei Jun. He is also the founder and CEO of Xiaomi. Xiaomi started its Android smartphone/tablet business by copying the physical aesthetics and User Interface designs of Apple’s iPhone. American firms like Apple and Microsoft are not strict against Chinese companies which copy the UI/UX designs of their products.Lei Jun’s estimated net worth is estimated to be $6.8 billion, this is partly (or largely?) thanks to his brilliant decision to imitate the UI/UX designs of American products.As far as I know, no Chinese judicial court has declared copying other software’s UI design as something illegal. As far as I know, patents and trademark rights protect only proprietary software code. WPS Office’s code is original. Kingsoft released version 1.0 of WPS Office in 1989.Kingsoft started imitating the UI/UX design of Microsoft Office more than 10 years ago when it first released the international English version of WPS Office. Until now, Microsoft never made any complaints regarding Kingsoft’s WPS Office suite.The Chinext listing will probably happen next year. Nevertheless, Kingsoft could use the funds raised from the said listing to develop more features for the paid versions of its WPS Office Suite. It needs to have better cloud storage, collaboration, and security/privacy features. These are the features that WPS Office must have to compete better against Microsoft Office and Google’s G Suite.If these features are implemented, Kingsoft could attract half-million subscribers to its $44.99/year business edition of WPS Office.$44.99 x 500k = $22.49 million of possible new revenue.My half-million guesstimate is actually very conservative. Google has 3 million business customers of its G Suite. I opine that WPS Office is much better than G Suite. G Suite doesn't look like Microsoft Office. It's the bane of G Suite that it cannot imitate the UI/UX of Microsoft Office. There are 1.2 billion people using Microsoft Office because it became the de facto standard.If we guesstimate that WPS Office Business Edition also gets 3 million paying business clients, the potential annual revenue would be $134.97 million. That is just from business users. We also have to take into account the $24.99/year home edition. I could see Kingsoft eventually attracting 8 million home users to pay $24.99. Home users could contribute another $199 million/year to WPS Office.I am discussing annual subscriptions because if I am Lei Jun, I will get rid of that $79 lifetime license option for WPS Office Professional versions. The best way to monetize commercial software is to rent them, not sell them for a one-time license.WPS Office mobile and desktop versions already tout the same feel and look of Microsoft Office/Office 365. Kingsoft only needs to offer the same cloud collaboration/communication features of Office 365 for Business. The $12.95 per user/month Office 365 For Business package from Microsoft includes free Skype for Business, Microsoft Teams, Yammer, OneDrive, and SharePoint.Kingsoft needs to build a team voice/chat/email/collaboration software to make WPS Office more palatable to schools and business users. The current Achilles Heel of WPS Office is it still lacks important online communication and collaboration components.Aside from the notably lower price of WPS Office Professional, it is a lightweight alternative to the bloated Microsoft Office 2013/2016 suite. WPS Office comes with an install file size of 70.6 MB. The 64-bit Microsoft Office 2013 ProPlus which I use now have a 702 MB download file size. Add the 32-bit version and you have a 1.4 GB install size. The Chinese programmers of WPS Office definitely care about software optimization.If they can create a lightweight version of Microsoft Office, Kingsoft’s employees could also create optimized software copycat versions of Skype for Business, OneDrive, Microsoft Teams, and Sharepoint.The future growth prospect of WPS Office will greatly depend on how fast/good it can imitate the cloud-based or online features of Microsoft Office/Office 365. Imitating the UI/UX design of Microsoft Office is only efficient in attracting people to install and use it. WPS office already has 1.25 billion installs.The next logical step is for Kingsoft to start making features that could attract paying home/business customers for WPS Office. The current $44.99/year Professional Business Edition of WPS Office allows online collaboration/sharing of documents. It also offers document encryption and free templates. However, those features are not yet enough to land nine-figure numbers of long-term paid subscriptions from business customers.Kingsoft Software’s annual revenue from Cheetah Mobile grew faster, 251.51% growth since 2014, after it was spun out. My fearless forecast is that it could also happen to WPS Office. An independent WPS Office unit could laser-focus on attracting customers away from Microsoft Office and Google G Suite. A 250% three-year growth for WPS Office Revenue is a grand slam future scenario.The money raised from listing at Chinext Shenzhen Stock Market could fund research and development to create online collaboration/communication features for WPS Office.Any extra money left from the said listing can be used by Kingsoft to improve its growing PC and mobile games division. The extra money could also be used to help finance its ambition to compete with Alibaba (BABA) Cloud. My attraction to Kingsoft as a long-term investment is also partly because of its proven success as an online games operator. The PC and mobile online games of Kingsoft generated 2,545,641,000 Renminbi ($378.60 million) last year, up 85.97% Y/Y.Unlike the declining pay-to-play World of Warcraft PC MMORPG title of Activision Blizzard (ATVI), Kingsoft’s Chinese freemium PC MMORPG game JX Online III is still growing. JX Online III’s FY 2016 revenue was RMB 1,392.8 million ($207.94 million), 56% higher than FY 2015. JX Online III posted a Q1 2017 revenue of RMB 458.2 million ($68.16 million), up 38% Y/Y. If JX Online III can post average sales of at least $65 million for the remaining three quarters of 2017, JX Online III’s FY 2017 revenue will be $260 million, 25% Y/Y increase.China is the biggest market for video games, and Kingsoft has a strong IP in JX Online. Along with Tencent (OTCPK:TCEHY) and NetEase (NTES), Kingsoft is going to be among the biggest beneficiaries of the growing gaming industry in China.China’s video games industry is estimated to generate $27.5 billion in revenue this year. I am an avid investor on video games-related companies. I am long in ATVI, TCEHY, and NTES. I also previously went long King Digital (KING) and SoftBank (OTCPK:SFTBY) when they were still independent mobile games publishers.(Source: Newzoo)Kingsoft has released the Chinese mobile version of JX Online. Kingsoft is wisely leveraging and transitioning its biggest PC game to the mobile platform. The PC-to-mobile transition is congruent to the rise of mobile games over PC games revenue in China this year.Tencent, the world’s biggest video games company, has licensed the JX Online IP from Kingsoft. Kingsoft has long-term benefits from licensing its IP to Tencent. The mobile games initiative of Kingsoft is also boosted by partnerships with mobile developers, 70yx.com and NetDragon Websoft. By expanding its JX Online PC games (JX Online I, JX Online II, and JX Online III) to the mobile platform, Kingsoft could further boost its online games business.My five-year projection for the online games segment of Kingsoft is presented below. I used a lower than 25% CAGR.2017 = $473 million2018 = $591 million2019 = $738 million2020 = $902 million2021 = $1.1 billionAs for Kingsoft’s biggest business segment, Cheetah Mobile, I’m pretty satisfied with its consistent annual revenue growth. The American depositary shares of CMCM have declined well below its $32++ price levels in 2015.(Source: YCharts)However, a check on Morningstar’s five-year quarterly report revealed that Cheetah Mobile is back to black. The Q4 2016 and Q1 2017 of CMCM have positive net income numbers. Consistent revenue growth plus a decent net income is satisfactory to me.Figures are in Chinese Yuan Million.(Source: Morningstar)I opine that WPS Office’s chance of long-term success is better if it is released as a separate, publicly listed company. A WPS Office Suite with Microsoft Office-like online collaboration and communication features could eventually propel Kingsoft as one of the world’s top companies involved in productivity/collaboration Software-as-a-Service [SaaS].Like Office 2016/Office 365 propelled Microsoft to the top of the $13 billion per quarter enterprise SaaS industry, WPS Office could also propel Kingsoft to the top of China’s SaaS industry. Kingsoft is in a great position to take advantage of the heavy restrictions on foreign-made software inside China. Once more Chinese businesses/citizens stop using pirated versions of Microsoft Office 2016/Office 365, Kingsoft’s WPS Office will find more success in its domestic turf.The only obvious headwind I could see is that some American and European firms may not fully trust the Chinese-made WPS Office. However, unlike Huawei, no country has banned Kingsoft’s products.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

4290579,39591,2019-09-09T15:12:58-04:00,"Kingsoft's core games business is expected to deliver negative full-year FY2019 revenue growth as its newly-launched JX Online III mobile game met with technical issues, which affected its performance.The cloud services business almost doubled its revenue for 2Q2019, and future prospects look promising with Xiaomi's backing and cloud computing's low penetration rate in the Chinese enterprise service market.Kingsoft plans to spin off its office software business on the new Science and Technology Innovation Board, or STAR market, which could help to unlock value of this fast-growing business segment.Kingsoft recorded an impairment loss of RMB1.3 billion for its associate company Cheetah Mobile in 1H2019.My sum-of-the-parts valuation suggests limited upside for Kingsoft valuing the games and office software businesses at 10 times and 30 times P/E, and the cloud business at 3 times price-to-sales.","I like Hong Kong-listed Kingsoft Corporation Limited (OTCPK:KSFTF) [3888:HK] for its fast-growing cloud services and office software businesses, and the company's plans to spin off its office software business to unlock value.On the other hand, I am concerned about Kingsoft's weak games business affected by technical issues with the launch of the JX Online III mobile game, and the longer period of time expected for its loss-making cloud services business to achieve profitability with the business segment focused on market share gain over profitability in the near-term. Further impairment losses on its listed associate cannot be ruled out as well.My sum-of-the-parts valuation of HK$17.92, based on P/E multiples of 10 and 30 times for the games business and office software business, respectively, and a price-to-sales multiple of 3 times for the cloud services business, suggests a limited 4% upside to Kingsoft's share price of HK$17.16 as of September 6, 2019.Kingsoft Corporation is a leading Chinese software and internet services company, which has diversified beyond its core games/entertainment software business to cloud computing and office software. The company's customers are located globally in markets such as North America, Europe, Japan and Malaysia, while its offices and R&D centers are located in Beijing, Zhuhai, Chengdu, Dalian, Guangzhou and Hong Kong. Kingsoft's games/entertainment software, cloud services and office software businesses contributed 32%, 49% and 19% of the company's 1H2019 revenue respectively. Excluding the loss-making cloud services business, Kingsoft's games business and office software business accounted for 66% and 34% of its adjusted operating profit for 1H2019 respectively.Kingsoft's core games business registered an uninspiring -2% YoY and -5% QoQ decline in revenue to RMB569.8 million for 2Q2019. Daily Average Peak Concurrent Users decreased from 798,354 in 2Q2018 to 680,869 for 2Q2019; while the number of Monthly Average Paying Accounts also fell to 2,542,271 in 2Q2019 versus 3,272,023 in 2Q2018.The weak performance of the games business was due to a combination of existing games approaching the mature stage of their life-cycles and and a widely-anticipated and newly-launched mobile game falling short of expectations. The culprit was the debut of JX Online III mobile game, a swordsman-themed role playing game, on June 12, 2019 which met with technical issues which affected its performance.At the company's 2Q2019 earnings call on August 20, 2019, Kingsoft elaborated on the technical issues that adversely impacted the debut of its JX Online III mobile game:The JX Online III mobile game's initial first monthly gross billing was RMB150 million, representing 55% of the company's monthly gross billing expectations or target as mentioned above. The popularity of JX Online III is validated by the fact that the game was ranked first on the iOS downloads chart for games in China on its debut.Kingsoft has decided to re-launch an updated version of the JX Online III mobile game in end-October or early November this year. Another new game, which was planned to be launched this year, the JX Online II mobile game will have its launch delayed to earliest March 2020, as a result of the need to optimize and update the JX Online III mobile game. As a result, the company is guiding for a -10% decline in revenue for the games/entertainment software business for full-year FY2019, as both the JX Online III and JX Online II mobile games are now expected to have a more significant revenue contribution starting FY2020.Other games in the pipeline include Final Fantasy Brave Exvius and Double Life World to be launched in Mainland China and Japan respectively in the second half of 2019. Kingsoft is the distributor of Japanese gaming company Square Enix's (OTCPK:SQNXF) (OTCPK:SQNNY) Final Fantasy Brave Exvius in Mainland China; while Double Life World is a shooter game with a female protagonist.In the near-term, the financial results of Kingsoft's games business will be dependent on the performance of its new games.Kingsoft's loss-making cloud services business saw revenue grow 96% YoY and 9% QoQ to RMB918.2 million for 2Q2019, driven by increased customer usage of cloud services for mobile video and enterprise cloud. The cloud services business generated an operating loss of RMB463.4 million for 1H2019. On the back on the segment's strong revenue growth, Kingsoft is guiding for the cloud services business to deliver a 70% YoY revenue growth and improved profitability for full-year FY2019. Kingsoft is one of the leading cloud services provider in China. International Data Corporation named Kingsoft as one of the top ten public cloud IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) service providers globally in 2018. Kingsoft has also been among the three largest Chinese Internet cloud vendors between 2016 and 2018 alongside Alibaba (BABA) Cloud and Tencent Cloud.Kingsoft emphasized at its 2Q2019 results briefing on August 20, 2019 that competition in the cloud services market is not likely to affect the segment's revenue growth and profitability improvement:Kingsoft's competitive edge lies with the backing of internet company and smartphone manufacturer Xiaomi Corporation (OTCPK:OTCPK:XIACY) (OTCPK:OTCPK:XIACF) [1810:HK]. I wrote about Xiaomi Corporation in an article last week. According to Kingsoft's FY2018 annual report, Xiaomi's founder and CEO Mr Lei Jun, who is also the co-founder and Chairman of Kingsoft, has a 25.70% deemed interest in Kingsoft.Xiaomi's Internet of Things or IoT business has 196 million connected devices (excluding smartphones and laptops) and 49.9 million Monthly Active Users for its Artificial Intelligence or AI Assistant as of end-June 2019. Leveraging on Xiaomi, Kingsoft's cloud services business has developed Artificial Intelligence of Things or AIoT applications for multiple industries. Recently, Kingsoft is working with Xiaomi Finance, Nanjing Yang Zi State-owned Investment Group, and Nanjing Digital Finance Industry Research Institute to run China's first digital financial integrated service platform in Jiangbei New District together. Apart from Kingsoft management's comments above, the growth potential of the cloud services market is validated by the low industry penetration rate. It is estimated that the penetration rate of cloud computing in the enterprise service market in China is under 10%. Kingsoft's office software suite of products is branded as ""WPS"" and positioned as an alternative to Microsoft (OTCPK:MFST) Office. The WPS office software business generated revenue of RMB386.0 million for 2Q2019, representing a 31% YoY increase and a 34% QoQ growth. This was attributable to increased sales of its enterprise version of office software and more users paying for value-added services associated with the personal version of its office software.Monthly Average Users or MAUs of WPS office software grew 24% YoY from 280 million in 2Q2018 to 348 million in 2Q2019, of which approximately 23% of MAUs were from international markets outside China. The split between desktop and mobile MAUs is about 47:53.Kingsoft is guiding for the WPS office software business to achieve 35-40% revenue growth and operating margin in excess of 20% for full-year FY2019.Kingsoft also has plans to spin-off its office software business on the new Science and Technology Innovation Board, or STAR market as per the company's announcement on May 30, 2019. The STAR market is a Nasdaq-style China stock exchange focused on technology companies which was launched on July 22, 2019.Kingsoft has a 47% interest in associate company Cheetah Mobile (CMCM), a developer of mobile applications such as utility apps Clean Master and Cheetah Keyboard and casual games like Piano Tiles 2, which is listed on the New York Stock Exchange in the form of American depository shares. The company recognized an impairment loss of RMB1.3 billion for Cheetah Mobile in 1H2019. Cheetah Mobile's share price was down approximately 40% in the first six months of 2019.Cheetah Mobile has no impact on Kingsoft's cash flows and operating earnings, as it is recognized as an associate. Furthermore, Cheetah Mobile contributes to less than 10% of my sum-of-the-parts valuation for Kingsoft presented in the next section of the article.I arrive at a target price of HK$17.92 for Kingsoft by using a sum-of-the-parts valuation methodology. My valuation assumptions include P/E multiples of 10 and 30 times for the games business and office software business respectively; a price-to-sales multiple of 3 times for the cloud services business; and valuing Kingsoft's stake in associate company Cheetah Mobile at market value.My sum-of-the-parts valuation suggests a limited 4% upside to Kingsoft's share price of HK$17.16 as of September 6, 2019.The key risk factors for Kingsoft Corporation are a worse-than-expected performance of its new games, a delay in approval of new games by regulators, a slowdown in the revenue growth of its cloud services business due to competition, a widening of losses for its cloud services business and a delay in the listing of its office software business.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

4298298,105480,2019-10-23T15:45:00-04:00,"We rate a buy for Kingsoft with a target price of HKD 33.50, representing an upside of more than 80%.Kingsoft has long-standing partnerships with some of the world's largest electronic devices manufacturers like Xiaomi, which could contribute to the company's growth.We anticipate the company is well-positioned to take advantage of its cloud-related total addressable market in the enterprise and government markets in China.","In our first article, we will focus on the cloud services segment of Kingsoft (OTCPK:KSFTF). The company is currently up approximately 68% YTD and is trading at a price of HKD 18.16. In our view, the stock price currently seems undervalued as we believe that the local stock market participants are concerned regarding the decline of both operating and gross margins over the last couple of years. Margin's contraction was driven by increased cloud services related to operational costs. However, we anticipate that as the company increases its scale it can drive its cloud services margins to about software-related levels. Our analysis suggests that Kingosft's strong business performance will continue to be driven by an increasing number of cloud consumers in its mobile game and video vertical. Furthermore, we anticipate a strong penetration rate of conventional businesses and government markets. We recommend investors to buy this company with a price target of HKD 33.50 for Kingsoft.(Source: Statista)According to the figure above, the cloud computing market in China was RMB 41.3 billion in 2018 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 38.99 % to reach RMB 110.9 billion by 2023. Based on data from the most recent report by market research firm IDC, Infrastructure as a Service or ""IaaS"" public cloud market was roughly $32.85 billion in 2018. In fact, that makes up approximately 80% share of the total cloud computing market in China. In addition, Julia Zhuge, a research manager of IDC China, believes that the growth rate of the cloud computing market in China is going to outpace its global peers. In general, analysts anticipate that the particular gap will be driven by improved Internet coverage in the country and supportive policies from government authorities that are looking for a digital-led economy with top-edge technological solutions and services. Another important factor is increased IT-related investments as well as higher research and development expenditures for the domestic companies, which are looking to update their slightly outdated in-house produced software and hardware solutions.In addition, we see a 5G network expansion as the biggest opportunity for the growth of the cloud computing market, which will lead to new cloud computing-related AI+IoT technologies combined with wider Internet network expansion into lower-tier cities and villages. Kingsoft is well-positioned to capitalize on this 5G network expansion trend as it's a major player when it comes down to the IoT market.(Source: McKinsey)According to the figure above, in 2017, roughly 55% of enterprises in China still prefer to use private cloud compared to public cloud while that ratio is less than 20% in the U.S. Given that, transition to the public cloud is not an easy one-way process. Plenty of domestic companies especially in the small-to-midsized field have to first invest significant resources for the development of their outdated software and hardware.(Source: McKinsey)In our opinion, they also are most likely not experienced enough or lack the required deep domain knowledge of the cloud computing industry, therefore they will most likely have to pay hefty fees for experienced professionals in the field. In the U.S. most of the public cloud providers do a great job to offer additional cybersecurity-related services, while in China most of the companies have to secure public cloud by themselves. China is well known to have a very sophisticated network of so-called ""blackhat"" hackers, therefore companies have a very difficult task to secure their most important data. We believe that a particular issue becomes even greater for small-to-mid-sized companies that do not have enough capital or experts in-house to allocate for cybersecurity-related issues.(Source: China Internet Watch)In terms of market positioning, if we take a look at the figure above Kingsoft has an approximately 4.5% market share in the Chinese public cloud market. For a company with a market cap of only $3.2 billion that's an excellent result and has fallen behind large-cap competitors like Tencent Cloud (OTCPK:TCEHY), Amazon Web Services (AMZN) and China Telecom (CHA). Kingsoft has been successful so far by penetrating the enterprise service market with its video services and finance-related cloud offerings. As a result of a long-term partnership with Xiaomi (OTCPK:XIACY), the company is well-positioned to take advantage of the fourth industrial revolution with AIoT cloud-related offerings developed by both companies. In terms of market penetration rate, management stated that the current cloud computing in the enterprise service market is less than 10%.In addition, during the most recent earnings, management provided more details about the current market dynamics in the cloud computing market. Furthermore, management anticipates increased competition in different cloud-related areas over the next couple of years.(Source: Earnings Call)Kingsoft Cloud was established back in 2012 and it provides cloud services primarily focused on video-related solutions such as mobile live streaming, short video, and video on demand and download. Consequently, the company has developed strong business relationships with major gaming or live streaming companies in China as well as other Internet companies. The company offers products in all of the major cloud-related segments including cloud computing, storage, and CDN, networking and database related services.Kingsoft management presented the benefits and strong value proposition of its cloud-related offerings as the following:(Source: Kingsoft Cloud)Given that the company is involved in the high growth video cloud-related business it also has established a strong relationship with phone maker Xiaomi. As a result of this partnership, Xiaomi was capable of developing an ""iCloud"" equivalent service named as Xiaomi Cloud. In general, the growing number of mobile users consume more video-related content or upload a higher number of photos or videos to their cloud storage year after year. Therefore we anticipate that Kingsoft can take advantage of Xiaomi's domestic and overseas expansion strategy in the smartphone segment. During the most recent earnings release, Xiaomi pointed out on solid sales growth in the Smartphone segment.(Source: Xiaomi Press Release)Apart from cloud-related services in the electronic devices segment, both companies also are developing innovative solutions in the high-tech Artificial intelligence + IoT related cloud services. IoT devices generate a vast amount of data, which might be useless without sufficient storage capacity or appropriate analytics related tools. Therefore if we combine artificial intelligence and data from IoT devices on the cloud, we can further develop autopilot cars, smart cities, monitoring systems or virtual assistants. For instance, Xiaomi recently released its Xiaomi AI artificial intelligence virtual voice assistant which is an equivalent of Amazon's Alexa. Kingsoft cloud plays a very important part as it provides support with a high-speed data transmission network and GPU resources. When users ask its Xiaomi AI virtual assistant to do something, Kingsoft cloud supports the processing and transfer of information between the device and public cloud to make it as quick as possible. Xiaomi management sees a very strong potential as it plans to expand Xiaomi AI overseas and Kingsoft has developed a very strong cloud-related network globally.Given that the Xiaomi partnership contributes to a high share of cloud services revenue, Kingsoft management has prioritized over the past to penetrate other business verticals like government agencies and conventional businesses as well. However, things are a bit more complicated in those verticals as particular customers don't have a strong technical team like tech giants to make this transition to the cloud a very easy and smooth process.Kingsoft Cloud CEO Wang Yulin stated:(Source: Yicai Global)We anticipate that the company is well-positioned to successfully penetrate the domestic government agencies market given that it's the largest independent cloud provider in the country. Furthermore, the Chinese government is more likely to sign new deals with major domestic providers like Alibaba (BABA) or Kingsoft over the western counterparts including Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure (MSFT). When it comes down to the commercial success of the government vertical, we believe that Kingsoft already has established strong relationships and network with government agencies through its WPS Office solutions. For instance, Kingsoft can implement a go-to-market strategy and offer WPS Office on the cloud to the existing customer base. Afterwards, if customers are satisfied with the WPS Office + Cloud product than they can maybe decide for any other cloud-related products or solutions.During the most recent earnings call the company reported very important deals including government-related smart city projects.(Source: Earnings Call)We find it as one of the key bullish catalysts that Kingsoft can target government agencies in lower-tier cities, which plan to turn into a smart city in the near future. Smart cities will create new business opportunities for cloud-related companies like Kingsoft by using top-edge cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and machine learning tools to efficiently analyze the vast amount of newly generated data. Given that the urbanization rate in China is expected to reach 70% by 2035, smart cities will enable local government authorities to do a better job of managing the increasing number of people in the metropolitan areas.(Source: Silenda's Investment)Kingsoft has three primary business models, namely: (1) Online games, (2) cloud services, and (3) office software and services and others.(Source: Silenda's Investment)We take on a more conservative stance as compared to street consensus. We believe that the company revenue will hit RMB 10.19B by 2020. Cloud revenue increased by 96% YoY in Q2 2019, driven by robust demand from mobile video and internet companies as well as an increased number of enterprise customers in government and other industries. Nevertheless, the company has been increasing its costs and expenses over recent years, primarily driven by the rapidly-growing cloud services segment. For instance, as the increasing number of users use cloud services, the company faces higher bandwidth and IDC-related costs. Therefore, the gross profit margin has plummeted from 58.1% in 2017 to 46.3% in 2018. There's currently no clear visibility on when the gross profit margin contraction will reverse and normalize. The total operating profit margin fell significantly from 15.71% in 2017 to -5.12% in 2018.In fact, both gross and operating margin deteriorated even further in 2Q19. We believe this was driven by a higher contribution of the cloud services revenue growth. The particular business is labeled by lower gross and operating margins compared to the online games segment, however with a higher revenue growth potential with a CAGR in the range of 50% - 60% over the next couple of years. Consequently, we anticipate that a higher proportion of cloud services revenues will lead to improved overall gross and operating margins over the long run. In fact, they are at the moment at the lowest levels as compared to historical performance. We anticipate that both operating and gross margin to turn positive in 2020 and onwards.Below is a projection of the company's performance into 2021.Major Chinese growth companies are currently trading around a 4x price to sales ratio. However, Kingsoft is only trading at 3.1x price to sales. We don't think Kingsoft deserves to trade at more than 50% lower price to sales ratio than large-cap Chinese growth companies such as Tencent or Ping An Healthcare and Technology (HK:1833). Management also provided guidance for FY 2019 of total and cloud revenues of roughly 40% and 70% YoY, respectively. We think that Kingsoft should at least trade at about 3.5x price to sales. Using Kingsoft 2021e revenue with a 3.5x price-to-sales ratio, the company should be worth about HKD 33.50 per share what makes up more than 80% upside potential. We anticipate that the increase of the stock price will be driven by the high-growth cloud business as the company will be able to take advantage of its economies of scale once it increases its customer base. Furthermore, it's well-positioned to penetrate domestic government agencies and conventional enterprise markets with its public and hybrid cloud offerings. As such, we recommend investors to start accumulating Kingsoft given that it's extremely cheap now compared to its historical levels.(Source: Finance Yahoo)On the other hand, the stock price has achieved an excellent performance so far in 2019, even though the whole market for Chinese growth companies has been under pressure due to the ongoing U.S. - China trade war. Therefore we believe that in the case of a more serious technical correction of the major HSI Index, the stock price might become under pressure over the short run. Another important short-term challenge over our valuation might be weaker than expected earnings or cloud revenues results in Q3 19, which would stimulate some investors to take their profits by the end of 2019. On the operational side, in the case that some of the risks-related factors mentioned in our next section realize in the near future, that would most likely limit our upside potential.Overall, given the current strong growth rate and total addressable market of the cloud services industry in China, we believe that Kingsoft's strategy and attempt to diversify away business model from online games business into cloud services will enable the company to maintain a leadership position in the domestic market. Consequently, it will position the company to create strong value for its shareholders in the foreseeable future as well. We reiterate our recommendation to buy Kingsoft with a target price of HKD 33.50 per share."
